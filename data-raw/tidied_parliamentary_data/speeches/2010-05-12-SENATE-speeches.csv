"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-05-12,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. The bill introduces a number of measures, the majority of which are supported by the coalition. But one measure in particular is not: that part of the bill which seeks to implement the government’s promised superannuation clearing house and does so by clearly breaching a key aspect of the government’s election promise in this regard. That is right: yet another broken promise by a government that is hard pressed to point to any election promises that it has actually delivered in full and as promised. Sure, it said it would put computers in schools and some schools actually have some; but not one for every secondary student as was originally promised—not even access to one by every student as the promise was later changed to. Of course, the government has mismanaged the roll out. The cost of providing computers that students can actually use with software and support has blown out exponentially. Then there are the childcare centres to stop the double drop-off and the GP super clinics, on both of which there has been little action at greatly inflated and blown out cost. None of them will be delivered in the numbers and locations promised. In respect of the GP super clinics, during the MPI yesterday on the government’s failure to deliver on its promises Senator Bilyk gave the big tick to the GP super clinic in Rosny in my home state of Tasmania. I tell you that delivery of that promise constitutes a big hole dug in the ground many months ago and no action since. If, in Labor’s view, that deserves a big tick it says a lot about how they see their obligation to deliver on their promises. Then there is the promise not to change the private health insurance rebate, the promise to introduce an ETS, the promise to take Japan to the International Court of Justice over whaling, and Mr Rudd’s promise not to live in Kirribilli house. The list goes on and is long—broken promise after broken promise. Media outlets have taken to compiling their own lists of broken promises and publishing them. It is almost a sport except for the fact that the target is such an easy one to hit.
This promise of the government is no different. Before the last election the government promised that it would introduce this measure and that it would do so by contracting it out to a private clearing house—that is right, to a private operator to deliver. This was not just some slip of the tongue. It was a clear and concise, written, key part of the overall promise. Yet today we are debating a bill that sees the government trying to give the responsibility to Medicare Australia without implementing any public tender or other process to ensure that Australians will get the best value for money or even that the outcomes of the measure will meet an appropriate standard. And all in the face of a clear promise to the Australian people—another promise this Rudd Labor government has broken. The fact is that the coalition is broadly supportive of the government’s overall aims as set out in this promise. The government’s intentions might even be pure but as so often happens with this government it is in the design and delivery of its program that it has again cocked things up.
The government has rightly recognised that red tape is a concern for small business and we on this side of the chamber will always support well thought out and balanced government measures to make things easier for small business to comply with regulatory burdens. This measure certainly had the potential to do that but, for some inexplicable reason, the government has chosen blatantly to break its promise to the Australian people and is introducing this measure in a way that almost certainly will not deliver the best results or even deliver it at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer. The government has completely failed to explain why it broke its promise to tender the service to the private sector. Neither the government nor Medicare has publicly made a business case for establishing the clearing house in this way. Many operators in the superannuation sector have expressed concerns about the anticompetitive way it has been set up. I am particularly concerned about the anticompetitive nature of this measure and there are a number of other serious issues associated with giving Medicare the task of becoming the government-mandated superannuation clearing house. The support given by those in the industry is cautious at best but damning from most. The legislation requires further consideration and development prior to implementation.
The recommendation of the majority of the Standing Committee on Economics that the legislation be passed unamended is inappropriate and is indicative of the government’s refusal to properly consider feedback and criticism from industry about this and other legislation. The principal concern regarding this bill emanating from the superannuation sector and from clearing houses that are currently operating in the private sector is the anticompetitive nature of the legislation. Private sector superannuation clearing houses have been operating in this space for some time. The sector’s largest clearing house, SuperChoice, told the inquiry into this legislation that this year it will process around 20 million contributions on behalf of 50,000 employers—40,000 of whom are employers with fewer than 20 employees. They account for two-million-odd employees. Overall, it is projected about $7.2 billion will be cleared through the SuperChoice service and SuperChoice estimates that that has around 20 per cent of the entire clearing market.
If the government were to introduce its own clearing house operator and enforce preferential regulations on that operator when compared to currently operating clearing houses, as proposed, this would seriously impact upon the businesses of those privately operating clearing houses. Westpac’s QuickSuper would be forced to compete in a market distorted by the change and no longer uniform or equitable for public and private sector participants. This will have negative consequences for small businesses that choose to continue to use private sector clearing houses. As a result, the legislation should be amended to ensure clearing house standards are the same across both public and private sectors.
Whilst the intentions of the government may be to provide a superannuation clearing house to those employers who currently cannot access a free service, the legislation and regulations will allow absolutely any business with fewer than 20 employees access to the service. For instance, the 40,000 employees who use the SuperChoice clearing house will have overwhelming incentive to switch to the Medicare clearing house for a number of reasons. The government recently said that the way superannuation can be strengthened is to drive efficiencies, reduce administrative costs and thus increase returns. AFSA, the Australian Financial Services Association, submitted to the inquiry and recommended the following:
That the legislation be amended so as to provide a path forward whereby private sector organisations could achieve approved clearing house status. This would achieve a level playing field. The path forward could include the establishment of operating standards combined with regulatory oversight, as envisioned by the government’s original statement. Importantly, this would ensure clearing houses meet certain minimum requirements and provide a wider range of employers with the opportunity to meet their obligations by contributing through a clearing house.
Such a recommendation, if implemented, would encourage the use of clearing houses and provide each clearing house with competitive incentives to create efficiencies and implement best practice. Indeed, the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Hon. Chris Bowen, in his address to the Self-Managed Super Fund Professional Association of Australia in Melbourne on 18 February this year stated:
... an efficient clearing house system would be available to employers. Such a clearing house system could help drive reform of the superannuation system overall in such areas as how payments are made to funds, what sort of information is required by the fund and interfund transactions.
They are nice words, but they are not reflective of the reality of the clearing house model he has put forward in this bill. Amendments are needed to be made to the bill to protect competition, encourage innovation and improve the access and services available to all businesses.
The government has allocated $16.1 million to this project over four years. Why this amount? It was not based on any sort of public tender process. What guarantee does the government give of what can be delivered for the expenditure of taxpayer money in this way? Given this, what explanation can be made to taxpayers explaining why the Prime Minister failed to meet his election promise to implement the plan through a competitive tender process—a process that would have ensured the government could have delivered best practice clearing house functions at the best possible value?
The government has also failed to demonstrate why Medicare is the most efficient or effective option and whether it can provide services comparable to what the private sector can provide. There is also some doubt as to how far the government got down the path of tendering out of the clearing house before pulling the plug and moving to the in-house Medicare option. Treasury gave evidence in the Senate hearing to the effect that tender documents were not actually drafted. This seems contradictory to evidence given on notice by Treasury to Senate estimates in February 2010 where Treasury responded that no draft tender document suitable for public release was prepared, suggesting the draft tender documents may have been prepared but not released. There is also a suggestion that the government went first to Australia Post as its preferred clearing house provider but that this was rejected as unworkable. Given the evidence provided to the Senate inquiry, I think it should have kept on looking.
Medicare’s evidence to the inquiry hearing demonstrates that the agency has not completed a business plan to a level that would have been required as part of a competitive tender process, meaning that the government has not received any evidence from Medicare to a normal prudent standard that could satisfy the government of its ability to deliver for a reasonable price. Medicare made the following comments to the hearing:
We do not have any targets at this point in terms of the number of businesses which are going to use the system.
            …         …         …
We did not go and cost an alternative provider.
Medicare also commented, ‘We are considering options.’ That is, to accept employer payments. The Superannuation Information Centre submitted that the decision to send a clearing house to Medicare means that there is the serious potential for large-scale economic waste. Given the evidence presented, Medicare and Treasury have not been able to prove that Medicare can handle the scheme within the budget provided and without risk to employee superannuation payments and associated benefits like life insurance coverage. Many in the industry have legitimate concerns about Medicare’s ability to successfully and efficiently operate the scheme, particularly within the time lines provided. The evidence clearly supported the conclusion that Medicare operating the system would disadvantage the existing private industry.
The government must also be held accountable for breaking its promises. When asked about this broken promise in particular, what was the response of the Treasury officials? They stated that the need for the government to break its promise to the Australian people arose from a concern that a private clearing house might have a problem with fraud or solvency and that the consequences of this to Australians and their super is too large to contemplate or to accept. They said that we needed to eliminate that risk and that the only way to do this was through breaking the promise and taking the clearing house within government.
This statement by Treasury is ingenuous and, without wanting to cast any aspersions on the Treasury official involved, sounds more like a government’s spin line dreamt up by the hollow men in the minister’s office to explain a decision already made for less honourable reasons than a real reason justifying the blatant breaking of this election promise. It also demonstrates that the risks of private sector failure or fraud are not well understood by the government. This is in part because existing clearing house providers such as SuperChoice, Westpac and ADP are reputable, well capitalised and have extensive professional indemnity cover, thereby minimising the risk. They segregate duties by outsourcing payment distribution to banks which is a key fraud control.
The Investment and Financial Services Association told the Senate inquiry that private clearing houses are well regulated through prudential reporting requirements and that private clearing houses must hold an Australian financial services licence. IFSA told the inquiry that the risk involved with private clearing houses was very low and that the use of private clearing houses provides certainty. ASIC requires clearing houses to issue product disclosure statements which must detail the terms and conditions of the facility, any fees and charges, how the transactions are made and authorised, and any risks associated with the facility. Medicare, however, will be exempt from this regulation.
If the government is suggesting that companies with this level of regulation are risky, then the minister is suggesting that the current level of regulation is insufficient. And the officials’ protestations about risk and the need to look at likelihood of it occurring and the severity of outcome also do not hold water. The fact is that even if a private clearing house did see superannuation funds disappear through fraud or failure, as unlikely as that is, the consequences for individual taxpayers would at worst be one month’s or perhaps one quarter’s superannuation payments. It could in no way devastate their total super savings, as payments made for each and every other period would have been passed on to their superannuation fund long before the next payment would be sent to the clearing house.
The superannuation clearing house was promised by the government during the Prime Minister’s 2007 budget reply speech when he was opposition leader. The Labor Party in opposition argued that the Howard government’s superannuation choice policies, as introduced in 2005, increased compliance costs for small businesses, which in many cases were then required to make separate superannuation payments for each individual employee. This situation was a by-product of the success of superannuation choice. So many employees chose their own superannuation fund after the policy’s implementation—clearly a popular move by the then government, as proven by the high level of take-up by employees who took an informed look at their options.
Given the level of success, we supported the availability of a superannuation clearing house to small business to reduce compliance costs and could hardly argue against the then intention of the then opposition to implement such a policy through a privately tendered private operator. But, by not even testing the private market, the government decision to go straight to an in-house superannuation clearing house option—one which has the legislative backing to provide real and definitive advantages over private sector operators—can only be seen as a prime example of another blatant broken promise by this Rudd Labor government. The government did put out a consultation paper on its proposal, one that attracted a lot of submissions detailing the challenges of delivering the government’s desired outcomes and the advantages, both in cost and in terms of delivery, of doing this through a private operator.
When I asked at the inquiry if responses from the consultation paper into the clearing house were made available to Medicare for their consideration in terms of building and delivering the system, Ms Hughes from Medicare admitted:
We have not asked for any of those documents.
So here we have the agency tasked with delivering the government’s proposed clearing house option—something that has taken private operators more than 10 years and $50 million to develop, something that is hugely complex and fraught with challenges—and that agency had not even asked for or been provided with the submissions from the government’s own consultation on the measure. I guess this shows yet again the weight that this Rudd Labor government gives to the consultation it undertakes on measures it wants to introduce. We know that the government refused to listen to the experts on home insulation and now it is refusing to listen to the experts in superannuation and payment processing with regard to the clearing house. I ask the government: why do you bother to consult and why do you have so many reviews into superannuation and finance if you refuse to listen to the views of experts? It is all spin and no substance.
How Medicare can possibly understand the concerns of industry if they did not consider their submissions relevant is beyond me. The fact is that existing private clearing houses have systems in place to process transactions that reflect the systems and information requirements for the vast array of super funds that exist in this country and the even longer list of products they offer in this space. They know how much each transaction costs and they could implement the government’s policy in a relatively short time span and present a full business plan demonstrating the outcomes and the value for money. These businesses are being told that they have lost out to a government agency that has not finalised its plan, that has no apparent regard for industry concerns and that does not even know if there will be ‘issues with matching and some requirement for them to do follow-up work’, as was admitted by the general manager at the hearing. Why would the government award the contract to Medicare, which has no experience in superannuation? And this is after the government received overwhelming evidence that the private sector could easily handle the additional transactions at a fraction of the cost proposed.
The legislation provides that employers will be able to discharge their superannuation guarantee obligations by making a bulk payment to the approved clearing house on the 28th day of the month in each quarter when the payment is required. This is different to the current system, where employers need to have the payment arrive at the superannuation fund trustee by the 28th of the month when the payment is due, regardless of whether they use a clearing house or not. Not allowing private operators to be approved in accordance with this bill means they will not be able to compete in terms of timing, which is important to cash flow for many small businesses and will render private operators largely uncompetitive as a result.
 Private clearing houses currently operating will still be forced to process their payments by the 28th of the month in which the payments must be made, which requires employers to pay their bulk payments in advance of that date. On the other hand, employers will be able to pay the Medicare clearing house on the 28th, when the payment is required. Under these conditions, why would any employer not choose Medicare as its clearing house? As ASFA have argued, the government’s scheme ‘has the potential to deliver commercial damage to existing providers of clearing house services’. The industry is questioning whether this was a rushed Rudd government decision to give Medicare the contract so that it could announce that it was meeting its clearing house commitment before the next election. Peter Philip, CEO of SuperChoice, puts the issue plainly by saying:
… we certainly feel that what the Government is proposing will create distortions in the market …How could it not when they’re funding with public money a clearing house that will be a significantly advantaged competitor to existing clearing houses?
Private sector clearing houses have worked to meet the needs of the market. They have been operating efficiently without issue. The bill as drafted will damage this market.
This entire clearing house exercise has been another example of waste and mismanagement. The government is showing a reckless disregard for the companies backing Australia’s retirement system. As mentioned, $16.1 million has been allocated to the clearing house over four years and we still do not know if Medicare is able to deliver an effective scheme within the allocated budget. Private sector clearing house operators have delivered efficient and low-risk services to employers for many years. The legislation as drafted will give Medicare a significant competitive advantage over private sector operators, who have found a need in the superannuation market and developed innovative technologies to fulfil that need. It will put the premium services they offer at a reasonable price at risk and potentially replace them with substandard services at a bureaucratically inflated, heavy Rudd Labor Party cost. I have support for some elements of this bill but have major reservations with regard to the impact of the proposed government funded clearing house. It has been a retrograde step by this government to depart from its promise to have a service that is provided on a contestable basis. I will support the amendments that we will be putting forward.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-05-12,"—It is tough enough to run a small business without having to wade through all the paperwork and red tape. As someone who used to work in the superannuation industry and knows this field quite well, I am aware of the headache it causes small businesses when they have to pay contributions into numerous superannuation funds. It is an administrative burden that small businesses do not have the time for, and most of them do the right thing by their workers. That is why the decision by the Rudd government to set up a free superannuation clearing house for those businesses with fewer than 20 employees is a good thing. Having a clearing house available for small businesses is an important measure, because it will allow them to fulfil their obligations in respect of paying superannuation contributions through just a single payment each time instead of multiple transactions.
As a nation, we need to do more to help small businesses flourish in Australia, because they are the lifeblood of our economy and the largest employer of Australian workers. The Rudd government should be commended for helping to ease the administrative burden faced by small businesses. Back in 2007, the Labor Party promised the Australian people that if elected it would set up a free clearing house for small businesses by 30 June 2009, not 30 June 2010. Guess what? Yep, the Rudd government broke that election promise. It is almost a year after the deadline and it is only now that we are finally debating this with the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. Unfortunately, this type of behaviour of breaking election promises is something that the Australian public are growing more and more concerned about with the Rudd government.
In fact, I could name a whole list of election promises to the Australian public which the Rudd government has broken. But now the Rudd government has another broken election promise to add to that list, because instead of providing for the clearing house to be run by a private provider, as the Labor Party promised, it is now going to have this run by Medicare. This is a broken election promise that I know has caused a lot of angst amongst private sector clearing houses who feel that they should have been given the opportunity to tender for the business. Instead, the government has turned to Medicare, who it also turned to to run the pink batts program—that is right, the pink batts program which the Rudd government totally mismanaged.
We all know what happened to the pink batts program. We can only hope that the Rudd government does not stuff up this superannuation clearing house program. Family First is disappointed that the government has broken its election promise and let the Australian people down yet again. The Australian people are being treated like rag dolls by the Rudd government, which throws them from pillar to post without apparently really caring what they think or even caring about what it promised. When is an election promise a real promise? The Australian public is getting sick and tired of having the Rudd government constantly go back on its word. So what does this mean for this superannuation clearing house legislation? The establishment of a free clearing house for small businesses is a welcome initiative which will help small business. Family First supports this superannuation clearing house concept and will consider the amendments as the debate unfolds.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2010 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I would like to take this opportunity to thank those senators who contributed to this debate and indicate that schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 delivers on the government’s 2007 election commitment to introduce an optional superannuation clearing house service that will be free of charge to eligible small businesses—that is, those with fewer than 20 employees. Senator Fielding would be interested in these remarks, because I think they directly address his concerns. This measure will reduce the red tape burden on small businesses. In particular, it will remove the need for small business to deal with numerous different superannuation funds where their employees elect to exercise choice and, consistent with the government’s election commitment, it will enable small businesses to discharge their superannuation guarantee obligations once the payment is received by the clearing house. The measure has been welcomed by the Council of Small Businesses of Australia as well as by a range of other industry bodies, including the Investment and Financial Services Association and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, who described the measure as ‘the most significant first step in lowering administrative costs for employees’.
The government’s decision to provide a small business clearing house service through Medicare Australia was not taken lightly. The decision had regard to a number of factors. The key consideration relates to the government’s commitment to offer small businesses the certainty of being able to discharge their superannuation guarantee obligations on payments to the clearing house. A responsible approach to policy design required attention as to how to deal with this particular risk. This included thinking about what happens when something does go wrong, rather than just naively trusting that things will go right. Therefore, the discharge of the super guarantee liability at the clearing house has an important bearing on the design of the measure. It is the view of the government that if you do that—and this is a very important part of our election commitment—the best way of meeting that obligation and ensuring the security of employee funds is through the delivery of a service through Medicare. Delivering the clearing house service through Medicare Australia will minimise these risks in comparison with the provision through a commercial operator, ensuring that small businesses can discharge their super guarantee obligations on payment to the clearing house. Medicare Australia has a significant payment processing capacity, processing over 562 million services annually to the value of $35.8 billion. Medicare Australia is able to leverage its existing infrastructure and capabilities while ensuring the privacy of information and simultaneously ensuring the security of funds. Moreover, this is a measure that will be fully funded from the budget and will not require Medicare to draw on its existing resources.
The government accept that there are a number of private sector operators who believe they can deliver this service. However, it is not incumbent upon the government to deliver a solution which suits one particular segment of the superannuation industry. We have a duty to develop public policy in the interests of the whole nation—small businesses and employees as well as superannuation industries more generally. The government’s selection of Medicare is a responsible approach which will deliver significant compliance cost reductions for small businesses while removing any risk to employee superannuation entitlements while they are held by the clearing house.
The Senate Standing Committee on Economics has recommended that we consider that the threshold value of 20 employees be monitored over an initial period of three years. The government welcome this as a sensible recommendation. However, for the reasons that have already been outlined, the government will not consider enabling a commercial operator to provide this service on the same terms as Medicare, particularly in respect to discharging super guarantee liabilities.
The opposition has raised concerns about the government not tendering the service to the private sector and about the so-called anticompetitive effects of the selection of Medicare. It needs to be recognised that the significant segment of the market which are targeted by these measures involves employers with fewer than 20 employees. They are currently not extensively serviced by existing clearing house providers. This has been borne out in the evidence given by the superannuation industry participants to the Senate committee.
The relatively low use of the clearing house services by smaller businesses could be due to a number of factors, including that it may not be commercially attractive for existing operators to provide services to such small businesses. But the willingness and capacity of smaller businesses also needs to be considered when it comes to the issue of actually paying for the service. Whatever the reason, the measure contained in this bill is designed to address the gap that currently exists in the market by offering a free, no-strings-attached clearing house service to eligible small businesses, and I urge the opposition to support this important initiative. I am sure Senator Sherry, who is now here, will be able to deal with any other matters in the context of the committee stages of the bill. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2010-05-12,"—I rise to speak on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. I acknowledge that this debate takes place at a time when the federal government is backflipping and backtracking left, right and centre as its disastrous performance, in this case on border protection, comes home to roost. The sound border protection policies of the Howard government have now been comprehensively undone, and this has sent a strong signal to people smugglers that Australia is fair game for their criminal trade. This has profound implications and has placed considerable strain on our facilities at Christmas Island. Indeed, those facilities are now so strained that asylum seekers have had to be moved from Christmas Island to places like Darwin and Curtin. Of course, there is also considerable strain on Customs officers and Navy personnel who are attempting to cope with the consequences of that failing policy.
The government’s failed border protection policies have, at the same time, encouraged people smuggling across our region. They have persuaded vulnerable people to make dangerous journeys across the ocean in unsafe vessels, which has resulted in some cases in the tragic and unnecessary loss of life. Only in the last week or so we have seen what appears to be the loss of five lives in the Indian Ocean. That loss of life was unnecessary, it was avoidable but it was, in many ways, the consequence of policy settings which encourage people to engage people smugglers and to make these journeys. The Rudd Labor government has, in the face of ongoing pressure and swamped with continuing arrivals, realised that it has a policy setting which is unworkable and disastrous. It is in the process of taking stock of its policies and attempting to backtrack on the settings that it has put in place—but, in my opinion, only partially successfully.
This bill amends several acts in relation to Australia’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework. In relation to the Criminal Code, the bill creates a new offence of supporting the offence of people smuggling which targets people who organise, finance and provide other material support to people-smuggling ventures entering foreign countries, whether or not via Australia. The penalty for this offence is a very steep one: imprisonment for a maximum of 12 years, a fine of $110,000 or both. The bill creates two new people-smuggling related offences in the Migration Act: firstly, the offence of supporting the offence of people smuggling and, secondly, the aggravated offence of people smuggling, involving such things as exploitation, danger of death or serious harm, which will carry a penalty of imprisonment for a maximum of 20 years, a fine of $220,000 or both.

11:21:55 There are also amendments affecting the enforcement mechanisms available to those attempting to combat people smuggling. In relation to the Surveillance Devices Act, the bill will extend emergency authorisation for the use of a surveillance device to investigations into the aggravated offence of people smuggling. Currently the ability to maintain emergency authorisation for a surveillance device does not extend to offences under the Migration Act. In relation to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, this bill will simplify the criteria to be satisfied by agencies when applying for telecommunications interception warrants for investigating people-smuggling offences under the Migration Act. Under these amendments, agencies will no longer have to establish that the offence involves two or more offenders and substantial planning and organisation as well as the use of sophisticated methods and techniques and so forth.
This bill will amend the definition of the term ‘security’ in the ASIO Act to officially give the agency the statutory power to obtain and evaluate intelligence relevant to the protection of Australia’s territorial border integrity from serious threats. Such intelligence can then be communicated to agencies such as the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service or other law enforcement agencies.
All of that is good insofar as it strengthens the capacity of Australian government agencies and others with whom we cooperate to detect and deter, perhaps through prosecution, the trade of people smuggling. So the coalition supports what is contained in this legislation, but we need to acknowledge that in a very substantial way what is contained in this legislation is simply window-dressing. It is an attempt to disguise the fact that this government has presided over a weakening of Australia’s border protection policies and so it has brought forward tough-looking, tough-sounding legislation to beef up penalties against those who engage in people smuggling in a way which is good insofar as it goes, but which fails to acknowledge that the vast majority of people smugglers in the past have not been apprehended and prosecuted and in the future they are unlikely to be apprehended and prosecuted.
There is one arm of government policy which seeks to suppress people smuggling as an industry, but there is another arm of government policy which is quite clearly at the present time encouraging that trade to occur. The change made by the Rudd government to the Howard government’s border protection policies is precisely the kind of policy setting I am referring to. We have one part of government policy which is applying the brake to people smuggling and another part of government policy which is applying the accelerator. While that confused and mismatched policy is in place, we will not see an end to the very large trade in people carried out by people smugglers across Australia’s northern borders.
It is worth reflecting at this point on how that dismantling of Australia’s border protection policies has come about. It is a matter of record that in 2000 and 2001, after a significant number of boat arrivals, the Howard government took strong action to deter the trade in people. It made the tough decisions in the interests of Australia’s border security through a range of settings including offshore processing of asylum seekers, maintaining a policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers, excising territories from our migration zone that were previously attractive to people smugglers and engaging in an effective partnership with regional players such as Indonesia. The result of that change of policy was stark and clear. After the surge of arrivals in 2000 and 2001 and the announcement of new policies, we saw in 2002-03 no boats arrive on Australia’s northern shores. In 2003-04, there were only three boats. In 2004-05, again there were no boats. In the following three years, eight, four and three boats arrived in each of those financial years respectively.
The last of those years was 2007-08, a period which was partly under the new Rudd government. In the early year or so of the Rudd government’s reign, the slow pace of boat arrivals that had been characteristic of the previous government continued, but in August 2008 the government announced a change of policy. The government’s announcement was intended to send a signal that Australia was relaxing its previously ‘harsh’ border protection arrangements. Whether or not the government intended the signal to be as clear as it was is irrelevant. The fact is that it sent a very clear signal to people-smuggling operations around our region and the consequence was a surge in arrivals by boat.
This all comes from the Prime Minister who, as the king of spin, the day before the 2007 election when asked: ‘What would you do about boat arrivals in northern waters?’ said: ‘You’d turn them back’. That was what the Prime Minister to be said on the eve of the 2007 election. He said he believed in an ‘orderly immigration system’, but after a suitable interval he then set about undoing the coalition’s policy settings and repeatedly blamed push factors for the surge of arrivals that followed. He is responsible therefore, through his government’s decisions, for the large number of arrivals on Christmas Island and elsewhere in the interim. When those arrivals began to become politically embarrassing to the government, the Prime Minister referred to people smugglers as ‘representing the absolute scum of the earth’. Even while he was in the process of stimulating their business and allowing them to make the profits that they made and continue to make from people smuggling, he was describing them as the ‘absolute scum of the earth’.
It was this Prime Minister who called in a favour from the President of Indonesia in October of 2009 to stop a boat coming to Australia that he could not stomach, which subsequently led to an embarrassing and longstanding stand-off in Indonesian waters. This is the Prime Minister who offered a special deal to 78 asylum seekers on the Oceanic Viking, including the transfer to Australia of four asylum seekers who were later deemed a security risk by ASIO after a rushed check of their security status. This is the Prime Minister who continued to let numbers increase on Christmas Island because of a lack of conviction and a lack of will to alter the policy settings and who placed such strain on the resources that eventually Australia has had to let that number of asylum seekers overflow to the Australian mainland and facilities that had been closed for some time have had to be reopened. This is also the Prime Minister who planned for only 200 arrivals at Christmas Island in the 2009-10 financial year and who embarrassingly had to come back to the Australian parliament and ask for a further $134 million to cover the 1,400 arrivals that had actually taken place. That in turn has turned out to be an inadequate amount of money to cover that cost, with a record 4,580 arrivals and counting this financial year to date, including two further boats in the earlier part of this week.
It is not hard to see why people smugglers understand that a different policy has applied in Australia, that it is now open season once again and that the considerable profits that they are likely to generate from their nefarious activities are now available for them to continue to pursue. Welcome as the measures in this bill are and effective as they may be in the small number of cases where people smugglers can actually be intercepted and their work interdicted, the bill does not alter the fact that this legislation will not change the landscape with respect to that trade in people. It will not alter the landscape and it will not affect the number of people travelling to Australia. Nor, I suspect, will the government’s announcement that it will temporarily suspend the processing of asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
We saw the evidence produced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report that showed a 29 per cent increase in asylum applications in Australia while countries such as the United Kingdom experienced a five per cent decline in 2009, the clearest evidence that these policies simply are not making a difference. The changes in policy are simply not going to make any substantial improvement in the outlook for this particular problem that the government is now facing.
This is a government that clearly has difficulty in making difficult decisions. It is a government that cannot deliver and is flailing around desperately trying to make order out of chaos as it tries to satisfy both those critics on its left, who believe that it is already being too harsh with asylum seekers, and the critics on the right, a category which I suspect includes at this point the vast majority of Australians, who simply think that the government has lost control of our borders and who are not prepared to accept that the present policy makes any sense.
I have to say that, although there is a very powerful debate that has taken place in Australia over the status and entitlements of refugees—and I do not propose to traverse that debate here today—I think that anybody who is concerned about the welfare of refugees and is concerned to make sure that their interests are protected would do everything in their power to ensure that those people are not encouraged to board those unseaworthy vessels in Indonesian ports for that hazardous journey to Australia. Whatever we think about the need to protect refugees and to offer them protection and safe haven, we would never want a policy that is as firmly based on passage across the sea in those boats as the present government’s policy appears to be.
An indication of the way in which the government’s policy settings have changed the landscape came in an interview only a couple of weeks ago on the ABC, on 24 April, in which a would-be Iraqi asylum seeker had this to say:
Kevin Rudd—he’s changed everything about refugee. If I go to Australia now, different, different … Maybe accepted but when John Howard, president, Australia, he said come back to Indonesia.
I think that it is not surprising to hear those sorts of comments made. It is a question of perception, and the perception of those people who use the services of people smugglers is that this government’s policy has allowed them to make that journey and to obtain something of value from making that journey, and the people smugglers are more than willing to satisfy that particular market.
It is not surprising, therefore, that on 23 February this year, in the midst of the hype surrounding the counterterrorism white paper, Ministers McClelland, Evans and O’Connor announced a policy shift to try to disguise the green light which has been given to people smugglers for some time. It appears to date as if that attempt at smoke and mirrors has not succeeded in changing the approach of either people smugglers or their customers. I suspect that the government will need something else to achieve the effect that it desires.
To reiterate, the opposition does support this bill but we predict that it will have little impact on the scale of the people-smuggling industry in our region. In the future, we fear for the lives of those people who continue to make those journeys in that way and who obviously place themselves and their families at great risk by undertaking those journeys. We have a policy today that is neither tough nor humane. The Prime Minister said he wanted and was achieving a policy that was tough and humane. Clearly it is neither of those things. The 122 boats that have arrived since August 2008 and the 5,621 arrivals on those boats are stark testimony to the need to change policy, a change which we are yet to see from this government. The boats are still coming. There were two more earlier this week, carrying 36 and 86 people respectively. This indicates that the government still has not understood the nature and effect of its policy. I urge the government to assess the need to go back and revisit these policies. What is on the table today is welcome and will make a difference on the margin, but it does not tackle and address the real problem at the heart of the government’s flawed border protection polices.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-05-12,"—The Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, currently before the Senate, seeks to amend six principal acts: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, the Criminal Code Act, the Migration Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Surveillance Devices Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act.
In his second reading speech on this bill, the minister set out the proposed amendments to the various principal acts. In describing the purpose of the bill he stated:
This bill will strengthen the Commonwealth’s anti-people smuggling legislative framework, supporting the government’s plan to combat people smuggling.
I, and those on this side of the chamber, have no objection to supporting legislation that is designed to combat the insidious people-smuggling trade. But, as I will demonstrate in my contribution to this debate, this bill is too little too late and it has only become necessary because of the deliberate policy of the Rudd Labor government to soften the coalition’s tough but fair border protection policies.
As I have indicated, this bill amends six principal acts. Firstly, the bill seeks to ensure that people smuggling is comprehensively criminalised in Australian law, with tough penalties for the most serious forms of the insidious crime of people smuggling. Secondly, the bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the Surveillance Devices Act and the ASIO Act to provide the legislative authority to investigate people-smuggling activities and to enable law enforcement and national security agencies to play a greater role in support of whole-of-government efforts to address people smuggling and other serious threats to Australia’s territorial and border integrity.
Thirdly, the bill introduces a new offence of providing material support or resources for people-smuggling activities. Again, the minister has indicated in his second reading speech:
Such support or resources could include, but would not be limited to, property that is tangible or intangible, currency, monetary instruments or financial services, false documentation provided by corrupt officials, equipment, facilities or transportation.
Fourthly, the bill will introduce a new aggravated offence in the Migration Act for people smuggling involving exploitation, or danger of death or serious harm. The offence will apply to people-smuggling ventures to Australia.
Fifthly, the bill proposes to extend the application of the higher mandatory minimum penalty to the new aggravated people-smuggling offence involving exploitation, or danger of death or serious harm. And finally, the bill also proposes to extend the application of the higher mandatory minimum penalty to persons who are convicted of multiple aggravated people-smuggling offences in the same hearing.
These are all very commendable amendments and there is no doubt at all that Australia’s laws need to be strengthened to take account of the unprecedented number of illegal boat arrivals of people who have been shipped to Australia by unscrupulous and uncaring people smugglers. However, having acknowledged the need to strengthen Australia’s laws, it is now appropriate to ask the question and to examine the reasons why there has been such a dramatic increase in illegal boat people arriving in Australia since the Rudd Labor government was elected to office.
Following last night’s budget, why has it been necessary for the Rudd government to increase its spending on Australia’s border protection so dramatically? Again, in his speech the minister sought to hide behind the alleged push factors by referring to conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Sri Lanka. He said that these are the driving reasons as to why there has been a global surge in people smuggling. Consistent with his performance to date in this portfolio, the minister continues to fail to admit that it is in fact the pull factors, not the push factors, that he and the Rudd government alone have created that are the real reason we have seen an increase in the unprecedented number of illegal boat arrivals coming to Australia.
Have you noticed that when anything goes wrong on the Rudd government’s watch it is always someone else’s fault? Mr Rudd is a gutless wonder; he is spineless—he has no backbone. If he were a true leader, he would stand up and take responsibility for his failed border protection policies. As I said yesterday, no wonder there are rumours circulating of a Gillard/Emerson ticket. Gillard and Emerson must be rubbing their hands in glee, watching Mr Rudd slip and slide down the little slope that he is now on. If things get much worse, who wonders whether or not Mr Rudd will be replaced?
In terms of the failure of their policies, let us just reaffirm for the Australian people a number of other Rudd government failings to accept responsibility and their blaming of someone else. What about the failed insulation scheme? This has now cost Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. But on top of that it has tragically claimed four innocent lives to date, and there is a complete failure by those on the other side to take responsibility for it.
We all now know, of course, of the revelation in the Weekend Australian that officials in the Prime Minister’s and Peter Garrett’s departments assessed the risk of death or injury of the program to be extreme three times in the three months before the four young workers were killed. Yet, despite the irrefutable evidence of Rudd Labor’s mismanagement and incompetence, Rudd Labor continue to blame everybody else but themselves. Then we go back to the current legislation, which they tell the Australian people is designed to strengthen Australia’s border protection regime. And it is, but the problem is that the government are the reason behind why we now need this legislation. If they had not touched the Howard government’s strong border protection policies, we would not be here today in this chamber debating the need for the additional measures to assist our border protection.
When it comes to the failure of their border protection policies, Rudd Labor are always full of excuses. It is always the push factors coming from overseas; it is never the pull factors. But the bad news now is that there is so much on the record—and it is not just coming from this side of the chamber—that refutes the claims made by the Rudd Labor government. As the previous speaker, Senator Humphries, stated, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has stated that push factors have been easing in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, providing increasing opportunities for those previously seeking asylum to return home. But Labor cannot admit this. They will not admit it, as it will undermine their push to have Australians believe that global push factors are the reason that the boats continue to arrive here.
It is not only the United Nations commissioner who has commented. You will also recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—in fact, you will recall them well—the comments from Dr Palitha Kohona, Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, who said on the ABC’s Lateline program—not this year, but in November 2009:
I think this talk about the push factor is an over-exaggeration. If there were, as I said, a push factor, why didn’t they go across to India which is so close by, 22 miles away from Sri Lanka? Instead they head all the way to Australia. There must be another reason than simple push factor here.
There is another reason, and it is sitting across from me in the chamber: the good minister Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia.
Most Australians believe the influx of illegal immigrants is due to the widely publicised invitation that the Rudd government extended to people smugglers after the election in 2007. The people smugglers saw Australia go from a very tough place to get to—in fact, under the Howard government, the boats had stopped arriving—to having the red carpet thrown down for them and the Rudd government saying, ‘Come on down; the Rudd government have invited you here.’ The people smugglers now know—and, again, this is because of the Rudd government’s policy failures—that so long as their boats carrying illegal immigrants can get within about 200 kilometres of Christmas Island, they can make a phone call to the Australian Navy, claim that their boat is sinking and, guess what, the Rudd government are there to welcome them into Australia.
Soon after that, what do the Rudd government then give them? We all know, based on what they gave those on the Oceanic Viking, that it is an endless list of handouts that the Rudd government give to illegal people, handouts that the pensioners and the mums and dads in Australia must only wish that they had access to as well. What is Mr Rudd’s response to this influx of illegal immigrants? His response was:
We believe that we have got the balance of the policy right …
You have got to be kidding me. I say to the minister: ‘What do you say, Minister, to those people who have sat in refugee camps, who have done the right thing by Australia, who have done the right thing by the United Nations and who have sat in those camps year after year, waiting their turn and wanting to come to this country the right way? What do you say to them every time another boatload of unlawful immigrants arrives?’ You say, ‘Too bad mate; really sorry but there is no place for you because under our policies we allow queue jumpers into Australia.’ Minister, that is not good enough and it is certainly not fair to those people who are doing the right thing in the United Nations refugee camps.
Mr Rudd’s election promise to Australians that he would keep our borders safe was nothing more and nothing less than hypocritical rhetoric. It is a little bit like the promise he made to Australians prior to the 2007 election that he was an economic conservative. We all now know that that was blatantly untrue. If Mr Rudd and his minister honestly believe that the legislation that we are debating today is actually going to protect our borders, based on their current record, they are in absolute denial. We have all known for several months that the number of illegal arrivals from Sri Lanka has been declining, but the government refuse to acknowledge this as, once again, this undermines their spin that it is all about global push factors.
Labor’s policy solution to the increasing number of boat arrivals was to just increase the capacity of Christmas Island. There is a policy solution for you: we acknowledge that they are on their way; we will do nothing about actually stopping it, but what we will do is increase the capacity of Christmas Island. But, hold on, there is no more capacity at Christmas Island. So what did they do? The minister said, ‘Well, the good news is that there is another base that we can open in Derby in Western Australia’—his home state—‘and we will put the overflow of the asylum seekers there.’ That has gone down very well with the people smugglers, because they now know that when these bases actually reach capacity all the Labor government will do is just open another one. They are saying, ‘Come on down’ yet again.
As the previous speaker, Senator Humphries, outlined, when the coalition were in government we were given a problem, and the minister is right in acknowledging that we did have a number of illegal arrivals on our watch—we did. The difference between us and Labor, however, is that we saw that there was a problem. We acknowledged that tough decisions needed to be made to ensure that Australia’s borders were protected. So what did we do? We took tough policy measures. We had a problem, it was reflected in the number of boat arrivals, we put in tough policy measures, and what was the outcome? We reduced the boats to nil. That is the gift that the coalition government gave the Labor government when they took office. We gave them a solution. The Labor Party, as they do with most gifts they are given, looked at the solution and said, ‘How can we make a mess of it?’ That was very easy. All they needed to do was to make some very weak policy decisions to wind back the tough measures that the coalition had put in place. And guess what? All bets were off and the people smugglers were back in business.
Tony Abbott, our leader, is correct when he says that people are entitled to think that the Prime Minister has dudded them when he assured them that Australia’s border security would be safeguarded by his government. As with everything that came out of the mouth of the now Prime Minister prior to the 2007 election, that was nothing more and nothing less than Ruddspeak for ‘I want your vote and I will do and say anything to get it’.
The actions of the people smugglers are well and truly speaking louder than any of the policies that Labor have implemented. Labor’s failure to control our borders, and it is a failure, means that Australians are no longer in charge of deciding who comes lawfully to this country and under what circumstances they will come. It is a responsibility which the Rudd government have gladly abrogated and it is a responsibility that they should be ashamed of abrogating. Notwithstanding the amendments proposed in this current legislation, Mr Rudd and his government have an appalling record in relation to Australia’s border security and their lack of strong, decisive action continues to confirm that Rudd Labor are failing to protect our borders.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-05-12,"—I rise to speak on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010 and I pick up the point from my colleague Senator Cash, which is in summary that we can see that the Howard government saw and inherited a problem and found a solution for it. When this government came into power, Prime Minister Rudd had a solution at his hands and rejected every platform under which that solution had been developed. Of course, he now has a problem.
The fundamental point is that to stop this trade the people smugglers have got to be stopped in the first place. Why do they do it? Because, as we know, it is a very lucrative trade—up to $US10,000 per person delivered onto vessels upon which in the first place they should never be placed. Where do we have to stop the problem? We have to stop it at its point of origin. We have to stop the advertisements that we know exist in Sri Lankan newspapers, in Afghani newspapers and in other locations that are saying that Australia is now open for business. And we have seen nothing and they have seen nothing, regrettably, and neither will this proposed legislation provide any more that is going to discourage them. What a shocking, lamentable, despicable trade it is in human cargoes, yet that is what we actually see: a trade in human cargoes.
Let me put it to the perspective here in Australia regarding one of those costs that is not often recognised. I asked a question in Senate estimates earlier this year of the Australian Federal Police and they have provided me with this information. Between September 2008 and February of this year, in Western Australia 106 people smugglers were apprehended. Seventy-six of them are on remand and 28 of them have already been dealt with and found guilty and are now in our prison system. So we have 106 people who we did not budget for for whom there should be no burden on the Australian taxpayer or the Western Australian community. It may be of some interest to the Senate to learn that that figure alone equates to in excess of $10.6 million per year of cost to the Australian taxpayer for those people. According to the annual report of the relevant department in Western Australia last year, it costs just on $100,000 per annum, $2,000 a week, to keep somebody in our prisons. That is $10.6 million each year for that group, and that is only for those who have come since September 2008 through to February 2010. The cost, unfortunately, is borne by the Western Australian community in the main because there is no direct payment back from the federal government to the state government to actually take account of those costs. I learn that it is picked up in the GST calculations by the Grants Commission. We all know what Western Australia’s share of GST is this financial year. For those who do not, it is a mere 68c in the dollar, a 68 per cent return. So those hard-earning taxpayers of that state are picking up the $10.6 million. As I learnt in the media only yesterday, in most instances we are looking at a minimum of four-year terms of imprisonment, so you can multiply that $10.6 million by four.
The other cause of concern I have, and this legislation is not going to change this position one iota, is the question of how these people are arriving at our shores in the first place. In many instances they are people of Islamic background. Over the years we know that they have come into Asia, into Malaysia, another Muslim country, where they had been made very welcome but only in transit. They make their way then from Malaysia down to Indonesia, where they are made welcome in transit but not to remain. Of course, their objective is Australia.
I have asked myself over the years why it is that those of an Islamic background, keen to pursue an Islamic tradition, for which I applaud them, want to move through Islamic countries—through Malaysia; through Indonesia—to come here to Australia. But the case gets worse for them: they are, for whatever length of time, left in camps. They have not come through the front door in their application to come to our country. For whatever period of time, these poor people are left in camps and then they are put on leaking, unseaworthy vessels to come across some of the more dangerous of waters. We saw only this week a case where there have apparently been drownings of would-be asylum seekers.
The people smugglers, at $10,000 or more per head, are reprehensible. Do many of them actually make the voyage from these countries to Christmas Island or to Ashmore Reef? The answer is: no, they do not. In some instances they pay impoverished Indonesian fishermen—and that was the situation with a case that was dealt with in the courts in Darwin the other day. They pay them a meagre amount of money.
But it gets even worse than that. I want to draw attention to the exercise involving the Customs contracted vessel, the Oceanic Viking, in the northern waters in October-November last year and draw attention to what is actually happening in many of these cases. These vessels are unseaworthy and have insufficient water and insufficient fuel. They are going outside the territorial waters and the people smugglers are being taken off those vessels to return to the safety of home ports. In the case of the 78 Sri Lankans, when they actually made their call last year to Australia for some degree of assistance for survival at sea, their vessel was disabled—the rudder was not functional and there was insufficient fuel. They were simply at sea, in the water. So we had the circumstance where there was an incredible amount of money paid, yet these people were left to their own devices.
Did that group make contact with the Indonesians, given the fact that they were in Indonesian territorial waters? We think, no, they did not. According to Mr Carmody, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, when answering questions from me in Senate estimates, direct contact was made from the vessel to AMSA here in Australia. We of course then had an obligation under the safety of life at sea convention.
But did the issue stop there? No, it did not stop there. As we know, people were transferred onto the Oceanic Viking. It is true that, at the time they went on board that vessel, they were inspected, checked and searched for, amongst other things, mobile telephones. So you might say, ‘Well, this is all fine; this is safe. We’ve got an Australian vessel,’ and you would think that, for that complement of crew, including the security officers, the commercial crew—the vessel being under contract to P&O—and the 78 asylum seekers, a contingency plan would be in place should any untoward activity take place. You might ask: ‘Why would there be any untoward activity?’ Go back to April last year when we had SIEV36—which has now played out its role in the coroner’s court in Darwin. On that occasion, fuel was thrown into the bilges and as naval and other Australian Defence Force personnel were either on board or approaching it the vessel blew up.
So one would have thought that there would definitely be a contingency plan in place to assist the security and other personnel on the Oceanic Viking should there be a similar event—for whatever reason. I learnt, to our regret, that there was no contingency in place. We had an Australian flagged vessel in international waters, close to Indonesia—well away from Australia—and that group of personnel had no back-up. It was then said to me, ‘The Indonesian Navy were to supply some form of back-up and assistance.’ The advice to me was that that group never came within a kilometre of that vessel.
So you go a bit further and ask under what circumstances people might have been at risk. Surely, if it was possible for any vessel to come within a commutable distance of the Oceanic Viking, it would have caused some degree of concern. But we learnt from the Australian that a correspondent actually got close enough to throw a mobile phone on board the Oceanic Viking—and great jocularity took place. In the words of the journalist: ‘Threw the mobile phone on board. They slipped it; couldn’t catch; couldn’t bowl; and the mobile went over the side.’ So what did they do? Typical journalists—they threw another mobile phone on board and it was through the agency of that mobile phone that the asylum seekers were continually in contact with the Australian media.
When I put to the head of Customs that this was potentially a dangerous circumstance for all on board, he rejected that. He said, ‘No, I can’t see where your concern was.’ I can assure you that those in the security contingent on board that vessel certainly saw the cause for concern. Under their rules of engagement, they had no capacity at all to inspect those on board—to search them and to find out if there were any items at all on board. So the mobile phones remained and the calls remained. But the question must then be asked: if it is possible to get close enough to throw a mobile phone onto the deck of the Oceanic Viking, what else may have been able to have been thrown on board? What else may have been able to be propelled from a vessel onto the Oceanic Viking? Remember who was on board: Australian border security personnel, the asylum seekers, the commercial crew actually in charge of the vessel and the various officials who were trying over time to negotiate with the asylum seekers—a totally and utterly unsatisfactory circumstance which could have had a similar outcome to SIEV36.
I then asked the question, ‘In terms of those on board, who was actually negotiating with the asylum seekers?’ You may recall the asylum seekers were refusing to leave the vessel. I could get little information as to the qualities, the competence or the qualifications of those who were undertaking it. We were then told by the minister opposite that there was no special deal done with those asylum seekers. Of course there was a deal done. I do not know why the minister persisted with that line for as long as he did when we know that a deal was definitely done. Ask them on Christmas Island whether a deal was done.
Then, worst of all, we had the scenario in which a person on board that vessel was the spouse of somebody who had already been refused entry to Australia as a result of ASIO investigations. I tried to establish whether it was known that that person was onboard the Oceanic Viking and the answer was that I could not be supplied with that information. As we know, subsequent to them being taken off the Oceanic Viking, one of those people was in fact denied entry to Australia as an asylum seeker. This is a totally unsatisfactory set of circumstances.
—Factually wrong.
—The minister has made the point that it is factually wrong. I will seek the minister’s advice because the advice to me and the advice publicly is that a person who was onboard the Oceanic Viking at that time—
—There were four.
—There were four. I am referring specifically to the spouse of a person who was denied entry to Australia. My point is that ASIO and others should have known that. The minister is quite right when he says that not one but four people on the Oceanic Viking were subsequently refused entry. Surely that must have sent a flag to Australian authorities that there was the possibility of greater risk to all of those on board—yet no action was taken, no contingency was put in place and no protection was given.
—They were already off the boat when they got the security assessment. You are completely confused.
—The point that was made in my presentation was that the spouse of one of those people had already been denied access and she was on the vessel at that time.
I conclude with the observation that Australia is a very, very generous country when it comes to accepting refugees. It is my understanding that we are only second to Canada on a per capita basis in our acceptance of refugees. The point has been made and laboured, and has to be made yet again: for every person who comes in through the back door, who fails to apply to come Australia as a refugee in the normal way and who is accepted into this country, there is a person who has been a legitimate applicant waiting in a refugee camp elsewhere in the world actually being up for a longer period of time.
When I first came into this place there was derision from those on the other side about the amount of money that the Howard government had spent on Christmas Island—derision of that fact because at that time there was no great need. What do we see now? We see not only Christmas Island overfilled with asylum seekers but also a cost which will surely be blowing out. I think from last night’s budget, if I am correct, another $1 billion has been allocated to this whole exercise; yet the scenario continues that little action is being taken at the root cause—not attacking sufficiently the very people smugglers who are the genesis of this whole program.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-05-12,"—I stand on this side of the chamber to support the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010 and to also concur and associate my remarks with those of Senator Back, Senator Cash and other coalition senators who have expressed their extreme concern about the way that the government is handling the boat people and the immigration system, and the fact that it appears based on all the evidence available that the government has simply mismanaged this situation, which is basically bordering on being out of control.
Before I talk more broadly about some of those concerns, I want to commend the bill before us, and refer to the technical and administrative reforms and recommendations made to this bill by the government and to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report tabled just a few weeks ago. As the deputy chair of that committee, the coalition senators support the amendments that improve and streamline the federal government’s approach to anti-people-smuggling legislative efforts.
The bill before us amends the Migration Act to create new people-smuggling offences and harmonises the existing offences. It broadens the role of ASIO in gathering intelligence on people smuggling and other serious threats to border security. It increases the powers of law enforcement agencies to utilise surveillance devices and telecommunications intercept devices, and it expands ASIO’s powers to utilise telecommunications interceptions to collect foreign intelligence. There is a recommendation regarding the latter in the Senate report.
I thank the committee secretariat for the support in pulling this report together and the other members of the committee, including my fellow coalition senator, Senator Parry, and also the participating member, Senator Trood, on this occasion. We noted article 6 of the people-smuggling protocol. It does require state parties to criminalise people smuggling when it is committed intentionally and in order to obtain a financial or material benefit. We looked at article 19 of the protocol, which clarifies that the protocol is not intended to affect the responsibilities of states under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and we looked at the Bali process which kicked off in 2002, around the time of the Bali bombings.
I will come to the extent of people smuggling in a moment. It is a very, very serious issue and this is why, it seems to me, the government is out of kilter and the whole immigration system seems to be out of control. We noted in the budget last night that they plan to spend an extra billion dollars to try to alleviate some of the concerns, and that just confirms again, in my view—and I think in the view of many others—that the government has not got its act together. In terms of the recommendations in the Senate committee report, the coalition do support the reforms to expand the roles and achieve the objectives as we have indicated. There is a recommendation regarding foreign intelligence warrants, and that is recommendation 1, which states:
… that the proposed definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ in subsection 5(1) of the TIA Act should be amended to ensure that ASIO can obtain foreign intelligence warrants in relation to the activities of foreign nationals who are in Australia.
Now I want to come to the fact that the way in which our borders are being managed and mismanaged is out of control. It was confirmed last night in the House of Representatives, as I said, that the government plan to spend an extra billion dollars to try to fix the problem. It is a problem of their own making. The issue of waste and mismanagement is supreme. It is at the highest order. We had the pink batts fiasco where we saw—and confirmed in the budget last night—a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money go down the chute to try to fix that program.
—Borrowed money.
—‘Borrowed money’, says Senator Williams, and he is quite right. It is borrowed—as confirmed in the federal budget last night—to the extent of $100 million a day, $700 million a week, to pay for the reckless spending of the Rudd Labor government. It is shambolic. It is disgraceful. The government feel as though they have been forced onto the backfoot to pull out another billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to try to rectify a system which they have broken, which they muffed, which they stuffed, and that is what that money is being used for. That is taxpayers’ money, that is money that is being borrowed, and that confirms again that the system is out of control. I want to put on the record that the coalition will be digging deeper into these matters at Senate estimates in the weeks ahead, to make sure that we get to the bottom of it as to why these problems occurred and why we are in a pickle at the moment in terms of border mismanagement and maladministration.
We were advised yesterday that the Rudd government have decided to spend $1.2 million to house 79 asylum seekers in a four-star hotel in Brisbane, and that is frankly a consequence of the government’s failed border protection measures and policies. That is the bottom line. That is why those asylum seekers are there. If the government had proper policies in place, like we had under the previous government, they would not be in this pickle and they would not be causing Australians to borrow that extra money to spend in this way. Of course the neighbours are concerned; why wouldn’t they be? They have expressed their concerns publicly, and I hope that there will be coordination and liaison between the relevant authorities, the local police and the people in that community. This is, in fact, occurring in Treasurer Wayne Swan’s own electorate in Brisbane. The government are now paying $179 per night because there is no room left at Christmas Island.
We had another government backflip not long ago with respect to offshore processing. They slammed their hand on the desk and said, ‘We will have offshore processing.’ They were so adamant that they would continue to do this, and yet there was another backflip just months ago. That is another result of their failed border protection policies.
Let us have a look at the facts and the figures. Since Kevin Rudd started rolling back the strong border protection regime that he inherited from the coalition, 122 boats have arrived carrying 5,624 people. Apparently yesterday two more boats arrived, taking the total for the year to 54. I am advised that as at the same time last year, only 12 boats had arrived. It appears to me that the boats keep on coming. The report that I referred to earlier, the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee—which was tabled just a week or so ago—says, on page 2, that as at 3 May 2010:
… there had been 92 unauthorised boat arrivals carrying approximately 4,300 people (including crew) during 2009-10.
There is a reference on that page that refers to some research undertaken by the Parliamentary Library, whom I want to commend for their research and diligence. I thank them for that and for the tremendous work that they do for the members and senators in this place. The report goes on:
In 2008-09, there were 23 vessels carrying 1033 people, while in 2007-08 there were three vessels carrying 25 asylum seekers.
You can see that the numbers are increasing fast and vigorously. Under the coalition, the average number of boats per year was about three.
—That is not true.
—That is the advice I have got, and that was in the last six years of the government.
—So you forget the big years—
—I am happy to be corrected by Senator Evans, and he can put his views on the record, but let us compare the record. In those last six years, the average of three boats—
—Why only six years? Why not the full 12 years? Aren’t you proud of the first six years of the government?
—What is it now, Senator Evans? How many boats, on average, are coming per year, per week and per month? Let us have a look. There are three boats per week at the moment, so do not crawl around here and try to snivel away and avoid the accusations and allegations.
—You just be honest. Be honest with the figures.
—You can have the opportunity to respond, to put your view forward here, and you can say: ‘Yes, our border protection measures are 100 per cent right. Everything’s going fine and dandy.’ I can tell you, Senator Evans—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—that the Australian public do not think so. They are not happy pumpkins. They are worried. They are concerned about the numbers and the fact that our borders seem out of control. Senator Evans knows that. He knows that the government changed the policy in 2008 and, as a result, there has been a surge in the number of boat people seeking asylum who are coming to this country. There has been an average of three boats per week under the Rudd Labor government. They are the facts. Let him deny them and let’s see what he says about them, because we have the research. It is in the report. It has been referred to, I have tabled it, and there is a library research document which confirms the matter. It seems to me that the government are saying one thing and doing another.
Why shouldn’t the people in that community express concern? Apparently they had no notice of it or advice about it. Senator Brandis asked a question about this yesterday and Senator Evans’s responses in question time were very disappointing indeed. He was saying: ‘This is inappropriate and unfair. This occurred under the Howard government, and why should the people in the local community be advised?’ I think he has it wrong. I think they should be advised and communicated with, including local authorities such as local law enforcement agencies. They should be and they need to be. They are acting as if nothing ever happened in terms of the communication process. We would like a full explanation as to exactly what the situation is and how that could have happened.
I am not going to spend a lot of time on it today, but the fact is that Christmas Island is at boiling point. It appears as though this government have the red carpet out and are saying, ‘Come on down and come on in.’ The boats are arriving just off Christmas Island—not that far away. Now the surge has occurred to the degree that Christmas Island is overflowing. The government’s policy said ‘offshore processing’ but the fact is that that is now not the case. They have done a backflip.
Even the local member in Darwin has been commenting. In the NT News yesterday there was an article that said:
Darwin’s immigration detention centre is already over capacity just weeks after it started housing asylum seekers.
Goodness me! How do the people of Darwin feel about that? The article says:
The Northern Detention Centre has an operating capacity of 382 people.
But the centre has been forced to go into ‘surge’ capacity—offering a further 164 beds—to cater for the 430 detainees who reside there.
The fact is: it is out of control. This government have no idea what they are doing and how they are doing it. Their mismanagement of the whole immigration policy is an example of putting the cart before the horse, and it is very disappointing.
The report also says:
The Federal Government announced last month it would transfer detainees to the mainland after Christmas Island reached capacity.
That is exactly my point: this is another government broken promise. Of course, it is on the back of the ETS, the ‘great moral issue of our time’, and the backflip on that and other broken promises, whether they be GROCERYchoice or Fuelwatch, or whether they be the GP superclinics, of which there are only three that are fully operational. What a joke: they have announced extra phantom GPs superclinics—I think that makes 59 in total—when there are only three that are fully operational. That was a promise before the last election. There have been so many broken promises.
—Childcare centres.
—There were the childcare centres, as Senator Bernardi indicates. The government have ripped that promise up and thrown it away. In the quiet of a late Friday night, I think it was, the minister made that announcement at the bottom of a press release she put out, just quietly trying to tell people, ‘It’s not a big deal.’ The fact is: honesty is important in politics. Integrity is critical to building trust in members of parliament and decision-makers at the federal, state or local government level. And you have lost that trust. People do not trust what the government say anymore. That will be the problem with your federal budget—your assumptions and your figures just will not be believed. They are dodgy, unbelievable assumptions. On the one hand you say, ‘Put a tax on smoking and smoking will go down,’ but on the other hand you say, ‘Put a tax on mining and mining investment will go up.’ Come on! Pull the other one! Who is going to believe it? Your assumptions simply are not believable.
There is plenty more to be said about this, but I know others need to share their views. I do just want to refer to an article in the Age entitled ‘Push for missing asylum seekers inquiry’. What are the government going to do about the prognosis and the problems before them? They seem to have mishandled this issue so badly. Of course there should be an inquiry. We have had the tragic situation in which five Sri Lankan Tamils are believed to be dead after abandoning their failing boat last Wednesday, which is five days after Australian authorities learned it had run out of fuel. The issues are coming at us thick and fast, and the government simply cannot get a grip on the situation.
On the whole immigration process, Australia has a good record, and I am proud of that record of welcoming refugees to this country—those people who are doing what they consider to be the right thing in the various refugee camps around the world. We care for our fellow Australians, whether they be refugees or otherwise, and we should continue to do so. There is no excuse for not showing care and compassion. At the same time, we need to protect the national interest. We need to protect our immigration system and to make sure that our borders are secure so that we know exactly who is coming to this country and the manner in which they are coming. That is up to us as a parliament.
I think the government has not got it right. It needs to get it right and the time has come for the government to be called to account. This will happen, of course, in the weeks and months leading up to the federal election. People will have an opportunity to decide who is better able to manage our borders, to keep them secure, and who is better able to ensure that we have a professionally administered, carefully and properly operating immigration system so that we know exactly who is coming to the country and the nature of their coming. At the moment the immigration system is being run very poorly indeed.
Turning to population policy, the government seems to have and to accept the view that the population is huge and growing, but there is no rationale, no management and no thinking behind that particular view. It is a concern for a lot of Australians—they do not like it. I know, whether it is in Tasmania or other parts of Australia that I visit, people are feeling unsettled about this government’s approach to border security, about this government’s approach to population policy and to immigration policy more generally. The rubber will hit the road in the next weeks and months as we head into the election. I ask Australians to think carefully about who is better able to manage our borders, our immigration system and our population policy.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-05-12,"—I join my colleagues in this debate on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, the changes in which the coalition duly supports. But, as previous speakers have said, it is all too little too late. I will get onto the details and technicalities of the bill, but I could not help notice, in my rush to get onto the speaking list on this matter, that it is an issue which has moral, financial and social dimensions. It is probably the No. 1 issue in this country since climate change has been taken off as the No. 1 issue, and it ought to be. This is not pink batts. This is not a portfolio that is in the mess in which Peter Garrett, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, left his portfolio. It is not the embarrassment and disgrace in which Penny Wong, the former Minister for Climate Change and Water, left her portfolio. It is not the portfolio of Julia Gillard, the Minister for Education, with its memorial halls and billions of dollars of waste. This is not the same. This is a portfolio in shambles. It is a portfolio that deals with human cargo. This is a little more serious. We have the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship sitting on the other side reduced to interjecting speakers on this side because he has surrendered every other part of his portfolio to the Prime Minister. What an embarrassment he has made of it. What a castration he has made of this minister. It must be embarrassing to see him stripped of his powers in the media and in the department. He is not interjecting me now; he is playing the ignoring game. Every other speaker—and I watched it on TV—he sought to interject, and that is what he has been reduced to. By the way, no-one else around here is backing up the minister at all. Not one of them is on the speakers list. This is a pattern of course with this government.
—Because you’re voting for the bill, you goose!
—I would have thought on this issue they might have backed you. They might have thought to back you. They may have had a case to mount. You seem to want to mount your case through interjection. That is how you mount your case. What an embarrassment! The Prime Minister has stripped you of all your authority and of your voice in public. You wander around, if not waddle around, Christmas Island saying, ‘We’ll fix this,’ as it bursts at the seams, and that is all you have done. In 2008 your own department warned you about all of this.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—Yes. You do not know—you never read it, like Peter Garrett never read his reports. You were given a report in October 2008, if not the Federal Police report—the one by your own department. Both of them warned you that the changes in the laws would create a surge in illegal boat arrivals, as it has. You can screw up your face and say you never read it. Actually, I think you did not. I would agree: you probably did not read it. You are not on top of your portfolio—you never have been. I think you have been found out. You got to the leadership position through lack of talent on that side. You slipped into it.
—You’ve been here 20 years and you’ve achieved nothing!
—I have still got the passion, I have still got the ideals and I have still got the belief—and I have never lied to this chamber.
—They regard you as the village idiot. Even the National Party disowned you!
—I have never lied to this chamber. You have stood there and misrepresented this portfolio and what is happening in it. You have lied to this chamber.
—Twenty years of failure!
—I have never spent 20 years lying.
—Even the National Party disowned you!
—You are an embarrassment! You are useless! You are more useless than Peter Garrett, because you deal with human cargo and people’s lives are being lost.
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator McGauran, your remarks towards the minister are verging on the personal. I would ask you to stick to the subject in hand.
—I withdraw those comments, as he scurries out of the chamber. You may like to know that another boat has arrived, Minister. Mr O’Connor, the Minister for Home Affairs, now makes a statement on your behalf. Mr O’Connor has made the statement that—
—It’s Mr O’Connor’s responsibility!
—Oh, it is his responsibility now, is it? Duck-shoving it—which he has always done. In fact, he has been stripped of all his authority. The Oceanic Viking picked up another boat yesterday with 48 people aboard. They must have been thrilled to have been picked up by the Oceanic Viking. Here we go again, I suspect. Of all the boats you could be picked up by, that is the lucky draw. If the minister had stayed in the chamber and I had read to him Mr O’Connor’s press release, which has just come out—I was fortunate enough to pick it up—I bet you he would not have known. I bet you he would not have known there has been another boat arrival. What are we up to—over 120; maybe 123 or 124 since the law’s change? You can map it from August 2008. From the point that the laws were softened the boats started to arrive—the product started to look attractive. People smugglers were back in business, and the tragedy is the human cargo.
Whatever morality you want to put up on that side , people’s lives are being lost. Whatever morality you saw in those laws to soften them, whatever group you sought to pander to, they have failed. Admit that; change it. Change it because, as I said, this is not pink batt backflips, this is not ETS backflips, this is not Julia Gillard’s wicked waste. This is dealing with people’s lives. There is a moral dimension to this portfolio and that drongo you have in charge of all of this has led you to this point. It is more than just a political matter. He is not only doing you untold political damage. He is not only weakening our border security which is a fundamental responsibility of any government—put politics aside; it is fundamental—but also risking the lives of every person who jumps on those boats when he can make it better.
We reduced the boats to zero—to three. You cannot stop them forever. You will get the boats coming through but not 124 boats. You will get three. Reduce it. Have some compassion. Look at that sort of morality. That is where we are coming from on this side of the debate. We are doing no more than that, as we did in government. We sought to fulfil the fundamental responsibility of a government: border security. We took up the moral dimension of it, as hard as it was. We sought not to pander to a certain group—and we know who they are—from the left.
I appeal to the minister to get control back from his portfolio. Take charge. Admit or do not admit the error—it really does not matter which—but just make the changes. I appeal to the two senators in the Labor government who have bothered to turn up to this fundamental issue. It is actually a debate in which we are supporting the legislation of the government and they still do not have the courage to come in to talk even on the bill. There might be something you could boast about in this bill but you still do not have the courage to come in.
I heard it reported the other day that at pre-budget drinks at the Lodge some of the caucus had the courage to front the Prime Minister and ask him a few hard questions. I have no doubt. I would hope a lot of it dealt with border security—the political effect it was having, the moral effect it was having. We know five Sri Lankans have tragically gone missing in the last week, because they were induced to come to Australia. They locked themselves into the hands of the people smugglers. Today where are those who approached the Prime Minister and asked him some hard questions at the Lodge? It was all a bit of Dutch courage by the sounds of it. They probably woke up and sobered up because they do not have the courage today to take the Prime Minister on, to take their own government on on this deep issue. This cuts deep.
In fact, the senator on the front bench knows it only too well. If she wants to interject and say she does not, that I am misrepresenting her, she can. But I know only too well this is one she should walk into her caucus for—not down at the Lodge where you have a few drinks in you. Go into your own caucus party room and raise this issue about the softness of the laws. Have they got the courage? Well, they do not have the courage to stand up in the parliament they were elected to and speak on the issue. How would they have it in caucus? I would hope they would and you should. We have done it. The coalition party room has no fear or favour in it, and you saw that recently on the issue of the Emissions Trading Scheme. What an eruption within a party room that was. You will not see the likes of it ever again—at least I hope not. I had not seen it prior to that and I lived through opposition once before.
We believe in some things over here. We do have courage from time to time. We do allow dissent. You do not like it when it gets out and you do not like it when it is close to an election, but I keep saying this issue is an exception and you ought to treat it as an exception. You ought to start saying, ‘We have to get tough.’ This is not enough. This bill is too little too late. It makes technical changes to the penalties if someone is caught people smuggling. Trying to get them to and through the courts in Australia is very difficult but a worthy aim. But most of them, as we know, are operating over in Indonesia. We need Indonesian laws. They are many years away.
You have given ASIO extra powers. That is good, but they were operating anyway, if the truth be known. But it has clarified their powers. They know they can go straight to the source of people smuggling and not via some sort of border security issue. That is a good thing. You have broadened telecommunications interception powers to define a serious offence that entitles telecommunications interception to include people smugglers. Those are all very good and we support them, but there is a bigger and more important issue here. Those changes do not go to the heart of the problem. You know what the heart of the problem is. It is staring you in the face and, because you have all allowed yourselves for three years to be cowed by a Prime Minister, his department and his kitchen cabinet, you are not willing to stand by the oath of your office just once in three years on this critical human issue, this moral issue. It is not a financial issue. Politics plays second to it, quite frankly. It is a moral issue.
Senator Hutchison has walked in. He has just got himself another six years in parliament after the New South Wales pre-selection deals which are done before the real pre-selection.
—Mark Arbib.
—He must have really shook the hand of Mark Arbib. I do not seek to belittle that. I am glad. Thank goodness for Senator Hutchison—
—Hutchins.
—You ought to get up and speak more; I would know your name better! You know who I am of course. I can honestly say he is one who would stand up in his caucus party room and I am absolutely bewildered why he has not to date.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2010-05-12,"—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, for the call and for getting my name correct. I will deal with Senator McGauran on another date, but I want to deal with a serious matter today. On 10 April, the nation of Poland suffered a tragic loss, in a part of the world associated with horror and brutality of the worst kind. The Polish President, Lech Kaczynski, along with his wife, Maria, and a high-level delegation of senior members of his government, was killed after their aircraft came down over north-west Russia. They were en route to the city of Smolensk to pay tribute to those who fell victim to a war crime of gross inhumanity perpetrated by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union—the Katyn forest massacre.
Kaczynski, a titan of the Polish political landscape, has gone but the contribution that he and his peers in the Solidarity movement and the independent trade union movement made will live on well beyond today in the democratic institutions of Polish government that now stand testament to their great works. It was in the harsh and unforgiving environment of communist Poland that Kaczynski, an academic with qualifications in law and a doctorate in industrial relations, became active in the Polish trade union movement. Most notably, he was an activist for workers’ rights and democratic freedom. He became an influential figure within the Solidarity movement and a close ally of Lech Walesa, who was to become the first democratically elected leader of a free Poland. Walesa is also remembered for his lead role in forming Solidarity, as leader of the Gdansk Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, to which Kaczynski was a senior adviser. An industrial dispute organised by this committee at the Gdansk shipyard was one of the pivotal events in bringing about the end of communist rule in Poland. This action took advantage of widespread discontentment, forcing the government to legalise trade unions independent of the communist state. This set the stage for disparate workers committees to unite under the Solidarity banner, which would eventually lead them to freedom and democratic elections a decade later.
Lech Kaczynski’s career in Polish government began in 1989 as a senator in the Polish Senat, representing the Gdansk region. By 1991, he held the post of security minister, a position where he played a hands-on role in exercising a strong commitment to ‘decommunising’ the machinery of government and redefining Poland’s national security regime. Kaczynski held the view that corruption was caused by the lasting influence of former communist agents and officials in public and corporate life. During his time as minister for justice, beginning in 2000, his public profile and respectability among Poles was buoyed by his firm and unapologetic stance against corruption in government and against the pervasive threat posed by serious and organised crime, including the Russian mafia. These same themes carried him to popularly elected office in his own right, first as Mayor of Warsaw, a post that he held until his election as President of Poland.
As President, Kaczynski’s policy successes include ratification of the Lisbon treaty and reforms to financial markets aimed at further integration into the European Union. He was seen as a nationalist but viewed the extension of Polish influence in regional and international forums as a foreign policy priority. He developed close ties between Poland and the state of Israel, expanding cultural links between the two nations. Helping to overcome differences between the Catholic and Jewish communities at home that had been created by wartime experience, Kaczynski was a leader who reached out to bring people together. As Mayor of Warsaw, he donated public land and money to establish a Museum of the History of Polish Jews in the city. In 2008, he was the first Polish head of state to attend a Jewish religious service, at the Nozyk Synagogue in Warsaw. President Kaczynski was acutely aware of the suffering of the Polish people in the last century of its history and lent the power of his office to commemorating their ordeal while seeking truth and reconciliation for the families and communities touched by the pain of such memories.
But the deepest wounds take a long time to heal, and the Katyn forest massacre was no exception. This act of mass murder saw the execution of 21,768 Polish prisoners of war, academics, professionals and law-makers at the hands of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, an atrocity personally approved by Stalin and the most senior members of his politburo. It represented the loss of an entire generation of Polish community leaders—those most likely to resist communist control—and was indiscriminate. This incident had long been a roadblock to Polish-Russian relations, a result of the deception and secrecy of the Soviet government. Until 1990, when the Soviet Union finally declared the truth of its involvement, they had claimed that it was an act of Nazi Germany and was even included by Russian prosecutors in a list of charges at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. No former Soviet official has ever been prosecuted over the incident. For half a century, this represented the lack of trust between the Polish and Russian peoples. It was a truth too shameful to bear and an act too barbaric to forget.
The text of the speech President Kaczynski intended to give later in the day on 10 April is available on the President’s website. The importance of the Katyn incident as a lasting symbol of injustice in the minds of the Polish people is clearly evident in his words. This is what he was to say:
Lies about Katyn were a part of this attempt to deceive and historians even refer to them as the ‘founding lies’ of the Polish People’s Republic ... The world was never supposed to know the truth—families of the victims could not mourn them in public, could not grieve for them or pay them a decent last tribute ... The People’s Republic of Poland was based on lies about Katyn and now the truth about Katyn constitutes the foundation of a free Poland.
We have already seen strong symbolic steps towards a closer relationship for Poland and Russia and, on Russia’s part, unprecedented openness about the Katyn massacre. On 29 April, the Kremlin ordered the publication of once-secret documents relating to the atrocity on the internet. At a press conference shortly after the release of these files, the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, said:
Let everyone see what happened at that time, who made decisions, and who ordered the execution of Polish officers. All written documents are there, with all the signatures.
This is a potent symbol of increased transparency and a clear indication that Russia wants to set the record straight in order to improve future relations. On 9 May, President Medvedev further reinforced this move towards reconciliation, as he personally handed the Acting President of Poland, Bronislaw Komorowski, over 67 volumes of documents relating to the Katyn massacre and has vowed further cooperation.
The Russian Federation of today is not a totalitarian state with delusions of empire, as its predecessor surely was. It is an extremely different nation, one that has made tremendous progress on the path to democratic reform, free markets and open government. The political culture is no longer based on ideological withdrawal from development, commerce and the concept of a government accountable to its people. The call for closer ties between Russia and Poland has been echoed by Acting President Komorowski, who has said ‘President Lech Kaczynski’s testament must be fulfilled through rapprochement and reconciliation’ with Russia. He said further:
The truth about Katyn is a common test that both the Polish and Russian people have endured ... this truth could be a good basis for the development of relations between the two countries.
President Kaczynski’s efforts to achieve full disclosure over the Katyn forest massacre and his tragic loss in pursuing justice and recognition for the victims and their families have not been in vain. From this accident, the gaze of the world’s media has been drawn to Katyn and, through this, the world has learnt of the events that transpired there 70 years ago. The global community will now remember the victims and the man who fought with such determination for their memory.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the nation of Poland in this time of overwhelming national loss. Over the last century, the Polish have proven time and again their resilience of spirit, strong sense of community and ability to recover through seemingly insurmountable adversity. While President Kaczynski and the 92 other military, political and cultural leaders who travelled with him will be sorely missed by a grieving nation, the legacy of a democratic, free Poland, which they played such a pivotal role in shaping, will stand as a lasting monument to their service and sacrifice.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Poland</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-05-12,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister confirm that Labor has budgeted for a deficit of more than $40,000 million next financial year, the second biggest budget deficit in Australia’s history, beaten only by Labor’s record-breaking $57,000 million deficit this financial year?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-05-12,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that, in order to fund its deficit and, as we have just been told, to focus on repaying debt as quickly as possible, the government is in fact borrowing $783 million every week—that is, some $77,000 every minute of every hour of every day?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-05-12,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Given that within just three years Labor has turned $44,800 million in the bank into a debt of $78,500 million, a turnaround of $123,000 million, how can Labor seriously claim to be economic conservatives? Has any other government in Australian history ever racked up so much debt so fast, or is this another Labor first? (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-05-12,"—It is fair to say that I had not prepared for that question, because I was not down for a dorothy. I do not know whether Senator Abetz has read the papers, but I think he will find that people have universally acknowledged that the government has delivered a responsible budget—one that is very much focused on repaying debt and one that has at its core the early repayment of debt. Three years early the debt will be repaid compared to the budget forecast from last year. So not only are we in a situation whereby our current conditions have our economy stronger than all other comparable economies—we are in very good shape—but the government has taken advantage of those conditions and the fact that we have come through the global financial crisis in such good shape as a result of the government’s investment in the stimulus activity to protect Australian jobs. Having come through that, this government has delivered a fiscally conservative budget—one that focuses on repaying debt and meets the constraints that we predicted we would apply.
So what we know is that we will repay debt three years early. The whole focus of the budget is on making sure that we repay debt as the economy recovers, that we have limited new spending and offset new spending with savings and that we are very much focused on returning the economy to a situation where we are in the black as quickly as possible. Unless Senator Abetz has missed all the commentary, even from those who are critical of the budget, he will know that they acknowledge that that is the centrepiece of the government’s response: getting rid of our debt as quickly as possible and taking advantage of the strong economic position we find ourselves in as a result of the government’s effective management of the economy— (Time expired)

The budget sees this country repaying its debt faster than any of the other major industrialised economies. We will be debt free before all our competing major industrialised countries. We already have lower unemployment rates and we have less debt as a proportion of our economy, but this budget delivers the return to surplus three years early. It is repaying the debt that was accumulated as we protected Australian jobs. We stimulated the economy to protect Australian jobs. What people ought to focus on is the figure for unemployment projection—down to 4¾ per cent. That is a great result for Australians. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I do not know whether Senator Abetz is operating in a parallel universe to everybody else, but, as I reiterate, the key direction of the budget was an attempt to reduce the deficit as quickly as possible. We set out to do that, and we achieved that three years early. Three years earlier than expected last budget, the budget will be back in the black. So that has been the focus. I do not know what Senator Abetz has missed, but that is the clear focus. We have kept fiscal constraint on the budget, we have matched all new spending with savings and we have focused the return to economic growth on reducing the debt.

In the 2008-2009 budget, the Labor government forecast that this financial year we would have a surplus of $19.7 billion—that is a surplus. But they have delivered a record deficit of $57.1 billion—
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Joyce is entitled to be heard in silence.
—As I was saying, in 2008-2009 they said they would have a surplus of $19.7 billion. They have actually delivered a record deficit of $57.1 billion, and this government now expects us to believe a forecast of $1 billion in three years time. How can the Australian public give any credibility to what Labor states they will deliver, especially when these figures are built on the assumption of the best terms of trade in 60 years and they are made by a government with a record in blow-outs, including the $1.5 billion blow-out in the Building the Education Revolution and a complete lack of prudence and lack of value in the buildings that actually turned up.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I thank Senator Joyce for the question. He will forgive me if I do not take him terribly seriously when he quotes figures involving billions of dollars, but I have never sought to become finance minister myself. The opposition seem to be desperately searching around for an argument about debts without actually analysing the budget or analysing the reaction of all of the senior economic commentators on the budget. Everyone else recognises that the government is repaying the debt three years early. It is expected that we will see the budget return to surplus three years ahead of schedule in 2012-13, well before—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! If you want to debate the issue, the time for that is post question time.
—The budget will return to surplus three years ahead of schedule in 2012-13, well before any of the other major advanced economies. Senator Joyce seems to forget that we had a global financial crisis that severely impacted on all countries around the world and their financial positions. But what we now have as a result of this budget is that our debt position will be one which will see us return to surplus well before the other major advanced economies.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. On relevance, I direct the minister to the question that was asked. Can he please point to one Labor target that they have actually met and how can we possibly believe them?
—There is no point of order. Senator Evans.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Those on my right, Senator Evans is waiting to answer the question.
—As a result of the government’s management of the economy, we are actually going to exceed the previous forecast by bringing the debt level down three years early. We have also met a whole range of the targets we set. To fully offset all new spending is one of them. We kept the fiscal discipline in terms of new spending, which has allowed us to take advantage of the improving economy and pay off the debt quickly. That is very much meeting our commitment to fiscal constraint. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-05-12,"—Clearly, Senator Joyce continues to struggle to read the financial statements, which is worrying for a former accountant. As has been made clear, not only are we repaying the debt early, but we have met the commitments which we made, which were to fully offset all new spending. Sure, we have invested heavily in health and heavily in skills, because those are the priorities for the economy, but we have offset all new spending so that we can bring down the debt quickly. We have held real spending growth to less than two per cent a year when the economy is growing above trend. We have saved and not spent recovering revenues. That will allow us to return the budget back to surplus sooner. So we have invested new money in things like health and schools, which are priorities, but we have fully offset all new spending with savings and this has allowed us to bring the economy— (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I am not sure where the Liberal opposition have been in terms of analysing the budget, but what is clear is that the budget has focused on bringing us back into the black three years earlier than expected under the last budget. The whole focus of the budget is to reduce debt and to take advantage of the fact that our economy is recovering much quicker than other economies because this government invested during the global financial crisis. We acted early, and by acting early we protected Australian jobs. The great result from this budget is the projection that unemployment will fall to, I think, 4¾ per cent over earlier projections of it being around eight per cent. That is a great result because it means more Australians are in jobs. If we had not put the fiscal stimulus in place, thousands more Australians would have been out of work. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz), the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) and Senator Back today relating to the 2010-11 Budget.
I would like to make a few remarks about this Rudd government budget. This is just another big-taxing big-spending Labor budget—more debt, no hard decisions and no plan for real action. On the whole, this budget is uninspiring and has almost no unexpected announcements. It is totally unimaginative. It is a shameless deception, operating on the basis of new taxes and unrealistic expectations of the economy. It provides little in the way of benefits to the people of Australia. The budget confirms that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan are addicted to spending and are allergic to tough decisions. As I said, this is just another big-taxing big-spending Labor budget containing no serious reform.
The budget’s return to surplus is predicated on a great big new tax on Australia’s resources sector. This tax is a dagger in the heart of the Australian economy, putting major projects at risk and sending jobs offshore as well as weakening the superannuation of many thousands of average Australians whose superannuation funds have been invested in resource stocks. The Resource Super Profits Tax is a tax on so-called superprofits. There is no doubt in my mind that this supertax will kill the goose which has been laying the golden eggs for the Australian economy. The ALP likes to think that it was their stimulus package that saved Australia from recession, but it was not really that; it was China coming back into the resource sector in the second and third quarters of the last year and improving our balance of trade. If that had not happened, Australia would have gone into recession, notwithstanding any of the policies of the Rudd government. There is no doubt that what is happening in the resource sector with this supertax will mean that we will have projects not going ahead. We are going to see projects deferred and overall investment in mining decrease.
Already we have seen doubt cast over the $200 billion expansion of Olympic Dam, Santos deferring a decision on a $15 billion LNG export terminal in Gladstone, Xstrata suspending a $30 million regional exploration program, and Origin Energy predicting increases in domestic energy and fuel prices. All of that is a consequence of this budget of the Rudd government. In addition, we have levels of debt which now mean that the government has to pay something like $700 million a week for the next three years to cover the cost of the deficit. That in itself will put upward pressure on interest rates and the cost of living for Australian families. The cost of merely servicing our interest repayments is $4.6 billion in 2010-11 and it increases to $6.3 billion in 2011-12. The peak debt bill of $93.7 billion will be the amount owed by the Australian people to pay for Kevin Rudd’s spending spree.
The government is still spending $500 million on its flawed school halls program as well as on other programs from their flawed stimulus package. The government’s promise of a $661 million investment for skills rebadges the $601 million of existing spending, including a $456 million cut in the Productivity Places Program. Funding to trade-training centres in schools in this budget is set to be slashed considerably while we see the government spending millions and millions of dollars on unnecessary advertising for government services.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I would like to bring this debate back to some reality. The reality is that for a decade the previous Howard government allowed the opportunities for working families of this country to disappear.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—You were an incompetent government and an incompetent group of economic managers. You were a failure in every key economic indicator. All John Howard was about and all Peter Costello was about was the pork barrel at budget time. You frittered away the opportunities for Australia. You frittered away the future of many young Australians. You were incompetent. You failed to bring investment to this country. You failed to bring innovation to this country. You failed to increase productivity. You failed to develop this economy. You were a failure in economic management and you now have the hide to look at a government that is taking steps to build for the future and criticise this government.
To the Western Australian senators I have to say, ‘Don’t bow at the knees of the mining industry as much as you are doing.’ You should stand up for the rest of this country and the other workers in Western Australia who are not employed in the mining industry. If you look at this tax, it is a tax of fairness. This is the tax that is about bringing fairness into this country. In 2005-06 the mining industry had a profit of $30 billion and they paid $8 billion in taxes. In 2008-09 their profits were over $90 billion and what did they pay in taxes? They paid $11 billion. The coalition has got the gall to stand up there and say that ordinary Australian families should not share in the profits that the mining industry creates out of our resources—our resources! The resources do not belong to Clive Palmer and his ilk. The resources belong to the Australian people and those resources should be building for the future of this country.
I say clearly that any company that is not paying its fair share in taxes has to pay its fair share. You know that the mining companies are running a scare campaign aided and abetted by the coalition—a scare campaign to try to make sure that the big end of town and the mining industry can still have their mansions on the Swan River while ordinary workers are doing it tough trying to keep their heads above water. We want to make sure that ordinary workers get a fair share of the wealth of this country. The tax that we are implementing will build this country for the future. It will build a good society, something that you know nothing about. All your society means is that workers are subjected to Work Choices. What was the first stop for Senator Abetz? Down to the HR Nicholls Society to bend at the knees of the HR Nicholls Society and tell them what he was going to do. The HR Nicholls Society for Senator Abetz—first stop. Work Choices is there. Work Choices is in your back pocket. You know it is there. That is where you are going to come from.
It is about time the billionaires in the mining industry understand that a fair share is required for the rest of this country. We want decent health, education, infrastructure—something you lot never delivered over a decade of incompetence. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-05-12,"—It is easy to be fooled listening to that Scottish brogue as it rolls out platitudes about how the government is going to fix up the country. But it masks a dark heart, and one we have seen before: the dark heart of socialism. Socialism has failed all over the world, yet it is on the ascendancy in the Rudd government. Yesterday we saw Senator Cameron asking questions of Senator Carr. We have seen Senator Marshall asking questions. The socialists are on the march, and their mantra has not changed for decades. It is about finding something that makes money and creates jobs and prosperity and taxing the heart out of it. Mark my words: this is a government that is intent on finding those companies that dare make a profit and ripping the cash out of them to put back into its government, which has proven over and over again that it cannot manage public finances.
Let us put this in perspective. Senator Cameron attacks the record of the previous government. The Howard government took 10 years to pay back Labor’s $96 billion debt. The debt it took 10 years to pay back is what this government is going to rack up in the next two years.
—Which we’ll pay off in full.
—In two years Labor will exceed its previous high point, and already debt is at $78 billion. I note the interjection from Senator O’Brien about paying back the debt. Let us put this in perspective. In the next three years the government is allegedly going to have a $1 billion surplus. At that rate, it will take 450 years to pay off your nonsensical spending.
If you had not squandered billions of dollars on the pink batts program you could have doubled the surplus, because you are going to spend another billion dollars fixing up the disaster that no minister has been held accountable for. The minister responsible still sits at the cabinet table, getting his fat ministerial salary for nothing. Then there are the hundreds of millions of dollars which you have spent and wasted on your extreme climate change folly, which the minister did not even know was dumped by the all controlling and commanding socialist-in-chief, Kevin Rudd. She did not even know that it was going to be dumped. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered.
This is a government that is absolutely drunk on reckless spending. There is no doubt about that. It has not managed its expenditure. It only knows: ‘There’s something that’s profitable; we’ll grab the cash from it.’ The government dresses it up in public health measures, like it did with the alcopops tax, which did not see alcopops, or ready-to-drink drinks, consumption fall at all. The government says it is going to reduce the incidence of smoking by putting the price up. Will we see the same result as that of the failed alcopops policy? Probably. Now the government is going to go into the mining sector, which has been the driver of growth and wealth in our economy, and tax the heart out of that.
This is a government without a heart. It says it is going into bat for the people, but it is not. It has no plan to deal with the 500,000 people whose livelihoods are dependent on the mining industry in this country. Some of those jobs will go—make no mistake about it. We already know that industries are going to be closing up here. We know that they are going to move their exploration and mines offshore because they think it is a punitive tax regime.
Not all the people on the other side believe in this. There are some who have been shut down, although I will not call them economic conservatives. The reasonable people have been shut down because the extreme Left is on the march. The government might indeed trot out someone like Senator Hutchins or Senator Polley, people who should know better, to defend some nonsensical lines that have put out by the Rudd bureaucracy, or central casting, but the fact is their heart is not in it. We know the government’s heart is in closing down industry. We know that this government is going to spend $36½ million dollars in the next couple of years promoting a review of taxation of which it has implemented one of 138 measures. We also know the government is going to spend a further $126 million, including over $30 million in this financial year, advertising government programs like their climate change program. Remember that one? What happened to that? That was ditched without even Minister Wong knowing.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-05-12,"—Senator Bernardi has covered himself very well in this debate, but his shallowness has still been exposed. The word that I have used most since we came into government about those opposite is ‘hypocrisy’. They try to rewrite history. This is a budget for all Australians and it is a budget that all my colleagues in this chamber are very proud of. It is history making. Finally, after more than a decade, there is a federal government that is not about pork-barrelling. That was what Peter Costello, the former Treasurer, and John Howard were not about. This is a budget for the future.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz is the next big step to Work Choices mark 2. He is all about living in the past and what the Menzies government did. This government will not waste the opportunities or the resources that belong to the Australian people. We are actually reforming the economy. You talked about responsibility, Senator Bernardi; I think you will find that the Australian people are no longer fooled by you and those opposite in relation to economic sustainability and this country’s future. I am overjoyed at this opportunity to once again pick up on those opposite who want to rewrite history.
When we talk about the health reform that this government and the Prime Minister are undertaking, we have to talk about aged care. I think those opposite should hang their heads in shame at their record during almost 12 years in government when they neglected older Australians in aged care. You talk about our record; let us talk about the record of former minister Santo Santoro. How many ministers were there? There were six in four years and we can talk about kerosene baths. When we talk about aged care, I notice that those opposite are very quiet. I also note that Senator Humphries at least had the gumption not to take that question on aged care.
I want to put on record my congratulations to the Treasurer and to the leadership team for bringing forward a budget to sustain the long-term future of Australians, ensuring that all Australians share in the wealth and prosperity of this country. We are talking about investment in skills and apprenticeships, giving young men and women of this country the opportunity to have a start in life.
—They want jobs.
—Yes, having jobs because if we had taken the advice of those opposite during the global financial crisis, done as Senator Coonan advised and put our heads in the sand and just sat back and waited, what a mess this country would be in. The Rudd Labor government acted decisively to ensure that Australians kept their jobs. We invested in infrastructure, something that those opposite would know very little about from their more than 11½ very long years of neglect. It does not matter what area you talk about, whether it is health, ageing, investing in our schools or investing in skills and training, we are the ones who have set the agenda—
—Jobs.
—Yes, we are the ones, Senator Abetz, that have ensured that Australians have retained their jobs. We will continue to do that, to ensure that all Australians have access to the profits from the resources of this country—resources that all Australians own not just the top end of town and those with shares, although there is nothing wrong with having shares in mining companies. When we come to superannuation, let us not forget that once again it was a Labor government that introduced superannuation. Those opposite, the Liberal coalition, would not even agree to the fact that Australian workers deserve the right to have superannuation. It is imperative for this country that everyone has access to superannuation and that all young Australians are encouraged to invest in their superannuation to ensure that they have a good standard of living as they reach their twilight years and can be self-sufficient.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-05-12,"—I am amazed by the gumption of the government. This government that has run up a level of debt that was unprecedented two years ago walked into the building yesterday and claimed credit for that debt being $50 billion less than it otherwise would have been only 12 months ago but three times what it would have been two years ago. Why is it that whenever we hear the word ‘reform’ from this government, every taxpayer in Australia has to reach for their wallet or in this case, with Labor’s mining supertax, to reach for their superannuation? It is because this government is incapable of taking a difficult decision.
Not only does this government lack the ticker of Hawke, Keating or Peter Walsh, it also lacks the albeit flawed philosophical commitment of Whitlam. Since this government announced its mining supertax, this government has channelled Rex Connor. We have had the Prime Minister with his xenophobic campaign against foreign investment running around to try and justify his mining supertax, the same foreign investment which this budget counts on. Of course, there is one big difference between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and Rex Connor and that is that Rex Connor only wanted to borrow $5 billion, he did not want to borrow $150 billion. Secondly, Rex Connor saw development as good. He tried to facilitate the development of Australia’s resources whereas this government is trying to kill it.
A decade ago, when the previous coalition government undertook the most drastic tax reform—the most significant Australia had seen since World War II—it convinced the states to abolish a raft of taxes and reduce other taxes—promises that many of them have not followed through—and it cut income tax rates. The catchcry was: ‘It is not a new tax, it is a new tax system’. Under this government, the Labor Party, it is not a new tax system; it is just a new tax. This is a tax on our most productive export sector; a tax on that sector which did more than most to get Australia through the global recession, the sector that is most exposed to growth in our own region. This government has done to the sector what it has done to everything else—whether health care or the so-called education revolution—it has created the illusion of reform. By throwing around words like ‘reform’ and ‘revolution’ often enough it seems to think they will eventuate. But it takes no difficult decisions.
There are no real spending cuts in this budget, despite what they may say. The two per cent real growth cap represents a substantial increase in government expenditure of over $40 billion over the forward estimates. Government is getting significantly larger. In every sense this is a state Labor budget in spirit and in practice. It has rubbery forecasts. It has massive increases in expenditure and any semblance of claimed financial responsibility is based on one thing only and that is a dramatic increase in taxation. All the promises are on the never-never. The surplus is never today, it is never tomorrow, it is always after the next election, just like it is for every state Labor government when you see increases in taxes and massive failures in services. This surplus is illusory. Let us put it in context. At $1 billion allegedly in three years time, it is less than one-third of one per cent of government expenditure. That is a rounding error, a typographical error, a $1 billion surplus out of a $350 billion budget. That is not going to happen, it is an illusion.
I recall when the former Treasurer Paul Keating promised he was ‘bringing home the bacon’. There was a small surplus promised, although in real terms it was larger than what this government is promising. He said he was ‘bringing home the bacon’. This was just before he put the budget into such massive deficit that it took the last coalition government a decade to pay it off. Labor then ran up tens of billions of dollars of debt for the same reason: no discipline in spending and an inability to take difficult decisions.
But there are a few things in this budget that I am sure the Labor Party’s trade union mates will be proud of. I did pick up last night that there is a $10 million grant to the trade unions for the Trade Union Education Foundation. The government, of course, will just try to slip that in on a page of the budget: $10 million to the paymasters. It is nice to know they are doing well, but future Australian taxpayers will pay for a long time.

That the Senate—
notes that:
under the agreement reached between the Commonwealth Government and the states, stimulus funding under the Government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan is to be additional to existing state spending efforts,
as part of its inquiry into the Primary Schools for the 21st Century school building program, the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee is seeking to ensure that states and territories have maintained their planned spending on primary schools and have not reduced their spending as a consequence of receiving stimulus funding through the Government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan,
the committee received evidence in November 2009 that maintenance of spending effort is being monitored through quarterly reports by the states and territories to Heads of Treasury,
the committee wrote to the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury (Dr Ken Henry) in December 2009 requesting copies of these quarterly reports,
the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury wrote back to the committee, also in December 2009, declining to provide the reports on the basis that to do so would not be in the public interest as it would damage relations between the Commonwealth and the states, but noting that a decision on whether to provide the reports was ultimately a matter for the Treasurer (Mr Swan),
the committee then wrote to the Treasurer on 8 February 2010, noting its disagreement with the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury’s assessment that provision of the reports would damage relations between the Commonwealth and the states, and requesting provision of the quarterly reports by no later than 26 February 2010,
having received no formal response, the committee again wrote to the Treasurer on 15 March 2010, asking that the reports be provided by 26 March 2010,
when the Treasurer finally responded to the committee’s correspondence on 20 April 2010, he refused the committee’s request on the basis that to release the quarterly reports (either publicly or in camera) could reasonably be expected to cause damage to relations with the states and would therefore not be in the public interest, and
the committee continues to disagree with the grounds advanced by the Treasurer for failing to provide the reports, for the following reasons:
if all states and territories have complied with the requirement to maintain their spending effort, the committee does not see how any damage could be caused by providing evidence to confirm this fact,
if any state or territory has not complied with the requirement to maintain its funding effort, it is an explicit feature of the National Partnership Agreement on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan that such a failure may be made public, and
state and territory capital spending on schools will ultimately be made public through various budget papers and reports and the committee is merely seeking this information in a more timely fashion in order to progress its current inquiry; and

That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Wong, by 13 May 2010, the following documents relating to the shortfin and longfin mako shark and the porbeagle shark during and since December 2008 when those species were listed on the United Nations Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (the convention):
all briefings from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (the department) to the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts in relation to the listings on the convention and subsequently in relation to listing the species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; and
any briefings and advice received by the department or the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts from scientific experts or bodies or other government departments in relation to those three species.",SENATE,<title>MAKO/PORBEAGLE SHARK FISHING</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-05-12,"—by leave—The briefings being requested by Senator Siewert constitute advice to the minister with respect to his deliberations and the carrying out of his functions under the EPBC Act and, in accordance with the long-standing practice of all Australian governments, this should not be provided before tabling.
It is also appropriate to note that Senator Siewert was twice offered, as I understand it, a full departmental briefing on these matters by Minister Garrett’s office—verbally by her adviser on Monday 10 May and by email from Minister Garrett’s chief of staff yesterday. To date, I am advised she has declined to take up these offers.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-05-12,"—It is quite evident that we are now in a twilight zone where we are once more sucked into believing the Labor Party, who told us, merely a couple of years ago, that today we would be experiencing a surplus of about $17 billion. Yet now we have before us a $57.1 billion deficit. That is what they have delivered. In raw terms, that is a record. We have never had a deficit bigger than that. The question that people rightly ask is: how did we get ourselves this problem? We have $140 billion in gross debt. Even the Labor Party admit we are heading towards $222 billion in gross debt. If we put on top of that the state debts, which are predominantly debts that the Labor governments have brought about, we are starting to get into real problems.
The Labor government make statements that they are going to hit a target, but when it comes to money they never do. They can never hit the target when it comes to money because they lack the acumen; they lack the capacity for cost control. Of course, one key example that all Australians are aware of is the ceiling insulation program. It was pathos. It was so hopeless, such a stuff-up, that it will go down in the annals of our nation’s his-tory. To think that we could conduct a program that burnt down in excess of 120 houses; that has been responsible for the deaths of at least four people—and we suspect more; and that is going to cost in the vicinity of $1 billion to fix up! They only spent $1.5 billion of the money. It is an example of how the Labor government have no concept of the value of money or the capacity to control costs.
Then we had Building the Education Revolution. Where do these terms come from—these ‘revolutions’, these ‘wars’? They are emotive statements, but the government lack the acumen and the diligence to sit down and really control costs. That is not sexy but it is absolutely essential, and it has been missed.
We now have discretionary expenditure in excess of $90 billion. This is why Australia is so much in debt. And this massive problem is now forcing up interest rates and causing real problems out there in the general economy.
The Labor Party blow-outs just go on and on, even if we go down to the minutiae. Do you remember them talking about computers—the toolboxes of the 21st century—as they earnestly held them in their hands and said they were going to deliver that outcome? What do we have? They were going to provide a million of them. I think 220,000 of the million were delivered and the budget has blown out by a billion dollars. Everywhere you look you find examples where things are coming unstuck.
Now they tell us that, as we go forward, we are to be impressed by the fact that they will be borrowing only in excess of $700 million a week. That is supposed to be a good outcome. This cannot go on. As I have said all along, if we go on like this then something has to snap. A rational conversation with any person who has been dealing with money would tell you that things just cannot go on like this.
Let’s look at the opportunities we could have had. They have just talked about rail infrastructure. What sort of rail infrastructure do we have? They have announced a billion-dollar upgrade on rail, I acknowledge that, but what happened to inland rail? What happened to the capacity to really drive projects that would make the Australian people proud; that would actually take trucks, such as the 1,600 trucks that go through Moree each day, off the road? What happened to that vision? When it comes to infrastructure, this crowd are about as exciting as a jam sandwich. If it does not fall off the back of a truck, to be bolted together in a schoolyard, they just do not know how to do it. When it does happen like that, they end up paying three times the price. We have had the Labor Party blow-outs on GroceryWatch and on Fuelwatch—those voyeuristic endeavours—but what did those programs deliver? We get the bill but we never get the outcome.
Minister Wong is in charge of a department that has in excess of 400 staff, but they do not have a job. What goes on in there? They must have discussions about philosophy or issues for a higher intellect. What is going on in that department? What is its purpose? We have a health department with in excess of 5,000 employees and not one patient. These issues might not be sexy but they are the reason the Labor Party have got us into so much debt and created so many problems. These problems are going to become manifest and, as we go on, the Australian people are going to have to ask themselves a very serious question: can we afford to leave the Labor Party there for another three years? How will we get on top of this debt if we do not deal with the issues they have brought about? What on earth is the process for dealing with it?
In the budget papers, the Labor Party have put out the idea of nirvana. They would have it that there is a nirvana out there at a time when, to be honest, Mr Rudd will not even be the Prime Minister. He certainly will not be the leader of the Labor Party. They push their solutions to a point you cannot nail them down to, then they run—and they have been quite successful in getting the media to laud them—at a position that is not even imminent. Australia has to have a retrospective on the promises about delivery that they have made in the past and where we actually are now, and it must judge its client—being the Labor Party—on that basis: what they promised, what they delivered and how much we actually paid for it.
If you really want to look at it, let us look at the minutiae of some of these things. The other day, I went to Manilla Public School—$1.807 million for two demountables that were bolted together on the site. For $1.807 million, I imagine most Australians would expect a pretty fancy sort of house—we are talking tiles, we are talking a pool, we are talking a tennis court. What this school in regional New South Wales got was two demountables bolted together. Remember: they did not have to buy the land, the land was already there. They came off the back of a truck. They were constructed in a factory in Newcastle. This goes to show you where Australia is coming unstuck. We have to have this honest discussion with the Australian people about exactly what is happening to them. We know that one in 10 principals say that the projects they got they did not want or did not need or were overpriced. We have P&Cs saying, ‘If you had only given us the opportunity to have a greater say in what we got, then we would have got better value for money.’
After the brouhaha about the apparently miraculous $1 billion surplus three years out, I would put my left one on it that that is not going to happen. I have seen this line and I can assure you that that is just not going to happen. We could all talk about it and it could be a wonderful discussion piece, but can you honestly believe this crowd, which has not delivered a surplus since, I think, 1990—I stand to be corrected on that, but I think that was the last one they did?
The coalition, for all the problems people have—we were mean or we were this or we were that—delivered surpluses 10 out of 12 years. An accountant judging their clients would say: ‘This is the sort of client that I want to run the books. That is the client I just do not want anywhere near the chequebook because they have not got a clue.’ The Australian people are coming to terms with that. They are saying, ‘We really are starting to doubt where you are off to.’
The latest one—which just takes the cake—is the nationalisation of the mining industry. So help me! Where did that idea come from? How did that one manage to make it through? You are now going to basically take ownership of 40 per cent of the mining industry—taking up 40 per cent of the revenues and accepting 40 per cent of course of their costs. This is ‘Castro Kevin’ at his best. There is a peculiarity that has come into this.
Do you think for one moment that, now you have a 58 per cent tax rate on mining companies, you might have a slight problem with vertically integrated companies that work across nation boundaries? Do you think that a fully state-owned enterprise from overseas is not going to move its profits, even though it might operate here, back to a more sensible and favourable taxing regime? I expect to find in this budget a huge allocation for the Australian tax office, because they are going to be very busy boys and ladies chasing around the money that is going to go hell west and crooked but is never actually going to be nailed down—it is the blow-outs, it is the costs, it is the waste and it is the bill that is left for the Australian people. What we got from you guys is about as exciting as a jam sandwich.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,29,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I have to congratulate the opposition today for having the audacity to move this motion. The day after Treasurer Wayne Swan brought down a budget that has been widely praised for its fiscal responsibility and that forecasts a drop in government spending as a proportion of GDP, those opposite want to lecture the Labor government for so-called reckless spending. The day after the budget in which the Treasurer announced cuts to the rate of company taxes for Australian small business and also announced measures to simplify the Australian taxation system for Australian taxpayers, the opposition want to criticise this government for so-called high taxation. To be moving this motion today, takes cheek of a very high order.
Far from criticising the government on the issues of spending and taxation, the Senate ought to be congratulating the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for having brought down a budget which manages to be fiscally very prudent while providing increased investment in areas of high priority, particularly health. Such a high level of responsibility in an election year is very rare indeed—and certainly unknown during the Howard-Costello-Abbott government, when election year budgets were notorious for an orgy of pork-barrelling in marginal coalition electorates, for continuing extensions of middle-class welfare and for unaffordable tax cuts for the already well-off. You will recall that Prime Minister Howard very famously in 2004 managed to spend $94 million a minute during his election speech. It was a Prime Minister who never feared to spend taxpayers’ dollars to get himself re-elected.
The economic data which the Treasurer tabled last night confirms the basic facts about our economic situation, facts which the opposition is doing its very best to ignore. This data confirm that Australia is recovering from the global economic downturn more rapidly than expected and more rapidly than virtually any other country. The budget forecasts are a return to surplus in 2012-13—three years earlier than anticipated as growth returns to trend. The budget also tells us that unemployment has fallen and will continue to fall—something that those opposite do not seem to be very interested in.
At the time of last year’s budget, the unemployment rate was rising and was forecast to peak at 8.5 per cent. Let me remind those opposite that today we have a five per cent unemployment rate. Furthermore, that rate is falling. Meanwhile, France has an unemployment rate of 10 per cent; the United States, 9.7 per cent; the United Kingdom, eight per cent; Germany, 7.5 per cent; and New Zealand, 7.3 per cent. We have a record in this critically important area that we can be very proud of indeed. As we have seen in recent weeks, the economic crisis in Europe is far from over and unemployment will keep rising in most of those European countries as their economies continue to lag. The US economy is still in a very fragile state. We are almost alone in having returned to growth and in having excellent prospects of continuing growth. As the Treasurer rightly said last night, we have an economic and fiscal position which is the envy of the developed world.
Let me remind the opposition of some more facts. During 2009, the advanced economies, taken as a group, saw their economies contract by over three per cent, while Australia grew by 1.4 per cent with only a single quarter of negative growth. If the 1991 recession was the recession we had to have, then Wayne Swan can take the credit for this being the recession we did not have. It is also the recession we could have had. According to Treasury, without the government stimulus measures we would have gone backwards by 0.7 per cent during 2009. Also, thanks to the government stimulus measures, our recovery from the downturn has been more rapid than predicted. This time last year the forecasts for the 2009-10 financial year was negative growth of 0.5 per cent. Now we expect the figure to be a positive growth number of two per cent.
None of this happened by accident. It happened partly because of continuing high demand for our exports from China and other Asian countries, and no-one will deny that, least of all us. But it also happened because of the bold, rapid and well-targeted response of the Rudd government to the global financial crisis. When the crisis struck in September 2008, the government acted boldly and quickly, on the best economic advice, to stimulate the economy to preserve jobs and save businesses from bankruptcy. The advice from the Secretary of Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, said, ‘Go early, go hard, go households,’ and that is what this government did.

Senator Fifield interjecting—

—The fact is that the opposition wants Australia to forget that they opposed our stimulus measures. Those opposite voted against our investments in infrastructure and against our schools building program. As we can now see very clearly, it was those projects that have served to preserve over 200,000 jobs and save thousands of small businesses from bankruptcy. If those opposite had had their way, unemployment would now be at eight or even 10 per cent, as was forecast when the crisis first struck and as is now the case in many comparable countries. The opposition criticises our stimulus spending but ignores the fact that 70 per cent of the government’s stimulus spending consisted of investments in infrastructure, projects that the previous government failed to fund because it was too busy wasting money on regional rorts and middle-class welfare for its own supporters. The Rudd government’s stimulus consisted of investment in roads, rail, ports and bridges—investments that will pay for themselves over the coming decades through higher productivity. As we can now see, it was that prompt response which kept this country out of recession, preserved Australian jobs and preserved Australian businesses.
Let us look at the allegation by the opposition that this is a high-taxing government. This assertion is just plain wrong. This government cut income tax in its first budget, as we said we would during the 2007 election campaign, and we have not increased income tax in subsequent budgets. At this budget, we are delivering the third instalment of those income tax cuts. This year’s cut is worth $450 a year for someone earning $50,000 a year. As Tim Colebatch pointed out in this morning’s Melbourne Age, income tax on individuals as a share of GDP is at a 40-year low. In this budget we are cutting company tax by two per cent, from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, to help give further assistance to Australian small businesses.
When one looks at the facts, when one looks at the history, one can see that those opposite are relying on tired slogans and stereotypes. It might suit them well. It might be comfortable for them to complain about the fact that Labor is the party of big government and big taxation, but the facts tell a very different story. The facts tell a story that when you were in office the rise of big government conservatism was in full flight. We had a Prime Minister who in an election speech spent $94 million a minute desperately paying off every single interest group he could lay his hands on. I am sure Senator Fifield, if he was ever struck with a bout of honesty, would be able to stand up in this place and tell us some hair-curling stories about a Treasurer who desperately tried to prevail on a Liberal Prime Minister to spend less, who desperately tried to prevail on John Howard to protect the Australian taxation base rather than fritter it away in his extravagant promises and in his orgy of pork-barrelling. These are the stories Senator Fifield could give us if he was so inclined and I would encourage him to do so.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Feeney, I ask you to address your remarks through the chair, and I ask other senators to respect the fact that Senator Feeney has the floor.
—When one looks at the facts the truth is that the Labor Party has become the party of responsible economic management in this country. It is the Labor Party that has the true claim, here and now, to be the fiscal conservatives of this country. In our very first budget Treasurer Swan produced a $21 billion surplus—a $21 billion surplus that was immediately subjected to the sabotage of coalition senators in this place. It is the Rudd Labor government that has followed the orthodox, proper advice about how to handle the global financial crisis. It is the Labor Party that produced a stimulus package that was consistent with orthodox economic thinking and it was those opposite who opposed the stimulus. It was those opposite who would rather have plunged this country into recession and abandon their own tired slogans and preconditions.
Even when considering climate change, it was the Labor Party that looked for market mechanisms to produce that important reform this country needed and it was those opposite who once again went back to the tired old solutions of non-market action, non-market mechanisms and big government. So put the tired slogans aside when looking at the history and the facts. It is easy to see that those opposite in fact are not the party of small government and they are not the party of low taxation. Their record in office tells a very different story. In fact, we can see it in an article that was produced in the spring of 2006 in the journal Policy. The article, titled ‘The Rise of Big Government Conservatism’, finished with this spectacular bit of data:
Even in the traditional areas of social democratic spending, emphasis—

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-05-12,"—When Senator Feeney called upon me to be honest, I would like to think that I am disarmingly honest. Let me share something with the chamber. That contribution by Senator Feeney must have absolutely killed the good senator because he put in a very spirited defence of the Prime Minister, and it is well known that Senator Feeney and the Prime Minister are not the closest of colleagues. I commend him for the team game that he played there. A couple of weeks ago I was on Sky against my regular sparring partner, Mark Butler. For those colleagues who do not know Mr Butler, he is a very lovely man.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the senator should refer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide by his proper title.
 (Senator Barnett)—I take the point of order and Mr Butler is appropriate.
—Mr Butler was looking forward to the budget. He described the budget in these terms:
So this will be a very important budget for the future of Australians. A sort of budget that I think people expect to see from a Labor government and didn’t see under the previous government.
Mr Butler was right: this is the sort of budget that people expect to see from a Labor government. It is a high-taxing and high-spending budget characterised by debt and deficit. Mr Butler was also right to say that this is not the sort of budget that you used to see from the coalition. He was absolutely spot-on. The previous government, and I do not want to overstate our case, was not perfect. Out of our 12 budgets, we delivered 10 surpluses. We were not perfect. We had to pay off a little bit of debt, $96-odd billion in our first budget. That was a bit beyond our control.
But I have to give credit where credit is due. The current government have a perfect score: three budgets, three deficits. You have to give them that. You cannot take that away from them. When we were in office, the guessing game at each budget used to be: how big will the surplus be? We have a different guessing game under the current government: how big will the budget deficit be? The government say: ‘We ought to be congratulated. Let’s break out the champagne, because in 2010-11 the budget deficit isn’t going to be $56 billion or $57 billion. No, it’s only going to be $40 billion, so let’s break out the champagne.’ Senator Feeney was saying the government ought to be congratulated. That is the new game.
This government’s budget narrative essentially has three parts, which I do not agree with. The three parts are: this government steered Australia through the global financial crisis; this government imposed fiscal discipline; this government has charted a course to surplus—and the associated media commentary now is that debt and deficit are no longer serious political and policy issues. Each proposition is wrong. The first one, that the government saved Australia from recession, is not true. What saved Australia were world-class prudential regulation, courtesy of the previous government; a strong asset position, courtesy of the previous government; a better fiscal starting position—that is, no debt—courtesy of the previous government. It was also thanks to a resources boom and the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy.
The government wanted to look like they were doing something, so they embarked upon the third biggest fiscal stimulus in the world: three per cent of GDP. The government want us to believe that it is the fiscal stimulus that made the difference. If that were the case, the UK and the US would not have gone into recession, because the fiscal stimulus would have stopped it. We faced a very different circumstance to that faced by the US and Europe. The editorial in today’s Australian says:
Ultimately, capitalism has been much kinder to Kevin Rudd than he has been to it. The politician who, in his essayistic period, babbled about the failure of the “great neo-liberal experiment”, did not sufficiently trust the automatic stabilisers of the open Australian economy, and its fundamental strengths, when trouble struck two years ago. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have generally been poor judges of the economic cycle.
So we do not owe thanks to the government for saving us from the recession. I will have the good grace just to focus on the quantum of the stimulus rather than its profile or quality. I will not focus on the junk spending, other than to say that I think every one of those stimulus signs on school fences around Australia will actually be a reminder to voters as they walk past of the government’s recklessness.
The second flawed proposition is that of the government’s fiscal discipline. Exhibit 1: in 2009-10 the budget deficit will be a peacetime record of $57 billion—three budgets, three deficits, as we know—not exactly what I would call a fiscal straitjacket. Exhibit 2: claimed savings of $30 billion over four years. This government has invented the new concept that you count new revenue measures as savings, an interesting concept. Of the $30 billion in savings, half is from new revenue: the increase in the tobacco excise and the increase in the mining tax. New taxes do not represent fiscal restraint; they demonstrate weakness and policy sloth.
In relation to savings, the most absurd statement I have heard in support of the concept of Labor’s fiscal constraint came from the Treasurer himself, who said, ‘What you are not seeing is the money we are not spending.’ So the government now have to be given credit for spending commitments that they have not made. It is a weird concept that you count, as savings, programs which you have not embarked upon. That is a seriously weird one. I am not quite getting my head around that one. Exhibit 3: spending in this budget will increase by $26 billion over the next three years, relative to last year’s record spending forecast. Exhibit 4: the government are going to be borrowing $700 million a week. Exhibit 5: government debt is going to be $94 billion in 2012-13. Exhibit 6: the interest bill will be $6.5 billion.
The third proposition of this government is that it has charted a course to surplus. Wrong. What has led to this forecast surplus are parameter changes, stronger growth, stronger recovery, new taxes on tobacco and mining and heroic assumptions. This government operates on the assumption that, the more you tax and the more you hit an industry like mining, the more revenue you get and the more it grows. This budget also assumes no new spending between now and 2014. It is a con, it is a hoax and it will not happen.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,29,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-05-12,"—It is interesting to see the opposition stripped of the excellent advice and support they had from Treasury and other government departments during the time that they were in government. Now that they are in opposition, we hear the quality of their economic expertise. While not claiming a great deal of economic expertise myself, I think I have the commonsense to understand how illogical the opposition’s position on the economy now is. They continue to say what is obviously untrue—that is, that no stimulus spending was required as a result of the global financial crisis. The opposition voted against the stimulus and have continued to rail against the stimulus spending. The result of that spending is now Australia finds itself in a period where the government’s fiscal position plus the stabilising factors that Senator Fifield quite rightly outlined—good prudential regulation et cetera—helped Australia come through the global financial crisis in a good position. Australia is in a good position to take advantage of what growth there is around the world—in China and other Asian economies and so on. As Budget Paper No. 1 says:
A prolonged period of financial sector balance sheet repair and fiscal consolidation will act as a drag on recovery in the advanced economies.
But that is not placing a drag on our recovery because we are in a good position to take advantage of that recovery and advance further as an economy. The opposition continually ignore what is happening elsewhere in the world. I think they should look at chart 2 on page 111 of the budget overview that shows government net debt for Australia and the G7 and they will see the minuscule position that Australia occupies in that chart compared with Canada, Germany, the UK, France, the US, Italy and Japan. It would be clear to anyone that what they are saying today is complete nonsense. They are trying to paint Australia’s debt position as being appalling. We are in a very good position compared with other world economies.
What the government has done is not sit on its laurels and let the economy recover. The laurels the government sits on are to get through the global financial crisis without ever going into a technical recession. But rather than stop there and allow the recovery to continue to lift Australia’s economic position, the government has sat down and looked at the future, how we might even more consolidate our position and set ourselves up for the future—that is, by doing what the previous government failed to do, to use our economy and the natural advantages we have to ensure that Australia goes into the future with better prospects for every Australian.
One of the ways to do that is to reassess the way that our resources are taxed. We had a resources spending boom by the last government which was one of the things that enabled the series of surpluses for the previous government. Did the previous government use those surpluses to provide for other industries in the future, to provide for projections into the future to ensure our future regardless of what happened to those resources? No, they did not think of the future.
This government, through the proposed resources rent tax, proposes to use the resources that we have in Australia to fund infrastructure, skills training and a reduction in company tax. Why? Because it is very important that we reduce company tax and some of the drags on growth and productivity so that other industries will build up to take the place of those resources industries if the cycle turns down again. It is very clear in the Henry report that our actual rate of return from the resources sector under the ad valorum type taxes we have was going down. We were also not encouraging those industries that were marginal because the tax rate on the amount of ore or mineral produced discouraged those mines that had high costs. The resources rent tax will readjust that to ensure that those mines that were perhaps a bit too difficult because of the costs of starting up will now have those costs taken away. They will not have a big imposition of costs until they are producing product that enables them to get into the supertax area.
This is a just, sensible, fair and reasonable way of approaching resources and the much higher prices for various minerals and ores in recent years. There is no reason our country should not take advantage of the greater profits from that, not just to spend willy-nilly, but also to ensure that the future of Australia is secure by encouraging other industries and the vital infrastructure that we have so badly needed in this country for so long. It is very clear that this government is looking to the future.
One of the aspects that reinforce the fact that Labor governments usually look to the future is that part of the budget looks to increase savings through superannuation, so the superannuation guarantee charge will go up from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is one of the other aspects that have been helpful to Australia, as compared to the countries of Europe and many other countries. We now have in superannuation a huge saving pool that ensures that, as we have an ageing population, we are not as badly off as many other countries around the world. We have this pool of savings that we never used to have because people were not in a position to save privately, except for the few wealthy people. So this is a well-thought pattern of readjustment to this economy that should serve Australia well into the future.
But what do we see from the opposition? Plans to oppose it at every step—plans to oppose the resource rent tax. It was a knee-jerk reaction. I think many people around Australia are beginning to see that the resource rent tax might be a very sensible adjustment to the way we tax in this country. I think that, as we go along and people digest exactly what this resource rent tax is about, they will come to see that that is a practical way to go to ensure our future.
The opposition’s threat to derail the government’s budget will not serve them well in the forthcoming election, I think. The attitude of the opposition—to simply oppose every measure taken by the government, to nitpick and to pick holes in government policy without proposing any reasonable policies of their own—will not sit well with the Australian public. I think this government has demonstrated why it is Labor governments that have been able to introduce the reforms—financial, fiscal and structural reforms—that the country has needed in the past—the reforms, in fact, that the Howard government used to produce the surpluses that Senator Fifield talked about.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,29,1,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-05-12,"—I also rise today to speak in the matter of public importance debate on the recklessly spending, high-taxing Rudd Labor government. It has been less than 24 hours since their latest budget was handed down, and over that period—we heard it this afternoon, we heard it earlier today during question time and we have heard it from most of the senior members of the Labor government—they have been crowing and pushing the message that they are paying off the debt, or at least getting back into surplus, three years earlier. They certainly make it sound to the Australian public as if they are paying off the debt three years early, but what they are talking about is bringing the budget back into surplus three years early. ‘Three years earlier than what?’ I ask.
—Treasury forecasts, actually.
—Treasury forecasts—exactly. Now we have Treasury forecasts saying that there will be a surplus three years earlier, and the government are out there trumpeting that. But why are we in a situation where we have a deficit? The fact remains that this government is tackling a mess of its own making. In the light of the global financial crisis which hit the world a couple of years ago, there is no doubt that this government overreacted by putting together a massive stimulus package, or series of stimulus packages, that with the benefit of hindsight everybody would have to agree were too large, involved poor-quality spend and have gone for too long. How ridiculous it is that we heard last night that the Building the Education Revolution spending will continue into the 2012 year, four years after we had one quarter of negative growth. Can anybody in this place honestly tell me that we need to continue stimulus spending four years after the global financial crisis in order to keep us out of trouble? I think it is a pretty long bow to draw.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—We have Senator Sterle over there saying, ‘Are you going to stop the spending in the schools?’ That is not an economic reason for continuing the stimulus package; that is a political reason. The government have gone out and promised all these new buildings for schools, and they have to keep on doing it four years after the threat has passed. They keep on spending not because there is still an economic need to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy but because they have promised it and they cannot afford politically not to deliver it. That comes with consequences, because we have to keep on borrowing money to pay for that. Continuing to spend as the economy recovers also adds inflationary pressure, which ultimately leads to added pressure for interest rates.
The fact is that this government inherited the best economy in the world. We so often hear the government comparing our current situation and how well we are doing to the situation in the rest of the world. But you just have to take a step back and look at how we were placed when we went into the global financial crisis. We were the best in the world at that point. We had the lowest unemployment rate. We had more money in the bank. We were consistently delivering surpluses. If we had not been in that situation, the spend that the government did, as large and as poor quality as it was, would not have delivered the results that it did. What is more, they would not have had the flexibility to be able to do massive stimulus spending on the projects that they did. They just would not have had the available funds or the money in the bank. They would not have been able to have the notional $21 billion surplus that they were supposed to deliver in their first budget to be able to spend on it, because they just would not have had that opportunity. If they had not gone into it as well as they did, they would not be coming out as well as they are now. We as a nation are very lucky that this government inherited an economy in the shape that it did. It is the height of hypocrisy to say now that they are somehow doing well because they got us out of the mess more quickly than they thought they could.
If this government were really serious about getting us out of the debt situation and putting us back in surplus, it would make the tough decisions. This year we are going to come in over $50 billion in deficit. The government is predicting that in the coming financial year we will be $40.8 billion in deficit. If this government were really serious about getting us out of debt, it would make the tough decisions and they would be in this budget. There would be serious savings. The government would be making tough decisions to cut spending and have us back in surplus in this coming year, not the year after. Get serious: if you really want to do it, do it now, show us and make tough decisions. There is not one tough decision in this budget.
Another interesting fact in respect of the $40.8 billion that is due to be the deficit in the coming year and the $1 billion surplus the year after that is that, if you get into the budget and have a look at it a bit, you can see that there is an awful lot of spending that would normally have occurred in the following year—the year when we are going to have the $1 billion surplus, so they claim—but that has been brought forward by a year. Sure, it pushes up your $40.8 billion deficit in the coming year, but what it means is that the government can get their $1 billion surplus the year after. It is a very nice little trick, that one: move $10 billion or $15 billion forward a year. It fattens out the next year, but you are ignoring that, because you can now say, ‘We’ll be in surplus three years early.’ It is a nice little trick.
It is important to remember also that this out of debt line, as I mentioned, refers to annual budget. It is not the net debt position. We are not going to be out of debt as a nation for close to another 10 years, even on the heroic and positive assumptions that are built into this budget. Sure, in accordance with this budget, we will be in surplus three years early—if you believe everything we are told. But it is a lot longer than that before we actually get out of debt. There is still going to be close to $100 billion net debt that has to be paid off, and that is still accumulating now. As Senator Fifield said, we are borrowing $700 million a week: $100 million a day is being added to our debt as we stand here and speak. I hate to think how much money we have had to borrow just in the few minutes that I have been standing here speaking.
There is no doubt that under the Rudd Labor government Australia is rapidly heading towards new records—new highs and new lows. But the records that they are looking to set are not ones that Kevin Rudd and those sitting opposite should be proud of. On the contrary, this Labor government should be ashamed of the direction in which it has taken the nation. Sitting right at the front of the government’s historic achievements in this regard is the new record that they are setting as the biggest-spending government of all time. They claim they will return us to surplus, but the budget deficit this coming year, with a massive $40.8 billion, is the second-biggest ever—only beaten by the one they are delivering this year.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rudd Labor Government</title>,Matters of Public Importance,29,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-05-12,"—I think this debate from the other side has been absolutely enlightening. I would like to talk about the budget, but before that: all we used to hear in here from 24 November 2007 onward was how great Peter Costello was—‘the great Peter Costello,’ and, ‘Thank you, Mr Costello’. Isn’t it absolutely amazing that since the sabres were brought out late last year and the Liberal leadership was executed and replaced with Mr Abbott we do not hear about Mr Costello any more.
Why do we not hear about Mr Costello? I would be very interested to get Senator Fifield’s feel on this one, because I think they were pretty good mates and good supporters of each other. But, quite clearly, no mention of Peter Costello: why? Let us think what Peter Costello said about Mr Abbott when he gained the leadership of the Liberal Party—
—Peter is still in our warm embrace!
—Please, Senator Fifield, correct me through the chair if I am wrong: I think it was that he was incompetent in economics and he would not have him as his deputy. Then Mr Abbott went on to say something about condemning the Rudd stimulus package—of which $42 billion went to infrastructure—that we should have the same as New Zealand.
Now his deputy, Ms Bishop, said we should just sit back and wait—even the deputy could not have a decent contribution to the debate. But let us go back to New Zealand, shall we? No stimulus package—beauty! No worries: five consecutive quarters in recession. Mr Abbott said, ‘Let’s do what New Zealand did’.
—But they’ve been recovering from a Labour government!
—Not only would there be five consecutive quarters of recession but unemployment, Senator Fifield, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, is hovering around 7.3 per cent. But if I am wrong I am sure Senator Fifield will come to the defence of the leader of the Liberal Party, a person who just thinks that economics is boring. It just says it all Anyway, we do not hear a lot. I am not hearing a lot over there now, so I must be on the money.
I want to get back to the budget. There have been some wonderful announcements in the budget, there is no mistake about that. I would like to talk about health: an extra $2.2 billion in health investment that will take us to a reform of $7.3 billion over five years, which adds up to about $23 billion over the rest of the decade. Where is the leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Abbott, on this, who is the ex-health minister from the Howard government? What was his main claim to fame? His main claim to fame was that he ripped out $1 billion from the health portfolio.
Time does not allow me to go through verse by verse on how good the budget it. It is a responsible budget. But there is one part of the budget that I do want to home in on in the short time that I have left, and that is the big spending on jobs and skills training. Unfortunately, the minister responsible has left the chamber, but I do want to take this time to congratulate him; he is a minister with foresight. The minister had foresight when that fantastic gas site off the coast of Western Australia was announced—the Chevron operated Gorgon project. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Ferguson, and Minister Arbib actually thought, ‘Heck, we’ve got some problems.’ This government took over the reigns during a global financial crisis, but even when things were going well—and I come from that fantastic state of Western Australia, where mining is just about everything—what did the Howard government do in their 12 years? They sat there and witnessed the boom. They wasted the boom.
I know the word ‘boom’ gives some people problems, particularly people like the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I was in a conference in Karratha a few years ago, and this is their line of thinking: we should not call it the boom, we should call it a ‘once in a lifetime paradigm shift’. This is the sort of nonsense that you have got to put up with—it goes on. But to cut a long story short, they squandered the boom—they cut back in skills training and they cut back in apprenticeships. What did they leave us? A massive hole. Thank goodness for the Prime Minister, for Minister Ferguson and Minister Arbib for having the foresight to say, ‘What are we going to do? Where are we going to get these workers when the Gorgon project gets off and running?’
Through the hard work of the Hon. Gary Gray, the member for Brand, who is chairing the National Resource Sector Employment Taskforce, we have sat down and consulted extensively with industry—mining, construction, gas and the whole resource sector—and asked, ‘Can someone please tell us how we can identify, if all these mining projects go to final investment decision in the next five to 10 years, how many workers we will need?’ We think we know from the good work of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy and APIA and the like around the country that we will need 80,000 workers in construction alone and 30,000 in production in the next five to 10 years. So I want to applaud Minister Arbib for his foresight and the Treasurer, Mr Swan, for the big spending blitz on skills training.
I will list a few key points, if I may. There will be $661 million for the Skills for Sustainable Growth strategy. That is fantastic, as this area was very seriously lacking and nonexistent in the Howard years. There will be $300 million to address skill hot spots, with a $200 million critical skills investment fund to support training through partnerships with industry. It is expected to fund no fewer than 39,000 training places. Also, there will be $79 million for small and medium businesses to take on young traditional trade apprentices. This is all fantastic foresight, which was seriously lacking throughout the Howard years. There will be $20 million to encourage competency based apprenticeships. As someone who was fortunate enough to have been awarded the Centenary Medal by the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Howard, for services to training in the transport industry, training is close to my heart. I am happy to have an argument with any senator or member about the need for training and skilling young Australians.
There has been a lot of conjecture over the new Resource Super Profits Tax, but I want to bring to the chamber’s attention a full-page article in the West Australian—that fine newspaper in WA—on 27 April 2010 written by Ms Gina Rinehart. Ms Rinehart is very well known in mining circles. She is also Australia’s richest woman, and good luck to her; I wish I could say I was Australia’s richest man. I would be happy to be in the top 20,000 but, unfortunately, I am never going to get there. In her article Ms Rinehart talks about Rio Tinto, one of those mining giants which are all around Australian but particularly in Western Australia, and how it has taken advantage of the African country of Guinea’s:
… relatively low labour costs to export iron ore in increasing quantities to Asian markets, markets that we would like to think of as Australia’s forever. These changes will occur in the near future—within four to five years—meaning that Australia has a very short time to prepare.
I take it that means to prepare with low labour costs. I am quoting bits and pieces but I am happy to table or supply any senator on the other side with a copy of this article. If they want a copy, I have got many in my office and am very happy to pass it on so that they can read it themselves. Ms Rinehart goes on to say:
In West Australia, as the Gorgon project and other resource developments occur, we must address a critical problem that is already becoming obvious again, that is, the shortage of construction workers willing to work in remote Northern areas.
That is not news to us; we know that very well. Ms Rinehart continues:
Let’s remember Asian markets will not want to buy more expensive minerals from Australia, their priority will turn to countries that can supply minerals competitively.
Does that mean that she will take a drop in her profit for the sale of iron ore? We are not sure, but she says that Australia must set up special economic zones, either brownfield or greenfield, and she then goes on to say that we as a nation should not build these massive mining projects in the north of Western Australia using Australian labour—because it is too expensive. She is saying, ‘We must build these projects in a northern economic zone with cheap overseas labour.’ As a proud Western Australian and a senator for Western Australia, I will go to my grave fighting for Australian jobs and Australian conditions. I understand that we need robust migration systems but I will be damned if I will see Australian jobs go offshore. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-05-12,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, perhaps I could say to Senator Sterle: before you come in here parroting K Rudd’s words, you might check your facts. For example, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian government expenditure on public hospitals increased every year from approximately $5.2 billion in 1995-96 to over $12 billion in 2007-08, and from 1995-96 annual spending on health and aged care by the Australian government more than doubled, from $19.5 billion in 1995-96 to $51.8 billion in 2007-08. So might I suggest, Senator, that you get your facts right before you come in here parroting K Rudd’s lies and misleading statements.
 (Senator Hurley)—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I assume you mean—
—I withdraw ‘lies’ and refer to misleading statements.
—Could you refer to members of the lower house by their correct title.
—Prime Minister K Rudd. It is very clear that this government has now racked up a massive debt of $40.8 billion, the second biggest sum since World War II. The Prime Minister will have to borrow over $700 million a week to fund his reckless and wasteful spending. So what are the government going to do? They are going to go out and con the most frail and vulnerable people of this country. That is how they are going to mislead and that is where they are going to go and raid moneys from to pay for their reckless spending. In 2007, in their own document, Labor promised a new direction for older Australians, improving the transition between hospital and aged care. What is happening? It is the complete opposite—another con, a blatant broken promise. Mr Rudd is doing the opposite to what he promised in 2007. Surprise, surprise! The government are keeping people in hospitals because they are raiding the money for the nursing home beds. What is the Prime Minister going to tell our frail and aged Australians and their families, who are waiting for nursing home beds, now that the money that was put aside in special appropriations for the building of nursing home beds has been raided to prop up failed state and territory hospital systems and to buy them off so that they would support the Prime Minister’s grand health plan? In August 2007 Mr Rudd talked about:
… not providing enough aged care beds, and people are becoming bed blockers in acute hospital beds. That is part of the real problem nationwide.
So, in short, Mr Rudd’s bed blockers have now become the long-stay older patients, or LSOPs in Mr Ruddspeak. Surprisingly, the minister could not even get his facts right because he referred to the wrong program. But what is happening? They have taken the money that has been set aside for nursing home beds, and we are finding that providers in the aged care sector are calling out that the sector is in crisis. Forty per cent of providers are operating in the red with a very, very minimal return. Nursing home beds are not being built. As I said earlier, according to Aged and Community Services Australia, aged care is ‘in rags’. According to the ACC, Aged and Community Care Victoria, the budget fails frail aged again. According to Anglicare, Australians living at the margins are ‘largely forgotten yet again’. According to COTA, aged care is still in waiting. And according to Alzheimer’s Australia, one million Australians have been ‘forgotten in the federal budget’.
So that is the real story. They have overspent, so now they have to go out to rob one area of the budget to buy off the states, in this case, as far as aged care is concerned. So what are they doing? They are redirecting funds; therefore when older Australians and their families cannot get a nursing home bed in this country, the person they are going to blame is Kevin Rudd. In 2007 Labor said that the average cost of acute public hospital beds was around $967, whereas the average cost in an aged care home was about $100. We are now going to pay nine times more to keep people in hospitals instead of moving them to appropriate nursing home beds.

SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS


TABLING STATEMENT


Alert Digest No. 5 and Fifth Report of 2010
12 May 2010
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 5 of 2010 and its Fifth Report of 2010 I draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee’s comments on:provisions which seek to incorporate material by reference; and the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010.
The Committee’s Alert Digest No. 5 contains a number of comments in relation to bills which seek to rely on information contained in another instrument ‘as in force from time-to-time’.
The Committee’s concern with provisions which take this approach is that they allow a change in obligations to be imposed without Parliament’s knowledge or without the opportunity for Parliament to scrutinise any variation.
These provisions can create uncertainty in the law, and could mean that those obliged to obey the law do not have adequate access to its terms.
A further complexity is that incorporating material by reference is often combined with a delegation of power.
For example, a proposed section of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 20101 currently before Parliament empowers the Minister, by legislative instrument, to make a determination relating to ingredients in medicines. The section also provides that a determination may refer to other instruments or documents ‘as in force or existing from time to time’.
The Committee recognises that there are circumstances in which it may be appropriate to incorporate material by reference, but considers that a thorough explanation of the need for this approach should be included in the explanatory memorandum.
The explanation should any highlight any circumstances which minimise the likelihood of uncertainty for those who are affected by the law – for example, that there is a commitment to undertake appropriate consultation before incorporating material by reference, or that the material being incorporated is a widely‑used and recognised industry standard.
It is also useful if the explanatory memorandum identifies whether there will be adequate access to the material being incorporated from ‘time to time’.
I also draw to the Senate’s attention the Committee’s comments on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill includes amendments to the Criminal Code and the Crimes Act in response to several reviews, including the 2008 Inquiry by the Hon John Clarke QC into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef.
The Committee acknowledges the fine considerations that sometimes need to be balanced to maintain both the security of the community and the protection of personal rights.
As is its usual practice, without considering the policy merit of the bill the Committee has scrutinised its provisions against the Committee’s terms of reference in Standing Order 24.
In relation to some provisions the Committee is seeking further information from the Attorney‑General about their operation and the justification for the proposed approach.
In relation to other aspects of the bill, the Committee draws the provisions to the attention of Senators and leaves consideration of them to the Senate as a whole.
I commend the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 5 of 2010 and Fifth Report of 2010 to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2010-05-12,"—I present an interim report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on its inquiry into the future direction and role of the committee.
Ordered that the Senate adopt the recommendation of the report.
The report read as follows—

STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS


SCRUTINY OF BILLS COMMITTEE

INTERIM REPORT
The Committee has made progress with its inquiry into the future direction and role of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and has received 35 submissions to date.
On 21 April 2010 the Government announced as part of its Australia’s Human Rights Framework policy the establishment of a new Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights to review legislation against human rights obligations. The Parliamentary Joint Committee is to be established by legislation.
The work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights is likely to have an impact on the remit of the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It will be relevant for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to consider the content of the enabling legislation before it can develop an informed view of its own future role and direction.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is seeking to continue the inquiry into its future role and direction once the legislation to establish the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has been introduced. The Committee will also then be able to suggest to the Senate a new tabling date for its final report.
Recommendation
That the time for the presentation of the committee’s report on this inquiry be extended, with the reporting date to be determined after the introduction of legislation to establish the proposed Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.
The Committee thanks all of the individuals and organisations that have made submissions and been involved in the inquiry so far.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-05-12,"—In continuation from earlier today, I am debating with my colleagues in this chamber the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. As I said earlier this afternoon, the coalition supports the bill. We are giving our support to the government because in essence the bill tightens and clarifies certain criminal offences regarding people smuggling. We support it because it defines and extends the investigative powers of such critical agencies as ASIO, no less. But, as I said, this bill is too little too late—it does not go to the core of the problem, and the problem is we have a surge of boats coming to our shores virtually unchecked. Certainly, most of them are getting picked up—not all, tragically. As I left the debate earlier I announced in this chamber that the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, Minister for Home Affairs, has said that yet another boat has made it through our border security. I do not think the government has announced it other than by press release—certainly the minister has not come into this chamber and said anything. Mr O’Connor said that yesterday afternoon, 54 nautical miles south-south-west of Scott Reef, a boat with 48 people on board was picked up. It was picked by no less than the Oceanic Viking, still out there working the refugee trade when it should be assigned to more productive areas down south. As I mused earlier, how lucky are those refugees to see the name Oceanic Viking? It brings back all the memories of when the government was blackmailed last year by a group of refugees who got a special deal because they would not remove themselves from the boat.
Mr O’Connor said in his press release that while the nationality of these asylum seekers is not known, if they happen to be Sri Lankan or Afghans, the government, under its announcement of 9 April 2010, will not be processing them—at least not for at least six months. That is the new law that the government has introduced—the new dictum. I would have thought that to be the wrong end to introduce it. I would have thought that to be a little inhumane. I thought you built your case—your humane case, your moral case, with the minister trumpeting and yelling and shouting from his podium—on the fact that the processing would be done quickly. You are confused. You are absolutely confused. Now you are not going to process them if they happen to come from Sri Lanka or Afghanistan, the very two countries you said were the push factors. You built your case on the push factors from these two countries; now you will not even process people from there. I think that is inhumane and I think that collapses your whole case in regard to border security.
You ought to stop the boats before they leave, not treat the people inhumanely when they get here. They have a right to be processed, seeing as you have now picked them up. So the point is this: your case in regard to push factors has now been turned totally on its head. You are now not processing Sri Lankans and Afghans, because you do not think the problems lie in the countries that you once said they did—they are no longer the push factors, so you have banned processing. What a con; what a bunch of frauds! Even on this issue the Australian people do not know where you stand. And, while you are not processing Afghans and Sri Lankans anymore, you happen to allow three or more—I am not sure—unsavoury characters who ought to be sent home because the weight of evidence that they are not fit characters is compelling.
Who can forget back in April of last year the explosion of SIEV36 off Ashmore Reef? That was a very dramatic affair where the government allowed the Navy to swing in the wind when they were accused of not acting properly under those sorts of pressures. Of course, the coroner in the Northern Territory found otherwise. I have never heard the minister come in here and defend the Navy in their actions. Of course, they acted honourably, they acted properly and they acted according to the book. There happened to be some characters there found guilty by the coroner of setting that boat alight, but they are allowed residency in this country, perhaps pending charges or perhaps not. There is an ability under the law for the minister to act without waiting for the DPP and I say he ought to.
There are contradictions everywhere now in your policy. You are allowing unsavoury characters who put a light to the ship and cost the lives of five people. You have allowed the Navy to swing in the wind. You now no longer will process Afghans and Sri Lankans. Yet you will not change the core of your policy and the core of your policy is the problem: temporary protection visas, for example—no onshore processing. You would have none of these problems—the onshore processing problem you have now or the bursting at the seams of Christmas Island where people are living in tents—if you had a tough policy. How humane is that policy? You do not have a humane policy at all and you do not have a tough policy at all, as much as you trumpet around that you are getting tough, such as this legislation which has now become your cornerstone. It is not humane and it is not tough and you will not do anything about it. Either you are caught up in the politics of it or you are just plain weak. You are playing with Australia’s border security, you are playing with people’s lives and you are playing with people who are waiting in the queues of the refugee camps. Make no mistake: this is old-fashioned queue jumping. They are not my words; they are the words of the United Nations High Commissioner. He claims that such asylum seekers that make their way to Australia or anywhere are queue jumpers and he used the word ‘queue jumper’, I should add. Where is the morality in your policy?",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-05-12,"—In rising to speak on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010 I would like to repeat and endorse some of the comments that have been made by some of my colleagues. The purpose of this bill is quite simply to make changes to the country’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework. The aim is to create a range of new offences relating to people smuggling, extend the penalties for the most serious forms of people smuggling and make changes to six acts, including the Criminal Code and Migration Act—all worthy changes.
The changes that this bill seeks to make to the Criminal Code relate to targeting the people who provide assistance to people smugglers, whether it be through financial, organisational or other means. The penalty for this offence is a fine of $110,000, imprisonment for a maximum of 10 years or both. Changes to the Migration Act include offences for people who provide support to people smugglers, higher penalties for multiple offenders and a maximum 20-year prison term for those involved in aggravated smuggling crimes. This bill aims to extend the emergency authorisation provisions in the Surveillance Devices Act to offences under the Migration Act. It aims to simplify the criteria for the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act that agencies need to satisfy when they apply for telecommunications interception warrants against people smugglers. The bill aims to redefine the term ‘security’ in relation to the ASIO Act so that ASIO can do the job that we ask or expect them to do.
In speaking in support of these changes, it cannot but occur to me that these changes are necessary because of the dereliction of duty and responsibility that this government has had towards Australia’s border security. There is nothing so annoying as to have listened to the voluble and many interjections and claims from the other side that their policies have had nothing whatsoever to do with the influx of illegal arrivals. For two years we have been hearing from those on the other side claiming that their change of policies had nothing to do with the increased boat arrivals in this country. We know that is now hogwash because they are attempting to change their own legislation to tighten it up. It is unlikely to work because the changes that they have announced have not stopped the arrivals. They have not stopped the boats. We have not seen Mr Rudd turn the boats back.
The government has maintained for two years that it is push factors that are bringing people here. If it is push factors that are bringing people here, why do we need to change these domestic arrangements? The government knows that what it has been saying is codswallop. It knows that it has been trying to spin its way out of this, but it is catching up with the government. It is catching up with the government because the Australian people are sick and tired of a government that has lost control not only of our financial situation but also of its borders. I have said before that a nation that loses control of its borders loses control of its destiny. The Minister of Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, says:
... I make the point that push factors are responsible for the increased movement of people ...
Wrong. Senator Wortley says:
This situation has been driven by the push factors of conflict, persecution and insecurity ...
How is changing our domestic legislation going to change that? It is not. It is more spin from the Rudd government and from Senator Wortley. Senator Wong, the minister for failed policies, has now claimed:
The reality is that there are a great many factors contributing to the increase of asylum seekers around the world and in Australia. That is why the government has in place a strong border protection regime.
Senator Wong will probably pick up the border protection regime because it is another failed policy to put in her suite of ministerial failed policy portfolio. Senator McEwen says:
They are the classic factors that see people in many countries attempt to find safe haven and secure future in an alternative country. They are what we call the push factors.
I could go on. Senator Pratt—master of the push factor—Senator Bishop, Senator Carol Brown, Senator Carol Brown again, Senator Evans—I could go on and on and on. They have blamed everyone else and they have refused to acknowledge or accept there is a direct correlation from when they changed the border protection policies that worked so effectively under the previous government. There is a red dot on the graph and then it skyrocketed. When they changed the policy the boats started coming. It is interesting to note the Department of Immigration and Citizenship are five weeks behind in updating the graph on their website—five weeks of shame, five weeks of boats—because they clearly cannot keep up. They cannot tally it. Maybe it has gone off the scale. They have to get a new axis.
Whilst this government is trying to do something here, it is doing too little, too late. We support these measures. As the shadow minister, Scott Morrison, said:
In this bill, we are supporting a policy that we believe will help and will add.
We believe it will help and, if it does help, it will make a mockery of what those on the treasury benches, on the government side of this chamber, have been saying for two years. It is too little, too late from a government that has lost complete control. Labor have made a mess of Australia’s border protection policies and they will not be able to make up for the effect of these soft policies that Mr Rudd and his incompetent team of ministers have implemented. These measures alone will not make up for that. They do not offer a comprehensive solution to the border security problem that Mr Rudd and his government have created. These are soft policies that have encouraged people smugglers and they have resulted in the highest rate of arrivals on record. We are getting not three boats a year; we are getting three boats a week. Three boatloads of people are prepared to risk their lives and pay tens of thousands of dollars to people smugglers to come to Australia knowing that the policies of this government are soft.
We have heard about the $1.2 million contract to put these illegals up in a resort-style hotel. It is alarming. I am sure the Australian people would be alarmed at the headline today in the Age: ‘Private VIP jets transport asylum seekers’. This government spent $5.6 million to 15 March of this financial year on luxury chartered jets. It spent $3.6 million on 48 chartered flights the year before and $5.6 million this year. What are these chartered jets doing? They are flying these people who have arrived in this country illegally from the overcrowded detention centre on Christmas Island, which the same party in opposition said was going to be a white elephant, to resort-style accommodation in Queensland. I know many Australian families who would love to be put up at taxpayers’ expense in resort-style accommodation in Queensland—many of them—particularly if they are going to get flown there in a private VIP jet that normally flies VIP flights for celebrities.
—Kevin.
—And Kevin. I wonder if they complain about the sandwiches they get or that hair dryers are not available, like our own Prime Minister, who set such a bad example. This government has lost control. It does not know what it is doing anymore and it is putting together a range of interim measures to try and arrest the decline in its public standing.
The problem is that they can arrest the decline in their public standing, they can try and do some window-dressing on their soft border protection policies and they can try and patch up or cover up the failures and put them in the basket of the minister for failed policies, Senator Wong. They can try and do all that. The problem is the Australian people no longer believe their rhetoric. They can no longer believe a word that comes out of the mouth of our own Prime Minister, and what a sad day that is for this country. What a sad day it is when the Australian people, who placed so much faith in Mr Rudd, can no longer rely on anything he says because, as I mentioned earlier, the government said for two years their soft border protection policies were not responsible for the influx of illegal arrivals by boat. They said that repeatedly—minister after minister, lacklustre backbencher after lacklustre backbencher. They have dutifully come in here and trotted out the lines given to them by command central and they have told the Australian people, ‘It’s not our fault.’ This bill indicates it is their fault.
The coalition has some form in protecting Australia’s borders. In the last six years of the coalition government, after the Pacific solution was implemented, only three boats arrived per year—three boats per year versus three boats per week. I think our record compares rather favourably with the very poor record of this government. Since the Labor government softened Australia’s border protection policies in August 2008, 122 boats—this is as at 11 May, so it could be 127 or something by now—with 5,624 people have arrived here illegally. In the 2009-10 financial year alone, over 4,500 people arrived in 98 boats, and this financial year is not even over yet. There are going to be many more luxury VIP chartered jets and many more resort hotel accommodations provided to the many more people that will risk life and limb to come to Australia, thanks to Kevin Rudd’s policies. But there is still an opportunity for Mr Rudd and his government to try their hardest to solve the problem. There is still an opportunity.
But Mr Rudd has not only failed the Australian people by softening our border protection policies; he is failing the Australian people financially. In this most recent budget—a budget that covers up the failings of this government, that covers up the fact that at the rate of $1 billion every three years it is going to take 450 years for them to pay off their $150-something billion debt—they have $202 million for more places in detention.
Does that indicate that there is a problem? Common sense would say that it does. There is going to be another $97 million for more Christmas Island infrastructure. It seems like only yesterday they were shipping in the bunk beds to double up in every room. Now they need another $97 million for infrastructure to cope with the influx of illegals. There is going to be $16 million for the lease of an extra ship to patrol our northern waters. It is a good idea but it should not be necessary. It should not be necessary, because we should be having a tight border protection policy that stops people wanting to come here, or they should come here through the appropriate, reasonable and legal channels. They should not be jumping the queue. They should not be coming here knowing that Kevin Rudd is going to put them up in resort-style accommodation and fly them in VIP jets around the country. This is not what the Australian people expect.
What I find equally galling in this budget is that there is apparently $6 million for two of Mr Rudd’s officials to work in Kabul to resettle those Afghanis that have been rejected here for asylum. Two officials and $6 million for the people that were sent home and told, ‘No, you are not allowed here, because you are not a refugee.’ It beggars belief. This is a government that is completely out of control. It is spending Australian taxpayers’ money flying people around the country in VIP jets, putting them up in resort hotel accommodation and then giving them counselling when they send them home. There is something severely wrong with these priorities. If people are coming here and they are not found to be genuine refugees and they are being sent home, is it really Australia’s responsibility? These are people who have lied to the Australian public; they are lying to officials. Clearly they are not genuine refugees and they claim to be. We are spending $6 million on two officials, according to press reports. Nice work if you can get it.
The coalition has had a commitment to strong border protection right through its time in office. When we realised there was a problem and the problem was getting out of hand, we took tough measures to do it. And we copped a lot of pain for it: the inflamed rhetoric on the other side about cruel and inhumane treatment, about people having to wait for quite significant amounts of time to get temporary protection visas or to have their status assessed. It is far less cruel than having people floating across the ocean in an esky—we had a couple of arrivals by esky. People conveniently forget that. We have those that jump off their leaky boats and try and swim to safety and are never seen again. What sort of a government do we have when they think that is the humane thing and the appropriate thing to do? As Senator McGauran said in his earlier comments, the moral thing to do is to put in place policies that will stop the boats from coming. We do not want more people in peril. This goes a little way towards it. It makes a joke and a mockery of all the government’s arguments about how it is not their fault. It makes a joke of all of that, but it is a start. But if it takes them three years of denial to realise that they have a responsibility to the Australian people to secure Australia’s borders, how long is it going to take them to implement a policy that is actually going to stop the boats from coming?
I fear for the future of our nation if this government is re-elected for another term. I fear it on a number of fronts. We see the nationalisation of industry, we see the great sovereign risk attached to their rapid changes in the business and commercial environment with regard to broadband, to mining tax. We have seen them undermine the value of trademarks and branding through their ill-considered plain packaging for cigarettes. We have seen them have smash-and-grab raids on anything that makes a profit. We have seen them squander tens of billions of Australian taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars on ridiculous schemes. And still the ministers are not accountable for it. The failed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—a dud, ditched. We had to lead the world. It was the great moral issue of our time. I would suggest that the great moral issue of our time is stopping people risking their lives coming here in leaky boats.
That is the great moral challenge for this government. Have they got the intestinal fortitude to do that? History would suggest they do not. History would suggest that this government takes politically expedient decisions, not decisions that are in the best interests of Australia. It does not take the decisions that are in the best interests of our national security, our balance sheet security, our food security or our environmental security. Those opposite takes the decisions that are in what they perceive to be in the interests of their political security, and that is the wrong approach for any government to take. The people of Australian know it. They know they have a fake, a phoney, a fraud, a toxic bore in charge of the government. They know that the ministers do not even have a decision about what their policies are; they are just puppets. It is all controlled out of Mr Rudd’s central casting office. That is where the decisions are made and they are dutifully given their piece of paper and out they have to come with it. They are stoic in their defence. Senator Wong has got the basket case portfolio now. We know that. That will be rapidly filling up with even more policies as it continues. Because the minister for immigration has clearly failed in securing Australia’s borders and managing Australia’s unauthorised arrivals, that portfolio I am sure will be shifting into the basket of failure that Senator Wong manages. And she is very competent at managing those failures, I have to say. This is a tragedy for Australians. It is an acknowledgement that this government is failing. This government needs to be changed, and this bill indicates that that should be the case.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-05-12,"—Speaking on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, it is difficult to decide which is the greater concern—the complete collapse of Australia’s border protection system or the Prime Minister’s bald faced attempt to deny the undeniable. The Prime Minister has spent the past 21 months trying to squirm his way out of the corner into which his failed immigration policy has painted him. But while the Prime Minister can run he surely cannot hide. The vain efforts by the Rudd government to duck responsibility for the asylum seeker debacle have long since passed from the realm of the ridiculous into the arena of the absolutely absurd. There are some things that are beyond the media black magic of even the Prime Minister’s battalion of spin merchants. Not even the steamroller tactics of Kevin Rudd’s press office can rewrite objective history. The record is clear beyond all reasonable dispute.
With much fanfare, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Evans, on 29 July 2008 announced a series of radical changes to Australia’s migration policy. The minister proudly proclaimed:
The Rudd Labor government will reform our immigration detention policies and the treatment of asylum seekers in a way that reflects the compassion and tolerance of the Australian community.
So the Rudd government abolished the detention of asylum seekers on Nauru—the so-called Pacific solution. Then Labor passed legislation that erased the debts imposed by the Commonwealth on those whose asylum claims were found to be without merit. The end result of this policy shift was as inevitable as it was predictable. Once again, people began to set sail in leaky, ramshackle boats and, once again, people began to die at sea.
The figures speak for themselves. The statistics provided by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship tell a story so clear it is crystal. During the years of coalition government, a strong deterrent border protection regime cut the influx of illegal immigrant vessels from a torrent to a trickle. During the 2007-08 financial year—the last before the Rudd government changed policy—only three boats, carrying 25 illegal migrants, arrived in Australian waters. But from August 2008 to the present date we have seen 122 boats carrying 5,624 people intercepted by our naval and Customs authorities. Just this Monday we saw two more boats arrive, bringing the total number since the beginning of 2010 to 54 vessels.
Because of this, the Christmas Island detention centre is overflowing, so the Rudd government is now spending $1.2 million to house 79 asylum seekers in a four-star hotel in Brisbane. I wonder what the 100,000 homeless Australians who are doing it hard on the streets every night think about that. $1.2 million to house 79 asylum seekers in a four-star hotel in Brisbane. On the streets of Australia tonight we will have homeless people, homeless Australians, sitting back and watching a government spend $1.2 million to house 79 illegal immigrants. The priorities of this government are highly questionable and should be questioned by the Australian community.
It is a simple fact of nature—one that the Prime Minister seems unable to grasp—that if you water down the deterrent against a particular behaviour you will get more of it. More is precisely what we now face in the form of an upsurge in illegal immigration vessels that began almost immediately after the Prime Minister emasculated Australia’s border protection regime. Labor sent a signal to the people smugglers and their clients that Australia is open for business. News that Australia was once again worth a go began to circulate through the global refugee grapevine and legions of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers responded by placing their lives at risk in rickety rust buckets that I would not take on a crossing of the Yarra much less on a high seas voyage. The people smugglers have become so brazen they now set sail directly for Christmas Island, aware it will be their destination anyway.
But equally as brazen has been the Labor government’s refusal to admit the obvious—that this entire debacle is a direct result of its failed immigration policy. Mr Rudd persists in his lame effort to defend the indefensible. He would have us believe that this massive increase in immigration has nothing to do with his gutting of Australian border protection. Sorry, Prime Minister, but, as opposed to the stream of spin spewing forth from your office, dates and numbers do not lie. Again, I will quote the statistics. From only three boats carrying a mere 25 people between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2008—the last fiscal year the coalition was in government—the seaborne influx of illegal migrants has exploded over the past 20 months to reach 122 vessels bearing over 5,624 persons. As I said earlier, there have been 54 boats this year alone.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees does not lie either. Back in March, a representative of the UNHCR provided an interview to the Australian that completely undercut the Rudd government’s ongoing work of fiction on this issue. The UN official commented that the special deal cut by the Rudd government to defuse the Oceanic Viking crisis:
… was a form of queue-jumping … it was a bad practice. There are Sri Lankan refugees who have been sitting in Indonesia for some time. When you are faced with an emergency and have people demanding resettlement, the (UNHCR’s) position is you should not give in to that because it does give an incentive for people to try this irregular movement.
The UNHCR’s position is that you should not give into that, because it gives an incentive for people to try this irregular movement. There you have it straight from the mouth of the global expert on immigration who is commenting on how the Prime Minister’s special deal for illegal immigrants on the Oceanic Viking allowed them to play the system and win. The triumph of the Oceanic Viking illegals sent a clear message to the legions of aspiring boat people throughout the world. It confirmed once and for all that if you can outlast this wishy-washy Labor government your entry ticket into Australia is assured.
When the timing and extent of this radical upsurge are taken into account there can only be one rational explanation. Under the false banner of a fairer and more humane policy Kevin Rudd’s penchant for moral posturing led him to gut the coalition’s strong deterrent policy against illegal migrants. The people smugglers and their clients rightly interpreted ‘fairer and more humane’ to mean ‘weaker and less rigorous’. The announcement of Labor’s changes to the Australian asylum seeker policy in 2008 triggered the onset of an illegal immigration crisis that shows no signs of abating. It was all done in order that the Prime Minister and his ministers can pat each other on the back and tell each other how morally righteous they are.
I wonder how many people will have to lose their lives in rickety, unseaworthy boats before the Prime Minister and his immigration minister will admit the obvious. It will be more than a few, I fear, because the Prime Minister is in a state of denial. Like a cat up a tree the Prime Minister has climbed so far out on a limb that he is unwilling to make a backwards move. Rather than lose a little political face the Prime Minister prefers that people continue to jeopardise their lives in ramshackle boats on the high seas. This is crass political cynicism at its worst. This is nothing more than crude political calculation garbed in the empty guise of high-minded moral rhetoric that endangers the lives of people less fortunate than us.
The bill we are debating at present is just another fig leaf that the Rudd government is attempting to drape over the tattered rag of their immigration policy. It is just the latest in a series of ill-conceived bills and measures motivated more by election year panic than by rational policy. We have already seen the arbitrary decision by the Rudd government to impose a moratorium on asylum applications from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. While the questionable legality of this policy will be ultimately tested in the courts one thing is certain: it has not worked. The boats have continued to come. And now we see this bill, the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, which is more of an attempt to immunise the Rudd government from political criticism than to come to honest grips with the problems caused by Labor’s botched policy.
It is not that the coalition is opposed to harsher penalties for people smugglers, I hasten to add—far from it. A tough criminal justice policy is a central pillar of Liberal faith. People smuggling is a vile trade that exploits the hopes and fears of people who are at their most vulnerable. Longer prison terms alone will not quash the people-smuggling trade any more than they quash the drug-smuggling trade. As long as there is demand for the services of people smugglers there will always be those willing to provide it. As the coalition demonstrated during its time in government, the only way to address this problem effectively is to make Australia an unattractive destination for asylum seekers who have the money and motivation to jump the queue by taking to the seas. Australia is a ‘field of dreams’ for millions of poor and oppressed people throughout the world. Like the movie of the same name, if you build it they will come. The problem is that the policy the Prime Minister has built is ill-conceived and dangerous.
We are indeed the lucky country and we have a moral obligation to provide refuge to those who are suffering from oppression and persecution. But the 13,000-plus humanitarian visas that Australia grants each year should be allocated on the basis of need rather than nerve. Our help should go to those who are most deserving, not to those who have the financial means to cut corners and the mindset to cheat the process.
The Prime Minister’s botched border protection policy can be added to the growing list of disasters and debacles that Labor has inflicted upon Australia over the past 2½ years such as the home insulation debacle; the rort ridden school construction program; and the massive debt burden Kevin Rudd’s profligate spending has loaded onto the backs of taxpayers. The damage inflicted on Australia by this bevy of Labor incompetence extends beyond squandered millions. The government has also cost lives. I view the behaviour of the government on this policy as probably one of the worst derelictions of responsibility from any government in recent history. This change of policy was premised not on the back of concerns for this country and not on the back of legitimate concerns about what an appropriate border protection policy is. It was on the back of a series of statements and comments by the present government prior to and immediately post the last election. It was designed only for crass political purposes. I suppose you have to acknowledge that, in that regard, it has been spectacularly successful.
I again ask the question, as I have asked it time after time in this place and indeed in the other place many years ago: what responsibilities does this government have to those people who do not have the money or, as I said earlier, the nerve to come to this country? What about those people the UNHCR were talking about who have been waiting their turn legitimately in Indonesia and elsewhere? On what basis does this government, if they are running a line that this is a humanitarian response to an issue, justify their actions on the back of a so-called humanitarian response? What is humanitarian about providing a change of policy which allows people to break the law?
—And puts lives at risk.
—And puts lives at risk, as my colleague said. What is humanitarian about that? What is humanitarian about forcing people in refugee camps throughout the world to go to the back of the queue because of a crass political policy that devastated a successful border protection policy?
This government has got as big an obligation as the Howard government and governments before that had to make sure that we have a legitimate and achievable border protection policy that can be implemented in this country’s interests. The fact that this government has refused to acknowledge the outcome of this policy is bizarrely, as I said, cloaked in some humanitarian approach to this. What this so-called humanitarian approach has done is put people’s lives at risk. It is now acknowledged, I believe by all parties, that this has cost lives. There are people dying on the back of a crass political response to a serious issue, and the Prime Minister is sitting back and doing nothing—doing no heavy lifting—because he is afraid of another backflip. Prime Minister, let us see you backflip on this—to the cheers of the opposition and the bulk of the Australian community and the people who are sitting in refugee camps waiting their turn to come here on a legitimate basis.
We are, on any measure, an incredibly generous country in relation to providing relief for those who seek to come to our shores—a remarkably generous country. What the Prime Minister has done and what the immigration minister has done is to impose another layer of so-called border protection which has put at risk lives and which has put at risk this country’s sovereignty. This is not, I can tell you, a policy that this government should be proud of. There are many that this government should not be proud of, but this is right at the top of the list. We urge the Prime Minister to accept his responsibility as this nation’s leader to put in place a border protection policy that serves this country’s interests and stops putting at risk the lives of innocent people. When the Prime Minister does that, he will get the plaudits; until then, I can assure you that he will get the brickbats.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-05-12,"—The purpose of this bill, the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, is to deter people smuggling, to expand ASIO’s charter to include border security issues and to make related amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. The bill makes amendments to the Criminal Code and the Migration Act to increase the sanctions applicable to people smuggling; to the ASIO Act to include the protection of Australia’s territorial and border integrity from serious threats within ASIO’s statutory charter; to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act and the Surveillance Devices Act to include people smuggling within the definition of a serious offence and thus permit the use of these tools to investigate allegations of people smuggling; and to align the definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act with the definition of that term in the Intelligence Services Act.
In relation to criminal sanctions, the amendments will create a new offence of providing material support or resources towards a people-smuggling venture; establish in the Migration Act an aggravated offence of people smuggling which involves exploitation or danger of death or serious harm; and apply mandatory minimum penalties of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years—the maximum penalty being 20 years or $220,000 or both—to the new aggravated offences and to multiple offences. The offence of providing material support does not apply to a person who pays smugglers to facilitate their own passage or that of a family member to Australia.
The fact that the bill recognises people smuggling as a serious threat to Australia’s territorial and border integrity—and therefore a national security threat—demonstrates by the government’s own admission the systemic failure of the Rudd government to confront the problem of people smuggling. These measures, which the opposition will not oppose, are piecemeal measures that have been brought forward by a government which found a solution and created a problem. Let it never be forgotten that, at the time the Rudd government was elected—two and half years ago—the people-smuggling problem had largely been solved. The arrival on Australia’s shores—and particularly on our north-western shores and on Australian offshore islands—of unlawful entrants whose passage is facilitated by people smugglers has been a problem in Australian history from time to time throughout our lifetimes. The problem grew acute in the late 1980s and in the 1990s—so acute that the then Howard government made a decision to take strong measures to stop the problem, to protect Australia’s borders, to secure our territorial integrity and, therefore, to protect our national security. Those strong measures—which my colleagues have described—were introduced by the Howard government in 2001. They followed, I might say, strong measures that had been introduced by a previous Labor government, during the Hawke-Keating period, including the policy of mandatory detention.
But it was the Howard government that got the mix right. From a crescendo of unlawful arrivals in 2000, the introduction of tougher-still policies by the Howard government in 2001 fixed the problem because it did the one thing no previous policy had ever done: it denied the people smugglers the capacity to sell a service to their clients. It denied the people smugglers the capacity to say to their clients: ‘We will guarantee you arrival on Australia’s shores. We will guarantee that you will be able to avail yourselves of Australia’s refugee assessment system, from which you are highly likely to receive a favourable outcome’. It took away from the people smugglers the capacity to sell that product.
What happened as a result? As a result, the people-smuggling trade died. This evil trade which plays dice with the lives of innocent men, women and children died. The number of unlawful boat arrivals from 2001 when the tough measures were introduced to 2008 when the tough measures were abandoned in a gesture of faux compassion—not real compassion—by the Rudd Labor government fell to approximately three per year.
Since the reversal of the Howard government’s policies in September 2008, the number of unlawful arrivals—the number of men, women and children whose lives are put at risk on the high seas between Indonesia and the north-west coast of Australia—has crept steadily and remorselessly upward so that now, in May 2010, an average so far of one unlawful boat every two days has sought to penetrate Australia’s borders. What a reversal from an average of three per year, or fewer than one every 100 days for nearly a decade because the previous policies worked, to a situation today in which we have approximately one unauthorised boat arrival every two days.
But it gets worse, because that rate of arrival is itself escalating. We have just been through the monsoon season—the season when, because of the turbulent weather and sea conditions in the Timor Sea, people smugglers are less inclined to seek to make the voyage to Australia. As anybody familiar with this area of policy knows, it is during the winter months that the numbers tend to spike. We are just going into the winter months now. If during what might be called the low season for people smuggling in the early months of the year the number of unauthorised attempted boat arrivals has escalated to one every two days, heaven alone knows what it is likely to be in the months ahead when the waters are calmer.
There have been 5,762 illegal arrivals in Australia since the Rudd Labor government weakened Australia’s border protection regime. In this financial year, since 1 July 2009, there have been 4,723 arrivals. That is 13 per cent greater than in any previous financial year in our history and, of course, this financial year still has more than six weeks to go.
As my friend Senator Ronaldson has said, the result of the government’s attempt to strike a compassionate pose by weakening the Howard government’s tough but successful border protection policies has been to relegate to the back of the queue thousands of deserving people who do not have the money to pay people smugglers US$10,000 or US$15,000 to secure a passage—people who are not prepared to put their own or their wife’s or their children’s lives in peril on the high seas to secure a passage to Australia, people who are not prepared to break Australian law in order to seek to enter our country unlawfully. Those thousands upon thousands of people waiting in refugee camps for a humanitarian entrance visa into Australia have been pushed to the back of the queue.
That is yet another reason why the so-called compassion of the Rudd government is so phoney. It is such a gesture. It is such an exhibition of moral vanity. It is supposed to be compassionate by authoring a policy which puts lives at risk, which encourages people to sell themselves and their families into the hands of people smugglers and to put their own and their family’s lives at risk, and at the same time punishes genuine impoverished refugees who are prepared to wait, obey Australian law and have their claim for humanitarian entry assessed in the proper way.
In 2008-09, the most recent financial year, Australia granted 13,507 humanitarian entry visas, of which 11,010 were granted to offshore applicants. In 2009-10, the current financial year, the refugee and humanitarian program has 13,750 places allocated, of which the offshore component is 6,000 people and the onshore component is 7,750 people. That ratio reflects the early and immediate response to the government’s policy change. The onshore component, which includes illegal entrants who made their way to Australia and sought to have their claims assessed within Australian territory, tripled, and the offshore component halved. Those entering the country illegally by boat were directly responsible for squeezing out more than 5,000 offshore applicants.
The coalition makes no apology for its belief that one of the elementary obligations of a national government is to keep the nation’s borders secure. Because Australia is a maritime nation and all of our international borders are maritime borders, we make no apology whatsoever for demanding and, when we had the opportunity to do so in government, for implementing tough and strong policies to deter people from embarking on unlawful voyages to Australia and to apprehend them and seek to return them when they did. That is entirely appropriate for a maritime nation which takes the task of protecting its own borders seriously. There is an issue of sovereignty here. A nation without the capacity or the willingness to protect its own borders sends a signal to the world that its borders are permeable, its national security is compromised and, in a profound way, it is incapable of defending itself. So there is an issue of principle and an issue of international law here.
There is also, as I have said—and as Senator Ronaldson said and Senator Bernardi said—an issue of real humanitarianism. How could we possibly countenance, as a civilised, liberal democracy, a set of policies which implicitly condone the conduct of people smugglers by giving them a tradeable commodity that they can sell to people with the wherewithal to pay their fee and secure this risky package? How could we as a civilised nation do that, knowing that it puts lives at risk and that it pushes genuine refugees who are prepared to observe Australia’s laws to the back of the queue? During the period of the Howard government, after that government toughened the policies in 2001, this problem was, for all practical purposes, solved. What happened in those years? The number of humanitarian entrants processed offshore in the orthodox fashion rose. Of those people in Australia today who have been in the desperate circumstances of being refugees, more of them have found a new home in this land as a result of the Howard government’s policies than as a result of the Rudd government’s weakened, new, falsely compassionate policies.
The year 2002, the first year after the Howard government toughened the policies, was a year of significant international turmoil. It was just after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan. The Sri Lankan civil war was intermittently in full flight or in temporary ceasefire. Yet in 2002-03, not one boat arrived in Australia—not one—despite those so-called ‘push factors’. In 2003-04, there were three boat arrivals; in 2004-05, there were no boat arrivals; in 2005-06, there were eight boat arrivals; in 2006-07 there were four boat arrivals; and in 2007-08—within the time of the Rudd government but before the government weakened the policies—there were just three boat arrivals. In six years there were 18 boat arrivals, notwithstanding the turbulent international circumstances which elevated the push factors from both West Asia and South Asia. Yet look at the pass we have come to now as a result of the Rudd government’s catastrophic policy failure.
As I have said, the opposition do realise that this is a very, very serious policy crisis and the Australian national interest does need to be protected. For that reason, we will not oppose these measures but we regret the weakness of will, the cowardice and the policy confusion which necessitated these measures in the first place.
Presumably, one of the consequences of this legislation is that ASIO will need to be better resourced. Therefore, it must be asked what effect the expansion of its charter will have on its existing functions. In last night’s budget not only was there no new funding for ASIO but the agency was asked to find another $15 million beyond the efficiency dividend in so-called ‘efficiencies’ over the forward estimates. The Treasurer announced last night that the Rudd government has also slashed funding to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service with a further $146.3 million of cuts over the next four years. Of the $1.2 billion announced in the budget last night to deal with border security, the government is actually denying resources to front-line agencies, including the very agency, ASIO, whose powers are being expanded tonight by this legislation to deal with this problem of the Rudd government’s own creation.
The opposition accepts that the amendments in this legislation are necessary. For that reason we will not oppose them. But we lament and regret the fact that they were necessary in the first place, as the direct result of confusion, cowardice and failure by the Rudd Labor government.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-05-12,"—I rise tonight to speak to the government’s Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. This bill, as we have heard, seeks to strengthen the government’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework as well as to ensure that people smuggling is comprehensively criminalised in Australian law. Yet, despite the Attorney-General stating in his second reading speech that the United Nations Global trends report ‘indicates that people seeking asylum in Australia reflects a worldwide trend driven by insecurity, persecution and conflict’, nowhere in this bill are Australia’s obligations to those seeking our protection under international law recognised.
I find it very concerning and disappointing that an incredibly complex piece of legislation such as that which we are discussing today has been introduced and is expected to pass with such expediency, with limited scrutiny on the full impact of the proposed measures. All we need to look at is the turnaround time for the inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and the pathetic report that was put together on behalf of the majority of the committee. It was an appalling report that did not reflect the evidence given to the committee, which of course is why I authored a dissenting report. It did not reflect the views of those who are experts in the field and who made submissions. In fact, there was only one submission that supported this legislation, and that was from the government departments themselves. Every other submission spoke about how poorly drafted this piece of legislation was, how poorly defined the definitions within it were, how poorly the arguments as to why this legislation needed to exist in this form had been put by the government, and the lack of public consultation and review that this piece of legislation had had.
While it is clear that the Greens are in no way supportive of people smuggling, that does not mean that this Senate should give up its responsibilities as a house of review; its responsibilities to scrutinise legislation—and this legislation is so, so poorly drafted. While I speak to the legislation itself, I must say that the Greens will not be supporting this legislation going on to the next stage because it is clear that it needs to go back to the drawing board. The government themselves have said that in the absence of bringing forward any human rights act they will introduce a new human rights committee that will scrutinise and review legislation. This should have been the very first piece of legislation that went to that committee. Until this legislation goes to that committee, the Greens believe it should not proceed.
The failure of the government to articulate why it is necessary to introduce the measures proposed in this bill highlights that wider public consultation and debate is necessary before these measures can be seriously considered. While it is incredibly important for measures to be implemented to prevent asylum seekers from embarking on treacherous journeys across dangerous waters to get to Australia, I would argue that there are plenty of things the government could have announced in last night’s budget to do that.
What is the use of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on facilities in Indonesia and billions of dollars on border protection but not increasing the number of refugees you agree to resettle from these treacherous places? It is ludicrous that we talk about the numbers of people arriving here by boat but do not increase the numbers of people we resettle from places like Malaysia or Indonesia, where these people are warehoused in Australian funded detention centres with no hope of freedom despite already being classified by the UNHCR as genuine refugees. Last year Australia took only 70 people from Indonesian detention centres. Seventy people who had been recognised by the UNHCR were resettled by Australia, yet we cry foul at the idea of people jumping on boats, coming to Australia and seeking refuge.
The best way for the Australian government to stamp out the scourge of people smuggling would be to go to the source—that is, to resettle those people who have already been found, in places like Malaysia and Indonesia, to be genuine refugees through processes that Australian taxpayers fund. We should be putting those processes to more effective use and resettling those people, rather than spending the money there, waiting for them to get on a boat to Christmas Island and then spending another billion dollars over the next four years simply because we could not increase our humanitarian intake the way we should have.
This bill has nothing to do with the practicalities of tackling people smuggling. This bill is all about Kevin Rudd being able to go out and say: ‘You know what? I’ve stamped strong, loud and hard on refugees and asylum seekers. I’ve done it so well in this election that I’ve given ASIO the powers to tackle people smuggling.’ We know, through the evidence given to the committee, that this legislation will not deal with the actual issue. During the inquiry I asked the departments themselves, both ASIO and the Attorney-General’s Department, how effective this legislation was actually going to be, pointing out that the organisation of people smuggling is not done primarily from Australia; it is done offshore. They agreed. This legislation as it is currently written is badly argued and badly drafted. It is only for show for the Rudd government. It does not deal with the actual issues at hand. There is no mention of our obligations under international law, no mention of the definitions that we have signed up to under anti-people-smuggling protocols and our international obligations. There is an anti-people-smuggling protocol. Australia is a signatory to it. Yet we have not even incorporated the definition of people smuggling that the protocol uses. We have made up our own so that it suits us in this piece of legislation.
Like many in the legal profession, the Greens have serious concerns that this bill in its current form not only breaches our obligations under international law but also breaches our obligations under domestic law. We remain very concerned that this bill is a direct attack on refugee communities within Australia and on those who support them. Despite assurances from the Attorney-General’s Department during the course of the Senate inquiry that innocent individuals would not be caught under this poorly drafted legislation, the definition of ‘providing material support’, which nobody seems to be able to define, is such that anyone here in Australia who sends money to a friend or relative in a refugee camp who subsequently—without the awareness of the person who sent that money—uses that money to pay a people smuggler could be charged under this broad definition. This legislation is poorly drafted and too broad, and yet it does nothing to tackle the issue of people smuggling or the issue of our obligations to asylum seekers under international law.
The point is: if the intention is to catch those individuals who provide humanitarian support, then why not make it explicitly clear in the legislation? It has been argued that no court would actually convict somebody who is providing humanitarian assistance to someone overseas who may then use a people smuggler to get out of a horrific detention facility in, say, Indonesia. If that is the case then why allow those people to be investigated in the first place—under broadening the roles and responsibilities of ASIO, allowing ASIO to use their current powers of interrogation and surveillance and possibly charge them in the first instance.
The government says these are not the people we are targeting. These are good-hearted Australians doing what they have always done—support the most vulnerable people in other parts of the world, particularly in our own Asia-Pacific region. If the government’s intention is not to target them then it should go back and redraft this legislation, because this legislation currently captures them. It is far too broad.
Professor Crock from the Sydney Centre for International Law told the Senate committee that:
This legislation targets refugee communities in Australia who are sending remittances to their families overseas. Every time they send money across to a relative, if there is a chance that that relative is going to get on a boat at some stage, they are at risk of being put in jail for 10 years. This legislation will only be seen by the very vulnerable emergent communities in this country as a direct assault on them—a frontal attack.
Who is the government trying to win over with this legislation? They are not delivering anything that tackles the issue of people smuggling and they are not doing anything to deal with the fact that we have people in places like Indonesia and Malaysia, desperate for freedom, security and a future, who have been found to be genuine refugees. It does not deal with any of those things.
What is this about? It is purely so that Kevin Rudd can say: ‘I am as tough as Tony Abbott. I can kick refugees too. Just watch me.’ That is what this legislation is about. It is so that Kevin Rudd can stand up and think that he can be as tough as Tony Abbott. But neither of them are tough, because neither of them are actually dealing with the real issue. Australia has obligations under international law to protect asylum seekers, to process their claims. I know the government does not believe in processing people’s claims any more; they have suspended that. ‘That is all right. We will just put that aside for a little while. Who cares about international law or our obligations?’
It is actually not the tough, strong thing to do to kick those who are most vulnerable in the world. The strongest thing to do is stand up and face the responsibilities we have and find mature, practical, humane and fair ways of managing it—for example, increasing the intake of resettlement of offshore asylum seekers, not warehousing them in desert prisons like Curtin and not setting up a whole new system of laws and regulations that are going to be seen as a direct attack on those within the Australian community who support refugees and asylum seekers. Church groups around Australia collect money on a weekly basis for individuals and families in refugee camps or those waiting for the determination process. Imagine if something happens and those people get so desperate that that money ends up getting spent on people smugglers because they have to get out of that situation. These are the types of cases we are talking about. Yet, those people who—

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I take note of this report and, in doing so, I wanted to make a few comments to highlight the shameful display by this government with respect to the Home Insulation Program. This report has been conducted by Dr Allan Hawke and is dated 6 April. It relates to the shameful, disgraceful display demonstrated by the Rudd Labor government in what I have described as the pink batts debacle. And it keeps getting worse.
What we saw in the budget brought down last night by Mr Swan and Mr Rudd was that $1 billion of taxpayers’ money—it has been confirmed in the budget papers—has been used to try to fix the bungled pink batts program. The fact is that the Prime Minister should officially and publicly apologise to the Australian nation, particularly to the people affected by this program. He has used $1 billion of taxpayers’ money to rectify a problem which is of his own accord and which has been administered by his government. There have been an estimated 240,000 dodgy installations and up to 1,000 electrified roofs, and 120 house fires—possibly more—that are linked to this program. Tragically, four deaths have been linked to this dodgy, rotten pink batts debacle. It is tragic.
This $1 billion that has been confirmed in the budget last night has been used to try to fix the collapsed and catastrophic Home Insulation Program. That cost will be borne by the Australian taxpayer. As I said, not up to 1,000 electrified roofs but, potentially, 1,500 deadly electrified roofs. This government still has not given a commitment to inspect all of the nearly 1.1 million homes around Australia that have been granted or had the pink batts put into their roofs. Some residents still live in fear and trepidation, some with an anxiety, and some simply not knowing whether their house is safe. The government simply has not committed to do that to every one of those 1.1 million homes insulated under the program. That is not good enough.
Mr Rudd should come into the parliament and should publicly say, ‘Enough is enough. I apologise’ specifically to those people and specifically to those people detrimentally affected as a result of this program. The Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade has warned that every home must be inspected. In the face of further warnings, there is no excuse for the Rudd government not to commit to inspect every one of those homes under that program.
Mr Rudd must come clean with the public and with the Senate, and specifically with the Senate committee of which I have been an active participating member, as have other members of this Senate. He must release the relevant correspondence between him and the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Peter Garrett, in which it appears, based on the evidence, that he was clearly warned. We know he was warned. He received many warnings last year, but we want to see those letters between Mr Garrett and Mr Rudd. He has so far said ‘no’, he will not release that, and he has come up with spurious arguments including cabinet-in-confidence. But only one of those letters apparently could perchance come under that category.
This pink batts debacle has gone from bad to worse. It was confirmed in the budget last night that $1 billion of taxpayers’ money will be used. Of course, the program cost in total $2.45 billion, so it has been a total and utter disaster. The Prime Minister should apologise.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-05-12,"—Tonight I rise to acknowledge the impending 80th birthday of the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, who was born on 21 May 1930. This is a celebration of an impressive birthday milestone, but it is also the celebration of a man who has been an outstanding figure in Australia’s history as a nation. Of Malcolm Fraser’s eight decades, 28 years were dedicated to parliamentary service, with eight years as Prime Minister.
At their core, Malcolm Fraser and the Australian psyche share a common blend of traits: grit, humility, determination and aspiration. Neither one’s genesis predestined greatness; both emerged from adversity stronger and greater nonetheless. Malcolm Fraser’s creed is wrought in perseverance, and it is because of this that history records the restoration of responsible government in 1975. It is because of this that the Australian economy was able to thrive once again. It is because of this that Australia turned to a leader with an intense commitment to integrity in public administration.
Today we look back on a government that wrote into the pages of history some of Australia’s greatest environmental pro-tections. The cessation of sand mining on Fraser Island and the prohibition of whaling in Australian waters are among them. We look back to a time when Australia’s 22nd Prime Minister became the first to adopt a migration program that was truly multiracial, when government policies were inspired by an indomitable belief in the Australian fair go. The trajectory of the Fraser government is something to behold in the index of this nation’s history. Malcolm Fraser has not merely lived history; he has made it, changed it and charted us a better course for it.
In 1975 Australia was in the throes of a national heart attack. While prepared to inflict short-term pain to avert impending disaster, the spirit of Malcolm Fraser’s intent was that of a healer and a builder. With the balm of confidence and the tonic of optimism, he reached out to all Australians with hope and assurance. He continued to instil reassurance and stability throughout his government, recruiting other healers like Sir Zelman Cowen as Governor-General.
On Aboriginal affairs, it was the Fraser government who extended native title rights and appointed three empathetic ministers in Fred Chaney, Ian Viner and Peter Baume. He gave the Northern Territory self-government. For drought stricken farmers, it was Fraser who first provided a system of deferred taxation. Ably assisted by my friend and colleague Petro Georgiou, Prime Minister Fraser conceived, funded and implemented SBS television.
Fraser immigration ministers set the course for non-discriminatory migration programs. It was that government that loudly resolved the recently abolished White Australia policy would never again blot any page of legislation passed in our federal parliament. It was their government that organised the calm and orderly arrival of 100,000 Indochinese. They were welcomed to Australia where their future citizenship would never be questioned and their dreams could be boundless. As David Barnett, Malcolm Fraser’s biographer, notes where Whitlam had called them ‘boatpeople’, Malcolm Fraser called them’ refugees’ which is what they were.
Imagine a time when there was a bipartisan national discussion on immigration that appealed to our best hopes and not our worst fears. Imagine a time when the immigration minister conducted a national tour to explain multiculturalism and was often joined by his opposition shadow. Ian McPhee and Mick Young could imagine it because Malcolm Fraser believed that we could be as responsible as that.
Abroad, the Fraser government supported the Gleneagles agreement to sever sporting links with segregated South Africa, not just because apartheid did not work but also because it was morally reprehensible. Malcolm Fraser’s negotiation of a practical border zone arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea may well be one of his government’s most understated achievements. Where Gough Whitlam failed, Malcolm Fraser’s tenacity, reason and patience prevailed. Becoming the first Australian Prime Minister to visit the Torres Strait Islands, Malcolm Fraser held negotiations on Yam Island. Under the Wisdom Tree, the Prime Minister and his foreign affairs minister sat in the sand with representatives of the local coastal Papuans, the Queensland government and the PNG government to see the dawning of this historic agreement.
Malcolm Fraser has had a lifelong aversion to communism. Given the times in which he reached adulthood in 1950s Australia, it is easy to understand why. As Prime Minister, he backed the United States in its condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. But he also swam against the prevailing international tides of the time which included the more relaxed attitude of President Jimmy Carter’s administration towards the Soviet Union. Fraser argued this stance weakened the position of the West which was critical during the Cold War period, and that was a view later endorsed by Ronald Reagan.
Throughout all of this time, the member for Wannon was an outstanding local member of parliament. During Malcolm Fraser’s prime ministership, I served on my children’s local kindergarten committee in his electorate. I once wrote to him about an issue concerning our kindergarten, unsure whether I would receive a reply. Two weeks later the member for Wannon responded with care and concern. I remember being very impressed by his attention to a minor detail while attending to the great challenges of an entire nation. There are those today who would do well to heed such an example.
In 1981, Ronald Reagan said that it was Malcolm Fraser who preceded both him and Margaret Thatcher on the path to smaller government. In America, those former presidents are revered statesman. No longer enmeshed in partisan politics, they become feted national elders. In the Australian Labor Party, I will admit, those who have led their comrades to the great enabler of government are indeed eulogised. In the Liberal Party, we are not as generous in this regard and I am not alone in this opinion.
My former colleague Alexander Downer has rightly said that the Liberal Party lionised Sir Robert Menzies as the nation’s greatest leader, but he asked how well we revered our other great leaders. How many people give credit to Harold Holt for dismantling the White Australia policy, to John Gorton’s efforts on the environment, and to Sir William McMahon who was a Treasurer and an early champion of liberal markets? Alexander Downer was a former staffer to Malcolm Fraser. In his words, Fraser ‘was one of the most dedicated and patriotic people I have ever met.’ The Fraser government received a majority in both houses, but Australians remained bitterly divided over the events that led to that moment. Alexander Downer’s view is that:
Some Liberals say Fraser should have reformed the economy more radically than he did. But all prime ministers operate in a context and the context of post November, 1975, is important to understand.
After more than a century of Federation, Australia has five living former prime ministers. They should all be celebrated and respected for the service they gave with all of their might and to the best extent of their abilities that the challenges of their times allowed. Malcolm Fraser was not a perfect prime minister. He is not a flawless human being. Who among us is? But it was the aspiration to better, to develop and to refine his abilities and to progress from a beginning that was not predestined for greatness that also speaks to his qualities of determination and aspiration.
Some may say that Malcolm Fraser let the opportunity of radical reform slide, but with the wisdom of hindsight they may now concede that legislating for the sake of opportunity has its drawbacks too. It was a time for calm, reasoned progression, not for legislation that sought to reach beyond what the public was prepared to grasp.
Mr Fraser is a person of remarkable consistency, without lacking in adaptability. His established views on the importance of federalism are now more relevant than ever. When Malcolm Fraser left the Liberal leadership, he left our party in capable hands and I want to pay tribute to him tonight. Abraham Lincoln once said that character was like a tree and reputation its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it, the tree is the real thing.
