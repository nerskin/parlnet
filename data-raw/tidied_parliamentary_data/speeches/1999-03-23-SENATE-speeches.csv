"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-23,"—My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. I refer the minister to an answer given in question time in the House of Representatives yesterday by Minister Vaile where he stated in regard to fuel prices:
In my electorate alone, I am aware that the retail price of petrol has fallen from some 79c to 72c. Apply the equation under our tax reform package to that, and it will fall even further.
I ask the minister: in light of evidence from the Australian Automobile Association that the rural-city fuel price differential will actually increase as a result of the GST, can the minister advise as to what equation Minister Vaile was referring to when he made his statement yesterday. Further, in regard to Minister Vaile's claim that fuel will fall even further, what does the cut in excise per litre of fuel have to be to ensure that rural fuel prices in fact fall, as is claimed by Minister Vaile?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-23,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister, for that long-winded diatribe but 
 you actually did ignore the two aspects of the question that I put to you—that is, Senator Vaile's statement as to the equation and, secondly, what the actual cut would be. Minister, I further ask you: will you guarantee that rural fuel prices will in fact fall as a result of the GST, as is claimed by Minister Vaile? Do you also agree with the Australian Automobile Association statement that a cut of 8.9c per litre is required just to ensure that country fuel prices will not rise? If you do not agree, what rate of excise cut do you believe is required to ensure that rural fuel prices will not rise—or, Minister, don't you really understand the question?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-23,"—Thank you for that question. Senator, we, as you are aware, are cutting fuel excises. We are doing it so business can benefit very substantially. It is one of the very big pluses I would put to you, Senator, of the tax package that we have brought before this parliament. This is quite in contrast with the rise in fuel prices which occurred under the Labor Party in 1993. In 1993—and I am sure my Labor colleagues will correct me if I am wrong—fuel prices rose in the order of 5c to 7c per litre.
—What did Murphy say?
—Senator Conroy, that is what happened under your government. You lifted fuel prices. Senator, if you go back to 1983, I think you will find there was a huge rise in fuel excise prices under the Labor Party. 
—Murphy said the gap is getting wider.
—And let me say it was without any compensation being offered to rural Australia or anything else. Senator, what we have said—and I am reading from a press release that the Treasurer has put out—
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Senator Conroy! Senator Kemp, I suggest you ignore Senator Conroy.
—Thank you, Madam President. Senator, you should be aware that for any business user entitled to a full credit on input tax the cost falls by some 10c, as business users are entitled to the full credit of the GST. In addition, Senator, heavy transport vehicles are entitled to an additional credit on fuel excise. Diesel excise for on-road use will fall to 18c per litre from the current level in the order of some 43c per litre. This will dramatically cut transport costs, particularly transport costs in rural and regional Australia.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—I was asked about transport costs and petrol costs and I have supplied the answer to you, Senator. But I do make the point that we in this government have a package designed to help rural and regional Australia, and that is why we have given those special concessions on diesel fuel. The Labor Party, when it was in government, raised the price of fuel to regional and rural Australia and to cities. Yet a Labor Party senator has got up and complained to us. The other point I would make is that we are attempting to deliver to the Australian people $13 billion worth of tax cuts, arguably the largest tax cuts in Australian history.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—That is what we are trying to deliver, and the Labor Party is attempting to prevent us from delivering those tax cuts.

—Thank you, Senator, that is a different matter. I do not think you actually appreciate the nature of the question you are asking. You seem to have missed the key point. What I said was that heavy transport vehicles are entitled, as you should be aware, to an additional fuel credit on excise. Diesel excise for on-road use will fall, and fall substantially.
—We are talking about the motorist in the country. We are talking about the price of fuel to the country motorist.
—I have explained this to you very carefully, Senator, and you keep on shouting out. You do not understand. In our tax package we are cutting diesel fuel excise. Don't you understand that, Senator? Don't you understand that very important part of our tax package? We believe that this package is extremely good for rural and regional Australia.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-03-23,"—I have some further information on a recent question from Senator Brown regarding Irian Jaya. I seek leave to have that incorporated.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senate Question
Irian Jaya: call for independence
Senator Brown asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 11 March 1999
1. What response has Australia made to the meeting of 100 West Papuan leaders in Jakarta on 26 February which called for immediate freedom and independence for West Papua or, failing that, an international effort by the United Nations to have dialogue between the West Papuans and the Indonesian government?  A copy of that statement from 100 leaders of the West Papuans has been sent to the Prime Minister and to the leaders of 22 other nations. What response have the Prime Minister and the government of Australia made to these West Papuan leaders?
2. There is fear about this statement having been signed by the 100 leaders, and I ask the minister representing the minister if he would also find out and deliver to the chamber what reassurances he can from Mr Howard about the safety of the 100 leaders who signed that document.
Senator Hill—The answer to the senators question of 11 March, which I took on notice, is as follows:
1. The government has obtained a copy of the statement that Senator Brown referred to, although it did not come directly from the authors. The statement does not ask Australia for a formal response and the government does not intend to provide one. 

2. Australia recognises Indonesian sovereignty over Irian Jaya, which was the result of the United Nations sponsored Act of Free Choice through which the people of Irian Jaya voted for integration with Indonesia. The government, however, has been concerned about reports of human rights abuses in Aeron Jays and has raised these concerns with its Indonesian counterparts on many occasions. As such the government welcomes the commencement of a national dialogue between the Indonesian government and the Irianese people to address issues of concern, including human rights abuses and resources issues.
3. The statement referred to by Senator Brown was put forward in conjunction with the start of this national dialogue and represents the views of some, but not all, of the Irianese participants in that dialogue. The government will continue to monitor the dialogue and hopes that this process will assist in the diffusion of tensions and create a better human rights environment in the province.
4. The government is aware that there have been reports of threats against some of the Irianese who participated in the national dialogue of 26 February. The source of the threats is unclear, and some of them are framed in such a way as to suggest that they have come from other Irianese who were aggrieved at their non-inclusion in the national dialogue process. The government is concerned about the possibility of violence carried out either by Indonesian security personnel or any other groups or organisations, especially given that a process of dialogue has now begun.
5. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta conducted a visit to Aeron Jays from 1 to 7 February, as part of its regular monitoring of developments in the province. During the visit the government's message on the importance of respecting human rights was reiterated to provincial and local government authorities.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>West Papua</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-23,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation entitled Safety of fire doors: notice of investigation and warning to the public . I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Concerns about the safety of consumers in a large number of high occupancy buildings have led 
 me to issue a notice of investigation and warning to the public under section 65B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 .
The Notice advises that a particular type of fire door, that is, fire doors using a Pyrokor core which were manufactured between 1993 and 3 September 1998, are under investigation to determine whether they will or may cause injury to any person. The notice was published in a special Commonwealth Government Gazette on Friday 19 March 1999.
Allegations that these fire doors do not meet mandatory building safety standards were first brought to my attention on 22 February 1999. I then asked the Department of the Treasury to obtain urgent technical advice from State/Territory building regulators and the Australian Building Codes Board on this issue and advise me accordingly.
Fire doors are required to satisfy the safety performance requirements of the Building Code of Australia 1996, which requires the doors to impede the passage of fire through a building. This means that fire doors must be manufactured and installed in accordance with Australian Standard 1905, Part 1.
In accordance with the Australian Standard, fire doors must be subjected to a standard fire test and be fire rated. For example, a fire door with a fire rating of one hour must impede the passage of fire through the door for at least one hour and a 2 hour fire rated door for at least two.
Fire doors therefore provide more time to enable the occupants of a building to evacuate in the event of a fire.
I have been provided with copies of fire door certification schedules which claim the Pyrokor fire doors meet the Building Code requirements. However, I have concerns about the validity of the certifications for two reasons.
Firstly, a number of the fire test reports being referenced actually show that the Pyrokor fire doors did not obtain the minimum fire rating of one hour.
Secondly, test reports on fire doors constructed of different materials were being referenced and reliance on these test reports would be invalid.
Thus the Pyrokor fire doors have been represented as complying with safety requirements, when they may not comply.
The ACCC is currently investigating the certificates of compliance for breaches of sections 52, 53(a) and 55 of the Trade Practices Act which deal with misleading and deceptive conduct and false representations.
This may have serious implications for those with responsibility for the inspection and approval of building works. 

While enforcement of the Building Code of Australia is a State/Territory responsibility, the relevant Departments responsible for building regulation do not enforce the Building Code of Australia. This is done by local Councils, which have the power to approve building construction and declare buildings fit for occupancy or unsafe as the case may be.
If Councils were led to believe that the doors met required standards, they would naturally have approved the buildings. The Department has now written to State/Territory departments responsible for building regulation and asked that this matter be brought to the attention of local councils.
Under the Trade Practices Act 1974 , I have a range of powers to protect the public from unsafe goods. I can publish a notice stating that specified goods are under investigation and warning of the possible risk involved in their use.
I can also order the compulsory recall of goods if it appears to me that the goods ""will or may cause injury"" to any person and the supplier has not taken satisfactory action to prevent the goods causing injury to any person.
Fire doors that do not meet the relevant mandatory safety requirements of the Building Code of Australia may not provide the level of safety and protection expected by the community and Government.
I have also received expert technical advice from CSIRO that the installation of a Pyrokor door that does not meet the safety requirements represents a varying degree of life and property hazard. The hazard could be extreme in situations where the occupants are asleep or incapacitated, for example, hospitals and nursing homes.
In other occupancies, which contain various combinations of smoke detection and fire control systems, the risk to life would be considerably reduced, particularly if the buildings were only occupied for work purposes.
I have been advised that Pyrokor fire doors manufactured between 1993 and 3 September 1998 are installed in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, major shopping centres, stores and supermarkets, high rise home units, government buildings and private business premises.
Before considering the need to order a compulsory recall under the Trade Practices Act, I need to establish conclusively that the fire doors in question fail the Building Code safety requirements and that those failures actually pose a threat to the safety of occupants of buildings.
Minor technical breaches of the safety requirements may not provide sufficient evidence that the Pyrokor fire doors ""will or may cause injury"" and, as a consequence lead me to use my powers to 
 order a compulsory recall under the Trade Practices Act.
I have asked the Department of the Treasury, therefore, to commission urgent testing of the fire doors by the CSIRO, to establish conclusively whether or not the fire doors installed in buildings meet safety requirements and to assess the safety implications, if the fire doors do not meet Building Code fire test requirements. These tests may provide conclusive evidence on which to base a compulsory recall under the Trade Practices Act 1974 .
Although there are varying degrees of risk, I am not prepared to take any chances when there is a potential risk to the lives of consumers and have therefore issued the notice of investigation and warning to the public under section 65B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 .
On completion of the investigation and testing of the Pyrokor fire doors, I will publish a further notice advising what action I intend to take.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Fire Doors</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-03-23,"—I present report No. 19 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled The fifth protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services and five treaties tabled on 30 June 1998 , together with submissions, the Hansard  record of proceedings and minutes, and move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
This report considers a number of bilateral and multilateral treaties which cover international investment, telecommunications, nuclear energy, extradition arrangements, whaling and access to medical treatment for visitors to Australia.
In each case the Committee has concluded that it is in Australia's interest to ratify the proposed treaties.
In the brief time available to me, I will summarise our comments on each the treaties considered in this report.
Although a number of concerns were raised in submissions to the Committee about the Fifth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Committee considers that the Protocol will be of benefit to Australian companies seeking to trade in services in international markets. The 
 Committee does not believe that the Protocol will impose any obligations on Australia that are inconsistent with the financial sector reforms introduced following the Wallis Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System.
The radio frequency management changes resulting from the revision of the International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulations will be of direct benefit to Australian users of the radio frequency spectrum. It will allow greater access to high-frequency broadcasting and mobile satellite services (of particular advantage to people in rural and remote areas), and will minimise interference in distress and emergency calls.
Australia's nuclear safeguard arrangements will be usefully enhanced by the Plutonium Transfer Arrangement with the European Atomic Energy Community. The Transfer Arrangement will maintain the integrity of the safeguards, while at the same time simplifying the transfer of Australian derived plutonium to Japan, Australia's second biggest uranium export market.
The final three treaties considered in the report were also considered to be in Australia's national interest:
the Extradition Treaty with Poland extends Australia's network of modernised extradition arrangements;
the Amendments to the Whaling Convention reflect Australia's continued commitment to the international moratorium on whaling; and
the amendments to the medical services agreement with New Zealand ensure that an appropriate balance is restored to the arrangements that provide reciprocal health care for Australian visitors in New Zealand and New Zealand visitors in Australia.
In conclusion, and on behalf of the Committee Chairman Mr Thomson, can I thank all those who gave evidence to the Committee. By doing so they contributed to the important process of promote greater transparency in the treaty-making process.
I commend the report to the Senate.
—This being a broadcast day, I should explain exactly what is happening here. Up until a short time ago, treaties simply were made between governments and that was the end of that. Since then, a committee has been set up which looks at all the treaties that come Australia's way. An all-party committee looks at them and sees what is in the national interest and what is not, and so gives an oversight of the material that is developed between various countries.
Today, for example, the committee looked at matters dealing with international investment, telecommunications, nuclear energy, extradition arrangements with Poland, whaling and the medical treatment that people from New Zealand can get in Australia—whether they can get that without paying for it or otherwise. The committee deals with matters which, although developed on a worldwide scale, have direct relevance to people in Australia. It develops relationships in a proper way, hopefully, with the rest of the world. I take this opportunity to commend the secretariat, as set out in the report. The secretariat consists of the secretary, Grant Harrison; Ms Cheryl Scarlett; Mr Jon Bonnar, a researcher; and Ms Elizabeth Halliday. Not mentioned is Mr Patrick Regan, who also does great work.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-23,"—I am happy to deal with that, although it is entirely irrelevant to the tax debate; it is a matter of management. The Manager of Opposition Business was contacted by me early yesterday evening, many hours prior to the adjournment—
Senator O'Brien interjecting—
—Yes, indeed. The question was asked in that conversation. I do not reveal private conversations that I have with the Manager of Opposition Business, and he has the same practice. But it is a matter of public record that the debate was adjourned at the conclusion of the debate at the second reading stage. In fact—this is revealing another private discussion—your shadow minister for telecommunications, Mr Smith, approached me on an aeroplane on Sunday night asking when the committee stage would come on. It is actually an issue that both sides have discussed: will we deal with the committee stage this week or not?
The government's position is that the Telstra debate will resume at a time that the government will propose, and it will be when discussions on outstanding issues—with senators who retain an open mind on the progress of the Telstra debate—are concluded. That is where it is at. It has been very open. It has been no secret. The Manager of Oppo 
 sition Business was informed within minutes of the government making that decision. I asked if he would raise it. All other senators in this place were informed through either my secretary, the Manager of Government Business or the PLO.
—All the fuss last night was pathetic.
—I do not know whether Senator O'Brien is out of the loop or not, but Senator Carr certainly did not raise any objections or discussions with me. Maybe there is a problem with communications on the opposition side. I certainly communicated the decision of the government, within minutes of it being made, to Senator Carr, which is what I always seek to do.

However, it is a fair question and let me answer it.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-23,"—I want to add something in response to Senator Cook's answer to my question, and I thank Senator Cook for responding. I was talking in my contribution—and I am sure this has been reported to Senator Cook—about the position taken in relation to the government's compliance concerns for some elements of business and, as Senator Cook would be well aware, how little that concern seems to extend to community groups and charity groups in relation to the new ANTS tax package. I also compared it to some of the elements of compliance cost that have been shovelled onto social security recipients, otherwise known these days, or hidden, as clients.
I have a list from 1994, but I guess that was a previous government. But, from 1996, the list reads like a nightmare. There were changes in July 1996, January 1997, March 1997, July 1997, September 1997, several changes in January 1998, several changes in July 1998 and March 1998. These changes have added to the complexity and onerous nature of 
 compliance for people on all sorts of social security benefits. I wonder whether we are being asked to take concern for only one group of people—that is, certain groups within industry—and say, `Okay, even if what you are doing is basically tax avoidance, we will overlook that provided there is a compliance cost involved.'
I can see that I am not going to win on this one, but I felt it was necessary to put on the record that we have two ways of dealing with people. If you are in business, we will be concerned about your time and compliance costs. If you are already struggling, and if you are already in difficulties in relation to being a recipient of some kind of social security payment, then that compliance cost is irrelevant or is just seen to be an issue of accountability. Here we have an issue of accountability which is passed over simply because it is a business cost and considered to be a compliance cost. I believe that really is double standards, to say the least. But I can count and I realise what the result will be.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-23,"—I would just say to the minister that I think the point made is a good one for government to look at, and that is: if the principle of compliance and simplicity is to be established across all taxation legislation, we should be as alert to the impact on individuals and those who are least capable in our community as we are to the impact on businesses. I think that is a useful point to note.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-03-23,"—I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  and to explain to my fellow Tasmanians why most of this policy is bad for Australia and even worse for Tasmania. I am often asked by my constituents why we are blocking the government's reform agenda in the Senate and whether it be political point scoring. The answer to those questions is that we have no choice if I am to do my job of protecting and agitating for the best outcomes for Australians but, more importantly, for Tasmanians.
If we were dealing with well thought out policies that were going to allow equity and access to quality services regardless of income or geography, then the story might be different. But that is not the case. So I rise again to address the obvious deficiencies in this policy, as, without changes, it will damage the 
 integrity of our health system and compromise the health of the Australian citizen. If the private health care industry had a track record of maintaining a balance between premium rises and a concern for the health of Australians, we may have supported this bill in its entirety, but that is not the case.
Most of us will remember prior to Christmas the debate concerning the last wave of bills passed by the present government that, in effect, gave public taxes to subsidise private health care when, due to the savagery of the cuts in public health care expenditure, that system is haemorrhaging. This act of public health terrorism revealed that the true agenda of the government is to introduce an American-style health system into this country by transferring public revenue to private companies, largely based outside this country. Thus, the audacity of some parts of this bill is staggering when you realise that part of the intention is to allow greater freedom for the private health industry to set its own charges by moving the monitoring of premium increases away from the minister's office and into the hands of the industry.
The cost to the public inherent in this bill has to be realised by the Australian public as it could be astronomical. The reason for this is that the Australian taxpayer is now subsidising 30 per cent of the cost of premiums. This is not a capped amount but a percentage. Thus, as premiums increase, so does the Australian taxpayers' liability; and if by some miracle the percentage of members increases, that also represents a tax liability.
The public needs to be aware of just how much the liability will be. For every one per cent increase in the population taking up private health cover, it will cost $45 million per annum, based on the 30 per cent rebate. For every one per cent increase in premiums, it will cost the government an average of $13 million, based on the 30 per cent rebate. Remember that every dollar paid to the private health insurers represents money that will not be available for public health expenditure—money that will not be available to reduce the waiting lists and money that will not be available in Tasmania to fix the huge shortfall in the health budget that is a 
 legacy of the Howard government. This has been compounded by the government's state colleagues, who paid the same bill twice and raided the trust funds of community groups in an attempt to cover up the callous indifference their federal colleagues showed by reducing health care to Tasmania in real terms.
Again, this government's ideological drive will devastate regional and rural Australia. There is no reference to social costs in their economic models and no reference to economies of scale and higher infrastructure costs that are not due to inefficiencies of the public model but are inherent in smaller communities' economies and are further compounded in Tasmania by the inadequate compensation given by this government to address the island status of my home state.
Not only does this bill seek to remove from public control premium increases; it also seeks to remove the obligations to cover palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation. The reason the private health insurers have for jettisoning this aspect of the coverage is purely profit driven and vividly illustrates the inherent problems when too much reliance is placed on private industry for all our health care.
This amendment will serve to shift the higher cost aspects of health care away from the private industry and onto the back of the public. The costs of rehabilitation and palliative and psychiatric care are often high due to the length of time involved in these services and, thus, would represent a substantial shift in bed time allocation away from the private and onto the public purse. This policy is essentially aimed at removing the care of the elderly and terminally ill away from the hands of the private insurers, in a callous disregard for the health needs of Australians, by not offering the choice that has been the main plank that industry and government have used to argue for their policy position.
The inconsistencies of both the private health insurers and the government become apparent. The justification used by this government for maintaining a private industry has been the sacred chalice called `choice'. But when it comes to rehabilitation and 
 palliative and psychiatric care, choice is no longer important. Thus, we see that the government's real obligation is not to look after the health care of Australians, particularly that of the elderly and terminally ill, but to look after their friends in the private health industry.
The cost focus of the private health industry becomes further evident when it is realised that, although it no longer wants responsibility for palliative, psychiatric and rehabilitation care, it wants to cover office based surgery. The cost of providing day surgery is small in comparison with long-term treatments, and the occasions of service are numerous. Thus, the industry would make large profits with small initial outlays. However, some day surgery requires specialist equipment and expertise, and that is why the AMA stated in their submission that owing to the lack of `detail relating to the administrative requirements for ministerial approval for facilities or procedures', it is not in a position to endorse the arrangements.
Interestingly, I saw an article in the press at the weekend about this very issue—day surgery and some of the people performing day surgery not having the expertise to back up the decisions they make in using anaesthetics to knock out their patients, or whatever they do. It is apparently causing quite a few problems, and it is an area that needs to be looked at. Thus, a common theme rears its head—lack of detail. In other words, ill-conceived and superficial policy aimed at appeasing the people in the private health industry, with some tokenistic policy thrown in to give the appearance that they are concerned with the health of ordinary Australians. Not only could this bill allow private health insurers eventually to set their own levels of premiums, without the ministerial discretion that now exists; it could result in undermining the control of specialists' fees that exists via Medicare. If the private insurers were allowed to set charges for specialists, as in the United States, the result would most likely be the same as the American result—a dramatic increase in the fees that specialists charge and the two-tier health system would be well on its way.
It pleases me that there are some aspects of this bill we can support. We are a responsible opposition and have proven that, when policy is in the best interests of the Australian public, we do support it, regardless of where it originates. The loyalty bonus seeks to reward those individuals who have stuck with their private insurers. Given the recent track record of the private health insurance industry, they should receive a medal for loyalty, not just a bonus. But the intent of the policy is sound, so we support it, proving yet again that we are not obstructionist unless the wellbeing of Australian society is in danger of being compromised.
We also support longer waiting list periods for some types of medical treatment in an attempt to address the hit-and-run phenomena that can disadvantage other consumers of private health, and we conditionally support a limited exemption of the pharmaceutical gap payment for in-hospital expenses, provided a strict definition applies. I wish the Howard government would think through their policy direction so that we can waste less time continually helping them get it right.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-23,"—In this debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 , let me say at the outset that the Democrats are more than just a little disappointed with this government's obsession with private health insurance. This year, certainly, every piece of legislation that we have so far dealt with, or are planning to deal with, relates in some way to private health insurance. Surely it is about time this government started focusing on many of the real issues in health, focusing on the key issues that actually affect all of our health system—public and private. Perhaps it is about time it took another look at the Industry Commission recommendation that a broad inquiry should be conducted into Australia's health system to make sure that it is sustainable, that it is one that is going to suit and serve us as we move to the year 2000 and beyond.
We certainly support a full inquiry of some sort. Indeed, we have been working towards it in a small way on our own by trying to 
 bring together interested individuals and groups that want to have some discussions about the future of our health service and its structure. But, as we see yet another piece of legislation here dealing yet again with private health insurance, we wonder if the government is not so focused on this issue that it has forgotten about virtually everything else.
Surely it is about time we looked at some of the major structural problems in our health system, the clashes between state and federal and the overlaps there that allow so much buck-passing and cost shifting, and to look too at some of the many work force issues. I know that the minister has an interest in some of these, but we do not see anything coming from this government that really will start addressing in some concrete form, firstly, the issue of where doctors are and where they are not. That isn't just rural; it is also in outlying areas around our capital cities, areas between what is generally described as rural Australia and the cities. We also need to be looking at allied health professionals, at nurses, and at midwifery in particular. But we see very little evidence that the government is interested in these issues.
We should be looking at better integration of the health system and how we can get various sectors of the health industry working far better together—not just protecting their patches but actually working to deliver more efficient and better quality care. There is the whole issue of dental health. The government has simply decided to defund the Commonwealth dental program, pass it back to the states and hope for the best. Well, the best has not happened. It has been an absolute disaster. When we hear so many people who are interested in this area telling us of the health consequences of people waiting 12 months, 14 months, two years and more in some parts of rural Australia to have basic fillings attended to, we see the need to integrate those issues and the whole question of dental health back into the Commonwealth's health program. We should be looking at developing better information management in health care so that we have the data available, shared between all players, to enable us to better plan and deliver services. Then, of 
 course, there are all the other areas, including mental health and Aboriginal health. But we are here again dealing with private health insurance.
I will go very quickly through the bill. Schedule 1 part 1 clarifies and formalises the current practices of offering premium discounts in specific circumstances. Generally, the Democrats are supportive of the basic thrust of these changes. We have argued in the past that private health insurance funds should be more innovative in developing products that meet consumers' needs. But we do have some concerns about the equity implications of this measure. The less well-off will be less likely to have the financial resources to be able to pay up-front, to pay in advance, and therefore higher income earners are going to be the ones more likely offered the discounts because they can pay up-front. They are far more likely than low income earners to be able to put the money in as part of salary packaging. However, we do appreciate that if the discounts are there they are based on improved administrative arrangements and so those less able to benefit from this measure will not actually be paying for the measure that is offered to others. As the minister determines by disallowable instrument the maximum discount able to be offered, we are satisfied that there is reasonable opportunity for this practice to be scrutinised, and therefore we will be supporting it.
Schedule 1 part 2 introduces another mechanism to encourage loyalty to the private health insurance company and therefore to encourage people to continue their private health insurance. The bill states that bonuses must not undermine the principle of community rating, but we do have some concerns as to how this is actually going to be interpreted. For example, although the legislation currently requires adherence to community rating principles, we are aware that some policies already arguably undermine this basic principle with all the exclusions they have begun to build in. You can get policies leaving out joint replacements and policies leaving out bypass surgery. So I do question what is happening in this area. I have not heard anything from the minister about any 
 government concerns, so presumably they are not worried about that being a problem. I understand that any bonuses would have to be offered to all policyholders who have that particular type of policy, but I still think there is some scope for undermining the principle of community rating by selecting the policies for which these bonuses are offered. I appreciate that the Senate would be able to scrutinise any guidelines for bonuses specified in regulations, and therefore we will be supporting this measure today.
Schedule 1 part 3 proposes that waiting periods may be extended for certain conditions, ailments or illnesses, but as yet these have not been specified to us. The aim is to discourage the practice of people opportunistically taking out private health insurance, getting whatever the procedure is that they want, that they had planned for, and then opting out maybe for the next 10 or 15 years until they want another procedure. But it is not clear whether, or how much, this would discourage such practice. There is some potential for it to be used to discriminate against people with particular conditions or perhaps specific disabilities.
Therefore, we are moving an amendment requiring the minister to take into account the impact of extending waiting periods on specific groups in the community and also the impact on the public health system. This amendment also requires the minister to consider evidence—I stress the word `evidence'—that the relevant illnesses and conditions are actually being subjected to this hit-and-run practice now. I presume that the health insurance funds did have that evidence before they pushed the minister to put this particular legislation through parliament. We must see that there is a genuine reason for the funds wanting to extend the waiting period for those illnesses.
Schedule 1 part 4: the Democrats support the proposal to allow health funds to pay the co-payment for pharmaceutical benefits. This is a sensible option and one I congratulate the government for. It is about time that we dealt with the whole issue of out-of-pocket expenses for people who go into hospital believing that they have 100 per cent cover. I encourage 
 the minister to work with industry to get rid of out-of-pocket expenses, which I think is one of the greatest impediments to people taking out private health insurance. This is for those who have 100 per cent cover and, as I said, it is a sensible move.
Schedule 1 part 5: the Democrats do appreciate that, due to advances in medical technology, certain procedures may now be safely performed both outside of the normal hospital setting and also outside a day surgery hospital. We believe that, where appropriate, consumers undergoing minor procedures should have some choice and if they so choose they could have the more convenient location and what would often be a lower cost option. We are, however, concerned that this measure could disadvantage uninsured patients. Again, this government's fixation with private health insurance and those who have that is to the detriment of those who choose to stay with the public system. Under this proposal, the Medicare rebate is going to drop from 85 per cent of the schedule fee to 75 per cent. The idea is that the fund picks up the rest, but those people who are not privately insured will face a bigger out-of-pocket expense than they do now. I point out to those listening now that the number of patients who are attending private day surgery facilities who are not insured is increasing rapidly. Indeed, in some day surgery centres the majority of people attending are not privately insured.
Therefore, more and more Australians are looking at private health insurance, even with the 30 per cent rebate, and saying, `No, thank you. I will insure myself. I will put money away month by month, and have a small nest egg there, should I ever require it.' Why should we disadvantage those people who are making a conscious decision to look after themselves and are not choosing an insurance product?
I am aware that a number of groups have raised concerns about this with the minister and also that some of these groups have ranged out into the whole issue of quality control and have raised concerns about that. The Democrats believe it is vital that, in changing the venue for surgical procedures, 
 the risk of cross-infection, or indeed any adverse event at all, is minimised. Therefore, we will be supporting the opposition's amendments to require approved facilities to meet the same accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to day surgeries under the relevant state or territory legislation.
We will also be supporting the opposition's amendment which clarifies that procedures specified for the additional benefit are limited to those that are actually relocated from a hospital or day surgery or presumably, in some cases, to doctor's rooms. We also support the opposition's request to the House of Representatives to provide an increased rebate to uninsured patients—in other words, that they should not be dropped back to the 75 per cent.
Schedule 2 is an area that the Democrats simply cannot support. We have faced this battle before where funds want to deliberately take out anything relating to psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation. It is not fair and reasonable to do that. In fact, we do not know why they want to do it when few of the procedures would probably fall into this area, and when the measure is going to be determined by the minister anyway. I see it as another attempt by the funds to get rid of procedures that are often expensive and that are often long-term problems that do not have easy day surgery procedures to fix them. They often involve a lengthy hospital stay and to want to exclude them from this is not satisfactory. Indeed, there may well be times when it is highly appropriate.
Looking at schedule 3—the last schedule—we strongly disagree with the transferring of responsibility for increases in premiums away from the minister. I think this is an example of how worried the minister is about the long-term benefits of the 30 per cent rebate—the fact that here we have in the next bill a measure that will mean the minister is no longer responsible for okaying premium increases. Basically, the government has put $1.6 billion a year, year after year, into an insurance product but they are still worried, obviously, about the increase in premiums. They want to move that responsibility away from the minister. We believe that the only 
 consideration for an increase in premiums should be that of public interest and that, by far, the minister is the one to do that. We will therefore be supporting the opposition's amendment to remove reference to adversely affecting interests of the private health insurance industry from the list of grounds. We will actually be moving an amendment to make sure that the government and the minister maintain responsibility for setting premiums.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-23,"—These amendments to the act incorporated in the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  have the effect of allowing funds to offer discounts in some quite restricted circumstances. The restrictions on the circumstances seem specifically designed to counter each of the arguments against allowing discounting. For example, there are only four grounds on which a discount may be allowed: (1) it is paid at least six months in advance; (2) it is paid through a payroll deduction; (3) it is paid through a direct debit from an account at a bank or other financial institution; or (4) it is paid on behalf of the contributor concerned, because the contributor is to be treated, under the rules of the organisation, as belonging to a contribution group.
In other words, the discount is allowed on the basis of administrative savings, which can accrue to the fund from providing coverage in a particular way or to a particular group, and not on the basis of a particular group being selected by virtue of their health status. That would very obviously undermine the principle of community rating. We are talking about a group, probably selected on the basis of their common employment, where an employer permits or perhaps arranges payroll deduction or maybe even where an employer offers health insurance through a particular fund as a fringe benefit or part of a salary package. In effect, we are encouraging the employer to choose the health package for their employees.
Does that undermine the principle of community rating? Yes, it does. In the same way as indirect and structural discrimination can have adverse consequences for disadvantaged 
 groups without specifically mentioning them, this change provides for an indirect assault on the principle underlying the community rating system. It is not a full frontal assault but it is an assault nevertheless. It is more of a `nibble away at the edges' kind of assault and an `undermine the fundamentals' kind of assault.
It is probably instructive here to go back and have a look at what those fundamentals are. The basic principle is that all Australians should have equality of access to private health insurance, whatever their health, age or risk factors. If that principle were breached, there would be an explosion in costs for many of those who need health insurance the most. Funds would probably drop coverage of whole sections of the population altogether. Pursuit of profit would triumph over provision of service. To keep that menace at bay, we have legislated a system whereby all people going into a fund pay the same amount for the same service. It is a fair system. We do not have cheaper entry for the well-off, who tend to have better health. We do not have cheaper entry for younger people who tend to have better health or cheaper entry for employed people who, again, tend to have better health.
So what does this amendment do? It gives a discount to people who are in employment. You do not get payroll deductions from your dole! It gives a discount to people who are in particular types of employment—employment where you are more likely to get paid fringe benefits and employment where you get offered salary packaging. I remind honourable senators that if you suddenly become unemployed and lose your income, you do not get a break from your health fund. In other words, they will not say, `We will pause your premiums while you are in the situation where you do not have an income.' Basically, if you are unemployed, you lose any long-term benefits which may accrue as a result of this legislation.
Who do the benefits target? Not the low income battler. Not the older worker in manual labour nor trade workers. No. They target the younger, upwardly mobile professional in the higher income brackets—the very people the funds are after because they 
 do not get sick as much. What is the problem with that? Well, a comparative advantage for those people is a comparative disadvantage for others. It is undermining the principle of community rating and it is doing it by the back door. It is trying to obscure the fact of what it is doing by putting up caveats about the discount being equivalent to the savings in administration to the funds, the discounts can be limited by the minister and so on.
But, whichever way you look at it, the principle is being eroded and you only have to look at who stands to benefit from access to the discounts and who misses out to see that. You only have to see what it might lead to. If it is based on savings to the funds, what things would bring further savings to the funds? That includes making different kinds of coverage for different levels of health. If there are administrative savings to be made through payroll deductions, they should be shared by all fund members in the form of reduced premiums or improved services and coverage, not given directly to those who need them least.
Before I leave the discount issue, I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to the wording of the saving provision. I will not read it, you will be pleased to hear; but I commend a sentence to senators when they are looking for a piece of legislative gobbledegook to use an example of incomprehensible writing. In nine lines of conditional clauses and qualifying phrases, it manages to say what the Bills Digest quite adequately sums up in eight words: `Existing discount arrangements will be permitted to continue'. Where is the Scrutiny of Bills Committee when we need them!
On the face of it, a scheme to reward those who have maintained their health cover over a long period seems like a good idea, particularly when there are safeguards built in to ensure that access to the loyalty bonus is available on an equitable basis. The safeguards in 5M(b)(i-v) appear to rule out any kind of no claim bonus, and that is welcome. However, this is another variation, another move away from the `one size fits all' principle which underlies community rating. It does not by itself introduce anything of great 
 concern but it points in a rather worrying direction, in much the same way as the discount provisions discussed earlier do.
What concerns me is that we do not have all the facts about how this might impact on different sectors of the community. Will it have a differential effect on poorer people who may not have been able to maintain continuity of coverage, as I mentioned earlier? Will it be more readily available to those in the population who coincidentally have statistically better health? In other words, will it achieve in a de facto—albeit marginal—way the same outcomes as an erosion of community rating? And will it be used in the future by this government—if they are still in government in the future—to say that because we have voted in a particular way on a particular principle once we would do so again, thus moving closer to community rating? Answers to these questions are best explored in the context of an overall inquiry into health funding. I will return to that theme in a moment.
The provision of `greater product flexibility' in relation to waiting periods is intended to inhibit the practice of dipping into the health insurance system for short-term exploitation of it. I have no problem with the intent; my concern is with the mechanism employed. The bill will allow various waiting periods to apply for different ailments, illnesses or conditions, but the periods are not spelt out in the bill. They will be determined by regulation. How often have we seen that, for the absolute core of what we are being asked to decide on, we have to wait until we see regulations, and we generally do not see those regulations until after the bill has passed through.
I am always concerned when previously entrenched safeguards slip back into `regulations'. The scrutiny falls away and with it goes the rights of individuals—in this case, the right to coverage for which they have paid. Without knowing which conditions will be subject to which waiting periods, I would find it very hard to support this part of the bill. Yes, of course these regulations may be disallowable, but what are the clients of 
 health care left with if we disallow certain instruments?
The pharmaceutical benefits costs amendments are another example of tinkering at the edges—in this case, probably to provide some benefit, particularly to contributors with 100 per cent cover. The approved facilities part of the bill allows for some doctors' surgeries to become `approved procedures facilities' and will mean that procedures conducted there will be covered as if they were being conducted in a hospital or day hospital. This recognises the changing nature of medical technology and medical practice, and is quite welcome in many respects.
There is one area of potential concern with this part of the bill, however, and it would be interesting to hear the minister's thoughts on this. The issue is that of accreditation or approval of the premises. Will the same standards be applied to approval of these premises as would be applied to accreditation of facilities for the same procedures in a hospital or day hospital? Will the same safeguards be in place? I note that Senator Harradine has proposed an amendment on this issue and I shall be closely following the discussion on that. We have also heard that the Labor Party have some amendments in relation to accreditation. That is obviously important, because we do not want the cost of health care to be such that people are driven to a decision for day treatment when in fact the best option for them may be hospital coverage.
There are, of course, consequential amendments after that, but let us return to the issue of the inquiry. As I said, these issues are best explored in total in the context of an overall inquiry into health funding. That is what I moved by way of amendment when we were debating the 30 per cent rebate bill—the $1.7 billion government gift to private health funds. The need for such a wide-ranging inquiry has been well established. The Productivity Commission, in its 1996 inquiry, recommended a broad public inquiry into Australia's health system. The commission's own assessment of its role could equally well be applied in the context of the current bill. It said:
The Commission emphasises that its proposals are essentially incremental in nature and designed to alleviate the problems of the health insurance industry in the short term. A long-term solution will require more. Private health insurance is a cog in a machine. One can burnish the gears of that cog, but ultimately its performance and functioning depend on the rest of the machine. There are grounds therefore for looking at other aspects of the health system through a wider public review.
They said that such an inquiry should encompass: health financing, including state-federal cost shifting incentives; integrated health systems and coordinated care; the role of co-payments; competitive neutrality between players in the system; market power exerted by players in the system, including supply constraints in the medical market; community rating; information management in health care; and progress of protocol development.
Throughout the Senate committee inquiry into the 30 per cent rebate, the need for such an inquiry into the whole issue of health financing was a recurring theme. Many of the witnesses during the committee hearings believed that a thorough inquiry would be a worthwhile exercise to provide a blueprint for long-term sustainable health policy. The Australian Nursing Federation agreed with an inquiry as a way of making sure the finite amount of funding is applied in the best way possible. The Consumers Health Forum of Australia noted:
We have certainly supported the notion of having a major inquiry into the funding structure of our health system.
A variety of health economists also supported the call for a broader review. For instance, Mr Brent Walker of Macquarie University said in his submission:
None of the current policy provisions of the Australian Government appear to realistically address the long term health cost trends identified and quantified in this research. The Productivity Commission in its recent report on private health insurance recommended a `broad public inquiry into Australia's health system'. The Australian Government did not accept this recommendation. It should reconsider its opinion.
I agree. Yes it should. Similarly, Mr lan McAuley from the University of Canberra submitted: 
There is a need for broad public debate and research into health care financing. This was the strongest recommendation of the Industry Commission in its 1997 report into private health insurance—a recommendation the Government ignored.
The Australian Healthcare Association called for `a strategic and collaborative review of long term options.' The Greens (WA) believe that health funding cannot be fixed by tinkering around the edges. Similar sentiments were raised by the Australian Healthcare Association, which said:
The issue will not go away by minor adjustments on the margins, and yet hardly anyone is engaged in a search for the middle ground, much less for changes which will benefit the community as a whole.
The current bill is another example of minor adjustments at the margins, of tinkering around the edges. It will not contribute significantly to resolving the crisis in health care in this country—a crisis which is, more than anything, a crisis of funding. In broad terms, the solution is more funds, better targeted. More specific answers can be found only by the kind of comprehensive inquiry we have been calling for and which has been called for by many other well versed people in the community. I therefore move the following second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add ""and that the following matter be referred to the Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by the last sitting day in November, 1999:
Australia's health system, with particular reference to the issues outlined in Recommendation 22 of the Industry Commission's report on its inquiry into the Private Health Insurance Industry (Report No. 57, February 1997)"".
The government representatives again and again have said, `Look, there has been an Industry Commission inquiry into health care.' The very recommendation of that inquiry has not been acted on. We are being asked to move further in the direction of benefiting the private health funds. We will no doubt see further changes being asked for. We know it is likely that those changes will move closer to community rating—we know that the Australian Medical Association are already talking about this as an issue. But we 
 are doing this in the absence of a proper inquiry into appropriate and effective health care funding—not just about health insurance.
I guess I am pretty concerned that the move towards such things as accrual accounting might mean that some of these issues get lost in the changes in budgets in the future. However, what I do ask of the Senate is that you consider this proposal, which we have brought up before—it is not new. I am hoping that you have had discussions within your party rooms about it. We know it is supported within the wider community. I would like to ask that there be support in the Senate chamber for such an inquiry so that we know, even if this bill gets through—and I hope it goes through with some amendments—that there is going to be an agreement that we will look at the issue of general health care funding in the future and that those issues will be properly debated in a proper context.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-23,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  represents another measure in the government's ad hoc, confused and sometimes contradictory attempt to prop up the private health insurance industry. What we really need is a holistic and comprehensive approach to addressing the real problems that exist in the private health insurance industry and the real endemic factors that are preventing people from taking up health insurance. What we see again with this bill is that the government has not responded in that holistic and comprehensive way. As a result its approach to this matter really suffers and I do not think we are going to get the sort of public policy response that really is required in this area.
That is not to say that Labor does not support some of the initiatives in the bill, because we do. Some of them are overdue attempts to tackle those underlying issues I referred to that are driving the long-term decline in the number of Australians who are taking out private health insurance. These changes in the bill that I mention are a step in the right direction and should have been made before the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate, because I think that would have 
 been a much better process. Nevertheless, we have to deal with what we have to deal with.
We very vigorously oppose some of the core changes in this bill, particularly those that move to deregulate the control of the price of premiums. We think it is staggering that, at the same time the government has basically purchased 30 per cent of the private health insurance industry in this country by deciding to provide that rebate, we are seeking to remove the minister's powers to regulate premium price increases. We have just bought 30 per cent of the industry. We have decided to prop it up to finance the provision of that industry in this country. At the same time as we put a massive $1.7 billion of public funds into that industry we have a measure proposed today where the government intends to remove its ability to control the premiums, to relinquish control of that part of the industry which we are subsidising. Quite frankly, I find that staggering.
Usually governments seek to have accountability for, and control of, the funds that they invest. Here we have a massive investment in an industry, a measure which the Labor opposition opposed, being followed quite shortly afterwards by a political decision to move out of the effective monitoring of price increases in that industry. At its core it is a very poor decision by the government, and the Labor Party will be opposing and seeking to amend that approach.
It is interesting that the title of the bill has changed, another reflection of the confusion and alterations that are occurring in this area. The bill also does not include the  original schedule 6 that was in the bill as originally proposed. It seems that in consulting about the bill the government chose not to consult the Australian Medical Association. The explanatory memorandum for the current bill states under the heading `Consultation':
. . . the key industry associations plus major funds and consumer representatives have been consulted. Those associations are the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Australian Health Insurance Association . . . 
The AMA still does not get a mention. I pointed out in Senate estimates that it was 
 excluded in the original bill and the department assured me that there had been some, if only minor, consultation with the AMA. But it is interesting that the AMA is still not listed as being a party which has been consulted.
Clearly, it has been able to have some influence over this bill because schedule 6 is no longer there. Again, this reflects the government's ad hoc and confused approach to this bill and to the problems of the private health insurance industry. That whole schedule was removed after a bit of pressure was put on the minister and cabinet reconsidered the decision and removed that section. That again reflects the fact that there is not a comprehensive, holistic public policy at work here. There is a series of ad hoc, sometimes unconnected, measures that do not really deal in a proper way with the problems that confront private health insurance and private health in this country.
The context of this bill is very important because we have just seen the most massive investment of Commonwealth funds in private industry in the form of the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. It is a massive contribution of public money to prop up the private health insurance industry, and now the Senate has been asked to vote for further changes to that industry. So, despite all the claims made about how that particular measure was going to save the private health insurance industry, one suspects that the government now accepts that the rebate is not going to solve the problems of the industry and that much more is needed. In fact, as the early evidence suggests, the private health insurance rebate is not going to do the job that the government promised.
It seems that the government has blind faith in the value of the rebate. But at the recent Senate estimates it was interesting that the department again admitted that no research had been done to determine the possible effectiveness of the 30 per cent rebate among the groups that it was targeted at. So there has been no proper research as to the likely effectiveness of the rebate.
The private health insurance industry provided evidence that the rebate would 
 increase private health insurance membership numbers from the current 30 per cent of the population to 45 per cent of the population. I think that the government, in moving this bill, is signalling that it does not believe that sort of claim. It is recognising that the problems of private health insurance are far more fundamental and that it is going to need a much broader approach to deal with these problems.
It is not clear at this stage how effective the rebate has been in its initial three months of operation. The figures will not be available to us until mid-May. That is when we will get a real assessment of whether or not this massive injection of public funds has done anything to solve what has been a long-term decline in private health insurance membership in this country. The Labor Party has predicted that it will not, and we opposed the bill. I think the early evidence is that the government will not get the sort of response that it had hoped for and that even the government's more modest targets will not be met.
The bill at its core seeks to add deregulation to the government's policy mix of answers for the problems of the private health insurance industry. The main thrust of this bill is to deregulate the private health insurance industry. I understand more bills have been foreshadowed which will further reduce regulation of the private health insurance sector and that we can expect those soon. Central to the regulation of the PHI sector is the maintenance of a community rating that ensures that the risks and costs are spread across groups to ensure that insurance remains affordable to everyone in the community. In this way the private health insurance sector complements the central form of health insurance in Australia; that is, the Medicare system.
Labor supports a number of the measures contained in the bill on the basis that they are beneficial to the entire health system, not just the small part that is the private health insurance sector. While there are clearly problems in the private health insurance sector, for the vast majority of Australians the problems in the health system concern the waiting lists in the public hospitals. This bill 
 will do nothing to reduce those waiting lists. This government is devoting large amounts of money and effort to attempting to reform the private health insurance industry when only 30 per cent of the population is covered by that industry. The amendments proposed by Labor will attempt to overcome the government's blind spot by extending the proposed funding arrangements for approved facilities to Medicare.
Any attempt to reform the health sector, while ignoring the 70 per cent of people who rely on Medicare to provide their health care, will ultimately be inequitable and ineffective. Labor does not support any move to make private health insurance the only route to proper medical treatment. This would lead to a two-tiered system in which those that can afford private health insurance get appropriate health care and everyone else gets what is left over.
In terms of the specific measures in the bill, schedule 3 provides for a process that will remove the government's involvement in the approval of premium increases. As an interim step, the approval of premium increases will be delegated to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, PHIAC. The bill provides no criteria to guide PHIAC in approving increases nor any requirements to adopt guidelines or publicly explain its decisions. The bill provides no cap on the increases that PHIAC can approve.
The government appears to be shy about the effect of schedule 3. In the second reading speech on the bill, delivered yesterday, the effect of schedule 3 is described in the following terms:
. . . Schedule 3 takes care of [a] few administrative matters allowing for the transfer of the `rates of contribution' rule change provisions from the Minister to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council prior to the repeal of these provisions in the medium term.
As a result of those `few administrative matters' the minister will no longer be responsible for approving private health  insurance premium increases. The minister will no longer be responsible.
It was only in 1997 that the Prime Minister took personal responsibility for monitoring 
 and approving those increases in response to public concern about the large increases in private health insurance premiums in this country. At that stage the government was very gung-ho about taking political responsibility and ensuring that the increases were moderate and the funds accountable. Here we are, two years later, and the government wants to slide away from any responsibility. The minister does not want the power to monitor premium increases, he wants to hand it over to PHIAC. What happened to all the political courage about monitoring private health insurance premiums? It is clear that the government does not want to know any longer. They know the premiums will continue to increase. They do not want to wear any political heat, but the real irony is that this is the same government that has just put $1.7 billion into propping up the industry. So they want to prop up the industry but they do not want to wear any of the consequences of or ensure accountability for that public investment. It is an amazing stance to take in terms of effective public policy.
It is important to note that, as a result of the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998, the Commonwealth will fund 30 per cent of any increase approved by the PHIAC. The last stage in deregulating prices in the sector would abolish all control of premium rates and effectively leave prices up to the individual funds. There are no minimum time frames set on the deregulation of premiums. The move to either PHIAC approved increases or the complete deregulation of premiums could be very soon after the bill is enacted. As premiums rise, so will the cost of the rebate provided by the Commonwealth—by Australian taxpayers—drawing more and more resources out of the public health system into propping up the private health insurance system. It is extraordinary that we would make that sort of public policy decision, and the Labor Party will not be supporting it.
Schedule 3 represents the minister's efforts to avoid his responsibility for approving the premiums. It is interesting to note that the minister recently approved a 22 per cent 
 increase in the premiums for the Defence Health Benefits Fund that wiped out any benefits someone in that scheme would have gained under the 30 per cent rebate. The minister is obviously worried that under the current arrangements he will be forced to defend his approval of a number of further premium increases in other health funds later this year. These increases will start the process that Labor warned of: the erosion of the value of the 30 per cent rebate.
In the face of the large increases in premiums over the last few years—the premiums for hospital cover increased 30 per cent between July 1996 and August 1998—this government's solution is to simply deregulate the sector and duck political responsibility on the issue. Labor will be proposing amendments to limit the deregulation of premiums and to specify a minimum period in which any changes are introduced.
Another section of schedule 3 allows the minister to disallow rule changes amongst health funds on the basis that they are against the public interest or against the interests of the private health insurance industry. We have grave concerns about the second of these tests as it could be used to reduce competition or force funds to operate in a political way. Labor will be proposing amendments to delete the second test on which the minister can allow rule changes.
Labor supports the objectives of the bill, which are to make the private health insurance industry more efficient and to encourage the funds to offer more attractive products. The principal measures being proposed to achieve this objective are to permit loyalty discounts for longstanding members and allow discounts for bulk buyers, for example employers. With the safeguards built into the bill, these measures are acceptable to us. Labor will be supporting schedule 1, parts 1 and 2 of the bill.
Labor also agrees that it is unfair on other fund members if some people are allowed to hit-and-run by joining a health fund for a short time for the purposes of obtaining a treatment and then leaving the fund. Labor 
 will be supporting schedule 1, part 3 of the bill.
Labor agrees with the proposal to allow health funds to cover the patient co-payment of pharmaceutical products dispensed within private hospitals where this is done as part of a product that offers no gap coverage. Labor will be supporting schedule 1, part 4 of the bill. This measure is to ensure that patients are not provided with large quantities of drugs prior to being discharged. This would increase the costs borne by the health funds and therefore encourage increases in premiums and the cost of the rebate to the Commonwealth.
The bill also proposes to allow health funds to cover a new facilities benefit for approved facilities that would be chargeable to cover the additional cost of equipment needed to undertake office based surgery in a safe environment. However, the amount covered by the existing Medicare benefits for the procedure will fall from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. The health fund will cover both the 25 per cent gap between Medicare and the schedule fee and the new facilities benefit.
The introduction of the facilities benefit is a significant change, providing for two tiers. Doctors treating privately insured patients will receive the Medicare schedule fee and the facilities benefit. Doctors treating public patients will receive only 85 per cent of the Medicare schedule fee.
If procedures to be carried out in approved facilities are cost effective then it would make sense to provide similar benefits to Medicare recipients to encourage their use of these facilities, that is, Medicare should provide for a rebate equivalent to the facilities benefit that private insured patients are eligible for. Labor will be requesting that the House insert a provision in the bill to this effect.
The proposal for extending health fund coverage to approved facilities does not require them to meet the existing controls on day care facilities. There are no additional resources or powers for the Commonwealth to undertake a monitoring role. There is no provision for states to carry out the inspection and quality control role that they currently carry out in private hospitals and day surgeries. The government needs to spell out 
 what funding and resources it will commit to ensuring that approved facilities will be providing an appropriate standard of care. Labor will be proposing amendments that will require approved facilities to meet the same standards as currently apply to day surgeries under state or territory law.
The opposition is strongly opposed to the proposed deregulation of insurance premium increases and the poorly thought through proposals to create a new class of places for surgery and other procedures to be performed in. It is recognised from the debate in the House that the government intends to proceed with this legislation, so the opposition intends to move some specific measures to make these proposals more workable.
In the committee stage, I will be moving a series of amendments to achieve a range of objectives in that regard. The opposition will also move a request to the House to insert a provision so that the level of benefit payable to a public patient at an approved facility is 85 per cent of the schedule fee plus the facilities fee set by the minister. This will ensure that public hospitals are encouraged to send public patients to these facilities without the patient receiving a gap payment. It will also allow the public sector to achieve the same advantages as this proposal offers the private sector.
The bill, as I said at the outset, represents an admission by the government that a lot more needs to be done than merely throwing money at the problem as they did with the 30 per cent rebate proposal. We have to seriously tackle the issues that are influencing the long-term decline of private health insurance membership in this country. But the government has not done that in a holistic and comprehensive way. There are some measures in this bill which we will be supporting because they do go towards helping to solve some of those problems. But there are a range of other measures which we think represent a step backwards and which we will be opposing.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-23,"—The amendments contained in the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 come on the back of a significant policy 
 of this government, and eventually of this chamber and of the parliament, of support for private health insurance in the form of the 30 per cent rebate passed by the parliament late last year. That debate demonstrated that many ordinary Australians are relying on their health insurance to access essential services. It would be very interesting to hear from members of this chamber about the ordinary voters, the rank and file, who have been prepared to pay for their insurance, and who were very concerned that that legislation got through. Having got it through, the government has got a responsibility to ensure that the insurance industry delivers.
I say quite clearly at the outset that my immediate concern with the legislation as it currently stands is for those individuals, particularly the elderly and chronically ill, who purchase health insurance as an assurance that their access to essential care and treatment will not be hampered. The legislation, however, does place barriers to this access by not clarifying the nature and scope of cover in the very important areas of palliative care, rehabilitation and psychiatric care. Few could argue that these treatments are well catered for in the public sector and, consequently, are not necessary in the private health insurance area. As a matter of fact, it is essential that health insurance guarantees access to these treatments due to the lack of adequate cover in the public sector. I will deal with that matter shortly. Certainly, I have addressed it in amendments that I have prepared.
I also indicate that the bill attempts to extend private health insurance coverage beyond the hospital into general practice and community settings. In theory, this should make insurance conceptually more attractive. However, it is the price of insurance rather than its role which mainly determines its attractiveness. Consequently, these amendments in the bill have the potential to place increased financial burdens on health funds, since they will now be able to pay benefits for procedures undertaken outside hospitals.
Although the costs of the settings in which these procedures will be performed may be less than the costs associated with a hosp 
 ital—and typically probably would be less—any projected savings will at best only be realised if the procedures are no longer undertaken in hospital settings. Otherwise, health funds will be supplying benefits for procedures performed outside hospital in addition to paying benefits for the same procedures conducted within hospitals. This will only inflate the price of health insurance and become counterproductive in attracting members.
It is important to say, however, that the coverage which these amendments will deliver will be popular. Put simply, it means that insured people can have minor surgical procedures undertaken in approved doctors' rooms and be covered completely or with a gap. It should be noted, though, that there is no obligation to remove the gap. Since the gap will undoubtedly stay, the only improvement for insured people is in the convenience of having the procedure performed in the approved doctors' rooms rather than in a hospital or day surgery.
I am very concerned about this question of gaps. It is a matter that was discussed in December. Apparently, the medical profession is resisting some proposals in the legislation due to a concern that they will lead to increased controls being placed on doctors by health funds. This is due to the fact that the legislation facilitates contracts and medical purchaser-provider agreements to be drawn up between doctors and health funds.
The agreements would specify the price of the service and other quality consent issues. If they are signed, health funds could cover the medical bill above the medical benefits schedule price. This remains a non-negotiable item by the medical profession. Consequently, if left unamended, there will be no gap coverage.
Schedule 1 of the bill allows health funds to offer discounted premiums to contributors. Discounts are to be the result of `administrative savings'. Discounts cannot be the result of charging other members higher premiums. Already some employers are seeking contracts with health funds to provide discount premiums. I ask: what assurances are in place to ensure that the self-employed, the 
 self-funded retirees and the unemployed are not disadvantaged or charged relatively higher premiums so that other members can receive discounted premiums?
Part 3 of the bill allows funds to extend the waiting periods for certain conditions, ailments or illnesses. This is to be done by way of regulation and disallowance. If a strategy similar to the recent unfair dismissal regulations is adopted, waiting periods could be extended for some months without an opportunity for the parliament to disallow them. This provision lacks certainty over which particular conditions and illnesses may be in the firing line for increased waiting periods.
The private health insurance industry has already flagged a willingness to restrict cover for psychiatric and palliative care and rehabilitation. It is stiff cheese if you have paid insurance all your life and you go a bit gaga in your latter years when the insurance industry applies this sort of restriction. This provision gives little comfort that the industry will not make a case to have extended waiting periods for psychiatric, palliative care and rehabilitation into the future. I have prepared an amendment that goes to that issue which we will be able to consider at the committee stage.
Turning to part 5 of schedule 1, questions must be raised over what quality assurances will be given as to the standards of `approved facilities'. Has there been effective consultation with the state and territory authorities? What level of accountability will be imposed under doctors in these approved facilities? How will the Commonwealth department ensure that only the specified procedures receive insurance cover in the approved facilities?
The provision contained in schedule 2, item 9, limits the requirement of health funds to include within certain contracts treatment for palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation. In instances where the out-of-hospital procedures are those such as ophthalmic and dermatological work, palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation cover can reasonably be unnecessary. That is something we should all be concerned about. In the 
 future it may be clinically suitable to perform these treatments in out-of-hospital settings. Again I will address this by way of an amendment at the committee stage.
Overall there are features in this bill that are attractive and should be supported into the committee stage. I do note that nothing in the legislation is designed, at this stage at least, to oppose and abolish community rating. But I think we should be ever-vigilant that that principle is upheld. I support the bill into committee and will be proposing amendments at that stage.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-23,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 comes about in response to recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its report No. 57 entitled Private health insurance  which, I remind the Senate, was a report of February 1997—nearly 2½ years ago. Of course, a lot has happened in that interim 2½-year period, particularly with regard to the development of policy and the conduct of many inquiries already by various committees of the Senate—certainly before the estimates committees—associated with the detailed consideration of the legislation last December that went to the heart of private health insurance.
We also on that occasion in December last year foreshadowed these particular amendments that are now before us. It is interesting to note that support has been attracted quite publicly from a number of organisations: the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Health Care Association, the Consumer Health Forum, the National Seniors Association, the Australian Day Care Association, the Australian Private Hospitals Association and Medibank Private. Across the ambit, the various groups that are affected and represented have certainly all endorsed this particular legislation in very strong terms.
I appreciate the comments that have been made here today by other senators. We will have regard to the various comments that have been made.
This bill is a product reform bill designed to make the private health insurance product more attractive to consumers. It has been roundly endorsed by, as I said a few moments ago, a number of consumer and other health associated groups and organisations. The bill builds on the major hospital reform measures contained in the Health Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1997, and complements the federal government's 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance.
This bill amends the National Health Act 1953, and concerns itself with reforms in six key areas. Parts 1 to 5 of schedule 1 deal with five of these reforms. Part 1 deals with the reforms to allow registered health funds to offer discounted premiums in specific circumstances. Part 2 deals with reforms to allow health funds to offer loyalty bonuses. Part 3 deals with reforms to pre-existing ailment conditions to allow for waiting periods to be extended in particular circumstances. Part 4 deals with reforms to allow health funds to cover the cost to fund members of pharmaceutical benefits prescribed while as patients in hospital. Part 5 deals with reforms to extend payments by health funds for procedures undertaken in approved procedures facilities to promote the most appropriate type of care in the most appropriate settings.
Schedule 2 covers the consequential amendments to both the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953, which are required to implement appropriately the schemes outlined in the bill. Schedule 3 allows for the transfer of the rates of contribution rule change provisions from the minister to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council prior to the repeal of these provisions in the medium term. Schedule 3 also amends ministerial discretion with respect to fund rule changes, requiring that decisions in relation to a particular fund rule change include regard to the effects of proposed change on the industry as a whole as well as the effects on consumers and the individual fund.
I have noted that Senator Harradine has raised issues relating to elderly, chronically ill people, particularly with palliative, rehabilitation and psychiatric care. Approved 
 procedures facilities will provide a substitute for in-hospital care in an out-of-hospital setting. As such, approved procedures facilities are not covered under hospital tables where it remains compulsory for health funds to provide coverage for in-hospital palliative, psychiatric and rehabilitation care. The excluded services are treated like any other out-of-hospital service. The exclusion of compulsory coverage for these services from the provision of part 5 simply reflects the fact that, while such care is a substitute for in-hospital care, it is taking place as an out-of-hospital procedure.
The government will certainly look carefully, in the time available to us, at the amendments that Senator Harradine has suggested. As Senator Harradine mentioned, it is not proposed at the moment to proceed to committee today, therefore giving us that opportunity.
I would comment that the second reading amendment as circulated by Senator Margetts really is a rehash of a similar amendment that she proposed last year in a similar area. As I mentioned in my opening comments, this particular issue has been the subject of tremendous debate and discussion in the community, in this parliament and in this Senate since the Productivity Commission's report of February 1997. We certainly mentioned that in December last year in association with the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate bill. I remind the Senate that on 10 December last year the Senate opposed that motion by the Greens on the voices, and I would hope that it will do so again today.
The government has a mandate to proceed with private health insurance reform, and that is clearly set out in our proposals associated with this legislation. We do not need another expensive inquiry just to please Senator Margetts or a few people who perhaps have not had the occasion to appear—as many have done—in so many of the inquiries in other areas. Senator Lees has been complaining about our alleged obsession with private health insurance. I thought that would speak for itself, particularly with regard to Senator Margetts's proposed amendment.
Other detailed amendments have been distributed this afternoon by the ALP and by the Australian Democrats—although I should say I do not think we have yet seen the Democrats' amendments. Obviously the preparation of these amendments has been log jammed. I remind the Senate that both the Labor Party and the Democrats have had a full opportunity since this debate concluded in the House of Representatives on 10 March this year to have those amendments ready, rather than putting them on our tables here at nearly 4.30 this afternoon, therefore giving us one hour for consideration. It is indeed unfortunate that in order to give this matter proper consideration it will be necessary to commend consideration of the bill in committee to a later date.
Amendment not agreed to.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-23,"—This is an issue of pulling a second committee stage. I realise the reasons for that, but this is the second time this has happened on the program. I know there are some efforts at the moment to rearrange the program, but I am making a plea to the government. They are talking about whether we or other people have amendments ready. Can I suggest that the precipitant pulling of other committee stage bills has led to people being less prepared than they might be. Just a moment ago we were told that, after this, we were to go on to the RFA Bill, which was not even on the red today.
I would also ask that all parties realise that just speaking to each other—communication just between the government and the opposition—is not talking with all parties. Certainly the Greens would appreciate a little more notice that there are likely to be bills which are not on today's program. I remind honourable senators that we in small parties are working at our limits on many occasions 
 and, if you are changing from one day's program to another, it is good to be able to get advice. I do appreciate that the government is making some efforts to put on a bill for which people are more likely to be prepared—another tax bill which is on the program today, but please do not assume that all parties have been advised or are agreed if you have not spoken to the parties down at this end of the chamber.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-23,"—As just notified to the Senate, the bills before us are two in number: A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 .
The essence of these two bills is to ensure that those individuals who have been able to avail themselves of salary repackaging will no longer be able to avoid their obligations or receive government benefits on the basis that they were able to lower their taxable income by substituting reportable taxable income with fringe benefits.
From 1 April this year, employers will have to—for the 1999-2000 income year—begin including on employee group certificates the grossed up value of fringe benefits where their total value exceeds $1,000. I have to say that the opposition is happy to support these changes. Under previous arrangements, through aggressive salary repackaging, high income earners were able to avoid such things as the Medicare levy surcharge, the 15 per cent superannuation tax and HECS debts, and in other cases qualify for such things as family assistance or the family tax initiative when they would not ordinarily have been eligible.
We support the government on these two bills, but we also note that it is the opposition which over a number of years has been raising the issue of salary repackaging and how it was being used by in the main high income taxpayers to avoid their full obligations in a number of areas. I remember in 1997 my colleague Senator Sherry exposing the widespread use of salary repackaging amongst senior members of the Public Service, which was openly encouraged by the government in order that a select few public servants, such as Mr Max Moore-Wilton, could avoid paying their fair share of tax.
As is usual on an issue that involves tax avoidance, this government has been slow to act, but at least they have finally taken action which we in the opposition fully support. It is only, though, when the ALP exposes tax rorts and shames this government into action that they awake from their slumber and actually do anything about tax avoidance. We know this government are often slow to act, given that they are a party containing tax avoiders. We can go back to when the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, was dragged kicking and screaming on the issue of the bottom of the harbour tax schemes and acted only when the public outcry became too loud to ignore.
The government has indicated that in the committee stage of these bills there will be a number of amendments. There are 2½ pages of amendments that have been circulated in the chamber. The explanation provided to us is that their character is of technical changes and changes which do not alter the substance 
 or the merit of the substantive changes that the bill seeks to make but that, being technical in nature, they make the act more easily usable and operative and cover any loopholes that may have emerged as unintended consequences. I have not had a chance to check these amendments, but I will have done so before the committee stage proceeds. On the explanation given by the government, and subject to checking, we would support those amendments.
The titles of each of the two bills are prefixed by four words: a new tax system. This is the first sign of legislation that arises from the government's taxation legislation which contains the GST—legislation which comes from the ANTS package and which is referred to as `Not a new tax: a new tax system'. The government has adopted that title to introduce these bills, which do relate to elements in that package. I indicate for the record, as I said a moment ago, that the opposition will be supporting these bills so, to that extent at least, we are on the record of not voting down part of this package.
The allegation that the Senate is obstructing the passage of the ANTS bills has placed a frightful amount of pressure on the Senate. Nothing could be further from the truth. In politics, large statements like that—often repeated; thumped into the public consciousness—sometimes by repetition achieve an element of being believable, but it needs to be said clearly that all the Senate is doing is exercising the obligation placed on it by its constitutional forbears, who gave the Senate, as a states house, the obligation of reviewing legislation emanating from the House of Representatives.
Over the last few months, I have had the honour to chair the Senate's committee into the government's new tax package, and we have just on a month to go. We are due to table our report on 19 April, and at this stage I fully expect that we will table our report on time. It should be said that the process that we have undertaken is serving the Senate well, and the community of Australia even better, by enabling opportunities for all of those interest groups and individuals who have concerns about the government's tax 
 legislation to voice those concerns, to set out their misgivings and to raise areas where there should be amendment. In other words, for the first time since the government announced its intention to embark on this new adventure of taxation change, the community have had a chance to speak. They have seized on that opportunity through the Senate system of public hearings and public submissions.
For the record, it should also be noted that, while the whole of the Senate supported the resolution to set up that committee, the primary negotiation to form the committee took place between the government and the Australian Democrats and, I understand, with assistance from Senator Harradine. At no time were members of the Labor opposition invited to the inner councils haggling over the terms of reference of that legislation until a `done deal' had essentially emerged. When it had, we expressed our views and I think some of those were taken on board, but the motive force was a joint government-Democrats discussion that placed this on the agenda. So, if members of the government attack the Senate for being obstructive, it should be noted that they, together with the Australian Democrats, were party to forming this committee of inquiry.
—We were so enthusiastic about it.
—I am just stating the facts, which do not go to degrees of enthusiasm or reservation. But they are the facts and I thank you for your confirmation of them.
—Like Gareth's negotiations on native title at the end of 1992, I suspect.
—I am not sure how that is relevant, but I do notice there is some government sensitivity on this point. But no-one is disputing that they were part of it and that the sequence of events is as I have put it.
If there were anyone on the government side in this debate ill advised enough to attack the Senate for being obstructive because of the inquiry, the record is that the government was a willing participant and voted in a unanimous vote of this chamber to set up the inquiry and to set down its report-by dates. So 
 the nascent objections that come from many in the House of Representatives—often from the Treasurer and sometimes from the Prime Minister—about Senate obstruction in terms of the GST are ill advised, because the record is clear: there is no obstruction being entered into by the Senate.
The other point is that the inquiry has so far provided a public service by enabling a platform for the community to speak to the parliament and express their views. It must be said that not always do the community speak with full knowledge of the implications of the legislation. Sometimes they accept the government at its word and repeat the platitudes that have supported the government's submission as if they were truths and naively and obligingly accept the government at its word without studying the fine print. On other occasions, members of the public and/or organisations take a dim view which is not founded either, and so there is, to some extent, a clear misunderstanding—even at this late stage—about the intent of the legislation. But, by and large, there is a very good understanding, and a truthful understanding, of what the legislation involves, and the overwhelming body of submissions deals with this legislation from that perspective and thus ought to be heeded by the Senate because it is informed, it is considered and it goes to the nature of the legislation.
An interesting element of a lot of the debate that has emerged so far is that many organisations—often those that say, first and foremost, they support the government's legislation—also have a sheaf of amendments that they want to make to it. Some say they need even more time in order to finalise the detail of those amendments because they have not had a chance yet to fully study the 16 bills contained in the legislative package. Some of these organisations are impressive in their support of the government, but are unable, even at this late stage, to inform us of the detail of the changes they will seek, because they are still working their way through the technical nature of those bills.
This comes back to the question of obstruction. This legislation was put to the House of Representatives and voted on before Christ 
 mas in what I consider to be a very quick turnaround time indeed, and which many of my colleagues in the other place regard as being insufficient for proper public debate or for the effectual execution of democracy in the lower House.
—That is what I said about native title in 1992.
—I will take that interjection because it encodes a fallacy. Without accepting the premise from which it comes, it says, `You did something wrong in 1998, therefore it justifies us doing something wrong in 1999.' While not accepting the premise, there is no such logical procedure at all. It is a classical fallacy to say, `You've made a mistake, therefore we're justified in making a mistake.' The point I am making in terms of obstruction is that no government, and no-one in this government, has said that the public is not entitled to come to grips with the detail of the legislation and express a view upon it. What they have done is attack the Senate for enabling that process to occur.
The amount of public scrutiny that we have now seen, and the dawning and widespread conclusions being arrived at across the wide area of consultation we have engaged in, suggests considerable difficulty with the legislation. That is the voice of the community. It is not the voice of the opposition, it is not the voice of the Democrats or of any Independent—it is the voice of the community and, after all, wherever we stand in this debate, the Senate should be about good legislation which does take on board the voice of the community. So when people talk about Senate obstruction in the context of this debate, they are saying, `We want to stifle that voice and not hear its opinion.' I think that does expose the fallacious and insipid nature of the complaints being made at this stage on Senate obstruction.
Madam Acting Deputy President, you have been tolerant with me and I appreciate that because, while these bills are related to the package, I have strayed a little from addressing the intent of them but have taken on the matter in the broad terms of the package. We support this legislation and, subject to confirmation, we accept the government's explan

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-03-23,"—As Senator Cook has indicated, we rise today to support this legislation, A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 , and to welcome a number of the items in it. But when you look at what these bills are about, they are about making changes to fringe benefits and group certificates, among other things. That is an issue that has been very contentious in this chamber for some time. It is an issue which the government refused to deal with in another situation, arguing that it was too complicated, arguing that it was too hard and arguing about whether or not it was possible or putting too much compliance onto business.
Of course, I am talking about the surtax—the surcharge tax—where, without any consultation whatsoever with the industry that would have to implement it, the government forced onto the superannuation industry a measure which was massively expensive. The argument it put up was that it was inefficient and that there was an alternative mechanism, which was to list the surcharge for the purposes of the group certificates; it could be done through the group certificate method.
This government pigheadedly decided that that was not going to be the case. It argued up hill and down dale that you could not possibly put all those employers through it. What do we see today? We see the ultimate hypocrisy—the willingness to make all those employers list their fringe benefits on the group certificates. This may seem to be a small point to some but, given the level of debate and the level of angst that the surtax has created, you would have thought that the government would have at least let a little time go by before it introduced such a measure which clearly showed that it was never fair dinkum about wanting to be consultative with the industry when it came to the surcharge.
The Labor Party supports this, as it would have supported an alternative collection 
 mechanism. We have consistently argued that, and we have seen Senator Kemp day in and day out deny it was a tax. He claimed that it was just too much work for business, that what this government was about was reducing compliance costs and not wanting to put more red tape in the way of business—when all the time it was busily working away on this bill, which is doing exactly all of the things that the government said it did not want to do with the surcharge.
What we have been seeing from this government as part of the tax package, as part of the GST package—and this, as Senator Cook has stressed, is a bill that is titled `A New Tax System'—is an argument about compliance costs. This government has not actually done any serious modelling about the compliance costs of its package, of which this bill is part. What it has told the Australian public and the business community, and small business in particular, is that there will be minimal compliance costs from the tax package. This, just like the first part of the tax package, demonstrates that if you listened to the government 12 or 18 months ago about how this was just an incredibly difficult and expensive process—having to record details on the group certificate, and that it could not possibly impose such a cost onto struggling small businesses and big businesses—the same argument applies.
The reason it is relevant is that compliance costs have been a substantial debating point on the GST committee. What you have is the beginnings of this massive imposition. The government have done no modelling, as I said before. They have done an estimate; $2 billion is their estimate. They are not prepared to put up any reasons for that figure, they have just plucked out a figure.
What we saw today in question time was a number of quotes from the Arthur Andersen submission, tax experts, about compliance and how this bill is five times the size of the New Zealand bill. It is massively more complex than the New Zealand bill, and the government has been trying to pretend for the last six months since the ANTS package was announced that there are less compliance costs. But the evidence that we received—it 
 is a pity that Mr Gaetjens, who is in the gallery today, was not in Melbourne to hear this evidence—is the same as from any of the witnesses who have come before our committee, that there were going to be substantial compliance costs.
In fact, one witness who represents accountants who deal at the coalface with hundreds and hundreds of clients, if not thousands of clients, on a monthly basis said that in actual fact there were going to be no cost savings to those companies that were already inside the wholesale sales tax system. What was going to happen would be the substituting of one computer system for another computer system. So it was very hard to argue that the running costs of one package as opposed to another and the information that is going to be required would actually lead to a substantial saving in compliance costs for the 70,000 to 75,000 companies that are inside the WST system. So no decrease in compliance costs was the argument from coalface accountants.
But it was not just a coalface accountant, someone who actually does people's tax returns. What we had was an academic, Mr Walpole, who is from the Australian Taxation Studies Program, considered to be Australia's leading compliance experts. He strongly agreed that there are not any savings for companies within the wholesale sales tax system. If the people now inside the system are not going to be better off, you have to ask who is going to be better off. Surely the other million and a half companies that are being dragged into the new tax system as part of the GST, having input tax credits requirements and setting up the computer systems, cannot be getting a better deal on compliance because they have all got to be dragged into the system. So what you have actually got is massive amounts of new costs for all the people outside the WST system.
Then you have got experts, accountants involved in the industry, saying that there are no compliance savings involved in the new system either. Part of the reason that there are no compliance savings is this bill. This is a good bill, but part of the reason that it is not possible to argue that people are better off under the new tax system on compliance 
 issues is this very bill. Mr Ray Regan, who is someone who deals with people's tax returns, argued quite cogently that there are not only no compliance savings even for people inside the WST system but also that applies to everybody, particularly small business. His area of expertise is small business. Senator O'Chee was there and questioned Mr Regan at length on this issue. Senator O'Chee did not agree with Mr Regan. I think it is clear, if you read the transcript, that Senator O'Chee had a different opinion. But what was not possible for Senator O'Chee to disagree with was the expert evidence that Mr Regan gave. What he said was that it is a joke to suggest that all a company has to do now, if it does not have a computer system—
—Calling him an expert accountant is like calling you an expert senator.
—You would never be called an expert economist, Senator Campbell, so don't worry. What the senators from the coalition were not able to do was actually disprove what Mr Regan was saying. They were not able to say, `Look, it will only be an extra five hours a month or it will only be an extra 10 hours a month,' because they did not have a clue. What you had was somebody who does people's tax returns sit there and argue that there will be a substantial increase, around $7,000, for each small business in their compliance costs. This bill is part of that $7,000. It is not just the GST. This bill substantially increases the compliance costs. It is part of the extra accounting, it is part of the extra costs and administration that are imposed particularly on small business. Mr Walpole, who, as I said earlier, is one of the experts on compliance costs, makes this point in his submission to the committee. He says:
The New Zealand style GST proposed for Australia is comparatively expensive in terms of compliance costs.
This is Australia's leading compliance costs expert, a supporter of the GST, not someone who is walking around saying, `No, don't do it.' To make sure the record is straight, Mr Regan clearly says, `No, this is not in the interests, particularly of small business, but of everybody as a whole.'
But Mr Walpole is a different kettle of fish. He says that after studying it, after conducting studies, and after looking at the different research from around the world, the net compliance cost, as once estimated by Pope, Fayle and Chen, for the wholesale sales tax was 2.1 per cent of revenue collected. A slightly different study conducted by Mr Walpole and some of his colleagues found that it was 4.7 per cent of revenue collected. The UK's figure for VAT was 2.3 per cent. However, the figure for New Zealand was 7.3 per cent of revenue collected. That is nearly twice the collection costs for the WST. Mr Walpole stresses that our system is far more complicated than the New Zealand system.
Before we get into an argument about further exemptions, before we entertain Senator Lees's argument, or possibly Senator Harradine's, we need to know that compliance costs are close to twice the cost of the existing system for the WST, and close to four times the cost of the UK's VAT position, and our system is more complicated. The new tax package, in sheer pages, when you add them all up, is five times the size of the New Zealand package. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that it has to be more expensive. You would have to put more people hours into a study of Australia's new tax system. When accompanied by this bill and a range of other bills, it makes absolute commonsense that this bill will increase compliance costs. In his submission, Mr Walpole says:
In small businesses, it is the owners/directors/partners who principally bear the paperwork burden. Their time is the most valuable and productive time. A high compliance burden can stifle entrepreneurial initiative and innovation.
What was argued at length before the committee by the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, one of the architects of the debate at the moment—one of the key drivers and key supporters of this package—was the claims about benefits. We asked the Business Coalition in Melbourne a few weeks ago—Senator Sherry was with the committee that day—about the benefits to the business community. On their own admission, all of their members are passing on all of the savings from the WST and the famous nine taxes that are being 
 abolished. They are not being kept by business as increased profits. Savings will have to be passed on because this government is to introduce tough legislation, as part of this package, that will say, `If we catch you profiteering from the GST, if we catch you not passing on these savings, we will come after you with fines of up to $10 million.'
This government has said that they will not allow business to profit at the expense of ordinary consumers, after this package is introduced. We said to the Business Coalition, `So you are not making any savings from the abolition of these taxes and you are guaranteeing that you are passing through 100 per cent of the savings.' They said yes—they also believe in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus—they were going to pass them through. We said, `Where are the savings coming from? How is business going to be better off? You will have increased compliance costs. There will be no net gain to profitability from abolishing all of the other taxes because those savings will have been passed through.' They said, `There are dynamic benefits.' I said, `Is it possible to model dynamic benefits? Can you give us an example of a dynamic benefit? Can we have a look at a dynamic benefit?' They, of course, said, `No, it is not possible to model dynamic benefits. You cannot take into account the entrepreneurial initiative and innovation that will come from this package.' They were quite firm that it was not possible to model the future.
Others might suggest that this is something akin to economic voodooism, belief in the market to the extent where you can just say that it is going to have benefits and it must. It doesn't matter that you can't go to any other country in the world that has introduced a GST and say, `Look, what you saw was this expansion.' No, there was no pretence, not even an attempt, just, `You cannot model it.' Mr Walpole says that the compliance costs from this bill and the other bills will stifle entrepreneurial initiative and innovation.
Mr Murphy, the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, produced a study for the Senate committee and did a bit of work for the Treasury before the package was released. He said that the net benefit, the economic welfare 
 gain—to use his jargon—is $680 million. That is down from the $1 billion that he claimed during the election campaign—no coincidence, Senator Lees. During the election campaign he claimed that that benefit to the economy would be $1 billion. Three months after the election campaign he cut it back by 40 per cent.
—Sixty-five cents a week.
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. From Mr Murphy's modelling, everybody is to get 65c per week. That is if everybody gets the whole 65c, because there is the whole question of the distribution of the 65c. It could be that Senator Campbell could pick up three or four of the 65c and that somebody in the gallery might not get their 65c. I would be keeping an eye on Senator Campbell! What we have seen is an argument about compliance costs. The Treasury has said that there are $2 billion worth of compliance costs. In my maths, $2 billion in compliance costs is greater than $600 million in economic welfare gain. If you took a very simplistic approach—
—Are you opposing this bill?
—No, we are supporting this bill. We have said that this is a good bill.
—You are just complaining about the compliance costs. Do you want to chop down loopholes or don't you? You cannot have it both ways.
—If the government was fair dinkum about chopping down loopholes, it would not have caved into the cash management trust industry. Senator Campbell talks about loopholes but the government has already given away $380 million worth of taxpayers money.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-23,"—The two bills before us, A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 ,  are the first of the 17 bills in the tax package that make up the new tax system. Originally, they were to be debated with the rest of the bills, commencing on 19 April; and, indeed, that 
 was the agreement we had with the government. The bills were part of the reference to the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System.
This morning, the motion was moved in this place to uncouple these two bills, to take them out of the inquiry process and let them proceed early. This, the government argued, was necessary because of their start-up dates—1 July of this year, not next year with the rest of the package—and we were happy to cooperate with the government and to support the uncoupling of the bills and deal with them as soon as possible, hence here we are now. We are also happy to deal with them because they are part of the bills dealing with closing loopholes, and the sooner we can do that the better—something the Democrats have long been arguing for.
I have asked Senator Murray about the extent of evidence received on these two particular bills in the inquiry, and there were various submissions on this issue; but we have taken them into account in framing our position. The Democrats basically support these bills. They ensure that the device of fringe benefits and salary packaging is not able to be used to obtain tax and social security benefits. But I note with interest the package of amendments that landed on our desks today. These are largely technical amendments. In one case they correct an oversight relating to remote housing benefits. Some of them are simply amendments described in the explanatory memorandum as `technical corrections'. In some cases they relate to definitions.
I note with interest that the Treasurer was pushing us with great fervour last year to simply tick off the package and get it through this place with no inquiry, no second look. Indeed, the bills were dealt with in the House of Representatives with minimal debate—17 bills in some 20 hours. We now see that that was after rushed post-election drafting and a very rushed report from the Tax Consultative Committee. So it is not surprising that we have anomalies and mistakes. If we had gone along with the government's request to simply push them through this place without inquiry we would probably have been back here 
 already making technical amendments to the bills that had been passed.
When the minister gets to look at the other 15 tax bills in detail, I believe that he will find further need for technical amendments. Indeed, looking through some of the submissions to the tax inquiry, I see that there are quite a number of what are fairly small problems but very important details that have to be corrected if we are going to get it right without needing to revisit these bills time and time again. By the time we get to the great bulk of the bills, we will probably see many more pages of government amendments—not to mention the Democrat amendments. That is again the reason that it is going to take some time to deal with the bills after 19 April. Also, it is again showing us how important the tax committee process has been in identifying many of these problems.
The committees have been extremely busy; yet, to meet the government's tight timetable of 19 April, they have not been able to receive all of the evidence that they would like to have received. Quite a number of industry groups who had been particularly keen to address the select committee are going to have to be happy with just presenting written submissions because there simply is not enough time for that committee to deal with everyone who wants to appear before it.
Certainly, with just this package of amendments which the government has moved, I think the government has defeated its own argument that the Senate has been obstructionist over the tax package. With just this batch of technical amendments alone, we see the benefit of time, of hindsight and of a closer look at the tax package. Of course the package will need to be changed in light of evidence that it is flawed. That is what the committee process is about. That we are asked today to address technical amendments shows us—particularly as I read through the explanatory memorandum—what a fresh set of eyes and a few months will do to look in detail through the bills before us.
The fringe benefits legislation is very necessary to protect the integrity of the social safety net. Fringe benefits, despite all the complaints from business, remain a growing 
 part of the tax system. In the last three years fringe benefits tax collections have risen by 16 per cent. Interestingly, around one-quarter of that, around $781 million, is for expense payments. That is basically cash which should be picked up and should be going through the PAYE system. Indeed, in the last year of tax statistics to June 1997 this item of fringe benefits rose by 11 per cent. That is a lot more than the 7.7 per cent rise in ordinary income tax—highlighting the growing popularity of salary packaging.
Since the introduction of the superannuation surcharge in 1996 there has been a great deal of growth in salary packaging and conversion of salary to benefits to avoid the surcharge payment thresholds. This bill will put an end to those practices and, to that extent, we certainly welcome it. But, since we are dealing with part of the new tax system tax package, I should note for the record that this is simply not going far enough. This measure, worth around $270 million a year, is one of several measures in ANTS to deal with tax loopholes. In 2000-01 these measures will total around $2.6 billion, with a further $2 billion coming from the abolition of the savings rebate.
That all sounds like a wonderful attack on closing loopholes. While we welcome these measures that have been announced, they are woefully inadequate. And the tax statistics that were released last week show us why. In 1996-97, 427,431 trusts lodged returns—up just 29 per cent in three years. At least that is dealt with within the package as it stands, but it is not necessarily in law yet. After the Farmers Federation and a few small business organisations have finished with government, I wonder exactly what we are going to end up with in law. In 1996-97, 559,520 companies lodged returns—up 31 per cent in four years. Sixty per cent of private companies pay no income tax whatsoever. They earn over $150 billion in income, nearly 40 per cent of all income earned by private companies.
And what measures do we have in our package of bills, our new tax system, to deal with the huge blow-out in incorporation—a device obviously being used by professional service providers and by tradespeople to 
 reduce their tax by exiting the PAYE system? What measures do we have to combat what is clearly a huge leakage in our tax system? There is absolutely nothing. Income of $150 billion is allowed to be washed right through the tax system without any of it sticking anywhere. In other words, the government is happy to sit back and watch a huge amount of money not in any way touched to get the taxes we need for essential services. It is not lifting a finger to do anything about it.
A little further into the tax statistics we find the figures on rental deductions: $2.6 billion of rental losses driven by negative gearing. That amounts to a tax cost of around $700 million a year. And it is a growth occupation, with negatively geared losses rising by 48 per cent in three years—and that is despite a fall in interest rates.
Then there are the dividend imputation tax benefits, worth $3.2 billion—double what it was five years ago—with 70 per cent of that benefit accruing to the top one-eighth of taxpayers. There are FBT tax concessions on company cars. This tax break was worth $740 million in 1996-97, an increase of 85 per cent in just three years.
The tax break on employer superannuation contributions has risen from $2.3 billion to $3.9 billion between 1992 and 1996, a rise of 69 per cent. Then there is company tax, and the growing number of leaks from the Australian Tax Office from frustrated officials showing that corporate Australia is winning the tax battle against the tax man, with major companies like Newscorp paying barely nominal rates of tax.
If Australia were to look to the United States and adopt the 20 per cent unavoidable alternative minimum company tax used in the United States, we could collect an additional $500 million approximately from companies which are currently telling the tax man and their shareholders two very different stories about their profitability. In fact, the Australian Council of Social Service—ACOSS—has produced a list of tax loopholes totalling over $8 billion a year that could be collected. And all the government has produced so far in the tax package is $2.6 billion of income tax base broadening. So they are certainly a very long 
 way away from where they should be—very well short of the mark.
So while we welcome this bill as a start on closing the loopholes in the income tax system, it is only a start. Reform of the income tax system is a fundamentally important part of tax reform. Indeed, I would say that the Democrats rank it well ahead of indirect tax reform and the GST. Australia needs and deserves a fair and effective income tax system that collects from all, based on real capacity to pay—one that is able to collect the tax and is not giving so many high income earners the opportunity to avoid paying anything at all out of what they are earning. Indeed, if we do not take a more serious look at what many people are managing to do, we simply will not have the level of revenue to pay for the community services that all Australians expect.
We want to see a tax system that is more progressive, not less progressive. We want to see action to close more loopholes than this government is prepared to close at this stage. And we want to see the tax system rearranged to provide a greater benefit to low income earners and lesser benefits to high income earners. To that end, I will be moving two amendments to the bill in the committee stage.
The first will require employer superannuation contributions also to be included on group certificates. This would have two advantages. The first would be that it would allow the high income earners surcharge to be collected from individuals rather than the super funds, and that would save over $100 million a year in compliance costs. But it would also ensure that salary packaging using superannuation is simply not put in to replace what we are doing with respect to fringe benefits tax. In other words, it would ensure that another mechanism would not be put in place as a means of getting around social security and tax means tests. That would ensure that the top end of taxpayers at least, who tend to have the larger superannuation packages, are picked up properly by these measures.
At the same time, we would want to move to ensure that the lower end of the taxpaying 
 scale are not caught up inadvertently by this legislation. At the lowest threshold at which this new rule on fringe benefits in assessable income cuts in is the HECS repayments. That is $20,700, which is an appallingly low threshold at which to move low income earners into a higher tax bracket by virtue of this graduate tax. It was one of the more unfair imposts on low income earners that has come so far from this government.
We propose two amendments to the HECS repayment threshold to exclude low income earners. First, we propose that all taxpayers who are eligible for the low income earners tax rebate should be excluded from the graduate tax system. That covers around nine per cent of taxpayers. Second, we propose exempting low income graduates with families, that is, those in receipt of additional family assistance. If a graduate is regarded by the tax system as a low income earner, then that treatment should be consistent right across the board. To now include more people in the graduate tax system by adding in fringe benefits is to add to the unfairness of the low repayment thresholds.
In conclusion, the Democrats want an income tax system that provides tax relief, not more taxes for low income earners, and one that ensures that higher income earners pay their fair share. We welcome this bill as a small step towards that but propose amendments to widen the net at the top end and reduce it at the bottom. This reflects the view we will take into the consideration of the rest of the new tax system package—that the result must be a broader direct and indirect tax base, a fairer and more progressive tax scale and a more robust revenue stream.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-23,"—At the outset I should say that the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Cook, indicated to the Senate that we are supporting the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 . It is not my intention to repeat the very effective and incisive contributions of Senator Cook and my colleague Senator Conroy because, unlike 
 government members who have contributed in debates on a wide range of issues—particularly the Telstra debate that we were urged to finish yesterday, at least the second reading aspects of it—Labor opposition members are not here to mindlessly repeat each other in debate. Rather, we are here to analyse the various aspects and particular problems of the legislation that is before us and particularly the different aspects and problems that the legislation will present.
Senator Cook referred earlier to the allegation that the Senate is obstructive on a range of legislation that we have before us. I am glad to see that Senator Ian Campbell is in the chamber this evening for this debate because we had that allegation thrown at us yesterday in respect of the Telstra debate. When we got close to the end of that debate, what happened? The government called it off. So, on one hand, the government makes an allegation of obstruction and, on the other hand, when we are proceeding to the vote, the government all of a sudden decides that the vote should not proceed and that the legislation should be pulled for the time being.
That has happened for two reasons. Firstly, there is the fundamentally inadequate management of this chamber by Senator Campbell. In some respects it is sad to see that Senator Heffernan is waiting in the wings to take over his job. I note the recent appointment of Senator Heffernan to the cabinet Senate legislative subcommittee so, Senator Campbell, I would be keeping an eye out if I were you. Secondly, there is the failure of the government to proceed with the Telstra legislation. So it is not our intention to mindlessly repeat the various concerns we have about a piece of legislation merely to waste time.
The bills we are considering are the first wave of legislation that will flow as a consequence of the government's tax package. It is commonly known as the ANTS tax package. The purpose of the legislation is to implement the reportable fringe benefits system so that the fringe benefits of individual employees are reported by employers on group certificates. This approach is 
 interesting and I will come back to the use of group certificates a little later.
A number of areas are identified and the claim is made that this is an attempt to make the system fairer for all taxpayers. There are four elements—and I am looking at page 49 and page 50 of the ANTS document—and one is improving the income tests for surcharge and government benefits by requiring employers, from the 1999-2000 FBT year of income, to identify on group certificates the grossed up, taxable value of an employee's fringe benefits. The area of tax liability for such benefits will remain with the employer. With FBT the value will be included as income for `determining liability for a tax surcharge'—this is the issue that caught my eye—such as the Medicare levy surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge.
That is technically incorrect. I do not know whether the minister or the parliamentary secretary is aware that it is actually a tax. The Senate passed an amendment to the superannuation contributions surcharge legislation that made it a tax.
—I think I remember you saying that once before.
—I will come in a moment, Senator Campbell, to the monumental hypocrisy that is presented in this legislation in respect of the superannuation contributions so-called tax surcharge. It goes on to say that with income related obligations, such as child support, the non-grossed up amounts for a wider range of fringe benefits will also be included in assessing entitlements to certain income tested government benefits, such as the family allowance, and with parental income tests for youth allowance.
It goes on to refer to stopping the overuse of the concessional FBT treatment of public benevolent institutions—and there is some further detail on that—and to extending FBT to benefits in excess of $1,000 a year and extending the FBT exemption for remote area housing provided by mining industry employers to their employees. I am simply paraphrasing, in the interests of time, what is outlined on pages 49 to 51 of the ANTS package. 
A constant theme that this government reiterates is about the current tax system being broke or broken. In the context of the current Senate inquiry, I went to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary to examine the meanings of the words `broke' and `broken'. On page 287 the dictionary defines `broke' as `without money, penniless, ruined or bankrupt'. In respect of `broken' it goes on to say `financially ruined or bankrupt'. These are interesting definitions. I think most people would accept—and I notice we are being broadcast this evening—that those definitions of `broken' and `broke' would be the commonly accepted community meaning of those two words—`without money, penniless, ruined or bankrupt; financially ruined or bankrupt'.
In the context of the tax reform debate, the government makes the claim constantly—and Senator Kemp did it today in question time in response to an unruly interjection from me—that the system is broke. What evidence do we have that the tax system is broke? The minister for finance issued a press release in late February—I think it was on 22 February, but I stand to be corrected—about the revenue collection for the six months ended December last year. What did it show in respect of the wholesale sales tax system, about which we receive frequent allegations that it is broken? It showed that the tax revenue from the wholesale sales tax increased—and I stress `increased'—by 9.1 per cent in the six months to December last year in contrast to the six months ended December 1997.
That is hardly evidence that the wholesale sales tax system is broke or broken; in fact, it is evidence to the contrary. The current wholesale sales tax system, which is to be replaced by a GST, is going gang busters. The claim that the wholesale sales tax system is broken, when you have a 9.1 per cent increase in revenue, is a monumental lie. I hesitate to use that word—I do not like using it—but it is simply grossly misleading to say that the WST system is broke or broken.
—So that is how you measure a tax—by how much money it raises?
—It is certainly one of the ways, Senator Campbell, to measure the 
 effectiveness of a tax. I accept that there are other measures and I will make a contribution on that at a later date.
But I do want to come to one tax in this country that is definitely broke or broken, and that is the so-called superannuation surcharge—tax, as we call it. We should reflect that this government, on being elected in 1996, gave an ironclad guarantee that there would be no increase in existing taxes and no new taxes. It was a very firm commitment. But we had in the budget of May 1996 an additional tax—the so-called superannuation surcharge. That was projected to raise $480 million in the first year of its operation, 1997-98. How much did it raise? Rather than the $480 million that should have been raised, it collected only $350 million. It fell $133 million short of projected revenue estimates in its first year. Out of $480 million, $133 million failed to be collected. That is very compelling evidence that there is at least one tax that is broke or broken, and that is the superannuation surcharge tax.
I come back to the kind interjection of Senator Campbell who referred to the other evidence of the sustainability of a tax, and that is the horrendous collection costs of the superannuation surcharge. It is estimated that this tax, which failed to collect—there was a shortfall of $133 million in the first year—cost $190 million to collect. These are not my figures; they are the figures of the respected financial organisations, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, known as ASFA, and the Investment and Financial Services Association, known as IFSA. That is $190 million to collect $347 million in revenue, and this does not include the costs of the Australian Taxation Office. In the first year the cost of collecting the superannuation surcharge tax was more than 50 per cent of the revenue raised. This tax is a monumental flop with respect to the two critical criteria of revenue collected and the costs of collecting that revenue.
What is the importance of this tax in the context of the legislation we are considering? I return to my charge of gross hypocrisy, because that is what this legislation represents in the context of the superannuation surcharge 
 tax. Consider the legislation in respect of reportable fringe benefits of an employee for 1999-2000. The various deductions for superannuation contributions include rebate for personal superannuation contributions, rebate for contributions to spouse's superannuation, higher education contributions, superannuation surcharge and the Medicare levy thresholds.
Let me return to that second-last item, superannuation surcharge. What we have here is a package of legislation to prevent, or to try to minimise at least, the avoidance of a range of tax provisions. What is one of the six that I have read out? It is the superannuation surcharge tax. We have a package of legislation that is trying to minimise avoidance of the superannuation surcharge—quite rightly, but I point out to the Senate that this superannuation surcharge tax, the most costly tax to collect in Australian history, is not a product of a Labor government or a previous Liberal Party-National Party government; it is a product of this government. This government introduced the superannuation surcharge tax. It introduced it in the budget of May 1996. And here we have the absurd and hypocritical situation that the government is having to crack down on salary repackaging because in significant part taxpayers are trying to avoid a tax it introduced. It is an absolutely absurd situation and represents monumental hypocrisy on the part of this government in respect to this measure.
It is not as though this government was not warned about the problems of the superannuation surcharge tax. It was not just me who was a strong critic of the administrative methods of collecting this so-called surcharge. There has been an absolute litany of complaints, concerns and warnings issued, not just by ASFA and IFSA but by accounting organisations and legal firms. You are hard pressed to find one reputable financial or economic organisation that will say that the superannuation surcharge tax is an efficient tax. You are hard pressed to find one organisation because of the way in which the government chose to collect that new tax.
As the Senate is probably aware, I can get fairly passionate about this issue. My passion was heightened by what we saw in Senate 
 question time today. Senator Ferguson—who has joined us in the Senate—threw in a dorothy dixer to Senator Kemp. What was that dorothy dixer all about? I do not know whether Senator Ferguson knew the importance of the question he was putting to Senator Kemp. It was about yet more changes to the superannuation surcharge tax.
—Don't tempt me, Senator.
—Don't interrupt, Senator Ferguson. Do not disrupt this debate. We are anxious that we should get to the vote. The more unruly interruptions from you, in an attempt to defend the indefensible on the superannuation surcharge tax and the more disruptions of the Senate's timetable by the government—that we are continuing to see—the later we will get to considering this legislation. Senator Ferguson posed a dorothy dixer to Senator Kemp today about the superannuation surcharge tax.
—The question is, is he any the wiser?
—He is not any the wiser. We have not yet seen the details of the legislation. But it did refer to two elements. It referred to the government deciding not to collect the advance part of the superannuation surcharge. There is one good reason for that: the industry cannot work it out. The administration of this superannuation surcharge tax is so complex that they cannot work out what their liabilities are. The government was warned, and not just by me. Over and over again they were warned by industry about the problems of collecting this new tax. There was one other interesting aspect of the announcement. Senator Kemp, as is his wont, referred to `minor technical amendments'. I will be having a look at those minor technical amendments and so will the many people that advise the opposition on this surcharge tax.
—You have certainly got a lot of advisers.
—We have got a lot of advisers on this issue, Senator Ferguson.
—He has even got a few Liberal MPs.
—Liberal MPs as well, Senator Ferguson. You have totally ignored the good advice that has been coming thick and fast on the superannuation surcharge tax. The other area is the minor technical amendments that are going to be backdated to 1996. Why are they going to be backdated?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. He has spent most of his speech talking about the super surcharge, which is clearly something he pretends to know a lot about. I do think it would be appropriate that he come back to the topic of this bill. He is clearly not even trying to make his remarks relevant to this particular bill.
—On the point of order—
—Here we go.
—Yes, we are going to have a go. In fact he has spent two minutes of his speech on this particular matter and the rest of it was on the bill.
—As I was hearing Senator Sherry, I would have to rule that his comments were relevant because this is a portion of the legislation. But again I remind Senator Sherry that he must always abide by that ruling to make his remarks relevant.
—A wise ruling.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is a wise ruling because, as I said about two-thirds of the way through the contribution on this debate, if we look at the Bills Digest  on this legislation that we are considering in the Senate today, one of the major reasons why we are having to crack down on salary repackaging is the superannuation surcharge. It is quite legitimate to comment on the difficulties of the surcharge, because it was this government that introduced it. It was a failure before it started. It is the only tax in the current tax system that we can legitimately criticise as not collecting revenue and costing an enormous amount of money to operate. It has been a flop. If anything is broke or broken in the tax system it is this government's new tax—the superannuation surcharge.
I was just about to conclude my remarks about the minor technical amendments that Senator Kemp referred to today. These are being made retrospective to 1996. Why is that occurring? Because there are numerous court challenges to the superannuation surcharge tax. There are hundreds of them, apparently. I believe that these so-called technical amendments are in order to retrospectively fix up the tax, before it may be ruled unconstitutional or illegal by the courts and the government will lose a significant amount of revenue. That was another reason why I was prompted to get up on my feet and contribute to this debate.
This is a rolling saga of difficulty with this super surcharge tax. Finally, the other element of hypocrisy in this legislation is that group certificates are to be used in respect of fringe benefits. That was one of the solutions we put forward to simplify the administration of the super surcharge tax in the first place. Here we have an example of this government picking up this idea. If they had done it in the first place, we would not have the sorts of problems that we have got with the so-called super surcharge. (Time expired)

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-03-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report is quite vital for Australian industry, particularly the digital broadcasting industry. It is important in the sense of not only an industry that makes money but also an industry that does much for the culture of Australia and the way Australians see themselves. This is a matter on which Senator Lundy has made many a good speech. The report is entitled Australian industry: thinking outside the box . The thrust of the report is that we, as Australians, should develop a digital broadcasting industry and should think in a way that enables that to happen. The report is to be welcomed insofar as it says 
 that we should develop such an industry and it is to be welcomed insofar as it plots ways in which that can be done. However, it does raise certain questions. For example, under the heading `Executive summary' it states:
Key challenges for Australian industry are to apply its expertise and creativity to the development of the new kinds of services that digital broadcasting can deliver, and to make those products and services available to the community in a convenient and understandable manner.
Nobody could argue with that proposition. The Senate might well ask how creativity is being engendered by the present government. A later report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—in fact, I think it is the next one to be considered by the Senate—talks about economic competition, competition of the marketplace. What is often lost in debates about competition in this chamber is that competition exists not only at an economic level but also at an intellectual level, an imaginative level—indeed at several levels. Often we hear people say, `Don't look at that competition which is so important.' The report states:
The potential demand for content development, enhanced programming and information services are more difficult to forecast but are likely to be substantial.
They would be more substantial if we allowed competition to go beyond simply the competition of the marketplace, if we stressed the need for competition at an intellectual level, an artistic level—levels other than the economic ones. The trouble with the approach that this report seems to take is that it looks simply at the level of competition in the marketplace.
Where are we going to get this outflow of creativity? Certainly not from just the marketplace. Education is another element. We do not teach enough history, language and poetry to allow the imagination to give the boost that is required to bring the digital broadcasting industry in Australia to the level that we all desire. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Digital Broadcasting Industry </title>,Documents,16,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-03-23,"—I am concerned about recent articles in the media reporting the increasing weight of Australians. Through the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s there has been an increase in the proportion of men and women who are overweight or obese. A recent article in Australia's Health 1998  quotes data from the risk factor prevalence surveys and the national nutrition survey. The proportion of overweight or obese women aged between 25 and 64 years has increased from 26.7 per cent in 1980 to 45.7 per cent in 1995, while the proportion of overweight men in the same age group has increased from 47.6 per cent to 66.3 per cent over the same period. The proportion of specifically obese men has increased dramatically from 7.8 per cent in 1980 to 17.6 per cent and, for women, from 6.9 per cent in 1980 to 16.1 per cent in 1995.
In an article in the Australian Journal of Public Health, David Crawford and Neville Owen reveal that the prevalence of overweight and obesity varies according to socio-demographic characteristics. The odds of being overweight or obese are higher in persons born in Southern Europe compared with those born in Australia; for persons with a low level of education compared with those of tertiary education or qualifications; for married men compared with never-married men; for plant machinery operators compared with professional people; and for women in the two lowest socio-economic categories compared with those in the highest category.
Crawford and Owen believe the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, the biological consequence and the socio-demographic distribution make excess body weight 
 a major public health problem. At all ages, significantly more men than women are overweight or obese. Studies show that women are more concerned with body weight than men and are more likely to take steps to reduce or to control it. This has led to some negative effects and unfortunate eating disorders. Men are concerned about being overweight but are less likely to do something about it.
The damage caused by obesity has led practitioners to urge governments to address weight gain as an urgent national health problem. Overweight and obesity increase the risk of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, gout, sleep apnoea, gallstones, arthritis, some forms of cancer, impotence and infertility. One in three Australian families will be affected by heart disease or stroke. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics highlight the alarming fact that heart and blood vessel disease is a major public health problem facing Australia today, claiming one life every 10 minutes. The cost to the Australian national health system is absolutely enormous.
While there has been a marked improvement in blood pressure levels amongst men and women in Australia, data from the National Heart Foundation's risk factor prevalence study reveals that the average levels of blood cholesterol are too high and represent a national health problem. More than 47 per cent of men and 39 per cent of women aged between 20 and 69 years had plasma cholesterol levels above the National Heart Foundation's desirable level.
The 1980s and early 1990s were tough for Australians. We may be seeing the result of a society in a depressed mood—recession, unemployment and the decline of the family unit. It is recognised that the unemployed and those from low income groups have higher levels of overweight and obesity.
There is 24-hour television nowadays. We have computers, computer games and the Internet. These electronic devices, becoming more popular every day, keep people glued to their chairs. Let's face it: there is not much physical exercise in watching television or chatting on the Internet. Additionally, many people are employed in occupations that 
 require little exercise. Take us, for example. We have a limited amount of time available for exercise. We can joke that we walk quite a number of kilometres each day around Parliament House, but how many of our staff take time out to exercise during the sitting weeks? There are people in the parliament who do exercise regularly and quite vigorously, such as Senator Alston. Senator Chapman is another. We all need to set aside time each day for daily exercise regularly and in moderation.
The National Heart Foundation reveals that treatment of established obesity is successful in a minority of cases, so particular attention needs to be devoted to the avoidance of obesity. Children consume a lot of food and they also watch a lot of television. Up to 93 per cent of television advertisements in children's timeslots are for food—and they are not for fruit and vegetables.
Too little time is spent on physical education in schools and too many fatty items are for sale in school canteens—no doubt the popular ones that are advertised on television—and, as mum and dad both work, the school lunch box is actually disappearing from the school grounds. The Australian Medical Association has called for rigorous exercise to be made compulsory in all schools to `help reverse the ballooning rate of fat Australians'. Perhaps school canteens should be encouraged to stock 100 per cent health food, not junk food. Workplace food should also be addressed and more emphasis paid to eating healthy food in the work environment. Unions and employer groups should be proactive in this area, recognising that physical activity and diet are part of occupational health and safety policies and practices. Local councils can also assist by constructing cycle and walking paths, skateboard parks and the like. There may be a case for government to actually introduce tax deductions for gym fees.
The National Health and Medical Research Council is extremely concerned about Australians getting fatter. Background papers contributed to the development of a single strategic plan for the prevention of overweight and obesity entitled `Acting on Australia's 
 weight'. In summary, this report states that the trend of increasing levels of overweight and obesity in the population is likely to be the result of small decreases in physical activity and small changes in food intake by most rather than the extreme inactivity and excessive food intake among the few. Australians, therefore, eat too much and exercise too little. The National Health and Medical Research Council report states that many epidemiological studies report a negative correlation between physical activity and weight gain and that it is highly probable that the increase in overweight and obesity in Australia and similar societies over the past few decades is associated with a reduction in physical activity during the same period.
The strategic plan is about changing the macroenvironment to make it easier for people to undertake physical activity and to make healthier food choices. Its goals must be to prevent further weight gain in adults, to eventually reduce the proportion of the adult population that is overweight or obese and to ensure the healthy growth of children. The time frame for implementation of the strategy is 10 years, from January 1997, with an interim evaluation to take place after five years. I will eagerly await the progress reports.
The Life, be in it, `Norm', television advertisements, with their familiar music and quaint jingle, may be just what we need now to get us out of our armchairs and office chairs, away from the computer and television, onto our bikes and into our walking gear in order to exercise on a daily basis.

MAJOR PROJECTS
(1) I am advised that the Federation Fund Task Force within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet examined applications for assistance from the Federation Fund and prepared summary assessments of the proposals against the Government's announced criteria for Federation Fund projects.
Except for those projects announced before the establishment of the Task Force—the National Museum of Australia and the associated building 
 for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, and the Alice Springs to Darwin railway—all applications for assistance from the Federation Fund were assessed by the Task Force.
(2) See Table 1.
(3) and (4) I am advised that the Federation Fund Task Force examined proposals and assessed their suitability against the Government's announced criteria. It did not make recommendations to ministers.
Cabinet established a Committee of Ministers to consider proposals and the associated Task Force assessments, and to select suitable major projects. All selections were ratified by Cabinet.
(5) No—those details are Cabinet-in-Confidence.
(6) See Table 2.
FEDERATION CULTURAL AND HERITAGE PROJECTS (FCHP) PROGRAM
The Federation Cultural and Heritage projects (FCHP) program is jointly administered by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. All eligible projects submitted for funding under the FCHP program were assessed by the Federation Task Group, which was made up of officers from the two departments.
I am advised that the National Council for the Centenary of Federation provided additional independent advice on the capacity of all eligible FCHP projects to suitably mark the Centenary of Federation.
The assessment process was conducted in line with departmental guidelines, which were developed using the Australian National Audit Office's Better Practice Guide for the Administration of Grants , to ensure that the approval or refusal of applications for grants were transparent and well documented. The guidelines were endorsed by Ministers Hill and Alston in July 1998.

(2) See Table 3.
(3) I am advised that a list of all FCHP projects was submitted to Ministers Hill and Alston on 14 August 1998. As part of the assessment process conducted by the Federation Task Group, each eligible project was rated against a set of program criteria. Highly rated projects were identified, but no specific projects were recommended for funding.
The National Council for the Centenary of Federation forwarded separate advice to Ministers on 7 August 1998.
(4) I am advised that no FCHP projects were recommended by the Task Group. A list of highly rated projects and a list of all projects were provided to Minister Alston with a brief requesting that he consult Minister Hill to select a group of projects totalling $70.4 million for endorsement by Government.
(5) FCHP projects recommended by Ministers Hill and Alston were approved by the Prime Minister on 28 August 1998.
The full program of FCHP projects was announced formally in a joint media release by Ministers Hill and Alston on 15 October 1998.
Individual announcements for some projects were made before 15 October 1998. Table 4 provides details of those announcements.
FEDERATION COMMUNITY PROJECTS (FCP) PROGRAM
I am advised that no funding decisions have been made by the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation.
Members of Parliament have been requested to submit applications and Electorate Selection Committee recommendations to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts by 26 February 1999.
