"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-02-08,"—This legislation, the Australian Passports Bill 2004, was introduced in the last parliament, along with the Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004 and the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004. However, the legislation had not passed through the parliament before its prorogation and so it was reintroduced in the new parliament in December last year. This is our next opportunity to debate this legislation.
Two of the bills are unchanged since their previous introduction, while the Australian Passports Bill 2004 has been amended in a minor way. The Australian Passports Bill 2004 replaces the Passports Act 1938—and it is probably high time—and provides an entirely new passports act. It repeals Australian passports provisions in the 1938 act.
In a time of international terror, the maintenance of a world-class passports system is a key national security issue. Effective border security is part of the first line of defence in a strategic environment where threats may take the form of a lone individual or individuals, rather than the militarised conflicts we more normally associate with national security. Thus the Australian Passports Bill 2004 sets up a modern legal structure which will do a number of things. Firstly, it will provide Australian citizens with the best possible passports. Secondly, it will provide a passport law to complement national security, border protection and Australian law enforcement measures, as well as international law enforcement cooperation. And, thirdly, it will provide consistency with family law, privacy and administrative law principles.
The Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill repeals superseded provisions of the 1938 act and renames that act the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2004. This legislation makes the following improvements to the law governing Australian travel documents. Firstly, it provides, for the first time, a clear statement that Australian citizens have the right to a passport. Secondly, it increases the penalties for passport fraud to 10 years imprisonment or fines totalling $110,000. Thirdly, it introduces a framework for the use of technology—and later we can talk about the current technological advancements in this area. Fourthly, it will establish that disputes between parents regarding the international travel of minors should be dealt with by the courts. Fifthly, it improves refusal or cancellation mechanisms on law enforcement grounds or if a person is likely to engage in harmful conduct. Sixthly, it attempts to ameliorate problems caused by lost and stolen passports—it tries to overcome the difficulties that people have when passports are either lost or stolen—and in that instance it will provide a much better outcome for customers. Seventhly, it introduces various privacy measures, such as increased transparency in obtaining information for the verification of identity and citizenship and it regulates the disclosure of passport information for other limited purposes.
The bill also sets out the following major changes: first, it empowers the minister to make determinations regarding methods or technologies for identification or other purposes under the bill; secondly, it changes the framework and procedures by which passports may be refused or cancelled; thirdly, it creates new offences and enhances penalties; and, fourthly, it establishes new measures in regard to the use of information and associated privacy procedures.
You can see from the range of changes that they are not small changes. These changes ensure the modernising of the passports system in Australia. They provide in total a better position. Therefore, Labor supports the measures. The new bills include an amendment sought by Labor to division 2, clause 47 of the Australian Passports Bill 2004. There is always an opportunity for Labor to not only examine and agree to contents but also suggest improvements. It is worthwhile mentioning at this point that the government has picked up on the improvements that Labor has put forward.
This amendment refers to the authorisation by the minister of the use of particular methods and technologies as they apply to passports. That ministerial determination must now specify the nature of the personal information to be collected and the purpose for which it may be used. This is to build community confidence that personal information will be protected, while allowing for the adoption of new technologies such as biometrics. I suspect over the years we will hear more about biometrics and their use in identifying individuals. It is one of those areas that is important to get right at the beginning so we do not end up in a position where it becomes unclear whether personal information can be collected and what uses are appropriate. We need to make sure that it is adapted for the purposes it is supposed to be used for.
The integration of such technologies into the Australian passports system is necessary to ensure that our passports system not only provides maximum protection but can also integrate with other systems being adopted around the world. These are not simply advancements that are occurring within Australia. There have also been advancements overseas in ensuring that travel documents identify the individual, remain secure to the individual and are protected from being copied or otherwise used unlawfully. Australia has to maintain vigilance in this area to ensure that we are within world’s best practice. The Australian Passports Bill also includes certain changes from the original bill in regard to the cancellation of passports. I will not discuss them here. Suffice it to say that Labor supports those changes.
There have also been changes in regard to privacy provisions. The first clarifies arrangements for requesting information from private sector organisations. The second removes the specific reference to disclosure of passport information for national security purposes. That particularly relates to clause 46(d), which is an area covered specifically by the Privacy Act. In another change from the previous bill, the government has attempted to align this legislation more closely with administrative law principles, which in my view is always a good thing. The Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004 and the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004 remain unchanged.
We support the proposed amendments in the Australian Passports Bill 2004, reintroduced into the House of Representatives on 2 December and now available for debate in the Senate. We believe that the delay of several months in the passage of the legislation, and the refinement that it has allowed, will provide a better legal framework for Australian travel documents. I would like to concur with my colleague in the other House Kevin Rudd, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security, that it is unfortunate that these improvements would not have occurred had it not been for the proroguing of parliament.
Simply put, the additional time, closer scrutiny and willingness to compromise has produced a much better document in the end. It is certainly a much better bill and has thus been able to gain our support. This legislation has been improved through closer examination and, I believe, will serve the Australian people better than the original proposal. So Labor supports the passage of this legislation and the modernisation of our passports law to reflect contemporary needs. It is long overdue. We support it as an attempt to strengthen our national security structures and to provide a better service to the Australian public.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to this package of legislation to do with Australian passports. The Australian Passports Bill 2004, the Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004 and the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004 are important. They update the laws covering the issuing and cancellation of passports and administrative matters relating to passports, including fees. The legislation is thus welcome.
The bills cover a number of different areas, as Senator Ludwig has just outlined. There are changes to the methods and technologies for identification in relation to passports that are aimed at combating identity fraud, which is not just the production of fraudulent documents. Identity theft is certainly an area that needs continued vigilance, with most people thinking it is more important to ensure that a passport really belongs to the person holding it. Updating the laws to enable better effectiveness in addressing identity fraud is certainly a goal that the Democrats and, I expect, all Australians are supportive of.
The key question is how you do that: what powers you give to the minister, the government or the department and whether those powers are appropriate and whether the protections in place are adequate. Certainly, some privacy questions arise that I will touch on shortly. There are issues to do with the grounds for refusal and cancellation of passports, and issues to do with the criminal offences relating to travel documents—including increasing penalties, fines and maximum terms of imprisonment in relation to those offences. There are also aspects of the bill which enable the minister to obtain various pieces of personal information for a range of purposes. The general goals of the bills are something that most people would be very supportive of. The key question—and part of the important role of the Senate is to answer this—is whether it achieves those goals in a way that is going to be as effective as possible and that ensures sufficient protections for the Australian public.
When giving a minister, or indeed anybody, power over people’s information and details, we should always ask whether those powers are necessary and whether the protections surrounding the use of those powers are adequate. This broader issue is something that has been raised in relation to this legislation because of its ability to enable biometrics to be used as part of passports in the future. As I understand it, the bill does not specifically mention biometric technology, but I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that there is an intention that the bill will provide for the introduction of facial recognition or photo-matching technology and, potentially, other technology down the track.
It is important to emphasise—and I draw on comments which the former Privacy Commissioner, Mr Malcolm Crompton, made in an address about biometrics and privacy he gave to the Biometrics Institute Conference in Sydney—that there are strong arguments in favour of the use of biometrics from a privacy perspective, as well as strong arguments or cautions against it. What really matters is the protections surrounding it. The technology itself is not inherently bad or inherently good, as with any of the other technologies that are currently used. In many respects, at least in terms of the initial likely usage of this, it is probably not going to be particularly different from the current situation of facial or photo matching via the use of photographs that are provided—and, as anybody who has applied for a passport would know, a photograph is one of the things you have to provide. We already use biometrics in a range of areas in Australia, and some of the key considerations that are involved—and these are things that Mr Crompton flagged—are bodily privacy in the collection of biometrics, openness and choice in the collection of biometrics, the potential for data linkage and function creep, and the potential for that information to act as a universal unique identifier.
In terms of what the government or minister is likely to use the updated and clarified powers under this new legislation for, it is not particularly likely that concerns are going to be raised as part of that. But concern does need to be raised about its potential future usage. This is an important question and principle that will need to be highlighted far more specifically into the future, given that the single greatest protection for the rights and freedoms of Australians is about to be lost—the independence of the Senate. From 1 July the government will have control of the Senate. It will mean they will be able to push through any changes to legislation they like. They will be able to push through any regulations they like. Until that situation changes back again and there is some degree of independent scrutiny of what the government does in the future, then it makes it all the more vital that any powers that are given to a minister or a department have enough protections already built into the legislation to ensure that the powers cannot be misused down the track by not just this government but any future government of any political persuasion. That is why it is appropriate to raise concerns about what powers might be used for in the future, even though the current minister can give, and indeed has to some extent given, satisfactory commitments about what the powers will be used for with photo-matching technology in the immediate future.
Extra uses can be brought in in future via regulation and, as senators would know but perhaps the public does not, regulations or secondary legislation is far less adequate in terms of guaranteeing proper parliamentary and public scrutiny. Similarly, regulations cannot be overturned if the government has control of the Senate unless there is a sudden outbreak of genuine independence amongst government senators—and I will believe that when I see it. So that basic principle is one that applies not just to this bill but to every bill the Senate passes from now on. Every Senate committee will certainly need to closely examine every piece of legislation to determine not just what the government of today will use the powers contained in the legislation for but whether there are protections built into the legislation against a future government using those powers for means that may be less benign or positive.
For the record, my view is that in most respects the changes and the aims that are contained in this legislation are positive measures. Measures that reduce the chances of identity theft and identity fraud are clearly very positive. Measures that reduce the ability of criminals, terrorists or whoever to obtain false passports or misrepresent themselves as somebody else should be supported but, as I and other Democrats have repeatedly said in this chamber, we have to be very careful to make sure that, in bringing in necessary changes, we do not also put in place extra discretionary powers for a minister that will allow freedoms to be taken away in the future unless a clear justification is given.
I make those comments more as a broad statement of principle about the general need to ensure that there are checks and balances on the discretion and power of any government minister. The statements are not an attack, or anything of the sort, on this government or the current minister. They are a statement of principle about the way our system of government is meant to function. It is a system of checks and balances where no one individual will have too great a concentration of power with too little scope for independent accountability, for oversight of how those powers are used and for limitations on those powers being expanded without further scrutiny and further agreement from an independent source. That system of checks and balances is now much more at risk with the loss of the independence of the Senate that will occur shortly, and it is particularly important when we are talking about new technologies down the track. In most respects, photo matching is not a particularly new concept, although perhaps it may now be being done in a different way.
This bill also opens up the scope for other technologies down the track. One of the risks associated with biometric technology that Mr Crompton outlined, which I referred to before, is what he calls ‘function creep’. That occurs when information that is collected for one purpose is gradually used for a range of additional purposes. Because of the protections contained in the Privacy Act, function creep generally involves legislative authorisation to use information for additional purposes. The most obvious example is the vastly expanded use of the tax file number which was originally brought in for a very precise and limited purpose and is now being used for a wide range of purposes. All of those changes to the use or purpose have been authorised by subsequent laws, so I am not in any way saying that those wider usages are invalid. I simply say that once you open up legal authorisation more widely there is an innate tendency to expand things down the track. It is because of the issue of function creep that the Democrats retain some concern about the nature of this legislation, because it does provide for ministerial determination in relation to a range of details—from the technology that is to be used to whether information can be disclosed to another person.
Because of that reliance on ministerial determination, rather than the need for future legislative change, the potential for function creep is increased. It is always easier for governments—and I can very much understand why they prefer it this way—to get the general principle through in legislation and then, as changes and refinements need to be made down the track, to have the ability to make them in a much more prompt manner and, government ministers and public servants would probably argue, in a more efficient manner. If there is a need to draft changes to the laws, to put them before Senate committees and to introduce them in the parliament, it can be a lot slower. But it is also a lot safer and there is much greater protection of the freedoms of the individual and the community. In balancing the natural desire for maximum flexibility and speed, which governments always like, with the need to have adequate safeguards, checks and balances and protections for the community, I certainly believe you should always err somewhat on the side of caution without going overboard about it. Because of that prospect of ministerial determinations being made in the future, some of which will require regulations to be brought in, we do not believe that is necessarily an adequate protection against potential future misuse and future extra powers going to the government.
Certainly the area of ministerial determination I am most familiar with that of migration law. It is an enormous area of power for a minister. That ministerial discretion is virtually unlimited in some respects, with virtually no oversight of how that power is used and no opportunity for independent scrutiny. I suppose it is because of my experiences in that area—where I have seen what was originally proposed as a very minor piece of the law, to be used as a last resort or a safety net in extreme cases, over time expand to become a major aspect of the operation of some components of the migration law—that I am much more conservative about giving ministers, in any areas, further powers where they can make changes simply by exercising their discretion without adequate protections being built in. What is being proposed here, let me hasten to add, is nothing like what is in the Migration Act in terms of the scope of ministerial power and the lack of any scrutiny of what the minister does in certain areas. I simply draw on that as an example of what can happen when open-ended ministerial discretion powers are allowed to take hold without adequate scrutiny of, and accountability for, how those powers are used.
It is those two aspects that I would emphasise: firstly, down the track, what other things might those powers be used for and how adequate or otherwise will be the ability to scrutinise changes and extra uses of those powers that may occur; and, secondly, whether adequate processes are in place to scrutinise how the powers are being used. That is something that will be an ongoing task. I am sure it is something that those who have an interest in this area will continue to do: to look at how these powers are used—from a positive perspective, not just negative one. People have recognised the potential positive benefits of biometric technology for a whole range of reasons and we need to continually learn, as it is used, how it can be better used and what additional benefits can be gained from it. From that perspective as well, it is beneficial to have sufficient transparency of the monitoring of the use of technology so that people can learn from it and come up with ways of doing it better. In areas like this, where technological development is fairly rapid and the potential for a range of uses continues to grow, opportunities for input into how things might be done in the future are very important.
So, whilst the tone of my contribution has probably been focused on the negative or at least on sounding a warning, I do acknowledge the potential of this legislation—the potential benefits of biometric technology and, indeed, other technologies when they are used. As with any power, the key thing is that it is appropriately constrained and cannot be expanded without further future scrutiny and awareness and, secondly, that there is adequate oversight with how those powers are used. In those areas, I am still not convinced that the protections in this legislation are necessarily adequate, but my concern has more to do with how the technology may be used in the future than how I anticipate it will be used immediately. I think it is appropriate to put those concerns on the record. They are areas that in many ways link into the concerns that have been raised by the Democrats over a long period.
People will perhaps recall former senator Janine Haines and her concerns about the use by governments of personal information and the need for good protections about that. Her campaigning about privacy issues has been taken up and continued, particularly by Senator Stott Despoja in her exploration of a range of these issues, not least in the current Senate committee inquiry about the adequacy of the privacy regime across the board that is in place. I urge people who have concerns or views of any sort about some of the wider issues to do with the use of technology, personal information and privacy related issues to make submissions to that inquiry.
In many respects, it is the adequacy of our overarching privacy regime and privacy legislation in Australia that is the key. It needs to be made as effective as possible, balancing all the competing challenges rather than homing in on just one particular area of its usage. Despite the government having control of the Senate from 1 July, I am sure the Senate will continue through its committee process to play an invaluable role in engaging with and getting the expertise of the public about how we can do things better in a whole range of areas. The privacy regime is certainly one of those areas and that Senate committee inquiry, which was established at the end of last year, is certainly one that I would encourage people with an interest in this area to engage in.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—The Australian Passports Bill 2004 and its attendant bills, the Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004 and the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004, comprise a timely addition to the body of law governing Australia’s national security, especially in a world now facing the ever-increasing risk of terrorist attacks and of identity fraud. As Senator Bartlett has outlined, the Democrats have concerns with the bills as drafted. These bills, which replace the Passports Act 1938, will strengthen the probability of uncovering identity fraud and the possible misuse of passports by terrorists and other criminals through the introduction of facial biometric technology to verify identity. Additionally, under these bills the penalties for passport fraud will substantially increase.
However, what has not been addressed in this debate so far, or in the attendant publicity and information surrounding the bills, is the problem with the way in which Australians presently find themselves abused by our system. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 June 2004 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, was cited as giving his assurance that these new powers would be administered fairly and that natural justice would be preserved. He was cited as saying:
The government’s policy is that Australian passports should not be used as an extension of the judicial system and should not be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose.
It is these concepts of fair administration and natural justice concerning identity fraud that concern me with this new passports legislation.
To illustrate my concerns, I would like to draw attention to a specific and fairly recent example concerning the mistaken identity of an Australian citizen returning home after a trip abroad. In October 2003, my electorate office received via email a confidential submission for the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into children in institutional care. This submission was from an adult male who had been put into the care of Parkerville Children’s Home in Western Australia as a young child. There, he was subjected to such cruel treatment that he absconded regularly, only to be found and returned—and that is a common story for many of those who were abused in institutions. At the age of 14 he finally succeeded in absconding, making his way up north, where he secured work as a jackaroo. He states in his confidential submission, No. 93, that his tragic and traumatic time at Parkerville will remain with him forever. He remained working in the pastoral industry for many years and received many an award, including an excellence award for jackaroo of the year.
Another form of abuse, known as secondary abuse to those who understand this field, was to plague him in his adult years. With thoughts of overseas travel, he applied for a passport for the first time in 1999. When he did so, there was some confusion over his actual identity, because when he gave his name and what he thought was his birth date he was told that he already had a passport, which he did not. When asked for details of his birth and parents in a subsequent interview with a passport official, he could not supply this information as he just did not know—an all too common problem for the hundreds of thousands of those who have been raised in care in Australia. On producing his drivers licence a passport was issued.
In mid-2002 he was to fly to Holland with his fiancee to meet her family, only to find after intensive searches that he had mislaid his passport. Again, there was confusion over his identity, but this time he was actually interviewed by two federal agents. His fiancee flew back to Holland without him and eventually another passport was issued. Unfortunately, when he was finally able to join his fiancee overseas, his passport was stolen. When he reported this and went to collect a new one, he was given a new ID by the authorities in the name of the person they believed him to be. However, on attempting to book a flight home, he was told that this person had never left Australia and that he could not fly. So began another attempt to sort out his identity and passport at the Australian embassy in The Hague. Eventually, a travel document was issued to allow him to fly back home, but yet again it was in another name.
On arrival back in Australia last November, his nightmare continued with his immediate arrest at the airport by the Federal Police and subsequent detention. He then appeared in court on a charge of making false statements to procure an Australian passport, and his application for bail was refused on the grounds that he was a flight risk. At no time throughout these circumstances was it ever apparent that anyone from the department, the authorities or the police had any idea that identity issues are a major problem for hundreds of thousands of Australians who have been in care. The matter was eventually dismissed by the court.
The distress and frustration this Australian citizen experienced at being accused of deliberately defrauding the government to obtain an ID for a passport cannot be underestimated. Even though he is no stranger to abuse, considering his time spent in care as a child, this form of secondary abuse has caused him unnecessary pain and suffering. He somewhat poignantly writes that these events have:
... stirred up a lot of old nightmares and pain which I had thought were forgotten. The biggest issue I have is the stigma of being in Parkerville and being treated by authorities as a nobody and now being expected to prove who I am.
What is more, in spite of his embedded distrust of authority figures, he patriotically writes:
I am not seeking compensation or publicity. I am not seeking to embarrass my government. I am not looking for anything other than my name and my life to be given back to me. I am proud to be an Australian, I am proud of what Australia stands for and I am proud of what I have achieved given the circumstances of my early childhood.
This example of alleged passport fraud goes a long way to arguing the case that it is imperative that ‘fairness’ and ‘natural justice’ are safeguarded in these new bills and, more importantly, safeguarded in the exercise of authority under these new bills, especially for the people who are still searching for their true identities after being raised in care. Indeed, the search for identity for these people is a particularly onerous and frustrating task. Poor record keeping and the destruction of records by fires, church and other organisations or under government department orders has often made it nigh on impossible for them to either find or reconnect with family members or use the documents for more official practical purposes such as obtaining a passport. Right now the Senate has an inquiry into privacy, but there are miserable creatures who refuse to allow a change to the terms of reference which would allow for these sorts of issues, such as whether at times privacy principles need to be adjusted for people who cannot access their records and are denied their identity, to be assessed.
The August 2001 child migrant report Lost innocents: righting the record devotes a whole chapter, chapter 6, to the vital issue of identity. There are 40 pages to the chapter and it has 17 recommendations. I remind the Senate that this was a unanimous report, but if you were to ask the ministers or the officials responsible whether they are acquainted with that report and chapter I would venture to suggest that they are not. Of course, that report has been followed up by a further report, Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children, by the same committee—again a unanimous report—which again focuses on the issues of identity for, I repeat, hundreds of thousands of Australians. The great difficulty we have is that I very much doubt that successive ministers and their key officials have even read the report. Nor is there a system of automatically red-flagging a child migrant or a person in care to an official who would be aware of these identity issues. It is obviously impractical for an entire department to be aware of them, but it must be possible for a system to be introduced where, when there is a specific identity issue, there are people who are experienced in that area.
Like Jews in Nazi Germany, many of these Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous children and child migrants were known by number, not by name. It is a disgrace. Many had their names changed and their identity perverted by the good and charitable who ran those places of abuse. The loss of identity has had enormous practical implications for former child migrants. With no birth certificates they have experienced difficulties in obtaining passports and other documentation. It is also true of those Australian born children in institutions: those who were deserted by their parents, orphaned or simply handed over to the authorities frequently have no means of tracing their background and identity. Where is that issue attended to in the statements of ministers, the reaction of government and the examination of these bills? And this is when they have had two reports by the Senate unanimously recommending attention to these areas. Moreover, most former child migrants and others in care have discovered as adults that they were not even recognised as Australian citizens. Imagine the effect this has on these people, Defence Minister, especially when many—and this is typical of institutional kids—have fought for this country and went to war for Australia.
At the time this bill was to be debated in August last year, my office had yet another request—and there have been many—for assistance from a former child migrant planning to travel back to the United Kingdom to visit the grave of his mother whom he had never met. When he applied for a passport he learnt that he was not classified as an Australian citizen and, as he had spent time in prison—I should add that this is something not uncommon for victims of brutal institutional life—he faced possible deportation. The Senate committee recommended that the issue of citizenship should be dealt with sympathetically for people in those circumstances. Needless to say, the devastation and angst he experienced when informed of this situation was soul destroying for him.
You only have to speak to experts in organisations like the Child Migrants Trust, a wonderful and badly underfunded service provider, or the Christian Brothers Ex-Residents and Students Services, who provide a very good service trying to deal with this area, to realise what a huge issue identity is for Australians who have been in institutions—all 500,000-plus of them: the Indigenous Australians, the British and Maltese child migrants and the non-Indigenous Australians. I despair of those from a privileged silvertail or landed gentry background who have a decidedly un-Christian disdain and disregard for people with these unfortunate backgrounds and a visceral antagonism to the people and agencies trying to help them. This is a government that at times seems to revel in a harsh reputation, safe and secure in the knowledge that too many Australians care little about how the unfortunate or the disadvantaged are treated. Yet I am not without hope. I know that there are very many good people in the government ranks, and those people should join us in urging the government as a whole to give due consideration to ‘fairness’ and ‘natural justice’ in the administration of the powers under these laws for those Australians whose identity has always been hidden from them.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—I seek leave to incorporate a speech by Senator Stott Despoja.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-02-08,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I speak on these Bills primarily in my capacity as the Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the Australian Democrats. However, since the Bills have very significant implications for the privacy of all Australian passport holders, it is also relevant in this context that I am the Democrats’ Privacy Spokesperson.
I begin by indicating that the Democrats accept that the Government’s genuine intention in introducing these Bills is, as the Minister’s Second Reading Speech indicated, to “provide a modern legal structure to underpin our world-class passports system” and “to ensure that Australians can continue to rely on a travel document of the highest integrity, which clearly establishes their identity and citizenship.
The Democrats support those objectives, however, we believe that Government has gone well beyond them in the drafting of this Bill and, as a consequence, what we have before us today is bad legislation.
As we know, there are four main aspects to the Australian Passports Bill.
Firstly, in an effort to combat identity fraud, the Bill makes changes to the methods and technologies for identification in relation to passports.
Although the Bill contains no express mention of biometric technology, the Minister has made it clear that the Government intends to introduce such technology, indicating that the Bill “provides for the introduction of facial biometric technology as an effective means of verifying identity”.
The will be achieved by vesting the Minister with the power to authorise the use of particular methods and technologies for confirming identification or performing other functions connected with the Bill.
Secondly, the Bill expands the grounds for the refusal or cancellation of passports. For example, the Minister may refuse to issue a passport upon request from a competent authority if the person is the subject of an arrest warrant in respect of a serious foreign offence.
The Minister may also refuse a passport to a person who has lost, or had stolen, 2 or more passports in 5 years.
These provisions reflect similar provisions in relation to foreign travel documents which were enacted last year in the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3). Like the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3), this Bill will enable the Minister to certify that a particular decision relates to matters of international relations or criminal intelligence. If the Minister issues such a certificate, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will have no option but to affirm the Minister’s decision or remit it back to the Minister for reconsideration.
Thirdly, the Bill creates a range of new criminal offences relating to travel documents—for example, selling an Australian travel document, dishonestly obtaining an Australian travel document, transporting a false travel document across international borders, and using powers under this Bill for wrong reasons.
It is important to note that these offences will apply extraterritorially—in other words, a person will be able to be convicted of an offence regardless of whether or not the conduct constituting the offence occurred within Australia.
Penalties are increased from a maximum fine of $5000 and/or 2 years imprisonment to a maximum fine of $110,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment.
Finally, the Bill enables the Minister to obtain, use and disclose personal information for a range of purposes associated with the Bill, for example verifying information provided by an applicant for a passport.
The Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill will, according to the Government, “establish a simpler structure to deal with changes in the costs and validity of passports and other travel-related documents”. In actual fact, it could facilitate a massive increase in the cost of obtaining an Australian passport.
This Bill gives the Minister the power to specify application fees for Australian travel documents. These fees are “imposed as taxes” and the “application fee need not bear any relationship to the cost” of the travel document.
The maximum fee for the first year of the Bill’s operation is $1000, which is an extraordinary increase on the current application fee of $150 for a standard passport. However, we have been informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that this is simply an arbitrary figure which is intended to cover all possible increases to passport fees over the next, say, 30 years. I understand that there is no intention whatsoever to increase the cost of a passport to $1000 and it is important for that to be put on public record.
The Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill will, among other things, remove references to Australian passports from the Passports Act and rename that Act as the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act.
I turn now to the Democrats’ key concerns in relation to these Bills. Our primary concern relates to the Minister’s sweeping new powers and the potential impact on the privacy of Australian passport holders under the principle Australian Passports Bill.
The Bill is not specific about exactly what type of technology the Minister may authorise to identify passport holders. In fact, while the Government has indicated that it intends to introduce a biometric system, there is no mention of biometric technology in the Bill. Because of this ambiguity, there is nothing in the legislation to stop the Minister eventually going as far as requiring genetic information to identify passport holders.
This is an unacceptable situation, regardless of whether the Minister’s determination is a disallowable instrument. Many of you in this place would be aware of my long-term interest in genetic privacy issues and my strong view that there is a need for legislation to protect the privacy of sensitive genetic information. Indeed, I introduced a Private Senator’s Bill with this very objective in 1998.
The absence of any legislation to protect the privacy of genetic information is exactly why general powers such as those contained in this Bill are particularly problematic—as there is no guarantee that they will not be used in a manner which violates the genetic privacy of Australian passport holders.
However, even looking at the immediate proposal for a biometric identification system, there is no indication in the Bill as to what kind of biometric system this might be.
The Bills Digest, for example, identifies two different types of biometric systems which could be adopted. The first of these relies on machine readable travel documents, as advocated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
As the Digest explains:
“This method uses a MRTD in which a data-chip is embedded. A computer can then access biometric data from the chip, matching the data with the biometrics of the person purporting to be the passport-holder. In some ways, this is an automated version of the current system of identity confirmation whereby a human Customs or Immigration (or like) officer manually matches a traveller with his or her photographic identification. This method does not rely on a database of passport-holders’ biometric details.”
On the other hand, the Government could opt for a database containing the biometric details of all Australian passport holders, which could be accessed through network-connected computers when passengers leave and enter Australia. The Bills Digest indicates that this is the model the US intends to use for all visitors to the US under its US-VISIT scheme.
My understanding of the Government’s proposal is that it involves features of each of these models. It is predominantly a machine-readable system, however the Government will maintain a database of computerised photographs of all passport holders.
But, quite apart from the merits or otherwise of a biometric database, the Bill fails to provide any rules as to how biometric information is to be collected, stored, protected or used. The Democrats would hope that, at the very least, this type of information would be included in any determination made by the Minister, however, we maintain our position that any specific technology proposed to be used in relation to identity verification, should be considered by the Parliament and not left to the Minister’s discretion.
We do not accept that it is sufficient for the Parliament to have the power to disallow a determination made by the Minister. This will not allow the same degree of community participation in any decision to adopt new passport technologies and, given the very large number of Australians who would be affected by such a decision, the Democrats believe it is important for such matters to be subject to proper Parliamentary scrutiny, including a Committee Inquiry if necessary.
The Democrats believe that the Government should set out the details of its proposed biometric system in the text of the Bill. We note that, while the collection and management of passport identification information would be subject to the Privacy Act, the protection afforded by the Privacy Act is not particularly strong and notoriously difficult to enforce. Indeed, that is why I initiated the current Senate Inquiry into current privacy legislation and the extent to which it is capable of responding to new technologies.
In relation to the Minister’s power to disclose personal information for law enforcement, family law or other Commonwealth purposes, the Democrats are concerned that this could lead to the passport identification system becoming a de facto national biometric database which could be used by the Government for a variety of reasons.
The Bills Digest warns:
“These provisions could make the passports system a process by which the Commonwealth could obtain and centralise a large amount of personal information about Australian passport-holders which could be put to a very broad range of uses with minimal parliamentary scrutiny”.
The Australian Privacy Foundation has warned that this could result in passports becoming “a de-facto Australia card” and, as the Australian Consumers’ Association has pointed out, the legislation will “affect some 8 million passport holders”.
There are a couple of other concerns which the Democrats have in relation to this suite of Bills that I wish to place on record.
Firstly, there are restrictions on the appeal process if a person is refused a passport or has their passport cancelled on international relations or criminal intelligence grounds. If the Minister certifies that his or her decision involves matters of international relations or criminal intelligence, the AAT will have no choice but to either affirm the Minister’s decision or remit it to the Minister for reconsideration.
The Democrats believe this is unsatisfactory, given the enormous impact of the Minister’s decision on a person who is subsequently prevented from leaving Australia. It continues the disturbing trend towards more opaque decision-making on the basis that decisions relate to security, or in this case international relations or criminal intelligence.
Perhaps a more appropriate approach would be to limit the evidence which the AAT can consider as opposed to limiting the orders it can make.
Another concern which I wish to flag is that there is an anomaly relating to the form of Australian travel documents which means that Australian women who marry overseas will need to change their name by deed poll if they wish to use their married name on Australian travel documents. This new policy, which is contained in a DFAT directive, has already affected two Australian women. I understand that DFAT is aware of this issue but is not sure how to rectify it at this stage.
In conclusion, I can indicate that, while the Democrats have no in principle objection to the use of biometric technology in passports, we believe that the introduction of such technology must be accompanied by appropriate safeguards to ensure that the privacy of Australians is protected. In their current form, these Bills fail to include the appropriate protections. They are broad and ambiguous and the Democrats will not support them in their current form.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-02-08,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. It seems that the Australian Passports Bill 2004, the Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004 and the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004 are supported. In fact, generally the way I interpreted the contributions of the Labor Party and the spokesperson for the Australian Democrats was that they recognise the significant improvements within this legislation, which sets out the new passport scheme for our country.
I guess the only negative from Senator Bartlett was that he despaired the ‘loss of the independence of the Senate’ after 1 July this year. I do not quite understand what he means by that. He may be in some way reflecting on the choice of the Australian people to elect a majority of coalition members to the next Senate—and that might be his attitude towards the wishes of the majority of Australians—but the Senate will not change after 1 July. The numbers might change within the Senate, but it will be just as independent as it has ever been. I hope he does not mean that after 1 July there will be no role of scrutiny for his party. He will have just the same opportunities to scrutinise legislation and hold the government to account through his argument that he has now. Basically, whether he likes it or not, it will be the Australian people who will then pass judgment on whether the coalition in the Senate is doing a job they support or Senator Bartlett has persuaded them to some other position.
Senator Murray’s contribution was a different one. He raised the very real concern of those who, through no fault of their own, have difficulty in establishing their identity for passport reasons. He gave us the detail of one obviously very unfortunate case—it was a rather sad set of circumstances—and the great deal of anguish that a particular individual clearly went through. That is something we wish had not occurred. I have discussed the matter briefly with the officials and they tell me that, in the drafting of the regulations for this legislation, there will be sufficient discretion for them to make wise decisions in circumstances where people have difficulty in establishing their identity through traditional means. No doubt Senator Murray will have an opportunity, when he sees these regulations, to inform the Senate whether he believes they have adequately achieved the goal as expressed by the officials.
Whilst I do not in any way dispute his argument, I do ask him to also take into account the other side of the coin, which is the duty and responsibility of officials to protect the Australian people from abuses of the passport system. Sadly, that occurs. Through these legislative changes we hope there will be less opportunity for abuse. Nevertheless, the officials have a responsibility to enforce the legislation to protect the interests of the Australian people. That is not always an easy job. So I think there are two sides to this argument. On the one hand, we must be sensitive to those who, as I said, through no fault of their own have difficulty in establishing their identity. On the other hand, we must also understand and support officials who are doing their best to meet their responsibilities to the Australian people in seeking to avoid passport fraud. With those few words I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-02-08,"—Today the Senate is debating the Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004 and three related bills. The Senate is debating a number of bills to correct a hangover—and a mighty hangover it is—of the implementation nightmare of the GST. Five years after the implementation of the GST, here we are dealing with four bills to correct the hangover. It is now five years since the introduction of the GST!
—Move on!
—Senator Kemp, in his usual form, interjects and suggests that I move on, but we are dealing with Liberal government legislation to fix up the GST, which should have been fixed five years ago. Senator Kemp and the Liberal government moved on without fixing up the issues relating to the GST. Here we are, five years on, still trying to fix up the problems. If memory serves me correctly, this is about the 1,650th amendment to the GST since it was introduced five years ago.
One of the numerous difficult issues that arose at the time of the introduction of the GST was how to deal with long-term contracts entered into before the GST regime was introduced and for which no review opportunity has occurred. An example of such a contract would be a long-term lease by a bank over a branch office. If the GST had been applied immediately to these contract suppliers, they would have had to remit the GST on their supplies, but, because there is an existing contractual obligation, the contract price could not be changed to reflect the introduction of the GST. The recipient would have received the input tax credit without, so to speak, paying for it as a GST augmented price. In response, the Liberal government provided for a transitional regime that deferred the imposition of the GST on these contracts—and that effectively deferred the solution to the problem—until an opportunity occurred for the contracts to be reviewed. That transition period ends on 30 June 2005.
As I have said, the Liberal government has had five years to indicate in detail how it was going to fix this problem. Here we are at the eleventh hour and it has produced a set of bills. This is happening frequently at the moment. We are seeing tax bills, urgent bills, emerging from the government to deal with pressing concerns that should have been fixed five years ago. A problem with this approach is that it is attempting to railroad the Senate and the affected parties into a decision without an opportunity to have an input. The Labor Party, unlike this government, actually wanted to listen to the concerns that were being raised by parties particularly in the property industry about this last-minute solution to the issues that have been raised. It is just so typical of the arrogant approach of this Liberal government that we see emerging more and more. It is an approach that is arrogant, dismissive and uncaring, and it fails to listen to others.
The situation in relation to these bills could not, sadly, better reflect this arrogant approach of the Liberal government, particularly since their re-election. The Liberal government asked the Labor opposition in the last session to have the bill introduced into parliament, pushed straight through the Senate and passed on the same day. This is five years after the GST was implemented. Labor rightly called for a Treasury briefing in order to satisfy ourselves that the bill overall was an appropriate solution and mechanism to deal with the imposition of the GST on these contracts and also to consult with the affected parties. But the Liberal government refused to allow the Labor opposition to remove a copy of the bill from the briefing room, and we also had not seen an explanatory memorandum. In light of this, the Labor opposition allowed the bill to enter the House but insisted that a little more time, other than just the one day and the one sighting, was needed for the bill to be considered. Labor have listened to the representations from the sectors that are affected by the implementation regime. We have fully considered the legislation and consulted with the property sector, and Labor will be moving two amendments to the legislation when we enter into the committee debate on the bills. These are positive and fair suggestions that have been advanced by parties in the property sector who have been affected.
Before I touch on the amendments, the legislation we are speaking to as a whole seeks to provide a transitional phase for businesses engaged in long-term contracts which will be subject to the GST from 1 July 2005. A long-term agreement which was entered into prior to the commencement of the GST had no GST component negotiated in the contract. If suppliers under these long-term, non-reviewable contracts are unable to negotiate a change in the consideration to take account of the GST, they will have a GST liability from 1 July 2005, without the ability to recover the GST from their recipients. This has created the opportunity for major lessees of property to hold out, or at least to try to hold out, on renegotiating the contracts until after 1 July 2005 to avoid a price rise. The Liberal government has introduced this bill to try to ‘encourage’ such lessees to renegotiate the lease or end up paying the GST themselves. This is not an unexpected problem. It was a problem that was raised five years ago, when the GST was introduced. I would be interested to hear from Senator Murray what the Democrats—the party that teamed up with the Liberal government to allow the passage of the GST—thought about this particular problem at the time. I would be interested to know what the Democrats thought about this and why we are dealing with this mess five years on. Hopefully, Senator Murray can throw some light on that.
The bill provides for one of three outcomes. Firstly, the parties renegotiate the contract price, either voluntarily or through arbitration. The supplier can make an initial offer to adjust a price, which may be accepted by the recipient. If not accepted, the supplier can make an arbitrated offer to adjust the consideration. If accepted, the supplier remits one-eleventh of the renegotiated contract price, and the recipient receives input tax credits according to their usual entitlement. Secondly, if the recipient of the service under the contract rejects the offer of the supplier, the GST becomes payable by the recipient. Thirdly, the recipient of the supplies may make an irrevocable written election to pay the GST. Once an offer has been made by the supplier, the recipient has 28 days to accept it. Once an arbiter has ruled, the recipient has 21 days to accept the arbitration. A recipient who does not respond is liable for the GST.
Some problems with the approach in this bill have been raised with the Labor Party by the principal industry association for suppliers in this sector, the Property Council of Australia. They requested Labor consider moving amendments to the bill in two areas: firstly, to place a 28-day cap on the arbitration period and, secondly, to deal with the absence of regulations. We have not seen the regulations yet. Here we are, expected to pass a bill in one day because it is urgent, yet we have not got the regulations. It is another example of the arrogant approach of this government to the legislative process. The basic problem is that, without the amendments that Labor will be moving, the arbitration period could drag out. When does the arbitration period come to a conclusion? There is an incentive for the lessor to do this until after 1 July 2005, when the supplier will have to pay the GST. The lessor can then get the input tax credit without paying the GST. So a cap on the arbitration period is called for.
There is also a problem with regard to the qualifications of an arbitrator. The bill specifies that this will be determined by regulation, but we understand that the regulations have not been prepared. The minister may care to give us an update. These would normally be subject to disallowance within 14 days of the sitting period. But this is impractical from a Senate process point of view, because it would mean that there would be insufficient time to begin arbitration. So Labor is proposing to amend the bill to specify that, until the regulations are gazetted, the qualification of an arbitrator will be membership of CPA Australia or the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
The Property Council also asked Labor to specify that the costs of the arbitration process be split between both parties. That is an important issue, because it could be an expensive exercise. Labor do not propose to move a specific amendment to the bill in this area to deal with what we consider to be a very legitimate concern. I would ask that the minister indicate in her response, either in her contribution to the second reading debate or in the committee stage, how the government proposes to deal with the question of sharing the costs of the arbitration process. Labor call on the government to propose a solution to what is potentially a significant problem.
Labor’s interest in presenting the amendments and raising the problems that have been communicated to us demonstrates that we have attempted a fairness of approach when considering this very difficult issue. We have listened to business concerns, and Labor will continue to be proactive in dealing with legitimate issues that business raises. In terms of general taxation reform, Labor’s approach to these issues is to listen to business, to listen to its concerns—unlike the Liberal government on this bill—underpinned by a fairness to all approach.
It has to be said that in relation to this bill the performance of the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, has been appalling. After he expected us to pass the bill in the House and the Senate in one day, sight unseen, he arrogantly tried to stop Labor members debating the bill in the House. He even attempted to speak in the place of the member for Oxley when that member had been given the call. Fortunately, the deputy speaker asked the minister to resume his seat and to stop interrupting the debate. It is another example of the arrogance of this government’s approach. Labor approached the government to discuss the proposed amendments. However, the Liberal government cancelled the meeting with little over an hour’s notice. That is another example of the arrogant approach that is becoming all too symptomatic of this government, particularly since its re-election.
I ask the minister and all the senators to support the two amendments that I have foreshadowed when we get to the committee stage. The Labor Party are also asking the government to support the amendments in the other chamber when the time comes for consideration, if they are passed in this place. In concluding, let me repeat that it has taken not weeks, not months but years—in fact, five years—to draft this bill to deal with GST hangover issues. It is legislation which the government knew needed to be introduced before the transition period expired on 1 July 2005. The delays in presenting this bill to the parliament are not exceptional. As I said, they are signs of arrogance and a level of incompetence displayed by Minister Brough in the other place and another example of the government’s mismanagement of the legislative process. We will be supporting the bill, but we will be moving two amendments when we get to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LONG-TERM NON-REVIEWABLE CONTRACTS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—I too intend to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004 and the other three bills being dealt with cognately. I guess at one time or another all of us are guilty of this with pet issues, but I must say at the outset that sometimes—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—Senator Sherry and other members of the ALP, I think of you fighting a war that is long lost. I am almost reminded of those apocryphal magazine stories of some poor Japanese soldier suddenly emerging from a jungle 10 years after the war, ready to carry on and fight his battle. I think the GST is now well accepted in the community. I note that in Western Australia the cornucopia of riches that is available to both major parties contesting government is amply contributed to by GST funds. That enables them, of course, to make terrific offers on infrastructure, police, health and education. If ever you speak to the Labor members of state governments, as I do, you will know that the very last thing they ever want the coalition government or any other government to do is to get rid of the GST.
It is a great tribute to the coalition and the Democrats that we had the courage to introduce and support such tax reform. As I said, that battle is over and you need to move on. In fact, I guess you are moving on because, having made your criticisms, you nevertheless will support the bill—
—Five years on.
—Yes, it has taken you five years to accept it, I suppose. But I am pleased to see it. I get distracted and I am sure we will have this jousting for many years to come. The Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004 amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Act 1999 so that parties who entered into a long-term contract prior to 8 July 1999 have access to an arbitrator to enable negotiations to take account of the GST’s impact on those contracts after 1 July 2005. On 1 July 2005 the five-year transitional rules that ensured no party was disadvantaged will come to an end.
In one respect I agree with some remarks of Senator Sherry: this matter could have been brought on earlier and could have been dealt with for the benefit of the parties concerned. It is not the Senate’s fault that it was delayed. One thing I am increasingly irritated about—and I want to join the Hon. Bob Hawke in giving the media a clip around the ear—is the media’s continual and automatic acceptance of the coalition’s mantra that the Senate has endlessly held up bills. That is not true. It is the government that decides how many sitting days there will be and it is the government that decides which bills will be before us. When those bills are before us, you will find that the Senate has dealt with them. There are very few bills in fact that have been held up. On Sunday, yet again I heard a senior commentator saying ‘and all those bills that the Senate has held up’. Which bills? The media will immediately mention the unfair dismissal bill—yes. Telstra, yes. Any others, folks? There are perhaps a couple, perhaps seven but certainly fewer than 10.
It is about time that the media started to behave like a media and give the government a run-in every time they claim that the Senate in its role has been obstructionist and has been holding up legislation. Ask the next question: ‘All right, Minister, which bills? Name them. Name when they were held up.’ Ask them why they did not have an extra sitting week, as we Democrats ask for many times. Ask them why bills were not put on the Notice Paper, when they have the entire power to do so.
On 1 July 2005, the five-year transitional rules that ensured that no party was disadvantaged will come to an end. This bill is necessary because the legislation implementing the GST recognised that there were numerous pre-existing contracts where the supply was to be made after 1 July 2000. The prices set under these contracts were most likely negotiated without reference to the GST regime. If the GST had applied immediately to these contracts, suppliers would have had to pay the GST but would not have had an opportunity to pass on these costs to the recipients. Further, recipients would have been able to claim the GST input credit without paying a price for these goods that included the GST paid by the supplier. So the essential problem was that one party would be advantaged and one party would be severely disadvantaged.
Consequently, section 13 of the GST transition act allows supplies under a pre 8 July 1999 contract, or a pre 2 December 1998 contract where the recipient was not entitled to a full input tax credit, to remain GST free until either the first opportunity for review of prices under that contract or 1 July 2005, whichever date arose first. After 30 June 2005 this transition period finishes and under current legislation all goods and services supplied under pre 8 July 1999 contracts will become liable for the GST. As noted above, suppliers may face the situation where they are liable for the GST but have no means by which to recover this cost from the recipients of those supplies. If the arbitration mechanism fails to produce a satisfactory outcome to the supplier, these amendments require a recipient to pay any GST obligation on these transactions. Where the recipient agrees to a change in consideration or accepts an arbitrated offer for a change in consideration or where no arbitrated offer has been made and no agreement reached, the supplier remains liable to pay the GST.
The government has had five years to address this issue. On 3 May 2000 the Treasurer issued a press release announcing that the government would introduce measures to ensure that there was no disadvantage to either supplier or recipient after the transition period ended. But it took until 29 October 2004 for the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer to draft the legislation and release it. I am aware that this government have at times been able to produce legislation on a 24-hour call. We know they can do it. My view is that obviously the government did not regard this legislation as a high priority and have done it in their own time.
This legislation was then introduced into the House on Tuesday, 7 December 2004. The Democrats were then privately asked to support the bill being rushed through the Senate by Thursday, 9 December. The Labor Party were unwilling to rush it through. They were not aware of the bill. They had not considered all the issues. As well, both Labor and the Democrats were dealing with other pieces of legislation. It is necessary, given that Labor likes to work its legislation through caucus and the Democrats through party room, that ample notice is given when a bill is to be dealt with. However, it was always the case that the Democrats would support this legislation, and the parties concerned knew that that was the case.
After looking at this bill over the Christmas period, we did take on board the concerns of the Property Council that there was some uncertainty in its operation. Specifically, there did need to be some definite time frame for the offer period. That is a very common feature of contracts, as Minister Coonan would know as a former barrister—I presume she is still a barrister—and it is a very necessary constraint so that things are done in time.
The Labor Party have drafted an amendment to this effect. I have seen some correspondence from the very able Peter Verwer of the Property Council stating that the proposed amendment provides much-needed certainty. That particular amendment does make sense to the Democrats. We have not had any negative feedback from those concerned in the industry and we will be interested to see what the government’s attitude is to that minor and clarifying amendment.
On the subject of the GST, I would like to remind the Senate that the recently released mid-year economic outlook shows that the states will receive $35.2 billion in GST funding in 2004-05. This year, the states will have $1.94 billion more revenue from the GST than they would have had under the previous system of financial assistance grants and the state taxes that were abolished at the time of tax reforms. All of us must recognise that the primary role of parliaments is to ensure that they deliver the goods and services that are legitimately needed by Australians. It is a primary role of federal government to ensure that the states are able to attend to their duties successfully, particularly in the areas of the environment, health, education, and law and order. Therefore, the GST has provided much more certainty as a growing tax base than the wholesale sales tax—that limited consumption tax that only applied to goods and not services.
The state governments owe the Democrats a big thankyou. One or two of their ministers have whispered that in my ear but they have not said so publicly and I will not die waiting for it. Not only that, but the federal government is also forecasting massive surplus budgets in the coming years, the Australian economy remains strong, and inflation, unemployment and interest rates are either relatively low or low. The Democrats as a party have taken a lot of pain to deliver Australia a lot of gain.
I am going to repeat some remarks I have made before, but I do note some newspapers again stating that the GST should be revisited to apply to basic food. In response to that, the Treasurer made it very clear that he was not interested in that proposition. Some of the very newspapers that push that boat forget to remind their readers that at the time of the original debate those newspapers were asking to be exempt from the GST themselves. That is a little fact that is conveniently left out of the commentary. Now and again I write a letter to the editor reminding them of that and miraculously it does not get printed. It is always wise to keep a history of these things.
Some of these editorial writers and advocates imply that food is the only thing which is GST-free, but I want to persistently remind people that the coalition decided on extensive GST exemptions for dwelling rentals, health services, education, financial services and exports, all of which total well over 20 per cent of GDP. So, right from the start, the coalition advocated that one in five consumer dollars should not be subject to the GST, and we added basic and fresh food to that. It was not the only exemption or even the most important exemption. The Democrats agreed with the coalition’s proposed exemptions. We then broadened them to include basic and fresh food, which is consistent with GST/VAT systems the world over. We also negotiated extended exemptions in the health, education and charitable services sectors.
I freely admit that we could have done better. Undoubtedly, the government could have done better too. Everybody concerned could have done better, particularly the Labor Party, because if they had entered into the discussion with more principle and less politics we would have got somewhere. I will never forget that the Labor Party called a division and voted three times to tax food under the GST. It is on the record in the Hansard. Overall, I will say again and again that, despite the angst it has caused my own party, this was a very good outcome in Australia’s national interest.
Finally, I would like to briefly comment that we know the Treasurer is likely to have a large—perhaps huge or perhaps massive—surplus in the next few budgets he will manage, and he will be tempted to provide tax cuts. By the way, I agree with the Labor Party that the GST should be recorded as a Commonwealth tax; do not forget that I have put that on the record many times. Tax cuts of themselves are not a bad thing, but the Democrats would always say that first we should make sure that our health, education and environmental systems are catered for. If you are then going to look at tax cuts, the priority should be low-income earners. The priority should be to increase the tax-free threshold from its ridiculously low $6,000. This would provide a fair and equal tax cut to all Australians as well as potentially reducing some of the effective high marginal tax rates paid by those moving from welfare to work.
Tax cuts right now are a big agenda item because the backbench of the coalition have decided to flex their muscles and have an opinion on this. We support their approach in that it is creating a debate, but we stress that the principles we stand by are: firstly, income tax reform should be structural and permanent; and, secondly, it needs to be prioritised over a number of years. We say that the first priority is low-income earners, which means that, firstly, you have to pay attention to tax-free thresholds; secondly, you should pay attention to tax indexation; and, thirdly—only thirdly—would you then look at raising the upper rates. We do not object to the idea that the upper rate should be raised at some time, but this is not the time. If the Labor Party sit on the fence on this one they will be doing themselves a disservice.
We think that to provide another exclusive tax cut to high-income earners would be divisive in Australia, and it would certainly not be supported by the Democrats. The Labor Party might be tempted to fold again on those principles. We would urge them, under their new leadership and with their new mood, to in fact attend to the debate and attend to the issue of permanent structural income tax reform, which will get us away from the triennial debate about what goodies you dish out at election times and give us some certainty and security—which is, incidentally, what the coalition have provided on the consumption tax side. With those concluding remarks I confirm that the Democrats will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LONG-TERM NON-REVIEWABLE CONTRACTS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-02-08,"—As we appear to be in furious agreement on the Tax Laws Amendment (Long-term Non-reviewable Contracts) Bill 2004 and related bills, I am not going to take much of the Senate’s time, apart from making a couple of remarks in summing up and then dealing with the proposed amendments. The package of bills deals with the situation of people who have long-term contracts stretching from before the GST legislation was introduced to the rapidly approaching date of 1 July 2005, the end of the GST transition period when GST begins to apply to these contracts. These bills have arisen out of several periods of consultation stretching back to November 2000. There was a second one in December 2003, and since early 2004 there have been ongoing consultations with industry groups over the draft legislation which was publicly released for comments on 29 October 2004. I place that on the record because there were some comments made about the length of time this has taken. Time in itself is not a problem if you get a better outcome, and the government are satisfied that, having listened to industry, we now have the very best package of bills to address this issue.
The bills give the parties to these contracts a mechanism for negotiating a pricing adjustment to reflect the GST in the contract price, if necessary with arbitration. If negotiation fails, there will be a way of breaking the deadlock, by allowing the GST to be imposed on recipients of supplies under the contract. Because there is not a lot of parliamentary time before 1 July 2005, it is important that the parties have the certainty they have sought about the mechanism as soon as possible. While the GST will not apply until after 1 July 2005, the government certainly do wish to give industry enough time to finish their negotiations before then so that the price adjustment will be in place when supplies under these contracts become liable for the GST.
As I said, it seems that we are in furious agreement, apart from a couple of minor amendments. I should mention—because it has taken up a great deal of the time in this debate—the GST, which has been a reality for a number of years. It really is astounding that the ALP would still seek to argue that they no longer support the GST and the revenue it provides to the states and territories. If that is the case, it should be clearly stated. As Senator Murray said, the states and territories are indubitably better off. The windfalls for state governments which have flowed from tax reform have been quite extraordinary and can be measured in billions of dollars.
With respect to the proposed amendments, we accept the second amendment with reservations because of the availability of qualified arbitrators and the complexity of some issues. In the interest of certainty for the industry, the government will accept this amendment, but I want to place on record the fact that my colleague Minister Brough does have some reservations about this. The government are not disposed to the first amendment. We think that it is more appropriate for arbitrators to be listed in regulations. Regulations will be made as soon as possible after the bill receives royal assent. The government are of the view that it is inappropriate for CPA Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants to be listed as arbitrators, because their members are of course very expert in their own field and are suitably qualified, perhaps more so as assessors. I have indicated the government’s attitude to the amendments in the hope that we might be able to deal with this legislation before question time.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-02-08,"—My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in her capacity as minister for immigration. Can the minister explain why she has not responded to the community calls, including from the Rau family, for a full, open and transparent judicial inquiry into the case of Ms Rau’s 10-month detention by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs? Can the minister confirm that her chosen method of inquiry by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Mick Palmer will not have legal powers to compel the attendance of witnesses, will not be able to compel answers to questions, will not be able to administer an oath to witnesses, will not be able to compel production of documents or of items such as videotape footage, will not be able to protect witnesses or testimony, and that his report will not be protected from legal action such as defamation? Does the minister agree that the absence of these features may limit the capacity of Mr Palmer’s inquiry to have all the facts of the case fully considered and could undermine public confidence in the process?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-02-08,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer but I refer her to the original question, which she failed to answer and which is: can the minister confirm that her chosen method of inquiry will not have legal powers to compel the attendance of witnesses, will not be able to compel answers to questions, will not be able to administer an oath to witnesses, will not be able to compel production of documents or items such as video footage, will not be able to protect witnesses or testimony and that the report will not be protected from legal action? Minister, what is the answer to those questions? Why have you chosen to go down a route where the inquiry does not have those powers? Further, what powers does the inquiry have to call the attendance of and evidence from ministers and ministerial staff? Why have you not given the inquiry the sorts of powers that would seem to be so necessary in a case like this?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-02-08,"—I thank the senator for his question. It is correct that the government and I have decided that it is appropriate to have an inquiry into this matter to ascertain whether there is anything that anybody in the Commonwealth—a Commonwealth contractor is included in that—or any of the three state governments involved and the two agencies in each of those states, namely the police and mental health services, should have done that they did not do, or could have done in a better way or should not have done that they did.
We have selected Commissioner Palmer because of the respect with which he is held in the community. As you know, he is a former distinguished police commissioner, as I recall appointed by the Labor Party and then reappointed—I think it was on two occasions but, if not, on one occasion—by this side of politics. His integrity, certainly to my understanding and in my own mind, is beyond question.
I am also mindful of the unsolicited offer by Premier Beattie for his officials to cooperate with any inquiry. I would ask the Senate to be mindful of the Commonwealth’s unsolicited remarks that, when New South Wales indicated that they would usually have an inquiry when a missing person matter is concluded, we would cooperate freely with that. I am mindful of the remarks by Dr Phillips, who is in charge of mental health services in South Australia, and of the cooperation that he has always received from immigration officials, in particular at Baxter, and of his willingness to get to the bottom of these matters.
Given that there is such a willingness by officials—and I would be very surprised if there were not—to get to the bottom of this, I think the sooner we can get to the bottom of whether there is anything better that could have been done, the better. As a consequence, there will be a private inquiry headed by Mr Palmer. There have been other inquiries—for example, the Flood inquiry is one that comes to mind—that have worked in the same way and been effective. I look forward to the outcome of that inquiry being made public. Obviously, whether or not I think it is fair—and I happen to think it is fair—when the inquiry has concluded people will then be able to judge whether it has been appropriate. Certainly, I leave the way open for Mr Palmer to raise it with the Commonwealth if he has the slightest whiff or suspicion that he is not getting full cooperation from state and federal authorities. We will then look at the matter. But the understanding I have from discussions I have had with officials and from what has been reported to me from state authorities is that there is no-one in existence who does not want to find out what they could have done better if they could have, and what they should not have done if they did.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-02-08,"—Senator, with respect, I thought I had answered by indicating to you that it was a private inquiry.
—Why?
—I made the mistake of assuming that you knew the difference and that you were familiar with a range of inquiries that had been held in the past, but in any event—
—I am familiar, but why?
—With respect, Senator, since you have asked the question again, I will answer it again. It is a private inquiry, the nature of which you have just indicated you do understand and that you therefore did understand the answer. In a nutshell, the answer I gave you was that I believe there has been an expression of more than willingness by all agencies to cooperate, and I expect that there will be. Therefore there is no need to take the inquiry to a higher level. I believe that all witnesses that are required will attend, that they will answer honestly and that Mr Palmer will not need to compel the production of evidence. I further believe that people will tell the truth. As I have said, if Mr Palmer is uncertain of that during the course of the inquiry— (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-02-08,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that South Australian Public Advocate Jonathan Harley, who I presume is known to the minister, alerted the minister’s department to Ms Rau’s case in December? When was the minister first aware of this important source of information and concern regarding Ms Rau’s condition? When the minister did learn of this independent source of concern, what immediate action, if any, did she take or did she order her department to take?

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-02-08,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. There is just one issue from the original question. When was the minister first aware of Mr Harley’s intervention and what action, if any, did she take as a result? Can the minister also confirm that Dr Jonathan Phillips, the South Australian mental health services director, tried for two weeks to obtain a psychiatric assessment of Ms Rau? Can the minister explain to the Senate why Dr Phillips’ requests were resisted or denied?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-02-08,"—I thank the senator for the question. I have seen some remarks by Mr Harley, who is the South Australian Public Advocate and who is known to me. The Public Advocate is someone who may well seek to become a guardian of someone who is in institutional care in South Australia. That of course takes us directly back to the question asked by Senator Brown. The process was being followed to ascertain whether in fact it was appropriate to commit, or section, Ms Rau to Glenside. If that had happened, Mr Harley’s authority would have come into play because there would be a person in the care of South Australian mental health, but that had not happened.
That is a matter that I think the inquiry will want to look at, and there are two aspects to it: one is the manner in which it was dealt with by South Australian mental health authorities and the other is whether immigration officials or other officials should have sought to intervene or harass or cajole or remind South Australian officials that they had the material and that we were waiting for a response sooner than they did. They did in fact do that in early January. They sent a letter and had further telephone conversations, with the letter concluding with words to the effect, ‘Could we please have an indication of the appropriate way in which to handle Ms Rau.’ Once she was in Glenside Mr Harley’s authority would come into play, but until then he is the South Australian Public Advocate.
You asked me whether I am aware of him having contacted DIMIA in December. My answer to that at this point is no. I am aware that he indicated he had made contact. At this point the advice I have is that he made some contact with one person in the department after Ms Rau had been actually shifted to Glenside. One of the facts in this matter that needs to be made clear is that Ms Rau did not go to Glenside because of the publicity or because we subsequently found out that she was an Australian permanent resident. She went to Glenside because the process started by immigration officials and health officials employed by Immigration in November came to fruition. Officials at Glenside agreed that they would in fact make an assessment even if she was not sectioned. Then, in the last few days, there was an agreement that there would be another mechanism to do it through Baxter. But this visit to Glenside and her now being in Glenside would have happened in any event. What would not have happened if advocates had not raised it—or it may not have happened so quickly—is our discovery of who Ms Rau really is.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-02-08,"—Yes, I can indicate when I first heard, although I cannot specifically give you the date. I believe I was watching a news service and saw Mr Harley commenting. Mr Harley is entitled to put whatever views he chooses as an Australian citizen, but his jurisdiction relates to South Australia and people in the care of South Australian mental health authorities. We were already well into the process of establishing when in fact that would happen. I cannot give you the date of that.
As to Dr Phillips, I invite you to look at subsequent remarks by Dr Phillips. He made it very clear that he is not the operational person. I feel sure that Dr Phillips will be happy to tell you, should you inquire of him, when this matter was first raised with South Australian mental health authorities. I feel confident he will tell you what I have been told on the dates on which it was sent. The fact that he, the head of mental health services, was not told until some two weeks before is not the point. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-02-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to the detention of Ms Cornelia Rau.
I say at the outset that what the government has in fact outlined today in the answers given by Senator Vanstone is that the immigration detention system does have massive cracks and that Ms Rau seems to have fallen through every single one of them. Rather than go through, one by one, the issues of what happened so that we can understand the systemic failure that the immigration detention system seems to have had in relation to Ms Rau, rather than go through the dates when things happened—how many times DIMIA has in fact tried to establish her identity, when she was detained and on what basis she was detained—what we have had is a general version of broad events and an appeal to the heart from Senator Vanstone. No-one doubts that it is a terrible case, that this woman deserves sympathy and that her friends and family similarly deserve sympathy. But what they also deserve is the truth in relation to this matter, the truth in relation to how it is going to actually play out.
Instead, we find Senator Vanstone went to a press conference today before question time and failed to articulate how this inquiry will get to the bottom of these issues. She failed to identify what powers Mick Palmer will have—whether he will have the ability to compel witnesses and protect witnesses; whether he will even have transcripts of the proceedings; and whether he can ask not only the department but the contractors, subcontractors and anyone else who might have an interest in this matter, who might have evidence and who might be able to shed light on the Rau matter. During the press conference, she did not say what those powers are and what the terms of reference are and provide them for public scrutiny. We do not know. There has been no answer.
Her statement from the press conference seems to be, ‘I’ll go and check on it.’ One would imagine that, if you are going to go to a press conference and announce an inquiry into a matter, you would have those things bedded down, you would know the answers to those issues. I suggest that she did not know the answers because there are no answers. She will not ensure that there is. In fact, it will be a whitewash, a cover-up. That is what it seems to be—no more, no less.
If you were going to have a proper inquiry, you would make it public, you would make it open, you would make it independent, you would have the terms of reference bedded down and you would have the powers of the person who will run the inquiry bedded down. You would ensure that you have transcripts and that you have protection for witnesses. You would ensure that there is also the ability to preserve evidence. You would ensure that, if there is evidence of offences being committed under the Migration Act—or any other criminal law—that evidence is not tainted, that people have the ability to come forward and provide evidence to the inquiry so that they are then not subject to and open to charges themselves. In other words, it should be made clear to them that there is the ability for either self-incrimination not to be available or privileges to be given so that they are not then subject to future defamation cases. Those are safeguards that ensure that these things become open and transparent.
Today we have heard a poor imitation of what could be a proper inquiry. There is no question that Mr Palmer is a good individual. We are not looking at Mr Palmer as an individual. I do not want to hear from the government that Mr Palmer is a well-respected person. There is no doubt about that. We want to hear from the government how they will ensure that they will get all the information on the record, that they will ensure that it is available and that it will be a comprehensive inquiry. We have not heard how they will achieve that.
When you look at all the detail that has been asked for today, you get a blurred statement from Senator Vanstone about how this will happen. You almost expect to hear, ‘Trust me to ensure that we will get to the bottom of this case.’ Minister, we want to trust the system. The system has to be in place to ensure that there is no systemic failure. We do not want to trust anyone; we want to make sure that there is a system in place. Today the minister has been unable to articulate how that will work. It is a sad case. We need to ensure that the minister’s office, her advisers, are able to turn up and provide evidence.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-02-08,"—This is a tragic case about a human being in unfortunate and very difficult circumstances. No-one seeks to avoid these facts. No-one seeks to portray it as anything other than a very regrettable incident. No-one should—and I hope no-one will—seek to make political capital out of the difficult circumstances of Ms Rau, and I sincerely hope that the opposition will not seek to do so.
At this stage of the incident, it is probably premature to offer an apology. The important thing is to establish the facts and see if there was anything more that could have been done in the case of Ms Rau. To that end, Minister Vanstone—who has advised the Senate today—has announced the details of an inquiry into Ms Rau’s case. The minister has advised, as we have heard, that the distinguished former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer will conduct the inquiry. Senator Ludwig said that there was no need to discuss the integrity of Mr Palmer, the support that Mr Palmer has. But I think it is important to do so. It is important to ensure that we have on the record, from both the government and the opposition—and I am pleased that Senator Ludwig has expressed confidence in former Commissioner Palmer—that he is a distinguished former Australian Federal Police Commissioner. He was initially appointed by Labor when they were in office. He was reappointed by this government upon ascension to office.
I think it is worth taking time to note that former Commissioner Palmer is beyond reproach, and I think any criticisms of the inquiry do, in some way, seek to reflect upon Mr Palmer. I do not for one second think that Mr Palmer would seek to involve himself with an inquiry, would seek to conduct an inquiry, unless he felt that he had the tools, the authority and the resources to properly undertake that inquiry. Those who say, ‘We support Mr Palmer, but we are not so sure about the inquiry,’ should be very careful that they do not impugn Mr Palmer’s integrity. We can all have confidence in the independence of this inquiry because former Commissioner Palmer is in charge of it.
The minister also released today the terms of reference of this inquiry. They are as broad as they can be, but they focus on the central issues relating to the detention of Ms Rau: the interaction between the Commonwealth and state agencies, particularly police and mental health providers. It is important that this inquiry is a private inquiry. Absolutely, its findings must be made public. But it is important for Ms Rau’s privacy that it be a private inquiry. It is also important to ensure that the focus remains on establishing the facts and the sequence of events. We do not want distraction from establishing the sequence of events. What do we know thus far?
Let us deal with the substance, not the politics. There is a huge amount of misinformation currently circulating. There is understandable concern in the community. The community wants to get to the facts. We all understand the concerns of members of the community, the families and the parents of people with disabilities. We want to make sure that what happened here does not happen again. We hope—and I am sure that it will be forthcoming—that we will get the full cooperation of all four jurisdictions involved in this matter. Senator Vanstone has been very forthcoming. She has been totally upfront about when she was advised and when she first became aware of these matters.
But we have to make sure—I do not hold out hope—that we do not descend again into the opposition’s tired old refrain of: what did you know, when did you know it and who did you tell? If we descend to that level of debate on this issue then we are really missing the point. The point is to establish the facts. It is only once we know the facts that we can establish whether there is something that should have been done that has not been done. It is only then, when we know the sequence of events, that we can determine what can be done to make sure that this does not happen again. Senator Ludwig wants to prejudge the inquiry. He wants to state already what he believes the facts to be. To be responsible we have to establish the sequence of events. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-02-08,"—It is pretty clear from the answers given by Minister Vanstone and that contribution by Senator Fifield how the government proposes to deal with this serious issue and the serious questions being raised by the opposition and other members of the Senate. When we are asking legitimate questions about what occurred when, the sequence of events, when they were told and how come this was not brought to their attention we are told by Senator Fifield that we should not get bogged down in that sort of detail and that we should be focusing on the facts. Pardon me, Senator Fifield, but I would have thought that the Australian public have a right to know when the minister’s office knew, whether they took any action and why these issues when raised by people such as the Public Advocate in South Australia were not drawn to the minister’s attention or were not acted upon. The Australian public probably has a right to know the answers to those questions.
The other obvious tactic that both the minister and the senator have engaged in today is to seek to suggest that any criticism the opposition makes of the inquiry and the lack of powers associated with it is somehow a criticism of former Federal Police Commissioner Palmer. There is a straw man argument if I have ever heard one: in answer to any legitimate criticisms about the whitewash inquiry that has been put in place by this minister let us set up this argument that somehow the opposition is impugning somebody who is well respected on both sides of politics.
The minister failed to answer some serious questions in question time about the powers or lack of powers associated with this inquiry. That is not a criticism of former Commissioner Palmer. These are serious questions about things like how come the inquiry does not have the power to compel people to give evidence? Why has the inquiry not got the power to protect witnesses? If you have an employee of Baxter detention centre or a person who might, for whatever reason, be fearful of giving evidence to this inquiry, surely you would think that one of the things you would turn your mind to as the relevant minister in establishing an inquiry would be how to ensure that anybody who has relevant evidence can give evidence in an inquiry without fear—without any concern of victimisation or any retribution or defamation action or any of the various legal problems that could arise from giving such evidence. But has the minister dealt with this issue? Does her press release refer to issues like this: how do we actually ensure witnesses are protected in the same way that witnesses before Senate inquiries are protected? Is that dealt with? No, it is not. The only thing that is dealt with is the terms of reference.
When the opposition raise these legitimate questions, what do we get from the other side? What do we get from the minister and those senators on the other side who are lining up here to support her today? We get an accusation that somehow we are impugning Mr Palmer’s reputation. That is not the case. What we are saying is that there are some very serious questions associated with the case of Ms Rau. It is astonishing and distressing that a woman with a serious mental illness can have been in detention for so long without authorities becoming aware of who she was or correctly diagnosing her mental illness. It is tragic that this woman was placed in Baxter and that she was placed in solitary confinement—if the media reports are to be believed—for a period of time. These are serious issues and the Australian public deserve an explanation. They deserve a full and open inquiry which is able to take evidence as needed and which is able to take evidence from people who might be fearful or concerned about giving evidence and so forth.
Finally, on this issue of playing politics, I heard the minister on a number of occasions, and various interjections by senators on the other side when we were raising legitimate questions about this issue, criticising the South Australian Mental Health Service, the Queensland police, and the Queensland hospital. I say to them: do not take the high and mighty ground here. From what we have seen in the chamber today there has been a great propensity on the other side of the chamber to blame anyone else—any state official, state department or state government—for what is a very concerning story which we must get to the bottom of. If Senator Fifield is going to talk about not playing politics I suggest there should be some discussion on that side of the chamber about not responding to any legitimate question that the opposition, the Greens or the Democrats raise on this issue by having a go at some state department.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-02-08,"—There we have it: the opposition’s sole interest in this whole matter distils down to the fact that they anticipate a whitewash. That suits their political agenda—a whitewash is the allegation against this very respected and learned former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. He has already been hung, drawn and quartered by the opposition in this place by the label—the epitaph—of a ‘whitewash’. This is a great tragedy that in today’s Australia we can mistakenly, inadvertently or wrongfully incarcerate someone who is mentally ill and in circumstances where nobody has been able to accurately and reliably determine the truth for so long. Over many years, I have had some considerable experience with schizophrenia and those who suffer from this malady. In my experience it presents a very broad and often inconsistent group of outward patterns and manifestations in terms of conduct and personality traits. It is not easy to define or diagnose; it is not easy to detect in the personality of a person who may well be very adversely affected by this mental illness.
In these circumstances, my call to the opposition is to take the politics out of this situation. We must build into our system a response that protects people like Cornelia Rau from ever having this sort of thing happen to them. We need to be extra careful that our mechanisms for the identification of missing persons have some consistency and ease of access across state borders and boundaries.
When I look at what the facts appear to be—from newspapers, other reports and indeed from what the minister has said—the first issue that was confronting authorities in Australia was identification. People who know anything about those suffering from schizophrenia know that this is usually at the top of the list. Schizophrenics completely lose recollection of their context. So a woman saying that she is of German citizenship, speaking fluent German and identifying her parents would, on face value, have to be taken as being quite plausible. I must say that authorities would be very astute and completely out of the ordinary to be able to detect that as a false representation.
The next issue is, as I say, the extent and nature of the person’s mental incapacity. Schizophrenics are very difficult to diagnose. It takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of time with a subject to understand that they are not functioning normally intellectually. I must say that it strikes me as very odd that medical advice in South Australia—and I do not cast aspersion on this—was that she was unsuitable to be admitted to the Glenside facility in South Australia. So, by all accounts, she presented to those who should know as a very difficult case.
All I want to say in closing is: let us get the facts, let us get the advice of the agencies involved and let us get the advice of the psychiatrists. It is not a matter for politics and it is not a matter that the opposition can seek to get any mileage out of. We must build protections into this system and learn from what we have seen and read about in the last week or so on the tragic case of Cornelia Rau.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,9,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-02-08,"—At the outset, I have to say that I agree with the sentiments expressed by other senators here this afternoon that the case of Ms Cornelia Rau is a very sad and sorry story. It is tragic that this could have occurred to anyone in this country, whether they be an Australian citizen, an Australian resident or indeed somebody seeking asylum in this country. I believe the case of Ms Rau illustrates that there are a number of failures in the existing system. Firstly, there has been a failure in the identification of missing persons. That is quite clear. Secondly, there has been a failure on the part of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and a failure on the part of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in relation to the duty of care that she owes to all persons who are detained. Thirdly, there has been a failure of government policy generally in relation to mandatory detention—and this case illustrates that quite well.
In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have seen a systematic failure of the police and the health and immigration authorities seemingly at every turn. There was a failure to identify her as a missing person and there was a failure to identify the serious mental illness which she has now been diagnosed as having. This young woman was found wandering around in the desert, which the Aboriginals notified to police. She was then taken to Queensland, held there and then finally transferred to Baxter Detention Centre in my home state of South Australia where she was held for a period of four months until the situation that she was in and the series of failures that surrounded her case were made public.
Today I want to focus on the failures that have occurred in this case, particularly on the part of the department of immigration and the minister for immigration and, more broadly, the failure of government policy in this regard. On the question of the minister’s duty of care and the duty of care that the department has, it is quite clear that the minister and the department owe a duty of care to everyone who is in immigration detention. It is quite clear that the minister and her office should have been alerted much earlier as to the manner in which this woman was being treated and there should have been an immediate intensive investigation into her circumstances. The fact that this did not occur, that she was held in immigration detention in South Australia for four months before anything happened, can only be described as a monumental failure of the system.
The second failure of the system clearly was in this woman’s diagnosis. Until quite recently, this woman was not diagnosed as having the serious mental illness that she does have. Senator Johnston referred to the fact that it is very difficult to diagnose mental illness, and I have no doubt about that, but my concern is that the persons who were treating Ms Rau were unable or unwilling to diagnose the serious mental condition that she had.
In the time I have left I wish to draw the Senate’s attention to the broader issue that we have here: the question of how many detainees are in detention centres in Australia who are suffering from a serious mental illness and who have not been properly diagnosed. Anyone who knows anything about mental illness knows just how debilitating it is. It can lead to incidents that we have seen in detention centres: sewing lips together, attempted suicide and the like. This is the broader issue that needs to be considered following on from this tragic story.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,9,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—I have heard some senators today say that we should take the politics out of this matter. I could not agree more—it is a terrible story, a terrible ordeal that is still continuing for this woman and her family—but that should not be used as a way of trying to silence criticism. That is what this government is doing. We criticise what appears to have happened and we are abused and told, ‘You are playing politics’. If that is the best defence that the government has, it is just going to keep saying it, but it is certainly not going to silence me or plenty of other people.
We owe it not just to this woman but to everybody who has been touched by mental illness to get to the bottom of this incident and to get some good from what is obviously a terrible situation: greater understanding, greater awareness and greater accountability for how people have been acting to date. You cannot get accountability—the bottom line—if you have a secret inquiry. If all the evidence is presented in secret you cannot have accountability. That is not a criticism of Mr Palmer—that is not to say that he is not up to the job—but a simple fact: how can you have accountability, how can you increase public awareness and how can you have faith in the outcome, in an area where people’s trust has quite obviously been shaken, if you have a secret inquiry?
Obviously, if there is a matter that affects the privacy of Ms Rau, an inquiry can hold a session in private or not publish some evidence. But I have noticed that already, conveniently, stories are being put on the front page of some tabloids about her alleged activities in other parts of her life. I am sure there will be convenient bits of information put into the public arena to try to harm people’s sympathy for Ms Rau, playing on people’s lack of understanding of mental illness—no concerns about her privacy there. I have too much experience with this government, and in this area of immigration in particular, using the excuse of privacy as a blanket to cover up everything. There is simply no way that it is an adequate excuse to say that privacy means that we should not have this inquiry in public. Secrecy about the evidence is unnecessary. If Mr Palmer is as good as the minister and the government insist he is—and I have no reason to think otherwise—then of course he can make a judgment as to when it is appropriate to have a session in private.
There is no legal protection for the evidence that is given. What if somebody—perhaps somebody who has worked in these facilities and is involved in any aspect of this case—wants to report some wrongdoing somewhere? They will have no legal protection for their evidence. They will have no protection against ramifications. It is a massive disincentive to tell the truth if you do so in private and you know you have no protections.
In question time today I asked the minister: can the asylum seekers, the detainees who are the key to this woman’s identity being established, tell what they saw? The minister’s answer basically was ‘I’ll think about that’. Could she give a guarantee that, if they give evidence, the evidence of these people—who are living in fear of being deported every day of the week and who are in a detention facility behind closed doors where all sorts of consequences can be played out on them for giving evidence—will draw protection? No. When she was asked, ‘Will Mr Palmer be able to examine allegations of mistreatment of other people in Baxter detention centre to try to determine whether there is a pattern?’ she said, ‘No; we are going to quarantine this as much as possible and keep everybody else out of it.’
I have had allegations of mistreatment repeatedly made to me over the years. In relation to mental health I have had allegations made to me just in the last week about people trying to get into Baxter with an independent psychiatric assessment and being told not only no but also ‘if you try to push this we will ban you from even coming to this centre at all’. I do not know whether that is true but I have plenty of reason to assume that it is. If that is the way people are treated when they are trying simply to establish the wellbeing of people in detention centres, is it any wonder that situations like this have happened?
There is no doubt that if it were not for those asylum seekers Ms Rau’s identity would not have been established. She may have ended up in Glenside but she still would have been an immigration detainee within that facility, with all the consequences that go along with that. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-02-08,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2004;
Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004; and
Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2004 and 6 related bills.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—

FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN FTB CHILD RATES) BILL


Purpose of the Bill

The bill amends the family assistance law by adjusting certain FTB child rates to maintain the value of safety net benchmarking provisions.

Reasons for Urgency

Passage in the 2005 Autumn sittings will benefit Australian families.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-02-08,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Federal Government to:
establish a fully transparent and independent public inquiry into the detention of Ms Cornelia Rau.
establish an Inspector General of Immigration Detention and an operational secretariat for monitoring conditions of immigration detention and to deal with complaints, from detainees and their advocates.
guarantee access to immigration detainees by independent external medical and psychiatric personnel.
What seems to have happened in what can only really be described as a disturbing case, the case of Cornelia Rau, is that an Australian permanent resident was wrongfully imprisoned for 10 months. It was not for 10 days—something that you might think in passing is a short period. Ten months is a significant period in anybody’s language. In that 10 months she was in the immigration detention system per se, if I can use those broad words.
What we understand so far about Ms Rau’s case is from what we have been told so far and what we can garner from newspaper articles—and that is an issue I will go to shortly: the lack of information that is being provided by the government on this matter. What we can garner so far is that she presented in Coen as a person who was behaving differently from what the locals might think was normal and she was reported to the police. The police, as I understand it, made inquiries and came back to seek further information. This is only the version that I can garner from the media. I hope and I do think that what I am going to outline is a better course for determining what happened. Ms Rau ended up under DIMIA’s control—that is, under DIMIA’s detention regime.
The case is disturbing because Cornelia Rau went not only from Coen to Cairns but also from Cairns to Brisbane, where she was in the Queensland women’s prison system—not as a prisoner of the Queensland government but as a detainee under the DIMIA system, as I understand it. DIMIA request and seek arrangements with the Queensland Department of Corrective Services for the detention of unlawful arrivals and the like by the Queensland corrective services on behalf of DIMIA. But it did not end there; that only brings us up to about October—it is not quite clear. From there Ms Rau went to the Baxter detention centre, and it has not been made clear to us yet what protocol meant that she left the women’s prison or why the decision was made to transfer her to the Baxter detention centre in South Australia.
So Ms Rau had covered a considerable distance, which would be at the very least disturbing and unsettling if you were an unlawful arrival. In this instance it is not clear what Ms Rau thought about her detention; that is a matter that requires significant further investigation. What I think Ms Rau’s case has demonstrated—even if you just look at the breadth of issues that it raises—is that there are significant cracks in the Howard government’s immigration detention system: she has managed quite easily to fall through every single one of them.
Those who are listening to this debate will know that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has ducked and weaved on this issue, particularly as to where the responsibility lies. I think it deserves much better than that. I think it is a sad case and one that requires more than the minister simply ducking and weaving. The press conference that she had before question time today left more questions unanswered than answered. If the minister were going to announce, as she did, an inquiry of the type that she did, one would have imagined—although I cannot put myself in her shoes—that she would go to the press conference prepared to answer the journalists, who were asking pragmatic, simple questions about process and how the inquiry would work. Senator Vanstone in my view failed to adequately explain to the journalists and I think to the public generally—because it was broadcast—how that inquiry was going to be conducted. She effectively took on notice some of the questions from the journalists; whether or not they get a reply is another matter. She does deserve to have to come back in here at question time and answer those questions that were asked of her in today’s question time which she took on notice—the detail of what occurred, when it occurred and how it occurred.
First of all, it appears—and I do not want to unduly attack the minister until the facts are more clearly laid out—that, from the minute the story broke, Senator Vanstone was clutching at straws, trying to blame every other agency involved in the case. I do not think that this is a matter for apportioning blame. It appears she has been trying to pull them in, to blame everyone but herself in this process.
But a curious thing happened in Senate question time today. The minister managed to admit that not only was Cornelia Rau originally detained under the Migration Act but it was DIMIA that ordered her detention—DIMIA, no-one else. That means that, far from the undertones and suggestions that Senator Vanstone has been spreading about this place in relation to the Queensland police or anyone else involved, it is Senator Vanstone herself, as the minister responsible, who ultimately should take responsibility for ordering Cornelia Rau’s detention and for her welfare from the second she came into detention, almost a year ago in March. I am not suggesting for a minute that DIMIA should not have the power to detain unlawful arrivals. That is a matter for another debate and another time. In this instance we are looking specifically at the systemic failure that appears to be rife within this department overseen by Minister Vanstone.
For argument’s sake, in cases where people arrive at airports or by other means, or where they are overstayers, the immigration officials seem to be able to do their work and deal with them in a reasonable way. But in this instance something different happened, and that requires more than just an inquiry of the ilk that is being proposed by Senator Vanstone. Was there adequate assessment of the physical and mental health checks performed? Did DIMIA perform these checks? Why did it take so long for the mental health checks to occur? Did Ms Rau’s mental health deteriorate as a result of being kept in solitary confinement, as some of the media suggest? We do not know whether or not that happened, and I am not suggesting it did. But there are questions out there that need answers. Will the inquiry get to the bottom of some of these questions that I have posed? That is a difficult question.
It looks from first glance as though, without the ability to have compellability of witnesses, without privilege, without some of the ordinary things that attach to proper judicial or open inquiries, without those types of arrangements, you may unfortunately get instances where people choose to protect their own interests first rather than try to look at the interests of Ms Rau in this case. They may turn to their legal advisers, friends and colleagues and say, ‘What shall we do in this instance?’ They may not come forward. They may not give evidence. They may not provide a snapshot. They may not provide evidence that could be used to examine the case to determine what in fact happened so that the problems can be fixed, if there are systemic problems, which it appears there are.
It is going to be a closed inquiry, not a public one. We do not know whether transcripts will be kept or made available, or whether submissions will be called for or made available. Without that type of inquiry and the powers I have indicated, I remain unconvinced that we will have a full, open, frank inquiry that will get to the bottom of it. That is what we need. That is what this government should do and it does not seem to want to actually bite the bullet and do it.
These concerns go to issues such as: firstly, why did it take 10 months; secondly, was the treatment of Ms Rau for those 10 months that she was in immigration detention humane and appropriate, especially given what we now know of her mental health; and, thirdly, how can we guarantee the safety and welfare of those that are in detention centres? Those are the questions that we need to get to the bottom of and answer. Finally, why has the minister for immigration chosen to hold an inquiry which appears not to meet the tests that I have put forward? It does not seem to meet the tests of being open; it seems to be closed. She was not able to explain clearly all the other matters to the public during the interview that she conducted today. I think that it is a sad indictment of the minister that she has failed to adequately deal with this issue right from the moment it broke. It begs the question: is there something to hide? I do not know and I am not suggesting it, but unless you ensure that it looks proper then you always run the risk that it is not. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-02-08,"—As Senator Ludwig has said, this is a sad case and I would have thought, with respect, that good sense and common decency would dictate that it not be made the subject of an unedifying and discreditable attempt at scoring political points. Senator Ludwig, who, if I may say so, usually takes a very responsible attitude to these affairs did rather disappoint me in his speech by trying to use this sad case, which is about a sick person, a mentally ill person, in respect of whose affairs mistakes were made—and nobody is denying that—as an opportunity for point scoring. I would hope that senators who participate in this debate show a greater interest in getting to the bottom of the facts of the case than in using it as a platform for rhetorical flourish. That is what I want to do—I want to set out in a dispassionate way those facts which do seem to be established.
Can I in a preliminary way make two points. First of all, Senator Vanstone, I think, to any fair-minded person impressed anyone who observed her in responding to questions in question time today with appropriate candour and deliberation and an obvious eagerness to ensure that we did get to the bottom of whatever systemic failures there were in this sad case. Secondly, can I make the obvious point that the government by announcing today an inquiry by a highly suitable individual, the former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Mr Mick Palmer, has shown that same willingness to get to the bottom of what happened by holding a departmental inquiry and then making the findings public and subject to public scrutiny.
Let us go through the facts so far as we know them, and be aware that there are other undisclosed matters which will no doubt be revealed as the Palmer inquiry takes its course. The lady concerned, who we now know was Ms Cornelia Rau, a permanent resident though not a citizen of Australia, was at the end of March found in Coen, a small community about 660 kilometres north of Cairns, apparently by Aboriginal people, in a state of some distress and she then came to the notice of officers of the Queensland Police Service. When they interviewed her she told them that she was German. She spoke in German or partly in German. She said she was German, that she was a visitor to Australia, that she had no friends or family in Australia and that she had with her a stolen passport. She told the police that her name was Anna Schmidt or, variously, Anna Sue Schmidt or Anna Brotmeyer.
So the starting point of these events was that a person told officers of the Queensland Police Service, to whose attention she had been brought, that she was a nonresident foreign citizen who was in Australia on a stolen passport. The Queensland Police Service got in touch with DIMIA. She was taken into custody, as, on the basis of the information she gave the Queensland Police Service, she should have been. On 31 March she was taken to Cairns and several days later she was taken down to Brisbane, where she was detained in the Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre. During the course of this time, the Queensland Police Service apparently had an informal arrangement with DIMIA, the people who had initiated the detention, and she was being held in a Queensland government facility. There is no suggestion that she was other than an unlawful noncitizen and there was no suggestion, or any basis, for anyone to discover her real identity.
In detention in the Queensland women’s correctional centre she exhibited symptoms of a behavioural disorder, so in August she was sent, apparently at the instigation of those who were responsible for her custody, to the Princess Alexandra Hospital. As Senator Ludwig, as a Queensland senator, knows, that is one of the largest and most respected hospital facilities in Queensland and indeed in Australia. It appears she was there for about a week. During that time she was psychiatrically accessed by an eminent and respected psychiatrist, and as a result of that assessment—it was not a matter of a cursory examination; it was a matter of several days, almost a week, of clinical investigation—his professional conclusion was that she did not show the diagnostic symptoms of mental disorder. She was released back to the Queensland women’s correctional centre on the doctor’s professional advice and, in due course, in October, transferred into the custody of DIMIA at the Baxter detention centre in South Australia.
All of this was done in accordance with the procedure which, on the state of their knowledge at the time, the relevant authorities—both the state authorities and the Commonwealth authority—ought to have followed. There was no reason to believe up to that point that she was anything other than what she said she was. She characterised herself as being an unlawful noncitizen. She went to the Baxter detention centre and again concerns became apparent, to those in whose custody she was, about behavioural problems, so she was seen first by a psychologist—as Senator Vanstone said in answers in question time today—and then by a psychiatrist, and in mid-November a process of psychiatric assessment was begun.
Meanwhile, in August, her family in New South Wales listed Cornelia Rau as a missing person. But unbeknownst to them, by listing Cornelia Rau as a missing person with the New South Wales Police, the name Cornelia Rau went onto the New South Wales Police database, but not, evidently, onto a national database. That, no doubt, is something that Mr Palmer will consider when he conducts this inquiry—the extensiveness of the missing persons database. The report that Ms Rau was a missing person in New South Wales did not reach, and had no reason to reach, either the Commonwealth authorities or the state authorities involved in the custody of the person they thought to be an unlawful noncitizen of German nationality going under a different name in either Queensland or South Australia.
In the meantime, the process of psychiatric assessment continued in South Australia. Then last Thursday, 3 February, it appeared, as a result of inquiries—the full nature of which are not yet apparent—that the person in detention was in fact Cornelia Rau. Apparently a photograph of the person in detention was posted by somebody and it was identified by Cornelia Rau’s family. That was the first point at which there was any intersection between the identity of Cornelia Rau and the supposed unlawful noncitizen Anna Schmidt or Anna Brotmeyer. It was the first time that the identity of those two supposed different individuals was established. So that very day, it being established that the person who had been supposed to be the unlawful noncitizen was in fact an Australian permanent resident, there was no power to detain her under the immigration act, she was released first to Port Augusta Hospital and then the following day, Friday, 4 February, to Glenside psychiatric centre, where apparently the lady concerned still is.
Senator Vanstone addressed, without any hint of seeking to conceal anything, all of these matters with the media and in question time today. As well today the government established this inquiry, which is not wanting in transparency, Senator Ludwig, as you will see if you but read the terms of reference.
In closing, let me quote the words of Ms Rau’s sister, Christine Rau, who on the weekend said the most sensible thing that has yet been said about this sad case. She said that there is no point in apportioning blame until an investigation uncovers all of the relevant facts. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-02-08,"—It would not be the first time that tragic events have put someone with a mental illness into the headlines in this country. A couple of years ago we had numerous police shootings in Victoria involving people with mental illness. More recently, we had patients being shackled and guarded by security personnel in South Australia. The tragedy of people on the treadmill of illness, homelessness, incarceration and often suicide now and again gets media attention. But none of the public outrage that is attached to those stories appears to make much difference to the way people with mental illness are treated in this country. We heard from the minister today that mental health services are all up to the states, despite the fact that what is called the National Mental Health Strategy is supposed to be in place. It is a fine document and it has worthy aims, but it is not being implemented and it does not have the funding, either at the federal or the state level, to put it into place. In this latest incident, I think the victim of neglect, misunderstanding, misdiagnosis and mistreatment can point very clearly to the government for the situation that has transpired.
The Democrats are disappointed in the inquiry which has been announced today. It is not a public inquiry; it is going to be conducted behind closed doors. It will not have powers to call witnesses and to seek evidence. In our view, an inquiry should have been conducted by a judge and it should have had those powers. It should not be conducted behind closed doors. It could be made confidential where necessary, but secrecy about the evidence seems to us to be unnecessary. Those aspects of the inquiry that could impinge on Cornelia Rau’s privacy could be kept closed while it remains an open inquiry about the practices of the various agencies. That is what we are talking about here today—the treatment of someone with a mental illness who has ended up not just in prison but subsequently in a detention centre when there was clearly no reason why they should be there.
We also think there needs to be an inquiry, in addition to what should have been a judicial inquiry but is now just a private inquiry, into the state of Australia’s mental health services. We think that, given the number of people with mental illness who are not receiving treatment, given the failure of the national strategy to deliver and given the number of people who, as I said, are in this cycle of homelessness, despair, lack of treatment and sometimes suicide, we have a very serious situation on our hands. One of the reasons this is the case is that Australia spends on mental health services around half the percentage of the health budget that countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom do. As I understand it, it is just five per cent of the health budget, yet the mental health burden, if you like, is around twice that at 10 or 11 per cent.
I think there are some questions we need to have the government answer. We need to know how many people have become mentally ill since the government put them into detention centres, how many have been found to be refugees and released into the community without access to Medicare but who have serious mental problems and how many are suffering from a mental illness which has been caused by their detention.
On Friday, I went to the Maribyrnong detention centre. I regularly visit that place. I met with an Iranian asylum seeker who has been there for a long period of time. He is now on a cocktail of medication related to mental illness. When this man came into detention, he was not sick and he was fit. I argue today in the Senate that incarceration, particularly for very long periods of time and particularly where there is no end date in sight—that is, the government does not indicate to those detainees when they are likely to be released—in fact causes mental illness. I think that is what ought to be examined in the Senate inquiry that the Democrats are proposing.
Let us just look at some of the recorded impacts of detention and mental illness. We know that there is limited access to mental health services. The man whom I visited is on medication, but he does not have access to psychologists and psychiatrists. One of the reasons he does not is that he does not wish to be handcuffed when he leaves the detention centre. That is one of the conditions on his seeking and receiving that treatment. There is limited research into the impact of detention on the mental health of asylum seekers, which is mainly due to difficulty in getting access to that evidence. But there is evidence that detention and the treatment that asylum seekers receive in detention contributes to high levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm and suicidal behaviour.
A study reported in the Medical Journal of Australia found that all but one of the detained asylum seekers who participated in the study displayed symptoms of psychological distress at some time. At the time of the study, 85 per cent reported chronic depression, 65 per cent had pronounced suicidal ideation and 20 per cent exhibited signs of psychosis. We also know that in our prisons there are vast numbers of people who suffer from mental disorders. In prison those conditions are far more common than in the general population. For psychosis, less than half a per cent of the general population has that condition compared with nine per cent in prisons. For affective disorders—for example, depression—it is six per cent in the general population and 22 per cent amongst inmates. For anxiety disorders, it is 10 per cent in the general population and 43 per cent amongst inmates. For substance abuse disorders, it is five per cent in the general population and 57 per cent amongst inmates. I think that gives us some insight into the cycle. (Time expired)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-02-08,"—I rise to speak this afternoon on the urgency motion presented to the Senate by Senator Ludwig. I spoke earlier today on this matter and I indicated then, as I do now, that it really is a very sad and sorry tale indeed. Not only is it a very sad situation for Cornelia Rau, but I think it also reflects very badly on the government, on the minister and more generally on the government policy of mandatory detention. In the time that I have available today, I want to expand on what I said earlier today, particularly in relation to the failures that are obviously in the system of mandatory detention that have been brought to light as a consequence of Ms Rau’s situation.
We have seen in the last few days that the tragic case of Cornelia Rau has gained a great deal of media coverage, as it should have, and it has brought about a considerable amount of outrage and disbelief in the wider Australian community. People have been left wondering just how it could possibly be that an Australian resident could spend 10 months in a detention centre or in a hospital, during which time the authorities were attempting to identify her. During much of the time she spent in the Baxter detention centre, because of her mental illness she was acting in such a way that the authorities could only deal with this by putting her into what is termed the management unit and allowing her to suffer.
We have heard today from the minister that it is intended that there be an inquiry into this matter, which of course we do commend. However, our concerns are that the powers of this inquiry will be inadequate to bring to light exactly what the facts were in this situation and exactly where the failures in the system occurred.
Labor say in the motion before the Senate today that we believe there needs to be a fully transparent and independent public inquiry into the detention of Cornelia Rau. Senator Ludwig went into more detail about the powers that Labor consider this inquiry ought to have in order to fully expose the facts and the weaknesses that are quite evidently in the system. Labor also call upon the government to establish an inspector general of immigration detention and an operational secretariat to monitor conditions of immigration detention and to deal with complaints from detainees and their advocates. Finally, we say that there must be guaranteed access to immigration detainees by independent and external medical and psychiatric personnel.
As I said earlier in my remarks this afternoon, this case reveals systemic abuse and failure within the system that is in existence at the moment. We have to ask ourselves: how could a woman who is as mentally ill as Ms Rau seems to be find herself in the predicament that she is in? How could immigration authorities reach the conclusion that they did in relation to this woman? The plight of Ms Cornelia Rau raises the wider issue of how detainees are treated in detention, particularly when they have some kind of mental illness. We can only conclude from this very sad and sorry tale that this is not the only incidence of a person who has not been properly assessed being in immigration detention and not being properly treated.
Since this matter came to light, a number of lawyers, including lawyers in South Australia, have raised cases regarding their own clients or those of other lawyers who have received similar inadequate treatment and responses to their mental illness. A prominent lawyer in Adelaide, Ms Claire O’Connor, has indicated—and I think she is right on the money here—that it is unfortunate that it has taken the plight of an Australian resident—namely, Ms Rau—to highlight what is a systemic problem in the system. Ms O’Connor has said that one of her clients, an Iranian asylum seeker, suffers a severe mental illness and, since being in Baxter detention centre, has attempted suicide 20 times. Ms O’Connor has said that this man has not received adequate treatment since he has been in detention. Ms O’Connor has indicated that it took months of court appearances before the Commonwealth would allow her client to be examined by an independent doctor. She says the term used by the Commonwealth lawyers was that the standard of care for mental illness at Baxter on the ground was ‘excellent’ and that if there was anything wrong with him they would know. Once the Commonwealth finally conceded, a doctor from the Royal Adelaide Hospital examined him and independent medical treatment was received, he was transferred immediately to Glenside Hospital, which, I understand, is the hospital Ms Rau is currently receiving treatment at.
That is an example of another case where the treatment that is being received or the assessments that are being made about detainees in the Baxter detention centre are clearly inadequate. Unfortunately, we can only assume that there are many other detainees who are in a similar situation to Ms Rau and to this Iranian asylum seeker, who is a client of Ms O’Connor and who suffered the same kind of treatment that Ms Rau received.
On a wider point, this very sad and sorry incident really puts the focus on the government’s policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers. It also tells us something about how we see ourselves as a nation. We quite readily allow the imprisonment of people who are already traumatised and who can show they have suffered harsh treatment in their own country—often including persecution, which can give rise to very serious mental illness—yet we seem to be comfortable with detaining these people purely on the basis that we are attempting to protect our borders. As we know, Australia is the only Western country that enforces a policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visa documentation.
There have been independent reports into the conditions in our detention centres. One was released last year by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who highlighted in their report that mental distress in varying degrees is very much a common manifestation of detained persons within our detention centres. They also expressed concern that there was a lack of correlating mental health support in the system. The case of Ms Cornelia Rau certainly highlights that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission were correct in identifying this as a major failure in the system. It should also seem obvious to most people that a detention centre is hardly a conducive environment in which to recover from a situation where they have been traumatised or to recover from mental illness. However, this is the system that is in place. Again, the Cornelia Rau case just exposes how badly people can be treated as a consequence of this system.
More broadly, I think this case really exposes the extent to which the treatment of detainees in the manner in which Ms Rau has been treated has just become normal procedure for persons who cannot be identified as being lawful citizens. Essentially, it shows that we are happy to treat human beings and their human rights with contempt and that the onus is upon them to prove that the authorities are wrong in categorising them as being unlawful citizens in our country. Of course, as we now know, Ms Rau was an Australian resident. She had a right to be in this country and there was certainly no lawful authority for her to be detained in the manner in which she was.
The other thing that I think this case exposes is, as I said, in relation to public attitude. It took a group of detainees within the Baxter detention centre itself to highlight the plight of Ms Rau. As I understand it, they brought it to the attention of refugee advocates who, in turn, attempted to bring it to public attention. I think that in itself is very concerning but, again, it is as a result of the system that is in place: there is no open public scrutiny of what goes on behind the closed doors of Baxter detention centre and it is left to detainees and refugee advocates to bring to light the atrocities that are often occurring behind those closed doors.
Many speakers have spoken about the number of errors and failures that happened in our system which led to Ms Rau being left in the shocking circumstances that she has found herself in. I think that it is concerning and it suggests that the humanity and compassion of Australians is drifting further and further away from mainstream Australia. We are losing that sense that we have always prided ourselves on. We now seem to live in a country where the emphasis is on punitive measures in response to persons who appear to be, and often are, fleeing persecution in their own countries.
Labor have called upon the government to establish an independent and transparent public inquiry with all of the powers required to call evidence from all of the relevant authorities. Furthermore, there is a need for full resourcing of the inquiry and, given the seriousness of this matter, the inquiry should take place as a matter of haste and should report as soon as possible. We believe that aspects that ought to be investigated in the course of this full, public and transparent inquiry include the process leading up to Ms Rau’s detention and dealings between DIMIA and the Queensland police, including the availability of a missing persons notification. We say that the inquiry needs to look at the relevance of establishing an independent inspector general of detention, who would be supported and advised by the Immigration Detention and Advisory Group. We believe the inspector general should be able to monitor conditions and resolve complaints from detainees and their advocates.
The inquiry should also look at the desirable extent of independent external medical and psychiatric personnel to ensure sound monitoring of detainee conditions. There is a need to look at the monthly justification of continued detention after 90 days as well as the effect of the intrinsic tendency for a higher hurdle on psychological and health issues given the reality of detention centres. Finally, there is a need to investigate the adequacy of DIMIA’s database and reporting procedures for overstayers. This is a tragic incident and it deserves a response along the lines that Labor has outlined.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,16,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-02-08,"—Senator Kirk, both in her speech this afternoon and in the debate on the motion to take note of answers after question time, has sought to make the case that there has been a systemic failure in the management of Ms Rau’s case. By contrast, I think that the reverse is in fact true; I think that this lady has been managed very sensitively and that her interests have been carefully looked after at every stage of the process that has led to where we are now.
This is a very sad and complex case. I think it is important that we deal with the substance of the issue and the facts before us, not the politics of the general issue of the government’s policy of detaining illegal immigrants. Ms Rau has a history of psychotic illness. She is schizophrenic. She was in a psychiatric institution in Sydney, from which she absconded. She very clearly wanted to conceal her identity after absconding. She had a stolen Norwegian passport as her identity document. She did not in any way admit to being who she was. She then claimed to be of German origin, coming from Munich, and, again, quite clearly, did not want anybody to know who she was; she concealed her identity.
If somebody wants to conceal their identity and mislead people about who they really are, unless there is some other compelling piece of evidence about their identity, it is very easy for them to conceal it and pretend to be someone else. This lady obviously did not like being in a psychiatric institution, so she left. She did not want to go back there. After some time, when she was interviewed by the police in Queensland, because of this confusion about whether she was Norwegian or German, or who she really was, the suspicion arose that she might have been an illegal entrant.
So far one can hardly say that is a history of systemic failure or poor treatment. This lady had a confused story about her identity. The issue arose as to whether she was an illegal migrant or an overstayer. Accordingly, she was placed in custody until her identity was established. I think it is important to understand that the diagnosis of psychiatric problems, and psychotic problems in particular, depends on the cooperation of the patient and their giving truthful answers to questions. People with psychotic illnesses are different from people who have psoriasis or dermatitis or a pain in their abdomen or something. They do not walk around with some identifiable sign on them that says, ‘Hey, I’m a schizophrenic,’ ‘I’m a manic depressive,’ or ‘I’ve got an obsessive compulsive disorder.’ There is no way of telling, unless they manifest some sign of that illness in their behaviour. Unless they do that, it is impossible to know that they have a mental illness.
On the ABC AM program on 7 February, Minister Vanstone said that, while Ms Rau was in a Brisbane correction centre, suspicions were raised about her behaviour and she was sent to Brisbane Hospital for assessment. The assessment was that, while her behaviour was odd, she was not exhibiting any diagnostic symptoms of psychotic or mental illness. I think that, given that the assessment was made at such an early stage of the proceedings, again one must say that this is not an example of systemic failure; instead it is an example of sensitive treatment of a person who was behaving in a rather odd way but who was obviously well enough in control of herself not to be exhibiting overtly psychotic behaviour—and who was very careful about how she answered questions, I would suspect.
Consequently, according to the minister, investigations were carried out to determine her identity. She said she was German, and the German diplomatic service in Australia was contacted to see if they could locate her relatives in Munich, where she claimed to be from. She claimed to have a boyfriend in Germany. In addition, the police around Australia were contacted regarding whether she was a missing person. There were questions asked of Centrelink and other government agencies dealing with social security, births, deaths and marriages to determine whether or not her identity could be established. Again, that is an example of the system working to identify who this lady was.
When she was in Baxter, she was seen in the first week by a GP and a psychologist, who referred her to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist recommended further assessment. As Senator Johnston said, in the debate on the motion to take note today, it takes time to establish the diagnosis that somebody is a schizophrenic as it is a thought and behaviour disorder. Schizophrenics do not really have split personalities, as people imagine; they are not Jekyll and Hyde. They are people with a strange thought disorder and shallow affect. They often have hallucinations of persecution; they hear voices talking to them. They think there are special messages for them on TV and so on. It takes time to build up that picture.
This lady was eventually sent off to a psychiatrist at the Baxter detention centre. Again, that is not an example of systemic failure but an example of this person being treated very sensitively. I would say, as a general comment, that this is a sad case involving a woman who sought to conceal her identity because she had absconded from a psychiatric institution in Sydney. The Queensland police authorities and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in fact took a great deal of care with her in order to establish who she was. Because of her odd behaviour, there were medical interventions quite early in the piece. So I repeat: this is no example of systemic failure; this is an example of sensitive treatment of a woman who sought to conceal her identity and the fact that she had a psychotic illness. In no way at all do I believe that any of the authorities involved warrant any kind of criticism; in fact, they deserve to be praised for treating this woman so well. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-02-08,"—The story of Cornelia Rau is an incredible case of negligence and incompetence by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Global Solutions Ltd, the company contracted to run the detention centres; and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It is incredible that behaviour that Aborigines in Cape York and asylum seekers in Baxter detention centre were able to clearly identify as being related to a mental illness could be construed by the department of immigration as ‘normal’. It is even more incredible that the department and authorities at Baxter detention centre deemed that it was appropriate to lock up Ms Rau in the isolation unit. The minister cannot claim ignorance, and the department cannot say it acted responsibly. The minister must apologise immediately, as should the Prime Minister. Appropriate compensation should be arranged for Ms Rau and her family.
Unfortunately, Ms Rau’s case is not an isolated incident. It is a snapshot of the cruelty that occurs behind the razor wire of our immigration detention centres. The treatment that Cornelia suffered is the same treatment that asylum seekers suffer every day. I have visited the detainees in Baxter detention centre. I have heard their stories, and I have seen the depression in their faces. Every day I receive correspondence from ordinary Australians who have befriended asylum seekers and who are horrified by the treatment their new friends receive. Two separate studies into mental illness and immigration detention concluded that almost all long-term detainees suffered at least one mental illness. Dr Louise Newman has called Baxter a de facto psychiatric hospital. If Cornelia Rau’s case is an example of the level of care it provides then this is a facility that should be closed. The Rau case has exposed an immigration detention regime that is systematic in its neglect of detainees, that results in human rights abuses and that strips asylum seekers of their dignity and their mental health. Detention itself is the problem.
The Greens called for a royal commission into conditions in detention in May 2003 after Four Corners aired allegations of brutality and abuse in our detention centres. We repeat the call this week. An inquiry must not be restricted to Cornelia Rau’s case; it must look at the conditions of all people in mandatory detention. Everyone, whether they are an Australian citizen, resident or noncitizen, is entitled to quality health care, dignity, human rights and justice. The inquiry must be transparent, independent and public. We believe that a royal commission, with broad terms of reference and an ability to take evidence from a wide variety of sources, is the best form of inquiry. This type of inquiry will reveal the full extent of the inhumanity of mandatory detention and why it must be abolished.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ms Cornelia Rau</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,16,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-02-08,"—I have to say I do not believe that today’s urgency debate has exactly added to the lustre of the Senate. Here we have what is clearly a very sad case of a woman who according to the details provided in the media has suffered some quite horrendous circumstances and who needs to be restored to a different state to the one she has found herself in over the last nine months or so. Clearly, some kind of investigation is required to determine what happened in this case and make sure that, if there is any kind of structural problem to do with the housing and treatment of people in detention centres, it is dealt with. But what we have in this debate today is a litany of assumptions and accusations which appear to show no interest in what a considered analysis of the facts actually is.
We have heard that this case shows that there is negligence and incompetence on the part of DIMIA and the detention centre system. It shows systemic failure, according to Senator Kirk, and reflects badly on the government, on the minister and on the system of mandatory detention—the very system, incidentally, which Senator Kirk’s government put in place some years ago. It demonstrates that there are atrocities going on inside Australia’s detention centre system. I think that is an overreaction to the evidence that is presently available of what happened to this particular woman. We need to find out what occurred before the judgments which have been passed in this chamber are put on the table. We need to know what actually happened.
I for one have great faith in Mr Mick Palmer determining what exactly happened in this matter. Mr Palmer served concurrently for some part of the period that he was Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as the Chief Police Officer of the Australian Capital Territory. As police minister for the Australian Capital Territory during that period, I had occasion to work closely with him. I know him to be a man who is both fair minded and absolutely vigorous in the discharge of his duty. He is not a man who is going to have the wool easily pulled over his eyes. If there are facts to be found, this man will find them. Members of this place have said that they do not have confidence that people will come forward and tell their stories. I have no doubt that Mr Palmer will be more than capable of determining when people do not tell the full story, do not tell what actually happened, and that he will be able, with the intuition which comes from many years of service as a good policeman, to appropriately frame his findings and recommendations in light of that fact if it occurs. There is no evidence, of course, that it is going to occur.
The fact of what has happened today is that Senator Vanstone put on the table a series of pieces of information which ought to cause people who have jumped to conclusions about this matter to reassess their position. She has explained, for example, some information which could quite plausibly lead a person of goodwill, a person of good faith, to conclude that Ms Cornelia Rau was indeed a foreign visitor to these shores and in breach of the conditions under which she was visiting and to take the step of detaining her under the terms of the immigration legislation. That has been put on the table by Senator Vanstone and I think we need to know just how much of what is being said by other parties still stands in light of that evidence. But, of course, we will not know by virtue of what takes place in this debate. The enlightenment we seek will not be added to by what happens in this chamber with this sort of debate.
I must say that there is a considerable irony in hearing members opposite call for an open inquiry on this on the very same day that elsewhere in this city a Labor government is seeking to shut down an open inquiry into the circumstances by which four people lost their lives two years ago during the horrendous January bushfires. That irony does not appear to have drawn itself to the attention of those opposite. The fact is that members of the Australian Labor Party in this place, and other people, are trading on the unfortunate circumstances of this woman for political capital. They would prefer to talk about issues like this and others which are closer to home, closer to the internal circumstances of the Labor Party, and the convenience of this debate is a matter that presents itself very obviously to them.
I for one believe we need to wait and see what this inquiry produces. I for one have no doubt that Mick Palmer is the right man to determine what happened here and to put that evidence squarely before the Australian community. What he will determine, of course, will be determined in a fair-minded way, in a thorough way and in a way which will be evident to Australians, because this report will be public information when it is tabled. It is also important for this to be done fairly expeditiously, and that is the other advantage of the approach that the government has taken. I believe that it is a mistake to assume that merely because government agencies have been involved they must have in some way been at fault. It is possible for a system to be well designed and yet for certain individuals not to be dealt with with appropriate outcomes by that system. No system is perfect, and it may not be the imperfections in the system but the circumstances under which the case came about that explain why this situation arose. I want to see what those circumstances are and I for one believe that that is the appropriate approach for all of us to adopt here—not jumping to conclusions, not assuming that we know better because we have read reports in the media. That does not do the Senate any credit, and it certainly does not do the family of Cornelia Rau any favours as it seeks to get to the bottom of what actually happened in this unfortunate case.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The document is a letter from Minister Hardgrave regarding the resolution of the Senate dealing with the opening of parliament and Indigenous Australians. This relates to the Senate’s repeated request that Indigenous Australians be involved in some of the ceremonial activities at the opening of each parliament after an election. This was something that was recommended in a report in the previous parliament, which was not accepted by the government. It was again put forward by the Senate as a resolution after the most recent election. It is very disappointing to see that the government has again rejected this proposal by the Senate that Indigenous Australians be recognised more clearly as part of the ceremonies for the opening of parliament.
I do not suggest that these things are more important than tackling the major disadvantage that Indigenous Australians face in so many ways throughout our community, but I do believe that with something that is ceremonial and therefore by definition full of symbolism, such as the opening of parliament, it is remiss not to have a more clear involvement of Indigenous Australians in some aspects of it. Clearly the Senate thinks so and has thought so a number of times, as has the committee that originally recommended it, and I urge that the government reconsider this.
I note that the minister’s letter firstly suggests that the government believes the opening of parliament after an election is predominantly about the people who have been elected. Perhaps I can understand how those of us in the parliament who have been elected might feel that that is what the opening of parliament is all about. I think it is about a lot more than that. Certainly, in the central role that the parliament plays in our democracy concerning what it is to be Australian and some of the most essential positive things about Australia, it is disappointing that the government remains averse to this idea.
I also note, however, that the minister makes the point that the current arrangements were readopted in the House of Representatives without dissent. Whilst I know that members of the opposition in the House of Representatives probably cannot be bothered dissenting a lot of the time because the result is always the same, I urge them to perhaps make their concerns a little more vocal in that chamber so that they match the concerns and views that Labor members are expressing in the Senate. It is only by making the point, even in a fairly mild way such as I am attempting now, and reaffirming it—drawing attention to it again—that we increase the chances for change. Maybe if there was a little more niggling down in the lower house, we might get a little more movement from the government.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to make a few remarks on the Auditor-General’s performance audit report No. 22 on investment of public funds. I wish to do that now because I do not think there will be another opportunity before estimates and it is something I wish to put on the record. The Auditor-General’s performance audit report No. 22 concerned the very important topic of investment of public funds. The Auditor-General notes at 30 June 2004 that Commonwealth entities reported financial investments totalling $20.208 billion, which is a great deal of money. That belongs to all Australians. It means that the Commonwealth holds a great deal of investment on behalf of each and every Australian in Australia.
It is vital that public funds are prudently managed in accordance with the rules outlined by the parliament. The bureaucracy should not be free to simply invest Australians’ money in the manner they see fit. Anyone with experience in finance and in the financial industry will be able to explain that there is an inherent investment trade-off between returns and the risk of the investment. Quite properly, the Commonwealth, when holding public funds, has a low tolerance for financial risk, and investment activity should be limited to low-risk assets. The objective of the Auditor-General’s audit was to examine the investment of public funds by selected entities, their compliance with the relevant legislation, the value from the investment strategies and the subsequent reporting of the investment activities.
Six entities—three under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and three under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act—were selected for the audit. The six entities audited owned $1.84 billion in investments—roughly 10 per cent of the total Commonwealth exposure. During the audit, it was found that $566 million in unauthorised investments were identified. So about $1 in every $4 were unauthorised investments. The conclusion of the Audit Office was that there had been shortcomings in the management of the investment of public funds. The report makes seven recommendations and states:
Implementation of the recommendations should collectively lead to a level of management and focus commensurate with the quantum of public funds under investment.
If you decipher that, that is a nice, fat slap on the wrist. The implicit conclusion is that the current standard of management is not commensurate with the $20 billion controlled by Commonwealth entities. As the report notes, there is no excuse for noncompliance. It states:
It is clearly important that entities comply with restrictions legislated by the Parliament. In addition, where departures by Commonwealth authorities are seen as prudent, the legislation provides a means of obtaining appropriate approval from the Treasurer.
This government—sometimes rightly, sometimes with a little bit of exaggeration—lays great claim to its economic management, and it should not pass by the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration or, indeed, the government as a whole, that this is not up to the standard that they would demand of government.
It was at least pleasing to see that all agencies concerned agreed, or agreed in principle, to all of the recommendations; however, from my perspective, the law was broken. If company directors disregard the Corporations Law or the Trade Practices Act, they can end up in jail. Perhaps it is time to remind the public sector that they need to be conscious that, if they break the law where the parliament has specified how matters should be dealt with, they can experience the full force of the law.
I hope that we and the Labor Party will be able to investigate these procedural failures during the Senate estimates process. I will be interested to know if there will be a follow-up procedural audit that can cover some of the other entities that were not selected in this audit. It appears that Treasury did not keep proper records of approvals of investments. If the Treasury experts, the guardians of the system, are acting negligently, how can other non-financial entities be expected to keep records prudently? The loose practice with financial management, as I have stressed previously in this chamber, is also encouraged by the vagueness of Treasury reporting, specifically the breach of accounting standards, by refusing to recognise the GST as a federal tax.
I believe it is timely that these issues are raised. The Commonwealth is currently in an extremely strong financial position but, as the Reserve Bank Chairman, Ian Macfarlane, commented recently, it is in the good times that important concerns should be addressed. These are not technical accounting matters; they are matters of legality and should be given an appropriately solemn and immediate response. Finally, I wish to congratulate the Auditor-General and the Audit Office on the seriousness with which this issue has been approached and the quality of the report prepared. I hope that the ministers responsible will act immediately to improve this situation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-02-08,"—I rise to speak on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004, and I indicate that the opposition is intending to support this bill. When we talk about water efficiency and especially about the supply and use of fresh water, it is worth remembering a few important facts. Some 97.5 per cent of the world’s water is salt water and is unfit for human use. The majority of fresh water is beyond our reach, locked in polar snow and ice. Less than one per cent of fresh water is useable, amounting to only 0.01 per cent of the earth’s total water. This would be enough to support the world’s population three times over, if used with care.
Unfortunately water, like population, is not distributed evenly. Asia has the greatest annual availability of fresh water and, disturbingly—as we all know—Australia has the lowest. In fact, Australia’s rainfall is the lowest of the continents, excluding Antarctica. This low rainfall, combined with very high evaporation, leads to low river flows. Despite this, we in this country still have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world. While two-thirds of all the people on earth use less than 60 litres of water a day, the average Australian uses more than twice that amount during a single shower.
Access to clean, safe water is fundamental to public health and our quality of life. Australians expect that, when we turn on our taps, the water that comes out will be clean and safe. That expectation is deeply ingrained in our way of life. However, our growing population, combined with our drought-prone climate, means that we simply have to learn to do more with less. Indeed, we are likely to have more frequent droughts if the predicted effects of global climate change kick in. That is something I hope Senator Ian Campbell is aware of; I note that the government continues to maintain its position against ratifying the Kyoto protocol.
Nevertheless, I am hopeful and believe that Australia can become one of the most water efficient communities in the world. However, we all have to take responsibility to rethink where water comes from, how it is used and how to reuse it. Water shortages across Australia in recent times, particularly in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, have shown that the efficient use of water is not simply a response to the current drought. It is, in fact, an essential step in learning how to live with less water without compromising our way of life. I note that in my home state of South Australia the state government has made significant efforts to move to permanent water conservation measures for urban use.
There are no simple solutions to our water shortage. What is needed is a multifaceted approach that combines new sources, new efficiency measures and innovative ways of reusing our waste water. Clearly, water remains one of the key environmental challenges for Australia. Indeed, after climate change it is probably our most serious challenge. There have been many manifestations of this in recent times. In Perth there are plans for a desalination plant costing an estimated $350 million because there are no local sources of water to meet that city’s needs. In South Australia—the driest state in the driest continent—we have our own water shortage problems. A great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the River Murray which are aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide’s drinking water. Such work is extremely important because, as we know, if nothing is done by 2020 Adelaide’s water is predicted not to meet World Health Organisation guidelines two days out of five. On this note, one of the things the Howard government could do is to deliver the 1,500 gigalitres of water which is required to restore the Murray to health and to ensure Adelaide in particular maintains a safe drinking water supply.
Melbourne was on stage 2 water restrictions for most of 2003. Sydney’s problems with water have a very high profile, with restrictions on sprinklers or watering systems, washing cars, filling pools and general garden watering. As of last Thursday, Sydney’s main water supply, Warragamba Dam, was only filled to 43.4 per cent of its capacity. I am sure that most people in Sydney know water use is a serious issue.
The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in this legislation is a very serious challenge facing the country. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. This bill’s objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for the purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It also provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It provides for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements and for an enforcement regime. The government estimates the bill will reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021.
Whilst this is an objective the opposition supports, we consider that it is a manifestly inadequate objective. We need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption much more rapidly than by 2021. This is hardly an ambitious project. It is also expected that there will be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures. The legislation is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use.
I understand that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme and that it has not been opposed by industry generally. The bill addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilets. In the view of the Labor Party, the legislation is far weaker than it could have been and the environmental benefits will not be fully realised if the government’s agenda stands as it is in the bill. We believe there is a case for standards to apply far more broadly. It is the view of the opposition that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products.
We make these points against the background of the comments with which I opened, that we are one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australia each person uses around 350 litres per day, and our national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and our economy.
An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes, such as irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial purposes and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe, treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses. The government should be working with the states and territories to improve both water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. The government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and wastewater reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas. The government should be using the COAG process to implement national initiatives to promote water saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual flush toilets and increased use of grey water.
Another area of concern to the opposition is the research effort in relation to urban water. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. The government should be reinvigorating the role of the Commonwealth in research and development for irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research would yield many dividends, including better design and value from experimental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. Establishing an urban water research program would support innovation in the reuse of stormwater, the reuse of effluent, water conservation, water-sensitive urban design and urban water planning and management practices. The government should establish a national program of research to promote sustainable water use in Australia, with a particular focus on water reuse.
There are very significant challenges facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains-supplied water in Australia. That is the second largest share of mains water use after the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors, as you might expect. The main indoor use is showering, which accounts for 29 per cent of indoor consumption. In terms of overall domestic consumption, it is worth noting that the amount of water used for outdoor purposes does vary considerably between cities.
Between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas of Australia increased by about 3.4 per cent per annum. According to information from the Water Services Association of Australia, water consumption in two state capitals is already beyond the safe yield level, meaning that additional supply or effective demand measures are required immediately. According to the association, three other capitals will be beyond the safe yield level between 2012 and 2020. That is a very serious situation and it does require action.
Back in 2002, the Senate ECITA committee completed an inquiry into Australia’s management of urban water. I note Senator Allison is in the chamber; she was on that inquiry, and I think it was one of the first inquiries I came into, late, when I first came into the Senate. That was a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, many of the Senate committee’s recommendations have not been taken up by the government. The committee commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, indicating there is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies so that water-efficient appliances, which can dramatically reduce water use in the home, can be introduced. This approach, coupled with water-efficient gardens, the use of native plants, minimal lawns and efficient watering systems could yield substantial benefits. The committee found that the fundamental factor in a successful demand management program was changing behaviour—changing the behaviour of Australians, changing us so that we do not do things like hose down the driveway and gutters, water lawns during the heat of the day and have extensively long showers.
So, what will be the impact of the labelling scheme which is provided for in the bill? According to the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling component of the scheme will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021, compared with the ‘business as usual’ approach. As I indicated at the outset, we consider that to be an insufficiently ambitious target. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered—that is, washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers will benefit from a net saving because water bills will be lower. The statement also considered manufacturers and importers, noting that labelling will come into force 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised.
As water efficiency labelling has an effect on consumer preference, the extent to which the sales of various manufacturers and importers are affected will depend on the water efficiency of their product ranges. Manufacturers and importers that offer only products of low water efficiency will obviously be disadvantaged. Retailers that carry at least some water-efficient models should be advantaged. Those that specialise in low-cost products with low water efficiency will be disadvantaged. However, as the awareness of water labels is likely to build up over time, retailers should have ample time to sell their old stocks and order in more water-efficient models.
We want to raise one concern about the labelling requirement. Whilst the labelling requirement should assist those plumbers and builders who take an interest in, or seek competitive advantage from, advising clients on water and energy efficient products, the fact is that many end users will not see the water efficiency labels. Plumbers and builders will still be free to select or recommend products, irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and may well remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them. However, we note there are other programs under way to raise plumbers’ awareness of water product efficiency, including the Green Plumbers program, run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which does receive some funding from the Greenhouse Office.
The introduction of water efficiency labelling for various indoor water use products is unfortunately expected to have only a modest effect on household consumption, and that effect will obviously take some time to materialise. Nevertheless, the requirement for labelling foreshadowed in the bill is a positive step. However, we emphasise it is only one aspect of managing the demand for water by Australian households. It would certainly be worth while if modelling could be done on how the introduction of compulsory water efficiency standards for things like new showerheads or new washing machines would be likely to affect household consumption.
In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is also a substantial challenge to get our water use right in urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we can have sustainable practices in our cities and in the country. Against that background, the opposition support the legislation, but, as I have said, we do not think it goes far enough. The opposition believe the government ought be acting with a far greater sense of urgency. In the second reading amendment moved in the House we indicated that the government ought be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor use products. The government ought take up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.",SENATE,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-02-08,"—On average, Australia uses 350 litres of water per person per day. This figure has already been mentioned several times in this chamber and no doubt will be again. The problem is that overall demand is increasing and that is putting greater pressure on our limited water resources. It is clear to the Democrats that urban centres in Australia are using water in ways and quantities that are unsustainable. A great deal is being done, but we still see a specific need to increase the pace of change. We see a definite role for the Commonwealth to play in managing national water resources and setting national standards for efficiency.
At the time of the announcement of the Australian water fund, the Democrats were very pleased to see recognition from the Prime Minister of the role the federal government can play in achieving significant cultural shift in water use and management. However, the reform is not keeping pace with the damage being caused by the expanding ecological footprint of our cities and nor are water efficiency initiatives keeping pace with growth in water use. I am convinced that Australia already has most of the knowledge, the technical expertise and the systems to solve the problems in urban water management. In fact, many of the initiatives that have been taken in this country have gone offshore, where other countries are much more interested in conserving water than we have been to date.
I welcome the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. This comes as a result of negotiations between the Democrats and the government a year or so ago. The government wished to shift moneys that were not required from the oil recycling program to a range of projects, and we asked for water efficiency standards for appliances to be funded as part of numerous projects under Sustainable Cities, including extension of the photovoltaic scheme for 12 months.
Moving to national water efficiency standards was one of the recommendations, as has also been mentioned, of the 2002 Senate Inquiry into Australia’s Urban Water Management. I chaired that inquiry, and we looked in great detail at the adequacy of policies to reduce urban water use, the performance of urban stormwater systems and the potential to improve water quality and environmental outcomes. The final report of that inquiry calls for the government to play a more prominent role in driving the changes needed for sustainable urban water management. Since that time the government has set up the National Water Initiative and the National Water Commission, and we hope these are the first of many steps to be taken in that direction. We look forward to what will initially be mandatory labelling showing water efficiency ratings for domestic fittings and appliances as we have already for energy, and on to mandatory standards. That has the potential to result in very significant water savings.
My understanding, Senator Wong—and, if Senator Campbell is back in time, I am sure he will say this—is that toilets are the first step and that there is no requirement for other appliances to be in the legislation but they will be dealt with by regulation shortly. We hope to see continued work towards a similar water and energy efficiency rating scheme for buildings and for best-practice water management standards to be incorporated into Australia’s building and plumbing codes, particularly to pave the way for much greater recycling of water. Re-use of effluent on gardens and domestic use of grey water in cisterns, for example, could have a major impact on water conservation in this country.
Efficient water use within households must be coupled with water sensitive urban design principles, which currently remain the exception rather than the rule. Substantial water savings can be made through stormwater infrastructure and management being changed and reformed by minimising stormwater run-off and encouraging structures that contain rainwater on site. I have a 1,100-litre rainwater tank which fills up on a regular basis, especially in recent storms, and it is very useful.
—It would be overflowing since last Tuesday.
—It overflowed probably several times, Senator Patterson, but it is very useful for watering my small garden.
—When you are home.
—When I am home, exactly. We know that large volumes of drinking water are used for maintaining urban gardens. Initiatives to re-use grey water must be more fully explored and we must also have efficient garden watering systems so that this incentive on household appliances is supplemented by other sensible measures.
The Democrats also urge the Commonwealth to lead by example and develop a strategy for progressively upgrading all Commonwealth buildings for high standards of water efficiency. The cisterns in my suite are certainly still single flush and I think it is time we moved to dual flush throughout this building. There is little doubt that water use in both urban and rural areas is of primary importance to Australians and fundamental to establishing a sustainable and enjoyable standard of living in this country. At the time of its announcement, the coalition’s $2 billion Australian water fund was welcomed by the Democrats. A national approach to water through the Council of Australian Governments is crucial for Australia to move forward to the end goal of sustainable use of water resources.
The Senate has provided a clear basis for water reform strategy through both the urban water inquiry and the later rural water inquiry, which was chaired by my colleague Senator Ridgeway. Considering the importance of this issue and the absolute necessity of bringing the states on board for all negotiations, the Democrats encourage the federal government to engage with the states in order to establish an effective water reform strategy. It would be good to move quickly from mandatory labels to labels plus mandatory standards and for these to be progressively improved. The minister has notified us that he will see that minimum standards for water efficiency are identified and determined by the end of 2007. For the record, I thought I would read the relevant paragraphs of the minister’s letter. He says:
As you may be aware, the Bill establishes a regulatory framework for the Scheme. Standards for specific products will be set by ministerial determination, once the Bill is enacted. The Government has foreshadowed, in the explanatory statement and regulatory impact statement tabled with the Bill, its intention to introduce a mandatory minimum standard for toilets. I anticipate setting this standard shortly after the Bill is enacted.
I intend to consider the need for further mandatory minimum standards once the scheme has been in operation for 12 months. This will allow time for industry to adjust to the new regulatory requirements and also allow the Secretary of my department, as regulator, to gather information about the performance of products and the potential for further water savings and to recommend additional standards. I would then consult stakeholders through a regulatory impact statement in the normal way. I expect this process would be completed, ready for my final decision, in 2007.
We strongly encourage the minister to act on that commitment. Without identification of the absolute minimum water efficiency baseline for manufacturers, efforts to reduce water use through the sale of water efficient appliances may well be offset by the sale of much cheaper products with no efficiency benefits. While labelling is a very important first move, plumbers and builders would of course be free to select or recommend products irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and would be able to remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them.
Wasteful water practices have resulted in the degradation of many of our water resources and in ongoing rationing in many of our capital cities and rural areas. The Democrats believe the commitment to funding to secure the National Water Initiative is extremely important. So we hope that state and federal governments will adopt the second unanimously agreed recommendation from the Senate inquiry into rural water—namely, that COAG should negotiate an ongoing shared program for funding reforms in the Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative.",SENATE,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-02-08,"—On behalf of Minister Campbell I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. Since it is not my area of expertise I will not add anything other than to note that WELS, Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards, is a much easier acronym to remember, having some association with water. I have acronyms in my portfolio that do not seem to have any bearing on the program that they are related to. I suppose being a WELS inspector is appropriate when we are talking about water efficiency. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-02-08,"—The Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005] amends the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to ensure that the provisions of the draft disability standards for education are fully supported by the act. Labor supports this bill, which is the next step towards what, in my view, is the long overdue implementation of the disability standards for education. The bill amends the act to support the draft education standards in a number of ways. The bill introduces and defines the term ‘educational provider’, which is broader in this particular bill than the pre-existing definitions covering educational institutions and authorities.
The bill will make it unlawful for education providers to discriminate on the grounds of disability in the development or the accreditation of curricula or in training courses. It also includes a provision that educational providers may be required to develop strategies and programs to prevent the harassment and victimisation of students with disabilities. The bill extends the definitions of the defence in education, the so-called unjustifiable hardship provisions, to post-enrolment situations. While this extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions has caused some concern, nonetheless Labor will support the provisions in the bill insofar as it supports the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s and the Productivity Commission’s assessment that the amendment will remove a source of inconsistency and confusion in the current act. I will return to this matter in a little while.
Section 31 of the Disability Discrimination Act provides that the Attorney-General may formulate standards in relation to a number of areas covered by the DDA, including the education of people with a disability. The bill clarifies that disability standards made under section 31 may require reasonable adjustments to be made in order to avoid unlawful discrimination on the grounds of disability. The government has released a final draft of the standards which is intended to clarify and elaborate upon the obligations of education and training providers in relation to students with disabilities. I understand that the government intends to table these standards in parliament following passage of this bill.
I feel particularly strongly about these matters. I have had the opportunity to discuss these issues in this parliament for some time. In fact, in 2002 I chaired the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee inquiry into the education of students with disabilities. The committee produced a bipartisan report and its recommendations were unanimously supported by all members of that committee. The key message then, and it remains the key message today, is that social justice demands that students with disabilities have equal access to education. As the committee stated in its report:
This is a human rights issue of considerable significance.
In 2002, the committee expressed its disappointment at the failure of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, to finalise the Disability Standards for Education at its July 2002 meeting. Work on these standards has been under way since 1995—that is, since before the current government came into existence. Stakeholders have already been involved in two consultation processes—back in 1997 and 2000. It was the committee’s view that the inability to finalise these standards in a timely manner represented:
... a failure at the national level to recognise the paramount issue of equity in the provision of services to those with disabilities.
In my judgment, this failure makes a mockery of the Adelaide Declaration on the National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century. This is held up in many quarters, particularly within government, as being a declaration of principle which asserts that schools should develop fully the talents and capacities of all students—I emphasise the words ‘all students’. The national goals explicitly state:
Schooling should be socially just, so that students’ outcomes from schooling are free from the effects of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture and ethnicity, religion or disability; and of differences arising from students’ socio-economic background or geographic location.
Frankly, if we have a situation in this country where students with a disability are not able to fully develop their talents and capacities, then quite clearly we are failing to meet those grand principles.
In 2003, all state and territory members of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, with the exception of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, voted against the Commonwealth’s move to introduce the standards. While all the states and territories said they agreed with the content and intent, they were not prepared to move forward unless the Commonwealth agreed to share the costs of implementation which some considered to be significant. Given this apparent deadlock, it is pleasing to see that the Commonwealth has finally taken legislative action to support the Disability Standards for Education. In fact, that was the recommendation of the 2002 Senate inquiry. It is important on issues such as this that the Commonwealth in fact raises the bar. Just as commentators agree that the role of school principals appears to be crucial in establishing and maintaining a climate of inclusion in education, so the role of the Commonwealth government should be to provide leadership at a national policy level on these fundamental social justice questions.
The education standards must now be implemented as quickly as possible to ensure improved access for students with disabilities. There is strong support in the disability sector for the standards to be introduced. Importantly, implementation of the standards will reduce the need for parents to participate in highly stressful complaints and legal actions to ensure that their children are not discriminated against in education.
Looking at these issues in detail, we see that the issues addressed in this bill, like those addressed in the existing act, are in fact very serious. One of these issues that was drawn clearly to the attention of the committee during the 2002 inquiry was the importance of definitions. During this inquiry, the emphasis on definitions became apparent because, frankly, the principles of the definition of disability provide a situation where education providers and education access is in fact established. The definition issues are not just fodder for bureaucratic arguments, they have a genuine impact on the rights of people with disabilities and their capacity to have access to the services that they need.
In 2002, the Senate committee report highlighted that much of the definition of a disability or even whether a disability is defined at all hangs on this principle. The report said:
Depending on the scope of the definition, rights are protected; funds are allocated; research commissioned, and policy evaluated. The definition of disability becomes particularly important when it provides a mechanism to compete for funds.
A fairly narrow definition of disability tends to be applied when allocating funds for the support of students with disabilities. The committee found that the group of students with disabilities which attracts funding support has not kept pace with the advances in diagnosis and the potential for students requiring additional support.
Among other findings, in relation to the definition of disability the committee found that:
... the Commonwealth definition of disability for the purposes of additional per capita funding, are narrower than the definition of disability under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.
The report stated:
The evidence suggests, however, that in supporting the education of students with disabilities, the Commonwealth has given scant regard to the obligations imposed on education authorities since the introduction of the Commonwealth’s anti-discrimination legislation:
Some of the submissions to the inquiry raised concerns with proposed subsection 22(4), which would extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship in education to post-enrolment situations. Some parents expressed concern, and many advocates supported them, in relation to this provision, which is understandable. The record of non‑government schools in citing unjustifiable hardship as a reason not to enrol students with disabilities is not a particularly good one. Finney v Hills Grammar School was a particularly well publicised case—it led to considerable litigation—and was one which the non-government sector had expressed concerns about. The school was found to have discriminated against a girl with spina bifida. There are other cases that follow a similar pattern. It is something of a concern that non-government schools may use the extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions to avoid their responsibilities in relation to students who are enrolled prior to the onset of a disability or whose needs change.
Related to this is the risk that the extension of the unjustifiable hardship provisions will exacerbate the double standards that already exist between government and non‑government schools in the way in which their obligations to students with disabilities are expressed. Time will tell. I can only hope that the introduction of the disability standards for education, which will apply equally to both government and non-government sectors, will provide greater certainty for parents and students in terms of what their school will be required to do to support them.
I would like to emphasise that Labor support the implementation of the disability standards for education. However, we are somewhat disappointed that the Commonwealth has refused to accept any of the real financial responsibilities for the implementation of these new standards. Labor understand the concerns of many states that the costs involved in the implementation of these new standards will fall heavily on them in the absence of any serious financial commitment from the Commonwealth. It is particularly disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the further recommendations of the 2002 inquiry. The recommendations were unanimously supported by the committee, which asserted that the costs of implementing the standards should be shared between the Commonwealth, states and territories. The inquiry found:
The Disability Discrimination Act gives a new responsibility to the Commonwealth government. To ensure the objectives of the Act are achieved, the committee agrees that the Commonwealth will have to accept a level of financial responsibility for the implementation of the education standards ... Such funding would be over and above those funds currently provided to state governments for the education of students with disabilities.
The reference committee considering this bill was advised:
The Minister for Education, Science and Training will contribute to the development of professional development materials ...
However, professional development involves a lot more than just materials. Indeed, the fact that this small element has been identified for the Commonwealth’s attention simply highlights the government’s lack of willingness to provide comprehensive support for the implementation of the standards. I argue that, in relation to professional development, the Commonwealth does have a key responsibility in the existing administrative arrangements. The Commonwealth has in the past acknowledged that responsibility. The Senate committee that looked at these matters in 2002 found that there was already a training deficit that needed to be urgently addressed and that an attitudinal change to professional development was long overdue. The committee took the view that effective professional development in the area of disabilities required programs to be properly structured and sustained over a period of time. As the report states:
Quality professional development comes at a cost.
The committee also expressed a concern about the evidence it received, which pointed to a shortfall and which might be called the attitudinal budget. It noted that it was indicative of a problem more serious than the shortage of resources for disability education per se.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
A lot of the public debate around migration matters in Australia and in tribunals tends to focus on refugee issues. That is understandable in many respects but it sometimes obscures the fact that there is a huge range of other migration decisions made each year. The operation of the Migration Review Tribunal assesses appeals against those migration decisions that do not deal with refugee issues. There are a few aspects in this report that are worth pointing out. The interesting one at the start of the report is that the case load for the tribunal of a little under 8,000 cases represented a decline of 11 per cent in the number of cases lodged from the previous year. The tribunal suggests a number of reasons for that, including changes of visa criteria, strengthening integrity measures relating to migration agents and reductions in case loads.
Whether or not those reasons given are the only reasons or even whether they are valid ones could perhaps be tested elsewhere. Nonetheless, in most respects it is a positive sign that fewer appeals are being considered as long as that means that there are fewer mistakes being made. I hope that is the case rather than other hurdles being put in the way, but there is certainly nothing that I am aware of from the previous 12 months in terms of extra hurdles that would make that the case. That should mean that, overall, the decline in the number of cases lodged should be an indication that perhaps there are fewer erroneous decisions being made or fewer vexatious appeals being lodged. That may be the issue in relation to migration agents that are mentioned. It may also be a matter of better education amongst people about which areas are worth appealing against and which areas are not.
It should be noted that an appeal of a decision to the Migration Review Tribunal does incur a fee. I am fairly sure that fee is $1,400, which is refunded if you are successful. That in itself can be quite a significant hurdle for people wishing to appeal a matter as they are basically risking $1,400 to get a matter considered. There is scope for waiving that if people make a case for it but it is certainly a factor that can come into account.
The other big issue in relation to the Migration Review Tribunal is the length of time it takes to finalise a case. It is definitely a welcome sign in the report that the average time taken from lodging an appeal to finalising that appeal has clearly dropped in the last couple of years. It is still a fairly significant time, I might say—320 days is nearly a year—but it has dropped from 362 days the year before and 387 days the year before that. That is certainly a welcome sign. There are other examples. For instance, 585 days is the average time taken to resolve refusals for permanent business visas and 601 days is the average time taken to resolve an appeal for a skilled visa refusal. It is still far too long but, in the same way that I am certainly quite willing to criticise aspects of the migration regime when I believe it appropriate, I also think it should be acknowledged when there is a positive move, and clearly there is a move in the right direction here.
Overall, I think the percentage of successful appeals would, on one hand, show that the tribunal is able to be independent. On the other hand, it also shows that, when nearly 46 per cent of appeals of decisions set aside are successful, that is still a pretty high rate of what one could call errors in the different decisions made at the departmental level. That is an area that is still of concern. It is up from the previous year and in some categories, such as partner or visitor visas, over 60 per cent of decisions are set aside. That is an area that is still of concern and is something that needs further attention. One of the key frustrations of appealing to the Migration Review Tribunal is the length of time it takes. That being said, the improvements being made are certainly going in the right direction. (Time expired)

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-02-08,"—This afternoon senators united in expressions of condolence for the victims of the Boxing Day tsunami tragedy. Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, noted how important it is for the national parliament to act as a united representative of the Australian people in times of great tragedy. Sadly, we have known more of those times over recent years than any of us would wish. On each occasion, we in the parliament have been reminded that the matters on which we agree are more significant than those on which we disagree.
Tonight I want to acknowledge the magnificent response of local governments to the tsunami tragedy. In doing so, I do not want to avoid acknowledgement of the response of local governments to the South Australian bushfires and indeed many other events where local expertise, local knowledge and the capacity to respond quickly to identified needs is required. This level of government does, of course, do much that goes unacknowledged. Only rarely does the national parliament extend to this sphere of government the acknowledgement it deserves.
I know that many members and senators have a good deal of regard for the work done by local governments in their electorates. As Labor’s spokesperson on local government matters I propose to highlight as regularly as I can the contribution that local government makes to the wellbeing of our nation. In relation to the tsunami tragedy, this sphere of government has acted quickly to lend assistance to devastated communities. Some of this activity has been coordinated by the peak local government representative body, the Australian Local Government Association, and its state and territory based member organisations.
One week after the disaster struck—early in the new year and bang in the middle of the holiday season—the ALGA President, Councillor Paul Bell, issued a statement about the local government response to the tsunami tragedy. He noted that Australian communities have always been quick to help those in crisis and pledged that local government would do all it could to assist in this time of need. Councillor Bell said ALGA would offer advice to Australian councils about how they could best support the effort to assist affected communities and would establish a web site to facilitate the provision of this advice.
I can report that the web site was established very quickly indeed, and the Australian Local Government Association has played a key role in assisting local government to maximise its contribution to the relief of devastated communities. I urge senators to visit the ALGA web site—www.alga.com.au—and acquaint themselves with the local government contribution to the tsunami relief effort. On that site they will find an opportunity for councils and individuals to register offers of assistance. They will find details of the Adopt a Village program, which establishes direct beneficial links between Australian local government bodies and villages in tsunami-hit Sri Lanka. The ALGA tsunami relief web site also offers a small sample of the many activities being undertaken by local governments across Australia. I want to highlight some of those activities tonight.
Brisbane City Council has donated $100,000 to the Australian Red Cross tsunami relief appeal and established condolence registers at all council libraries, ward offices and city hall. Shoalhaven City Council has collected cash donations from residents and visitors for the Red Cross tsunami appeal. Manly Council has made community facilities available to a community initiative, Aid4Aceh, which has collected medical supplies for distribution to the Indonesian province of Aceh.
Whittlesea City Council has called a meeting of groups from Indian, Sri Lankan and other affected local communities and added resource material containing telephone hotline numbers and general information to the council’s web site. The City of Fremantle is lending a hand to its sister city, Seberang Perai in Penang, Malaysia, and has held a special fundraising function entitled, intriguingly, ‘the Brown Paper Bag Event’. The City of Melbourne has allocated $500,000 to the relief effort, offered the Melbourne Town Hall to community organisations and placed a condolence book in the town hall foyer.
The City of Sydney launched a New Year’s appeal for tsunami relief and pledged $50,000 to Oxfam to kick-start donations. I understand about $900,000 was collected at the city’s New Year’s Eve event. Mosman Municipal Council coordinated a day of fundraising on 9 January, saying that it was to ‘enable us to donate as a community and share our commitment to each other’. The City of Greater Dandenong has donated $10,000 to the Red Cross tsunami appeal and supported a tsunami interfaith gathering of prayer and reflection on 16 January in a local park.
Maroondah City Council has also donated $10,000 to the relief appeal and invited donations at its customer service centres. The City of Joondalup has approved the use of five environmental health officers to assist in the recovery effort. Port Phillip City Council has organised an interfaith community commemoration service and consulted with overseas aid groups to identify the best way that Port Phillip can offer long-term practical assistance to help rebuild devastated communities. Macedon Ranges Shire Council has organised a benefit concert and established a link with the local Sri Lankan community to assist rebuilding.
Whyalla City Council joined the Red Cross and the Salvation Army to conduct an appeal on Australia Day for both bushfire and tsunami victims. Mansfield Shire Council has donated funds to the Red Cross tsunami appeal and is acting as a collection agency for Red Cross donations. Council staff have also organised clothing donations to Sri Lanka. Kingston City Council has donated $10,000 and made customer service centres available as collection points for further donations. The council has also donated the use of the town hall for fundraising activities.
Adelaide City Council staff members have made payroll deductions to CARE Australia. Hobsons Bay City Council has held a concert benefit featuring local youth bands and established accounts with appeal funds for staff payroll deductions. A group of five Adelaide western suburb councils—Charles Sturt, Marion, West Torrens, Holdfast Bay and Port Adelaide-Enfield—have processed donations through their offices, and the mayors of each municipality have pledged $1,000 to the fundraising effort. Latrobe City Council has pledged a donation of $10,000 to the Australian Red Cross.
The City of Onkaparinga has committed itself to a 12-month response to the tsunami tragedy, donated $30,000 to the relief effort and received strong fundraising support from its staff social club. The rural City of Wangaratta formed a committee to oversee Wangaratta’s ‘10 Days of Giving’, which raised funds for the tsunami relief effort. Caloundra City Council has donated $50,000 to the APN tsunami relief appeal from its charity and benevolent management fund. Council staff members have also contributed to relief efforts through fundraising activities coordinated by their social club. Banyule City Council has donated $10,000 and made its community halls available for fundraising.
But I should say that councils in my home state of Tasmania have also made a tremendous contribution. My office is in the city of Launceston. They have made available facilities for fundraising and have conducted a special interfaith ceremony in commemoration of the victims. Waratah-Wynyard council has announced a $14,000 donation to an ALGA approved tsunami infrastructure benefit fund. This contribution represents about $1 for every member of the Waratah-Wynyard population.
Tasman council, together with the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, hosted a ‘Night of Lights’ concert on 28 January as a way of saying thank you for the support of the local community—similar to the support they got eight years ago—in giving help to others. The Salvation Army and the Red Cross collected donations during the evening. Glenorchy City Council has donated $20,000 to World Vision Australia to enable the council to sponsor five children from the affected tsunami region to an amount of approximately $500 per annum per child over eight years.
King Island council has established a King Island tsunami appeal, with an initial target of $10,000, kicked off by a donation from the council. Clarence City Council has allocated $10,000 for tsunami relief. Northern Midlands council has initiated a tsunami appeal and donated $2,000 to the fund. Hobart City Council has made a $50,000 donation towards the establishment of an orphanage in Aceh. The council has also made contact with the Australian Local Government Association to identify ways in which it can assist in the long-term recovery process. Sorell council is hosting a benefit on Sunday, 13 March, to raise more funds.
These are magnificent efforts, and they are just a small sample of the contribution that local governments around the country have made as part of the Australia wide response to the tsunami disaster. Tonight I acknowledge that contribution, one that proudly reflects the generosity of the communities that local government so effectively represents.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Indian Ocean Tsunami</title>,ADJOURNMENT,31,1,speech

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-02-08,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
Departmental systems indicate that as at 30 June 2004, there were 22 Protection visa (PV) applicants in immigration detention and 666 applicants not in immigration detention, who were awaiting a primary decision from the Department.
Given the nature of information sought in parts (1) to (14) of the question, these figures and subsequent answers exclude applications for Further Protection Visas (FPVs) lodged by holders of Temporary Protection visas (TPVs) and offshore Temporary Humanitarian visas.
Of the non-detainee PV caseload 33 persons do not at present have a reportable residential address postcode. Of the remainder, the State and Territory breakdown is as follows:

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) systems do not enable the statistical reporting requested on the numbers of PV applicants who have Bridging Visas in effect.
For reasons stated in (2) above, DIMIA systems cannot provide the statistical reporting requested on Bridging Visa holders.
The ASAS is administered by the Australian Red Cross (ARC) under an agreement with the Commonwealth. ARC systems do not provide consolidated reports on the number of persons who have applied for ASAS income support.
The total number of persons in receipt of ASAS income support as at 30 June 2004 was:

During 2004 (to 30 June), six families involving 14 persons have received financial assistance from the Government after being released from immigration detention on Bridging Visa E (subclass 051). This subclass of Bridging Visa E requires adequate care arrangements to be in place before a visa can be granted.
Where there are significant ongoing costs such as medical and pharmaceutical expenses, the Department examines, on a case-by-case basis, requests to contribute to these costs to ensure the proper welfare of those persons.
The geographic distribution of those released referred to in (a) during 2004 (to 30 June) on Bridging Visa E (subclass 051) are:
