"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (10:08):  I rise to speak on this private senator's bill, the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, and from the outset I'd like to welcome all senators back. It's good to be here. I'd like to also commend my colleague Senator McAllister for her tireless efforts in producing this bill. Primarily this bill seeks to require, among other things, the Productivity Commission to undertake research on inequality and its effects on the Australian economy and community and to report to the minister and to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.


This bill is a simple yet powerful measure that will ensure that the Australian government, by way of the Productivity Commission, has an easily accessible institution to measure inequality in our country. Many might ask why the Productivity Commission is best suited to perform this function. The Productivity Commission is more than just an advisory body. Its work sets the national agenda and provides a basis for substantial change—as seen, for instance, with the reliance by the FWC on the Productivity Commission's report into last year's despicable penalty rates decision. As stands, the Productivity Commission is not required to take inequality into account. Although its enabling legislation currently requires it to have regard to a wide variety of factors, such as the need to promote regional development and to ensure that development is ecologically sustainable, there is no reference to inequality. This is a problem because there is an emerging consensus that increasing inequality not only has social justice implications but also has macroeconomic consequences. Inequality restricts access to social, economic and other opportunities, which limits intergenerational mobility and imposes society-wide cost through lost economic opportunities.


Inequality influences patterns of consumption and demand in ways that restrict economic growth. This bill aims to correct this by expanding the Productivity Commission's mandate to explicitly include consideration of inequality. It does this by requiring the Productivity Commission to consider the importance of mitigating the negative impacts of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community when exercising its functions and requiring the Productivity Commission to produce a report on the extent of inequality and its effects on the Australian economy every five years on the same timetable as the Intergenerational report.


In determining the merits behind this bill I would like to inform the Senate of some alarming trends currently faced by our nation. Australia's inequality level is the challenge of our time. Inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high. Wealth is growing more quickly at the top. Over the past four decades, real earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times faster than they have for the bottom 10 per cent, and the trend of increasing inequality will continue unless we arrest it. Extreme levels of inequality are incompatible with how we as a nation see ourselves. Almost three-quarters of Australians agree the differences in income are too high. Australia doesn't have the extremes of inequality that we see in other countries such as the US, but it is below the OECD average. Two and a half million Australians live below the poverty line. Inequality is a drag on economic growth and a destabilising force. The OECD has estimated that, from 1985 to 2005, inequality reduced growth amongst member states by almost five per cent. Rising inequality in leading nations has been named as one of the drivers of the financial crisis. High wealth concentration was a destabilising factor in extremely deregulated financial markets.


We should talk more about inequality and we should do so armed with the numbers. An inequality report would do three things. Firstly, it would establish measures for economic inequality in different dimensions such as geography, gender and age. The government can't respond effectively if the problem is not measured, and the community may remain unaware of the extent to which inequality is connected to social and other outcomes. Secondly, it would access the effects of economic inequality on the economy and on individuals. It would ask, 'How mobile we are?' and 'How is inequality affecting people's life chances?' You only have to look in the remote regions of the Northern Territory and the rest of Australia to see how people struggle. Accessing the effects of existing government programs on economic inequality is a critical part of the policy development cycle. And, thirdly, it would access personal struggles with inequality—in particular, as I said, in the Northern Territory. The poorest regions in the Territory also have very high inequality. These are the vast regions that encircle the Darwin area, called Daly, Tiwi, West Arnhem and East Arnhem. Of course, there are regions with varying income levels that also have relatively low inequality ratios—for example, the region of Molonglo in South Canberra.


I have to talk about the gap in child mortality. The target to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018 was certainly not on track last year, and the target to close the gap in life expectancy by 2031 is not on track. Interestingly enough, we're coming up next week to the Closing the gap report on life expectancy, health and education for first nations people in this country. The attendance rate for non-Indigenous students remains steady at 93.1 per cent, but progress will need to accelerate for that target to be met. Halving the gap in employment by 2018 is not on track. As our shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, outlined in his recent book, Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age, it's certainly a remarkable achievement that Australia has maintained a record quarter-century of uninterrupted economic growth, especially when this period contained the greatest global downturn since the Great Depression. However, the gains of this growth are increasingly flowing to the top end of town. We see this way too often.


In the Northern Territory, as a Senator for the Northern Territory, I travel to our remote regions and towns. Equality is absolutely necessary in terms of transportation and access. At this time of year, with the wet season, half of the Northern Territory is impacted quite dramatically by heavy flooding, as we've seen with the evacuation of residents from the Daly River region last week to Darwin. Huge thanks, obviously, to the Northern Territory Emergency Service, Red Cross and other personnel involved with the evacuation.


Again, the measuring of inequality is certainly quite critical for the constituents of ours in the Northern Territory and the remote regions of Australia. I am certainly confident that this bill is a step in the right direction. I commend the bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (10:16):  I rise today to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, a private senator's bill introduced to the Senate by our colleague from New South Wales Senator McAllister. I'm very pleased that Senator McAllister shares the coalition's passion for decreasing inequality in Australia so that all Australians can have a fair go—after all, Australia has long been heralded around the world as the land of the fair go. But what is less pleasing is that Labor would once again commission yet another study into the problem of inequality rather than tackle it head-on.


You see, the Labor Party so often seeks to appear to be taking real steps to solve today's pressing issues, but in reality the Labor Party is unashamedly just sitting on its hands. By contrast, the coalition government is addressing inequality with policies to boost economic growth, general employment and income for hard-working Australians, while targeting assistance to those who need it most. We don't just want to be seen to be doing good; the coalition is actually doing good.


Before I address the substance of this bill, allow me to first highlight what some might view as a glaring flaw in the bill itself. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Senator McAllister's bill links the timing of the reports to the intergenerational reports that are produced by the Parliamentary Budget Office every five years. An inequality report must be tabled, according to this bill, within 15 sitting days of the tabling of an intergeneration report. However, the intergenerational report is produced by Treasury, not by the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is a significant flaw in the bill that we are discussing today. So this bill can't have any effect, because the PBO won't be producing the intergenerational report. Although, undoubtedly, the intent of the bill is sound, it would appear that it was potentially hurriedly prepared—and, let's be frank, it's a politically motivated piece of legislation that would in fact have very little effect.


Australia's tax and transfer system overwhelmingly directs assistance towards those who need it the most. According to the ABS household expenditure survey, the poorest 20 per cent of households, on average, receive welfare payments and social services worth more than eight times that which they pay in taxes. This is evidence of how our social welfare net is working effectively to assist those Australians who need it the most, ensuring that conditions are available for them so that they too can prosper and grow as contributors to our nation's great economy.


Recent data has supported the notion that income inequality outcomes in Australia have in fact continued to improve since the dark days of the global financial crisis, and that's thanks to a strong and resilient economy. For example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey—the HILDA Survey as we know it colloquially—released in June 2016 found that the percentage of Australians in both relative and absolute poverty has in fact fallen since the global financial crisis around 10 years ago. Absolute poverty has in fact decreased substantially, from 12.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent, and relative poverty has similarly decreased from 13 per cent to 10.4 per cent. Furthermore, the HILDA Survey shows that, thanks to a robust economy that facilitates social mobility rather than fosters inequality, most 'poor' households are not persistently poor, and this is particularly important. Half of those who experience poverty over a 10-year period remain in poverty for only one to two years.


In keeping with these findings, the government took steps in the 2017-18 budget to encourage greater workforce participation, and it also protected the welfare system for those who need it the most. Meanwhile, in stark contrast to our own track record, those opposite are talking. They're prevaricating, they're equivocating and, rather than developing a policy, they are commissioning yet another study. I can't believe that the opposition has not learnt from years gone by, and I remind those in the chamber of the years of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In the lead-up to his campaign he promised study after study after study and, as his term as Prime Minister showed, the people of Australia dismissed this as window-dressing. The people of Australia do not want that kind of do-nothing government, big on announcements but devoid of outcomes. Rather, what Australians expect of their government is a government that gets things done, working in a methodical, logical and timely manner to improve the lives of everyday Australians. Alternatively, the coalition government, on the other hand, is doing exactly what coalition governments are expected to do and what they have done since time immemorial—what they have always done. The coalition government is getting on with the job. Our priorities and our policy agenda are to secure the essentials that Australians rely on and to work to reduce the cost-of-living pressures in this country.


I am thankful for the opportunity this private senator's bill provides me to speak a little about the Turnbull coalition government's program to reduce income inequality in this country. One of the coalition's flagship policies is of course the enterprise tax plan. It was justified by a recently released journal study, courtesy of The American Economic Review. According to that study, titled 'Do higher corporate taxes reduce wages? Micro evidence from Germany', higher company taxes in Germany actually led to reduced wages and thus to greater inequality. The study I cite is particularly useful in the Australian context, given the similarity of our labour market to that of Germany. The study finds that workers bear about half of the total tax burden, a figure that is congruous with the 50 per cent corporate burden often quoted by Treasury. Examining administrative linked data from the 18,000 tax changes across 10,000 municipalities in Germany between 1993 and 2012, this study found that higher company taxes in fact reduce wages most for those who need our help most: low-skilled workers, women and younger workers. The study also noted that higher-skilled employees are not affected at all. All of this points to a simple fact: cutting company tax rates improves inequality.


In spite of this, the Labor Party continue to meet our enterprise tax plan with downright hostility, stubbornly dismissing it as trickle-down or neo-Liberal Reaganomics. As the aforementioned study demonstrates, those who the Labor Party purport to look out for the most—women, young workers and low-skilled workers—are those who stand to benefit the most from our enterprise tax plan. That's right: contrary to the member for Maribyrnong, the Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten's assertion that our tax plan is a cut for the top end of town, it is in fact women, young workers and low-skilled workers who are the main beneficiaries of our corporate tax cut. As per usual, the Labor Party are all talk. They pretend to look after the little guy, but, when push comes to shove, all they want to do is bash job-creating companies and look after union cronies. So artificial, in fact, is the Labor Party's concern for hard-working Australians that they refuse to support legislation to ease the tax burden for those who need it most. When will the Labor Party learn that higher taxes of any kind are not the answer? We cannot tax our way to prosperity.


Furthermore, the coalition government's budget repair measures are designed to reduce debt and deficit—a symptom of the addiction to spending that is solely attributable to the Australian Labor Party; an addiction for which all Australians are now paying dearly. Our measures reduce the debt and the deficit; they increase the ability of the government to respond to economic shocks in a way that supports economic growth and employment—two factors that are key in reducing income inequality. As the most recent round of job figures showed, the coalition's policies to increase employment and grow the economy are working consistently and are working effectively, with a record of more than 400,000 jobs created in 2017, of which, I remind the chamber, 300,000 were full-time. And, furthermore, in addition to our strong jobs growth, we have seen rising profitability and a gradual tightening in the labour market as companies are finding it harder to find skilled workers. As such, all the primary drivers of wages growth are now in place, and we expect, as do many prominent economists such as Chris Richardson and Saul Eslake, that the so-called income recession will now come to a rapid end. Attendant on the expected wages growth is swifter budget repair and an end to the crops of debt and deficit sewn and grown by Labor over those six fateful years.


In addition to creating jobs, the government has introduced a range of measures to rein in spending and improve the sustainability of Australia's social safety net—a social safety net of which we are immensely proud—all whilst ensuring that the welfare system remains one of the most precisely targeted in the world. With the support of the Senate, more than $37 billion worth of budget repair measures have already been legislated, including measures from the 2014-15 budget that comprise part of the omnibus savings bill that passed with the support of the opposition, and for that we thank them.


Our 2017-18 budget, building on the success of the omnibus savings bill, seeks to grow the economy to secure more and better-paying jobs—the kinds of jobs that are required, that are necessary, that are fundamental to a 21st century economy. The budget, as expertly put together by the Treasurer, the Hon. Scott Morrison, also guarantees essential government services that Australians rely on, such as Medicare, hospitals and schools, all in spite of the scare campaigns that emanated from those sitting opposite.


Our budget tackles cost-of-living pressures, many of which are the result of the disastrous former Labor government, and, contrary to our predecessors, ensures that the government lives within its means. All of these measures, working in concert with one another, are about continuing to redress inequality and ensuring that there isn't a single Australian who cannot access the assistance that he or she needs, while fostering the prosperity and growth of all Australians.


One of the core features of this coalition government's agenda has been guaranteeing the essentials, protecting and boosting essential services that Australians rely on. As we have endured the so-called income recession, Australians have come to place even greater faith in the government's range of essential services. And so it should be, for the first duty of a government is to protect and keep Australians safe and ensure that critical services they rely on are guaranteed. These services include health care, housing, disability support, education and, in particular, employment. This coalition government is, most importantly, guaranteeing Medicare, making funding fairer for students and sharing the responsibility of our higher education system. 


Our essential services give Australians the security and confidence they need to seize opportunities as they arise. First and foremost, this government is tackling the cost-of-living pressures on Australian households. The 2017-18 budget eases the cost-of-living pressures on Australians and their families particularly in the areas of energy, housing and childcare costs. On the energy front, the National Energy Guarantee, unveiled by the Minister for the Environment and Energy in October last year, will further ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian households, with expected savings of up to $400 per year on their energy bills. The government's energy security plan will help provide reliable and affordable energy for Australians, with practical reforms designed to meet immediate challenges and lay the foundations for our future energy needs. 


Hardworking families have faced increasing childcare fees, with costs growing by 51.7 per cent between 2008 and 2016. This has placed a significant strain on household budgets and presents a hurdle for Australians considering returning to the workforce. To assist around one million hardworking Australian families, the government is investing $37.3 billion over five years through its Jobs for Families Child Care Package, which will help ease the cost-of-living pressures and provide more affordable access to quality child care. 


Australians will also get a better deal from our financial and banking system, with the government giving consumers access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution services—making banks and their executives more accountable and giving consumers greater access to and control over their banking data, empowering them to seek out better and cheaper services. All of these measures are real, genuine and productive steps in making sure that Australia continues to improve on measures of inequality. 


Finally, as part of our commitment to ensuring that all of our older Australians are able to enjoy a comfortable and dignified retirement, the government will reinstate the Pensioner Concession Card for those impacted by the asset test changes introduced in January this year. This will allow an extra 92,000 people to access the discount offered to holders of the Pensioner Concession Card, including subsidised hearing services, offered by the Commonwealth. Furthermore, these people will continue to be able to access discounts offered by the states and territories. 


So it becomes clear that this coalition government is working to redress inequality by guaranteeing essential services, and the most important essential service is Medicare. Contrary to the despicable 'Mediscare' ad campaign run at the last election by the Australian Labor Party, this coalition government can assure all Australians that not only is Medicare here to stay but also it will be significantly strengthened in the future. The government is guaranteeing vital healthcare services, with Commonwealth health funding expected to increase from $75.6 billion in 2017-18 to $82.6 billion in 2020-21. 


The Medicare Guarantee Fund was established on 1 July last year to secure ongoing funding for the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, guaranteeing Australians access to these services and affordable medicines into the future. The fund provides transparency around the cost of running the MBS and the PBS and guarantees the government's commitment to funding affordable health care that all Australians rely on. Not only is Medicare guaranteed but it will be made stronger under this coalition. The government will provide a billion dollars to lift the freeze on the indexation of the MBS, to encourage GPs to bulk-bill children under the age of 16 and concession card holders. Bulk-billing incentives will also be indexed from 1 July 2017.


When the Gillard government introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme to parliament in November 2012, there was only one small problem—it was not fully funded. As they are wont to do, the Labor Party came up with a piece of legislation and passed that legislation but conveniently forgot that it must be paid for at some point if it was ever to become functional. Fortunately now, though, for those Australians who rely on the services provided through the NDIS, the Turnbull government has acted to fully fund the NDIS scheme. If my memory serves me correctly, I also think it was Mr Shorten, who is part of the party which now rejects the true Gonski funding that excludes unfair and special deals for particular education sectors. The Gonski program is also now fully funded.


The only failures, I believe, are those of the Labor Party, who have wrecked and resisted at every step of the way the government's economic plan to repair the budget, grow the economy and create jobs. Our achievements in implementing the national economic plan stand in stark contrast to those opposite, who show no sign of waking up to the economic challenges facing hardworking Australian families and Australian businesses. I thank the chamber for its time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (10:36):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. If you needed any more clear or stark reinforcement of why we on this side, and the Australian people, say that this government is out of touch, you only had to listen to that speech or take it off Hansard because, obviously, the government is living in a different community than we are in Tasmania or in Australia. They just don't understand the difficulties. The reality is that there is greater inequality in this country—much greater than there was when they came to power over four years ago.


I support this bill and I'm very proud to be in a party that is so evidently committed to addressing inequality, one of the greatest social and economic issues facing the nation. The bill amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's function to require consideration of inequality. This bill and fighting inequality are things Labor wholeheartedly supports—unlike those opposite—and, unlike those on the other side, we even acknowledge it. Last year, the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, said inequality hadn't got worse. But it's time to come back to reality. Under the Turnbull government inequality is thriving. Wage growth is at an all-time low. The cost of living is paralysing families. Thousands of vulnerable older Australians can't access care, and the government's health cuts are bankrupting families. Homelessness and housing stress are national crises. Where is the Prime Minister on all of this? He is busy obsessing over his own political woes; he's obsessing about whether he's able to keep his own job. When it comes to the recent polling, we note that No. 26 was rung out this morning—so there are only four more before he reaches Tony Abbott's 30 negative polls, which this Prime Minister used to knife that Prime Minister.


The Prime Minister is so preoccupied he has failed to fulfil one of the biggest obligations that a Prime Minister of this great country has, and that is to know and understand what's happening in our community. He has failed to listen, failed to act and failed to understand what Australia's most vulnerable people are struggling with. Those opposite have taken the low road one too many times, and even their most loyal supporters are turning away. If you were to say to me, Senator Bilyk, that Malcolm Turnbull had a bit of a tough time in 2017, I would give you an award for the understatement of the year, because 2017 was an absolute shocker for the Turnbull government. After a particularly tumultuous year you might have expected them to bunker down and re-emerge in the new year with a resolution to be better and to be different. But 2018 started the same way for the Liberals as 2017 ended—in a complete shambles. From their divisive Trump-style comments about gang violence in Victoria to the delay of the GST report to the revelations that our broadband speeds are now lagging behind Third World countries or the clumsy tirade on China's Pacific affairs, we're seeing more of the same old disorderly government. They've kicked off this year with no direction, no plan and, above all, no narrative.


As a former investment banker, you'd think that Mr Turnbull would have the economic nous to manage the economy and address the cost of living that's paralysing families in this country, in particular those on very limited incomes, such as older Australians. But his elitist approach to economic issues such as tax and housing affordability has created an us-versus-them culture. People are switching off and feeling disenfranchised. In Mr Turnbull's first speech of the year last week he vowed that 2018 would be a year of delivery and that families could look forward to cheaper energy prices and lower childcare costs. What a load of bunk and rot from the Prime Minister.


Last week's Productivity Commission report confirmed that childcare costs continue to skyrocket under the Liberals and that it won't get any better under the government's changes, which won't take effect until 1 July. The Liberals don't support early education or our early educators who do such a critical job. Next month, childcare workers will walk off the job in a bid to raise the industrial-law award wages. This will be the third national walk-off in 12 months, but, again, the Liberals aren't listening. It's not like these early childhood educators want to take these measures, but they are left with no choice. Parents support them; this government ignores them. This says everything about this government's priorities. While Australians have suffered record low wages, it has pursued penalty rate cuts and tax hikes for low- and middle-income earners while cutting tax for millionaires and big business. That's what this government prioritises.


Mr Turnbull is an elitist and the Liberals are so out of touch with the Australian people that it's not funny. From that speech, the first speech in this chamber this year from a Liberal, they've demonstrated very, very clearly that this government still doesn't get it. This government still doesn't understand what's happening in its own community. You might recall on Q&A last year when Mr Turnbull condescendingly asked an audience member to explain how he had disappointed her. How disingenuous can you be? That's the level and mentality of our Prime Minister: too worried about his own job and too big an ego to listen to what's happening in the community. Mr Turnbull has spent most of his life within the top one per cent of wage earners in this country. How can someone who has lived a very privileged life relate to parents who will be trying to balance their family budgets as they buy new school uniforms, school shoes, books and lunch boxes for their kids as they go back to school this week in Tasmania? It's no longer a question of whether Mr Turnbull can relate to the majority of the population, because we all know he can't. The magic number, as I said, of 30 Newspolls has arrived, and no amount of smoke and mirrors can hide the fact that he can neither lead and govern nor close the gap of inequality in this country.


This is a government with the wrong priorities and the wrong vision for Australia. The Prime Minister needs to understand the heartbeat of the country's people. The Prime Minister needs to understand the hardship that's been experienced by so many—too many—in this country. The Prime Minister needs to understand the heartache of parents having to say no to their kids when they can't do music lessons, when they can't do swimming lessons and when they can't dance with their friends. He needs to get real and start showing some heart for Australians who are less fortunate.


Those opposite think that if they give a tax cut to the big end of town, to big business, who do not pay their fair share of tax already, there will be economic growth and jobs created. I'd like to ask the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to explain to me and the Australian people when in history tax cuts for big business have stimulated job creation and caused wage growth. I know he can't answer that, because it hasn't happened. The drivers of an economy are the people. How about you focus on them, Mr Turnbull, just for once?


Last week, Mr Turnbull said that life in Australia was good as a result of the coalition's economic policies and that his government are committed to defending the fair go. That is absolute nonsense. It's rubbish. We heard from a government senator just before I began to speak saying that everything is all right, that they've got everything on track. The problem is that they don't understand and they aren't listening to the Australian people. I don't know who these government senators and members are socialising with or visiting or who the constituents they see in their offices are. Obviously they're very different to the people who have contacted me or the people who have talked to me in the supermarket or around a barbecue over the new year.


The government can never defend the fair go until they change their priorities and policies. They are an arrogant government who are so far out of touch it's not funny. Comments from the Prime Minister that everything's all right and that he's going to defend the fair go reinforce the fact that he just doesn't get it. He doesn't listen or understand what is so evident. He doesn't understand the struggles happening in our suburbs and for the rest of us. The Prime Minister doesn't understand the pressure Australian households are under, and he doesn't care that one in four parents are going without food so that their kids have enough to eat. Instead of focusing on big issues like stagnant wage growth, the rising cost of living, access to affordable health care and housing affordability, we've seen a government fixated on itself. It's comments like those from the Prime Minister which reinforce that the government don't understand and that they haven't been listening.


There are so many people in our communities who have legitimate concerns. Most Australians are focused on putting food on the table, paying their bills, paying their mortgage or paying their rent. But this government is too preoccupied with satisfying millionaires and the big end of town. There are single mums and single dads who are trying to make ends meet by having two jobs. They are also many, many two-income families who are still under increasing financial pressure, and that puts enormous pressure and stress on these families and individuals. Mothers and fathers have lost their jobs because industry is under pressure and government has not reacted fast enough.


And then there are the older Australians, the people forgotten by those opposite. We know the crisis confronting older Australians in this country. It's financial, but it's also about care. It's about the 100,000-plus people who are still waiting to get a home-care package, to get assistance to stay in their homes. Let's face it—we all know that the best place for older people to age is in their own homes. It's also a lot less expensive for every government to have people stay in their own homes. Let's not forget that. They still pay their rates. They still have to pay their own hydro bills and their heating and energy costs. So the least that this government can do is to ensure that older Australians who need assistance to stay at home, to live safely and have the dignity and respect they have earned, get it. But this government has failed.


It's not just this government. We remember the Howard days. They were in government for 11½ years and, even though people thought that John Howard was a man of the people and the man of the poor, he always failed to deliver for older Australians. And this government is no better. There are older Australians in my home state of Tasmania who are forced to wait in ambulances or in queues at emergency departments because there are not enough beds in the hospitals. We know that, in Tasmania, older people have been left on the floor in accident and emergency departments. Why? Because the Liberal state government and the Turnbull Liberal federal government have cut funding to health. The Tasmanian health system is in crisis. Only last week, the head of surgery at the Launceston General Hospital resigned because he couldn't reach an agreement with the minister and the government of the day. He left because they took away all his power to make decisions. That's the calibre of Liberals when it comes to health care in this country.


There's never been a more important time for government to be actively promoting equality of opportunity than now. It's in our national interest. The people are sick of hearing those opposite bang on about their sterile, unrealistic slogans, such as 'jobs and growth' and the 'innovation agenda' and the empty rhetoric of trickle-down economics. I don't have an economics degree, but I do know maths and I do know the numbers. I know the number of people who are still trying to get jobs in this country and the number of people who are doing it really tough in this country, and trickle-down economics will not change our economy for the better for those people who need it most.


We need a renewed debate on the role of government in reducing inequality—something that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, continued last week. This brings me to the contrast between Labor and the Liberals. Of Australia's two viable governing parties, only one has a policy approach that will defend opportunities—the Australian Labor Party. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, outlined Labor's vision for 2018 for a fairer, stronger and more inclusive Australia. The contrast between Mr Shorten's and Mr Turnbull's first speeches for 2018 couldn't be more stark. Mr Turnbull used his speech last week to cement the fact that he is the ultimate hollow man of Australian politics. As my colleague Mr Chris Bowen said, 'Malcolm Turnbull talking about income tax cuts is like the English cricket team bragging about winning the Ashes.'


Malcolm Turnbull, in his Toowoomba declaration last week, bragged that he will cut taxes for Australians, when he's increasing the taxes of seven million Australians. The fact is that Malcolm Turnbull is increasing taxes for seven million Australians so that he can cut taxes for multinationals and millionaires. He wants a medal for saying that he might cut taxes, when we know that he is, in fact, increasing them. Under Mr Turnbull's tax increase, someone earning $60,000 gets a tax hike of $300 a year. Meanwhile, he's giving millionaires a tax cut of $16,400 a year and big businesses a tax cut of $65 billion. If Mr Turnbull was really fair dinkum about tax, he would drop his tax increases. All his talk and jibe about tax increases when all this government wants to do is increase tax through the Medicare levy is just hollow rhetoric.


Fact: this is a government that wants to increase income tax, and the Labor Party stands against it in this place. Fact: the only thing stopping Australians earning less than $87,000 a year paying more income tax today is Bill Shorten and the Labor Party's opposition to this government's ridiculous policy. Fact: the Liberals are so delusional and out of touch they think that, if they give a $65 billion tax cut to big business, who do not pay their fair share of tax now, there will be economic growth and jobs will be created.


I could go on and on about the inequality in this country and the fact that this government is still out of touch. Inequality in Tasmania is already impacting many households, as I said earlier. We in Tasmania already experience high levels of inequality and underemployment. In fact, nearly 40 per cent of Tasmanians receive some form of government benefit. This is well above the national average. We know that Mr Turnbull doesn't like Tasmania because we didn't support him; we didn't vote for him at the last election. But he still has to respond to the desires and ambitions of all members of this country, including Tasmanians.


Most income in Tasmania is generated from wages and salaries. Other income is produced in the form of pensions and child payments. However, all income is then further reduced by taxation and other increasing costs. Any impact on our income stream, such as the Turnbull government's cut to penalty rates further, reduces our ability to support normal basic living costs, education and health. Clearly with this low wage growth any rise in unemployment in Tasmania will lead to defaults on mortgages and consumer loans and could have catastrophic results for our state. We have already lost 4,700 jobs in the last 11 months. We cannot afford for this to continue under Malcolm Turnbull or the Liberal state government of Tasmania. We need action. We need leadership. I know I'm asking too much when I ask to have leadership from this Prime Minister, but the Australian people deserve nothing less.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:56):  In December 2014 this Senate brought down a report with the title Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia: the extent of income inequality in our nation. It was a very concerning report, for the very reason that we had seen that the issue of inequality—we're talking about 2014—had been discussed both in our own community and internationally and that a range of recommendations and issues had arisen that focused on exactly what the issues around inequality were. As you know, our process of developing reports includes taking evidence from a range of experts across the nation and, most importantly I think, having the opportunity to visit communities all around our nation and to listen to people who genuinely care about their lives, about their communities and, in this case, about what they perceived as genuine inequality—a situation in which our nation was actually not responding to fairness, not actually going forward with equality but identifying a clear danger that the inequality would impel our society and our community as we knew it.


Well, the report came down, and a number of recommendations were made. I know many people in this place made contributions to the debate, and several months later the government responded and said that in fact there wasn't inequality in Australia. The government's response to that was particularly concerning because it went back over so many of the arguments we've already heard in this place, which were simplistic, and came up with simple answers, saying things like, 'Well, it's not as bad as it used to be' and 'If we get the budget right it will improve' and various other things. I'm not trying to verbal the government, but I'm trying to encourage people who are interested in this topic to go back and have a look at the build-up of evidence, community concern and personal stories showing how people feel about their lives and whether or not they believe that things in fact are equal and whether it's getting better.


So, this report came down. Within that report was a particularly worthy piece of documentation provided by Professors Peter Whiteford and Andrew Podger, which was a graph—and we had many, many graphs in this report—showing results of selected studies of inequality in Australia. It didn't go back to Federation, although it possibly could have. Nonetheless, it took a time frame and gave us a bottom line about which we could have our discussions and look into what we should do next. It began with the Bradbury study in 1992 and then went through over 30 studies up to Bray in 2014. It gave a synopsis about whether or not these reports indicated growing inequality. The reports all looked at our community—not the world, not the international aspects, but what was happening in our own communities. They consistently said that there were serious concerns. I will quote from the ABS's Survey of Income and Housing—and it's a long one which sounds like economics, which is not my strength, but I'm going to put it on the record:


While the mean household net worth of all households in Australia in 2011-12 was $728,000, the median (i.e. the mid-point when all households are ranked in ascending order of net worth) was substantially lower at $434,000 … This difference reflects the asymmetric distribution of wealth between households, where a relatively small number of households had high net worth and a relatively large number of households had low net worth …


This was then illustrated in a series of graphs that came after. The survey went on to focus clearly, and I have deliberately made that quote because we're looking at people who had income, who had strong income, as I noted. We weren't talking about the gap between the wealthiest and least wealthy—those who are very poor in our society—which is sometimes where this debate focuses, showing that great gap. It talked about people who were already in income-solid families and showed how that inequality had increased. However, it went on to show stats, which I know have been quoted in this debate, that over 1.2 million households, which is 14 per cent of our community, had net worth of less than $50,000, with 114 of those households having negative net worth—one per cent of all households. That's where it really hits home, where, despite many protestations made over many years, there is clear acknowledgment that there are people living in our community, who are our neighbours, who have not only limited income but negative net worth. 


Discussions around inequality and income often degenerate into a war of graphs and statistics, and I'm not saying that that is always bad. It's important to understand the statisticians' information, and that we have very clear data—and I'll come back to that later. In the Australian context, we have a range of academic institutions that look carefully at what's happening in our communities and a number of universities have very strong research areas that follow the economic inequalities and livelihoods of Australians. 


The key Australian Bureau of Statistics data came out of two surveys: the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, the HILDA; and the Survey of Income and Housing, the SIH. These surveys provide ongoing statistics that look at what is happening in our community, and it's on that basis that Treasury also make statements about income such as the one I read earlier. 


The whole reason we're having this discussion about this piece of legislation is that we want the Productivity Commission, which is an economic based organisation that lives and breathes statistics and how the economic process impacts on our community, to have a more regular high-profile role in looking at exactly what's happening in inequality in Australia, and putting it to the forefront so that not only does it review these issues but, as often with productivity reports, they come back consistently to the parliament so that parliamentarians are able to discuss what the recommendations and findings of those reports are. The core issue is then to turn that into effective responsive policy. So, where we identify inequality, we're able to consider the reasons for the inequality and access the information that we have across the board. We can then look at how we can develop policy that identifies where people are in need and where people are not benefiting from other advances that are going on in our economy and respond to that. That is the job of policy development, and Senator McAllister's bill makes sure that we have that front of mind and integrally linked to the development of all policy that comes from what's happening in our community. 


We know that we have data. We know that we have information, but I'm particularly keen for people who may be interested in this issue to have a look at Senate committee reports such as Bridging our growing divide: inequality inAustralia and many others that have come here. We have talked many times about individual areas that are disadvantaged and the particular problems some of our community have with getting solid financial security.


Beyond the statistics are the kinds of issues about which Senator Polley was talking. They're the people who have actually had the courage to come and talk with their parliamentary representatives about what's important to them and—sometimes with absolutely admirable courage and devastating honesty—talked to us about the terrible things that have happened in their personal lives and in their communities which have caused them to have the serious inequality issues that have brought them to talk to us. Whilst the 2014 report does not in a final report give a lot of data from communities and from representatives, when people who are interested go into the parliamentary records, read the submissions that people have provided and read the Hansard records of the public hearings, that's when the faces, the families, the immediate impact of financial insecurity and the growing inequality—and I state clearly that it is growing inequality—in our community become most real.


Senator Polley listed a number of gut-wrenching examples in her contribution. I refer meanwhile to the 2014 report, where we have the particular identification of sectors of our community who are most vulnerable. At the moment, one of the areas that is causing a great deal of distress for many of us is ongoing discussion with people who have disabilities and the impact of the absolutely clear evidence that shows that, for people with disabilities, the whole range—their income earning capacity, their livelihoods, their ability to have effective housing and education—is negatively impacted. The contrast between those families that are working with disability and those that are not is a clear area where there is need for effective policy to respond to that and acknowledgment that that is an area of need.


Chapter 4 of the 2014 report looks at particular areas. I want to pick up on one area about which I have spoken many times in this place: people with mental illness. The National mental health report 2013 said:


2‑3% of Australians – around 600,000 people – have severe disorders …


…   …   …


Another 4‑6% of the population (approximately 1 million people) have moderate disorders, and a further 9‑12% (approximately 2 million people) have mild disorders.


The committee recommendations go on to say there's a strong correlation between homelessness and poorer health and wellbeing, especially in relation to mental health. The rates of labour force participation are impacted, and Mr Fear went on to say we know that only about 38 per cent of people with mental illness work full time, compared to 55 per cent of the rest of the population. He goes on to talk about the issues with Newstart and Centrelink. We have much more in terms of other areas, particularly regional disadvantage.


Many years ago there was a report put out that Wayne Swan was involved in which looked at postcodes. If you look at postcodes across Australia, you can zero in and see significant contrast between various postcodes in our community with regard to financial security, access to health and access to employment. That is a clear sign to all of us in this place that we have to acknowledge that inequality exists. We need to acknowledge that not everyone has been advantaged by the statements that have been made about the strength of the economy over many years. We do acknowledge there has been increased wealth, but acknowledging there's increased wealth does not remove the reality that there are people who have not been benefiting from these advances. We shouldn't run away from that, we should try very hard not to allocate blame about that and we should look at how we, working as a parliament, can respond to it most effectively.


At the moment there are a number of issues pulling together that give us in Australia, in our parliament, a very clear encouragement and opportunity to respond to the recommendation from the 2014 Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia report. It called for us to take the issue seriously and look at having a report to parliament about what is happening in our community. That's what Senator McAllister's private member's bill has done in recommending the Productivity Commission amendment.


Also, internationally—and I've spoken about this many times in the parliament—the world has made an agreement, across all continents and in all countries, that we can identify inequality in our own areas and then work together to respond to that. The Sustainable Development Goal: Agenda 2030 looks at reducing poverty and, most importantly, at how our communities can ensure absolutely—and this is the theme that we should all hold dear to our hearts—that no matter what policies are introduced or what happens in the economies, we are going to leave no-one behind. This, to me, sums up the debate around inequality. If we had genuine commitment to effective policy development in our country as we moved our policies forward, as we looked at responding to the various pressures that impact on our nation and if we genuinely made a commitment that we would develop policy that would leave no-one behind, we would not only be ensuring that inequality would be reduced but we would also be acknowledging that people need to have that security—that we can, in fact, have a 'leave no-one behind' agenda.


There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but the first one is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. I know that's a challenge, but if we're looking at genuine equality we would be looking at removing poverty. The subclauses of goal 1, to end poverty in all its forms, go through the various things that were defined four years ago when we were looking at the evidence around developing the inequality report. We were looking at ending hunger and ensuring food security. There is devastating evidence in the 2014 report that talks about hunger in Australia and the impact that we're having in terms of food banks and kitchens which are being developed to ensure that people in our streets, in our communities, are not going without meals. I'll refer anyone who's interested in this situation to the evidence that was received there.


I think that sometimes we become very comfortable. In our own lives, we become extremely comfortable. When we hear about world poverty, we immediately think of something overseas—devastating malnutrition and things in our Pacific neighbours' countries, as Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells would understand. We don't think about our next-door neighbour in our own street in our own community, but the evidence we have from people who work in food kitchens and food banks indicate that there is poverty in Australia. If we're going to make an international commitment on the world stage to end poverty, that should mean everywhere. We should be looking at the data, the information and the people who are suffering from poverty, malnutrition and a lack of security in our own communities. In looking at that part of the Sustainable Development Goals, immediately we have a responsibility domestically as well as internationally. If we are to respond effectively to the Sustainable Development Goal: Agenda 2030, to which our country has signed up and about which we're going to make our first report back to the UN this year, we need to ensure that the data collection, information and education processes within Australia are addressing the identified issues of inequality, which are the same here as they are overseas.


They may well have lesser impact here. I'm not making a claim that Australia has the same desperate poverty as places that are suffering drought and famine, like central West Africa. I'm not making that claim. But I'm saying there is genuine inequality in our communities and we need to identify and address that, and then, as part of our genuine commitment to ending poverty in all its forms—to leaving no-one behind—we address openly what's happening in our own communities, using the data sources that we have. We have enviable data sources. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is seen as an international expert in looking at data collection, and one of the things we're going to be doing as part of the 2030 agenda is sharing our knowledge in this space with other countries. So let's use that effectively within our own community: address hunger, address homelessness, address housing shortages, address health shortages, address the environmental impacts of disasters and address what is happening in our own community overall—which is causing people to feel they're not respected and that they are not sharing the increasing wealth of our nation. 


That's the hint of inequality. We have the opportunity to do something about it. We shouldn't dismiss it. We shouldn't pretend it doesn't exist or make comparisons showing that everyone is doing better so, therefore, everyone is okay. That's clearly not the case. When you hear people talking about their own experiences, they don't feel as though everyone is doing okay, and we have the capacity, as a nation, to respond. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (11:15):  I'd like to start by thanking Senator McAllister for introducing the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 to the Senate. The provisions in the bill go to the heart of Australian values. There's no doubt that Australia is a prosperous country, but we're also a country that prides itself on compassion and egalitarianism. The principle of equality of opportunity—that old 'fair go' as most Australians call it—is a core Australian value. 


This bill would ensure that the Productivity Commission, one of the key drivers of public policy development in Australia, takes account of this core value when it provides advice to government. The bill will achieve this in two ways. Firstly, it will amend section 8 of the Productivity Commission Act 1988 to add: 


… the need to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.


That would be added to the Productivity Commission's policy guidelines. This will ensure that as well as important considerations such as economic growth, industry performance, employment and regional development, the important Australian principle of the fair go is taken into account in the commission's work. The inclusion of inequality in the commission's policy guidelines has a great deal of potential to guide Australia's response to the issue. After all, while the Productivity Commission is an advisory body, their advice is given significant weight when it comes to devising public policy. 


An example of that, as we have seen recently, is the Fair Work Commission's reliance on the Productivity Commission's report in their recent decision on penalty rates. It would be an interesting exercise to consider how the Productivity Commission's advice on penalty rate cuts for some of Australia's lowest-paid workers might have looked had they been required to take inequality into account. 


The bill will also require the Productivity Commission to publish a report every five years on the extent of inequality in Australia. And this five-year cycle will be the same as that for the intergenerational reports produced by the Parliamentary Budget Office. We only have to look at the contribution of the intergenerational reports to public policy debate to get an idea of the potential impact these reports could have on shaping government's response to inequality. 


What is proposed in this bill should really be uncontroversial, yet we have heard from senators on the other side of the chamber who speak in opposition to this bill. I really am a bit perplexed as to why they do that. On the airwaves, we heard the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, and the finance minister, Senator Cormann, deny that there has been a growth in income inequality in Australia. I am not sure what planet they are on, but it surely is not the same as the planet I'm on. Do those opposite truly and honestly believe that inequality isn't growing? If they do, surely they wouldn't have an objection to an independent report from a respected body like the Productivity Commission that could confirm this and settle the manner once and for all—unless of course they don't actually believe it. The fact is that those opposite know; they know that inequality is growing in Australia. And they know that the policies of their government are contributing to that, but they're obviously embarrassed to admit it. 


The government's denial of growth in income inequality is contrary to the recent evidence. In October last year, the International Monetary Fund said that Australia was among the countries with the highest growth in income inequality. And the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia—or HILDA, as we commonly refer to it—report, released in August last year, shows that following the election of the Abbott government, household incomes started to decline in real terms. The HILDA survey found childcare costs were soaring—I think most of us know that!—particularly for low- and middle-income families, and stated these may be 'acting to increase inequality'. It also found that mortgages for young Australians aged 18 to 39 had more than doubled since 2002. And no more starkly has Australia's growing income inequality been laid bare than in a recent report from Oxfam Australia.


Over the decade since the global financial crisis, the wealth of Australia's billionaires has grown by 140 per cent—140 per cent! But at the same time, average wages have increased by 36 per cent and household wealth by only 12 per cent. The top 10 per cent of Australians own more than half of Australia's wealth, whereas the bottom 10 per cent own only 0.2 per cent. We also had a report in December last year from the Victoria University Centre of Policy Studies, which found that not only had wages growth hit record lows but the wages of the lowest-paid workers had not grown at all. A report in August last year on the Australian Digital Inclusion Index found there was a growing divide between the digital inclusion of people in high- and low-income households.


It's a matter of national shame, I believe, that in a country that is one of the most prosperous in the world in terms of average incomes we have three million Australians, including more than 700,000 children, who live below the poverty line. How can anyone deny that there's a problem with inequality in Australia when we have the 12th highest GDP per capita yet so many Australians living in poverty? But those opposite continue to bury their heads in the sand and deny that there's a problem when it comes to inequality—either that, or it suits them to deny there's a problem because it's their regressive policies that are contributing to the growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. Those on this side of the chamber, when we stand up for equality and fairness, often get accused by government senators of waging class warfare or the politics of envy. If there's one thing those opposite can be trusted to do and do well, it's to turn supporting fairness into a negative.


I want everyone to understand: the term 'class warfare' is just a clever way of ascribing a negative connotation to what is no more than advocating for a more just and equal society. That's what we on this side of the chamber do. Labor believes in fairness, believes in egalitarianism and believes these are values that Australians also hold dear.


As I've said time and time again in this place, the real class war is that being waged by the Turnbull government. It's being waged against the vulnerable and the disadvantaged on behalf of big business. And yet when Labor stands up for disadvantaged Australians it gets accused of starting the so-called class war that those opposite have been perpetuating for decades.


We have seen time and time again the government use their policies to target people on low and middle incomes. Just last year, the government cut $1.5 billion in family tax benefit part A, affecting 600,000 families. They have implemented changes to child care, which will make 279,000 families worse off from July this year. And, in a dodgy deal with the Greens, they made cuts to pensions that see some pensioners worse off by up to $14,000 a year. And this government also, through their so-called Gonski 2.0 education funding changes, will rip billions of dollars out of schools, including $68 million from schools in my home state of Tasmania over the next two years. This is on top of the billions the Abbott and Turnbull governments have already cut from education and health. Australia's access to affordable health care has been further exacerbated by the government's Medicare rebate freeze, which is making it harder and harder for low- and middle-income Australians to even see a doctor. 


It's also worth mentioning the sustained attacks by the Liberals on superannuation. Under Labor a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee was due to commence in 2019, yet under this government the superannuation guarantee remains stuck at 9.5 per cent. Now it's going after the governance of industry super funds, despite those funds providing substantially better returns for Australian workers.


Sadly, while this government continues to attack low-income earners with its policies, it looks after its mates at the big end of town. Mr Turnbull has given a $16,500 tax cut to millionaires, and he's going to give away $65 billion of tax cuts to big business without any evidence that it will have a commensurate economic benefit.


We also have the consequences of inequality, which this government has failed to take any action to address. We have falling rates of home ownership amongst young Australians, who are finding it more and more difficult to get into the housing market. We also know that wages growth has slowed to a crawl, and this is eating into the incomes of ordinary Australian families. Wages growth is now at its lowest level in 20 years and has failed to keep pace with growth in the economy or company profits. Labour productivity has grown by 20 per cent over the last decade, but at the same time there has only been a six per cent growth in real wages—that is, less than one-third of the growth in labour productivity.


As an aside, there are a number of people in this room at this moment who have worked in the union movement—and I think we're all proud to have been union industrial officers or organisers or whatever role we held there, even though those on the other side tend to think there's a negative in that—and it's interesting to note that stagnation in wages growth appears to come at a time when the number of enterprise agreements is falling. But what do we get from the other side? Instead of trying to strengthen the enterprise bargaining system, we've got a government that's doing the bidding of its mates in big business and attacking trade unions at every single turn.


It's bad enough that more and more workers are being stuck on award wages, but many are also being exploited and underpaid. It reminds me of the rip-offs in the 7-Eleven, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Caltex, Bakers Delight franchises—and the list goes on—all the areas exposed by Four Corners.


We all know this government has done nothing—not a thing—to address sham contracting or the use of labour hire arrangements to undermine the pay and conditions of workers. The government has stood by while a pay cut of up to $77 a week has been delivered to 700,000 of Australia's lowest-paid workers.


Late last year there was an opportunity to restore these penalty rates. Mr Christensen had promised he would vote to restore penalty rates, but, sadly, he reneged. He did this spectacular backflip and, amazingly, he voted against a Labor amendment that echoed the provisions of his own bill. Unlike those opposite, Labor will continue to fight for low-paid hospitality and retail workers and the penalty rates that they rely on.


The other issue I'm reminded of, as I speak today about the policy failures of this government in regard to tackling inequality, is of course its lack of action when it comes to multinational tax avoidance. I've said this several times in this place before: not only has this government failed to take real action on multinational tax avoidance; when they came to power they set about reversing a number of Labor's reforms. Our legislation to plug loopholes in Australia's transfer pricing rules and anti-avoidance provisions and to crack down on companies overvaluing assets in international transactions was wound back by this government, handing back more than a billion dollars to multinational companies.


While this government has been crying about their own anti-avoidance laws, the Australian Taxation Office confirmed in the last round of Senate estimates that those laws had not netted a single dollar from multinational tax dodgers. In fact, much of the money that has been clawed back by the tax office was thanks to anti-avoidance laws introduced under Labor, which the Liberals of course opposed. It's pretty shocking, I feel, that more than one-third of large firms and multinationals pay no tax whatsoever, according to the most recent data.


Another failure that we've debated extensively is the failure of the government to crack down on bad behaviour by Australia's banks and financial institutions. I don't know how many years and how many hundreds of stories of inappropriate lending, loan fraud, bad advice and unfairly declined insurance claims the government had to hear before they finally—quite belatedly but finally—backflipped and accepted the need for a royal commission into the banks. They were dragged kicking and screaming into accepting that there was a need for a royal commission into the banks.


Yet another area where the government has failed to act is the use of discretionary trusts to split income and minimise tax. This is a mechanism used mostly by affluent households, and something which Labor has plans to address. Our policy is quite well targeted, in fact, and will not affect charitable trusts, deceased estates or people who work in or run a small business.


It's clear that Labor is serious about tackling inequality, while those opposite are not. While tackling growing inequality is a worthwhile end in itself, we should also recognise that there are other benefits. Often the debate around income inequality is framed as balancing it against the need for economic growth, but that is a completely false dichotomy. Analysis conducted by the OECD back in 2014 found that countries where income inequality is decreasing have faster economic growth than those where it's increasing. This is a view backed up by Nobel Prize winning economist Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who explained that low-income earners tend to spend a larger proportion of their income, thereby stimulating the economy. Inequality, Stiglitz argues, leads to lower consumption and weaker aggregate demand. This argument overturns the whole theory of trickle-down economics that we keep hearing from the other side, to which conservative governments tend to subscribe. Really, there's no proof that it works, but it suits those on the other side to use this process.


Of course, the other positive outcome of addressing inequality is improving people's access to economic opportunities. My colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Dr Andrew Leigh, looked at this in 2009 as a researcher. Dr Leigh and his associates found that, in the 10 countries they studied, social mobility and equality of opportunity went down as income inequality went up. Social mobility and equality of opportunity decrease as income inequality increases. To be honest, this isn't rocket science. It stands to reason that the more resources you have, the more opportunities you have to further yourself. If child care is available and affordable, you can afford to take up regular employment. If primary health care is affordable, you're more likely to avoid the consequences of chronic health conditions. If education is affordable, you have more opportunity to further your career prospects.


As I've said, this bill should not be seen as controversial. It makes sense, if the Productivity Commission is going to take into account such things as ecological sustainability and regional development, that inequality should also be on that list. We know how important the work of the Productivity Commission is in providing advice on driving industry productivity and improving the performance of the economy as a whole. But—and this is what people really need to think about—without this legislation, put forward by my colleague Senator McAllister, we are relying entirely on the private sector for advice about inequality in Australia, because there is no mechanism that compels federal government to routinely examine inequality. This bill provides such a mechanism and makes it far more difficult for any government to avoid the uncomfortable question of whether income inequality in Australia is getting better or worse. This question, of course, is one that would be particularly uncomfortable for the present government, which explains why they are so opposed to this bill. The government, through their actions in some areas and inaction in others, are contributing to worsening inequality in Australia. It is therefore hardly surprising that they oppose measures that would help put a spotlight on inequality. This is just another sign of a government that is becoming increasingly out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians.


What those opposite don't like about this bill is, if the Productivity Commission advice for tackling inequality were to be added, it would place public pressure on the government to actually address the problem. Taking serious action to address inequality goes against the philosophy of those opposite. They hate to admit this, of course, because they know it's not a view shared by most Australians who believe in the fair go. The Liberals believe it is the responsibility of the individual, not society, to further themselves. Rather than it being your circumstances, your resources and your opportunities that influence your outcomes, they believe it is your own personal failure if you can't achieve success in life. This is a party that subscribes to the flawed notion of trickle-down economics, and its members honestly believe tax cuts to millionaires and big business will drive job creation and economic growth rather than just line the pockets of already wealthy executives.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  I rise to make a contribution to Senator McAllister's private member's Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. Inequality is rife in Australia. On this first occasion following the Christmas break, we have to talk about that very expensive and very colourful shirt the Prime Minister wore to a Christmas event in Sydney. The Prime Minister, lit up like a Christmas tree, showed up in a shirt that cost over $700 to feed the most marginalised and most disadvantaged. I think we're going to struggle to find an image in the course of 2018 that shows more powerfully how completely and totally out of touch with the Australian people this Prime Minister is. And it's not just the Prime Minister; the entire party that he represents is in a permanent mismatch between the lived experience of ordinary Australians who are struggling under the burden of increasing inequality and themselves, which is a hallmark of this government. Private members' bill debates, let's face it, in the Senate, do not always attract a great deal of attention. But this bill is actually a very important piece of legislation that, if enacted, has the potential to readdress a very significant flaw in the way in which the Productivity Commission looks at the plight of Australians, and that's why I applaud it.


Senator McAllister's bill would require the Productivity Commission to take inequality into account in the exercise of its functions. It is very important that it does, given the nature of our current society. The reality is, at the moment, it's impossible for it to do that because it is simply not enabled by the current legislative frame. The bill would also require the commission to undertake work to regularly report on the extent of inequality in Australia and its effects on the Australian economy and community. I want to endorse and echo all of the sentiments that were expressed by Senator Bilyk, in particular, her comments around the bifurcation that exists with those who are running businesses getting an advantage from driving wages down and increasing inequality. We know Henry Ford a long, long time ago doubled the wages of his employees so that they would have sufficient disposable income to be able to go out, save, and envision that they might too buy a model T Ford and that's exactly what happened. The reality is people have been cut to the bone in the amount of money they have at their disposal to purchase in their local community.


As a senator who lives on the Central Coast, who is happy to represent the whole of New South Wales, I will speak to the reality of families I met over the Christmas break on the Central Coast who were talking about how difficult it is to get their kids in uniform and back to school because they are so stretched. Energy costs, under the government of the Liberal Party at both federal and state level, have left New South Wales residents in a terrible state. The financial burden of those costs is making it very, very difficult for them to even get their kids off to a good start at the beginning of school—and I hope that I'll have sufficient time to make some remarks about the terrible cuts to school funding that are entrenching inequality into the future. But let me be clear: this issue of inequality should be at the forefront of economic debate, because inequality absolutely adversely affects economic growth and the quality of life of all Australians. 


Senator McAllister's bill embodies core Labor values and reflects what would be the priorities of a Shorten Labor government—to deal with the reality that confronts ordinary, hardworking Australians, not the privileged few who have friends in the top end of town and can afford shirts that are worth $700. It is the Australian Labor Party that is committed to tackling the most significant social, moral and economic problems of our time, and inequality is right at the heart of a core problem for this nation. 


Australians, perhaps in the course of this year, or certainly in the year following, will have a clear choice: a Labor Party that understands and accepts—and is willing to make policy to address—the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country, a Labor Party that's committed to closing the gap, a Labor Party that contrasts with an out-of-touch Liberal government that doesn't see the inequality that it is itself creating and doesn't see inequality as an issue at all. We need a party that is committed to helping all Australians, not just the top end of town to the exclusion of all others. 


Just last week, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, delivered speeches that set the scene and revealed their priorities. The contrast between the two could not have been any clearer. Not once in his major address last week did the Prime Minister mention the word 'inequality'—not once. He doesn't see it. He doesn't get it. This is despite the fact that inequality on his watch is rising to levels that we have not seen in around 75 years. The Prime Minister didn't mention cost of living either, and only once in his entire speech did he discuss wages. This is despite the reality that Australia's record low wage growth is now at around two per cent and despite the latest cost-of-living figures showing that the cost of essential items is crushing Australian families. 


I mentioned electricity, for example. The latest figures from the ABS tell us that electricity costs grew around six times more than wages. No wonder people on the coast and across the great state of New South Wales are feeling the pinch in their pocket, while the Liberal Party continues as if nothing is going wrong. This means that Australians are struggling to keep the lights on. Instead of recognising this reality, the Prime Minister stated that he will 'continue to put downward pressure on energy prices'. If he's going to continue what he is doing, he should at least be honest about what he is doing, which is putting upward pressure on prices. A failure of policy in this area is impacting every hardworking Australian. Take fuel, for another example. Fuel costs grew more than five times the growth in wages, and that means Australians are struggling to pay for petrol for their cars. The situation is not much better for health and education. The cost of hospital services and secondary education grew by more than double wages. Australians are struggling to pay for necessary health treatments and to send their children to school. 


I visited rural New South Wales last year, where families in Cobar were speaking about the extraordinary cost of putting petrol in their cars to get to the health services that they need to access. As a senator for Western Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you know more than many this reality for people in regional Australia. The cost of health in the city is already a very big barrier for people, who are trying to get to a doctor just down the road, where they might be able to get public transport. Add to that, in the regions and the remote parts of Australia, the additional cost of putting petrol in your car—a cost that's risen at five times the rate of wage growth—and we've got a burden that's growing in an extraordinary way in the parts of this country that are supposed to be represented by the National Party, who are meek and mild here in the parliament and do not stand up for the people whose voice they claim they have. They do not fight for fairness for those from the regions. 


Instead of discussing the struggles of everyday Australians of this kind, the Prime Minister's speech was focused on spruiking his $65 billion handout to multinationals and big business—$65 billion—while he's cutting funding from health and education and watching on and doing nothing about a failure of wage growth that's impacting every family pay packet that will be going home this week. 


In 2018, the Turnbull government has learnt nothing. They're still fighting to protect that well-worn trickle-down economic agenda that they have so wedded themselves to. Policymakers worldwide know it's not working. Giving money to those who have the most and waiting for it to trickle down to the poor is a lovely notion that's been totally discounted by all economists worth their salt. Yet this government and a Prime Minister wearing that shirt on Christmas Day, insulting the group of people whom he was meeting that day, are completely out of touch with what's going on. 


In contrast, Bill Shorten was focused on inequality, and Labor promises to deliver better wages for working Australians. This is because Labor's listening. Labor's heard time and time again from hardworking Australian men and women that they're struggling with record low wage growth and rising cost-of-living pressures. 


Just yesterday, with regard to private health insurance, Labor made a very, very important announcement that we will cap the premium increases at two per cent in the first two years and also task the Productivity Commission with the biggest review of the industry in 20 years to improve the quality, value and affordability of private health insurance. It might not mean much to someone who can afford a $700 shirt, but most Australians are not getting the value from putting our money into private health insurance that they once were. Labor understands this, and that's why we want to take some of the pressure off families. 


The reality is that, under Prime Ministers Abbott and Turnbull, average premiums have risen by 27 per cent while we've got the lowest wage growth in 75 years. So, families now, under this Liberal government who says they're looking after ordinary working Australians, are paying over $1,000 a year more than when the Liberals were elected—$1,000. That's a lot of money in any person's language. But, for the people in the seat of Robertson where I live, $1,000, I know, is a life-changing amount of money that I'd rather see in their pockets than in private health insurance. 


According to Oxfam last year, Australia's 33 billionaires increased their wealth by $38 billion while the growth in wages for hardworking Australians hit record lows. And this is what we've seen under the Abbott-Turnbull government: time and time again, millionaires, billionaires and multinationals continue to increase their wealth and their profits while the ordinary hardworking Australian misses out. 


Australian men and women are struggling to make a decent living. They're tired of the anxiety that's associated with insecure work and the rise of casualisation, and more so than ever. This is certainly not their fault. Australia has been described internationally—and we still hold onto this view of ourselves—as the land of opportunity, but fighting for equality of opportunity and social mobility is a fight that must continue every day, and it's certainly a fight that Labor is willing to take up to this government on their watch. 


Research by the McKell Institute tells us that where you live is more likely than ever to determine your income. I grew up in an Australia where it was about how much passion you had to get out and use your talents and abilities that was going to give you opportunities. It used to be that you could get an education at any school across this country and you had a chance. But not under this government. Access to health services and education services and opportunities are dividing us like they have never divided us before. The rich are getting richer and richer by the day; those who are at the edge are being forced and forced and forced downwards.


 Location—not your level of education—playing a large role in determining your income is not the sort of Australia that I want to be a part of. Under the Turnbull government's watch, there is no longer an opportunity for people to make their way out of difficult situations. There have been $65 million tax cuts for multinationals, billionaires and the banks. We know that there was a $16,400 a year tax cut given to millionaires. Instead of helping Australian men and women gain secure work, earn a decent wage and retire with dignity—as well as being able to afford a house and get a world-class education—the Liberals have decided to do what they can to help those who are doing just fine. 


They're cutting funding from education, creating barriers to our world-class education system. Almost 10,000 students this year will miss out on a place in Australian universities because the Turnbull government has cut $2.2 billion from that sector. Our best and brightest, who need an opportunity for a proper education, have been cut away from that opportunity—further increasing the inequality that seems to be the passion of this government. 


Under the Turnbull government, there are now 730,000 Australians unemployed, and, of concern, there are almost 1.1 million unemployed Australians who are looking for work and unable to find it—1.1 million of our fellow Australians, and the Turnbull government think they're doing a good job. They celebrate the unemployment figures, ignoring these nearly two million Australians. For our young people, the situation is even worse, with the proportion of young men and women working full-time continuing to fall in a stubbornly downward trend. That's since the GFC. Importantly, nearly one in five young people in the labour force want to work more but cannot. Again, that is something this government is ignoring. 


The under-utilisation of our labour market is bad for the economy. Our economy will not be as productive as it could be unless people are spending, saving or investing. Beyond this, insecure work can cause, or be caused by, mental illness and mental ill-health; beyond earning an income, work is a source of social interaction and a way to gain a sense of purpose. This is particularly so for young people, and insecure work and unemployment—which we know is the hallmark of the world in which they are seeking work—can have a devastating long-term consequence on their education, on their employment, on their physical and mental health and on their capacity to contribute over a lifetime to the great nation we call Australia. Beyond not recognising the issue of insecure work, again, the Turnbull government fails to mention these sorts of issues in any of their speeches. Certainly, it was absent from the Prime Minister's speech last week. Australians need, want and deserve better wages, but the Turnbull government is doing nothing about that. 


I want to, particularly, put on the record my concern about this absence of policymaking for middle Australia. We really shouldn't be surprised, because it does reflect the ethos of a Liberal Party to govern for the top end of town. They always talk about how close they are to business, but decent businesses—small businesses that are employing people on the ground—are paying good value for good workers. Sadly, they're not getting the support of this government. 


I want to put on the record in the short time that remains to me that it's not just this federal Liberal government that has this attitude; Liberal governments across the country are embodying this same sort of out-of-touch approach to governing by no longer rewarding hard work with decent wages and by continuing to choose big business and the top end of town over middle Australia. Take, for example, the New South Wales Liberal government and their transparent desire to short-change 9,000 Sydney and New South Wales trains employees. These are dedicated workers who are seeking basic working conditions and fairer wages to simply support themselves and their families. For more than six months, the Liberal government—the sister to this government here in the federal  parliament—have failed to make a fair and reasonable offer that the workers there can accept. When the New South Wales Liberal government have openly said they look forward to the day when their transport system is driverless, it is easy to see they have no respect for their workforce. It's been left to the Rail, Tram and Bus Union to fight to ensure that the men and women that they represent are not left behind and have the capacity to earn a decent wage under fair working conditions.


It's also an opportunity for me to put on the record that, as a Labor senator, I stand in solidarity with those workers, who, since having their whole workforce decimated by the Liberal government in New South Wales to the point where a new timetable has come in, are now being forced to work 13-hour shifts for 13 days in a row. They are trying to stand up for the New South Wales residents who use that transport system. There are issues of safety. Do you really want someone driving a train in the 13th hour of their 13th consecutive day? That's what New South Wales has been reduced to because of the cost cutting of the Liberals: essential services put at risk because of a lack of understanding of the need to deliver equality for all workers and for all Australians. In closing, can I say it's left to the Labor Party and unions across Australia to deliver for those most in need in middle Australia, and it's exemplified today by Senator McAllister's bill.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (11:56):  Happy New Year, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle! It's good to be back and engaging in some interesting debate. But I have to say, it is disappointing to come in and listen to contributions like the one just made. I have a lot of respect for Senator O'Neill, but some of the things that have been given to her to read out today don't quite stack up. Often, and over many years, this country's been referred to as the 'lucky country' and—as I think Senator O'Neill said herself—a land of opportunity. People have come here from distant lands over many, many years to make the most of what is on offer in this country, to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities and the level playing field that I thought we had in this country. Everyone has a chance to make a go of it here, no matter what sort of a background they come from.


Recently, we celebrated Australia Day, when many of us have the privilege of representing the minister for immigration and citizenship and reading out the minister's message at the Australia Day citizenship ceremonies. People come from wherever they've come from, countries that don't have the same nature and system of opportunity that we have here in Australia, and they seek out these opportunities that our country provides and offers to them. You talk to these people and you hear their stories about the countries they've come from and the conditions they lived under—often squalor and fear. Many of these people, under certain regimes in different countries, couldn't get ahead no matter what they did. And so they were looking forward to the opportunity to make a go of things here. These people often come here with nothing. Some people have sought refuge here as asylum seekers. Often they are at a disadvantage to those of us who were blessed enough to be born in this country, because they don't speak the language. So they start from way back there. Yet these people will take any opportunity that is thrown their way. I don't hear them complaining about it. They are grateful to have the opportunity here to be able to do these things.


My own mother-in-law came from Albania. She couldn't speak English. They had nothing with them when they came here and sought political asylum. They worked three jobs. My father-in-law, who trained as a cardiologist in Albania, came here and worked as a cleaner for an extended period of time at the Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane. They did not take a cent of welfare. They've worked very, very hard since they've been here. They were at a disadvantage, compared to the situation that those of us who were born in this country started our lives with. But they made a go of it. They've done very well. And that's because this country presented to them opportunities that they did not have in their home country of Albania. They were not allowed to choose their line of work. They were not allowed to live in the town they wanted to. That is the difference.


Listen to Senator O'Neill and some of the other contributions from those opposite and you'd be tricked into thinking we're in some awful dictatorship where people are forced to work against their will at ridiculously low wages, where they don't have a chance to do what they want to do and improve the life of the next generation of their family coming through.


It's about equality of opportunity, which I was so pleased to hear Senator O'Neill mention, versus equality of outcome. We have opportunity. We have the chance to do something: to start a business, to study, to go and do something out of our comfort zone that may well yield a benefit, that may result in a profit or a promotion at work or a new job or something like that, something to improve our lives. In my view we should be nurturing that, not equality of outcome, where no matter what you do, however little you put in, you're guaranteed to get as much as the person who busts their guts over here and risks everything—mortgages their house—to start their business, to employ the 13 or 14 people that they employ in their small business. We should be rewarding those who want to put in, who want to make a go of things, who actually want to do something not only for themselves but also, through paying tax, for this country.


We talk, or at least Senator O'Neill talks, about these business people as if they're big moguls who sit in smoke filled rooms plotting to undercut workers in this country. It's madness. We have small-to-medium business enterprises in this country that make up a huge portion of our economy. They employ a huge number of Australians. They're the ones we're talking about. They're the ones we need to help out.


So I was pleased that Senator O'Neill talked about equality of opportunity, which is important, and we should protect that at all costs. But the rest of the rhetoric, the rest of the baseless claims that were made in her address, didn't stack up with that. They were all plucked out of thin air and they all pointed to the usual Labor stance of equality of outcome, which is the wrong thing to aim for. We should be aiming for and protecting equality of opportunity. We should be empowering Australians—young Australians, older Australians and new Australians. We should be motivating and encouraging them, not shaming them. This debate is all about shaming people who do well. It is talking about profit as a dirty thing. As I said before, people who run a small business, who have started up a business for the first time and have mortgaged or sold their home—maybe they're renting because they haven't been able to afford to buy one yet—are the ones who've risked everything to set up this enterprise which employs other people.


I commend and applaud that. I applaud those people who take that risk, who contribute to the economy, who aren't looking to government to sort their life out for them. They are taking matters into their own hands, and that's what we should be fostering. We should not be shaming these people into thinking they are doing something dirty and something wrong because they have done well in business and can afford to buy a nice car, send their kids to a good school and take their family on a holiday. This sort of debate is all about shaming those who actually want to do well, and that's what annoys me about this. It is something I'm ashamed of, that we in this country have this sort of attitude towards people who take risks, who put everything on the line, who have skin in the game, and—




Senator Carol Brown:
  What schools would those be?




Senator DUNIAM:
  There are many, many good schools, Senator Brown, and I will send you—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Ignore the interjection, Senator Duniam.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I accept your admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President. I'm sure that Senator Brown, as a representative of the great state of Tasmania, agrees with me that we need to be fostering this attitude of reward for effort, encouraging rather than shaming people who wish to make a go of things in this country.


I take issue also with a couple of the things that Senator O'Neill mentioned in her speech—namely about people who can afford to buy $700 shirts. I don't know many, if any, people who would go down to the shop and pick up a $700 set of threads. If they do, good on them. This outrageous example of pointing to someone who buys a $700 shirt and then grouping everyone who is a small or medium business operator with the big end of town as nasty business people—this talk of billionaires and millionaires—who are trying to undercut the worker is madness. The people we are talking about here—people who run businesses, who employ other Australians—are not in that category at all. To inject all this rhetoric into this debate and try to paint a picture of a society in Australia where you've got lots of people drive around in Bentleys and everyone else having to hitchhike is just ridiculous.


So I don't accept the points that Senator O'Neill made in that respect. It is just that: rhetoric. It is just trying to make this debate more emotive than it needs to be. We need to be real about it and we should get real about this sort of stuff. Getting out into our regional communities, where there are lots of small-business people—farmers and the like—you would understand that this $700-shirt business is not real. It is just part of this flourish that they're putting into this.


If I can turn to Tasmania for a moment: I've been observing the state campaign in Tasmania. We're in a state election campaign. One of the Labor Party's candidates in Tasmania, a fellow by the name of David O'Byrne, who was a minister in the last government in Tasmania, penned a—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  I beg your pardon—I missed that interjection.




Senator Polley:
  The last good government!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Polley, interjecting is not helpful.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will take that interjection, because Senator Polley says it was the last good government in Tasmania. Of course, there's another minister in this chamber who was part of that government, but I'd have to invite those in the gallery and anyone listening—the seven people across the country listening today—to go and check the scoreboard because, frankly, it was not a good government. It was one that left us with a mess in our state, and the last four years have been about fixing that mess.


I want to turn now to Mr David O'Byrne—the Hon. David O'Byrne, because he was a minister and has apparently earned the title 'honourable'. He penned an opinion piece for the Mercury dated 31 August 2017, 'Fighting to reduce inequality is the Labor Party's main task'. About two-thirds of the way through his opinion piece, he says in relation to Tasmania:


Inequality is represented by the one in every two Tasmanians who cannot read or write properly.


He's right about that. That's right. We do have a system which has, over many, many years, failed to support young Tasmanians—to teach them the basics. Our education system has not delivered what it should've done. We've been off experimenting with all sorts of different types of curriculums and learning systems. But I find it a bit galling when Mr O'Byrne decides to pen an opinion piece of this nature, having sat in government as a minister around the cabinet table as part of a government that wanted to close 20 schools in regional communities. He signed off on that and now has the gall to write an opinion piece saying that inequality is represented by these one-in-two Tasmanians who cannot read or write properly. If that is the case, in terms of fighting inequality in the state of Tasmania, my home state, how does closing schools—particularly in regional communities, where kids have to travel further to get to the next school if that one shuts, where there aren't all the supports of a bigger community and where the older generations certainly didn't have the educational opportunities that the younger generations may have—address inequality where kids can't read and write properly? That is something that he needs to answer for.




Senator McKim:
  As your own minister!




Senator DUNIAM:
  Senator McKim, I'm sure, would agree that some of the policies brought in in the last four years have been good—us being the last state in Australia to have schools that went through to year 12, kids dropping out at year 10 and often not going on to do anything else. Thankfully, now we are seeing students in these schools going on to finish their secondary education—about time. It is good, and the feedback has been good—from the students, from their families, from the communities in which these schools exist and from the staff as well. I know it's not convenient when the staff take a different line to the AEU in Tasmania, but they are welcoming it. They are embracing it.


Mr O' Byrne also goes on:


Inequality is the look on the face of Tasmanians who are forced to wait 12 months to get in to the RHH after testing positive to a bowel cancer screening because they can't afford to pay to see a private specialist.


There's been a lot of talk of cuts. The last government, the Labor-Green government in Tasmania, oversaw massive cuts. This is something that we see them try and sweep aside—put under the rug—so no-one can deal with it. They cut 250 nurses from our hospitals statewide. How does cutting those supports, those vital frontline workers—which, I might add, the Hodgman Liberal government have reinstated and then some—reduce the inequality that Mr O'Byrne is now concerned enough about that he's written an op-ed about it three years after he lost his seat in the Tasmanian parliament? Words are great, but back it up with actions. He went on, finally, to say:


An interventionist government—


aka big government, with lots and lots of public servants in nice big office blocks in Hobart, is the way to go—


lifting all boats on a rising tide through a strong vision and targeted action …


That sounds great, but to me it sounds like cutting down tall poppies, shaming those who do well, work hard and take a risk, and that is something I think we need to be aware of. 


On the specifics of this bill, I heard Senator O'Neill mention in her contribution that the bill will enable the Productivity Commission to do something that it doesn't currently do. But, as I understand it, the commission under the current legislation isn't precluded from doing that. I feel that, in directing it to study something that it already can, this legislation is not entirely necessary. No-one is stopping it from doing that. It can do that, so, in that sense, it seems mildly superfluous. The bill provides for a report in the end; it enables the Productivity Commission to study, evaluate and compile a report on inequality. It doesn't change anything. The government still needs to do something after receipt of these reports. 


Again, I'm pretty sure those seven people across the country who are listening to this debate, if they haven't tuned out already—




Senator Polley:
  Five have just switched off!




Senator DUNIAM:
  Five have just switched off, said Senator Polley. They knew you were up next! I'm pretty sure those people are sick of us just commissioning reports and having a gab rather than doing the things that address the issues that have been talked about in this debate.


I've already put on record my views about how best to assist those who want to get ahead, how best to provide equality of opportunity and not shame those young people who want to get ahead and try and do well. I encourage my kids to do well. I'm sure there are some opposite who will now say that I'm an elitist because I want my kids to do well, but I'm proud of any young person who does well, who does take a risk in life, who does try and improve the lives of others, particularly in our smaller, regional communities. Directing the Productivity Commission to undertake this analysis and provide a report to government is going to do nothing, other than allow us to line the shelves in our offices with yet another report that may well never see the light of day, that will just gather dust and that will not make a jot of difference to the lives of those people we're talking about now.


I'm a very strong supporter, having done extensive work with Senator Polley and other senators on the Community Affairs References Committee, of supporting those truly in need. We can never shy away from the fact that in this country there are people truly in need. But I don't think having support for those who are in need should come at the cost of assisting those who want to get ahead. That's the thing. I think this debate sometimes comes down to there being mutual exclusivity: you've either got to support those who want to get ahead, or cut them off at the knees and give it all to those who can't do well off their own bat.


You've got to wonder, though, if this bill passed, what would it would do for Australian families? They may be struggling to pay their power bills, as Senator O'Neill talked about. No-one's doing anything to address the cost of living. In Tasmania—and I'll need to double-check this—power prices under the Labor-Green government went up something like 65 per cent in the 16 years of government down there. We had an announcement yesterday in Tasmania, where the Tasmanian government, the Hodgman Liberal government, said that, if re-elected, they would leave the National Electricity Market, which would see a significant drop in power prices. That's the kind of thing that will help Australian families who are struggling with the cost of living and will assist in this debate about trying to make Australia a fairer place in terms of the burdens that are placed on Australian household budgets.


But commissioning a report up here in Canberra, talking about it in this big room and doing nothing much else, I don't think will help those people. It is about practical initiatives. It is about going out and listening to Australians and what matters to them. It's about putting in place measures and initiatives which will assist them to deal with the problems they face, which will assist them to take advantage of the opportunities that we have in this country, which, as I started by saying today, is the lucky country. It is the land of opportunity, as Senator O'Neill said herself. In terms of providing equality of opportunity, we should be nurturing the attitude that we want to see in our young people—of entrepreneurialism, risk-taking and things like that—so that, rather than waiting for the government to fix everything, they can get up and do it themselves.

  Team New South Wales!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Team New South Wales—that's it, Senator Payne! Team New South Wales—here to fight for the good side of politics.


During the Christmas break I met with a couple of friends. They had a reunion of the Commonwealth Bank staff in Inverell just a week or so ago. Many of them are good friends, and I met with a couple there. The wife was telling me that, when she got married, almost 50 years ago, she worked for the Commonwealth Bank and she had to resign her job because, if you were married and a female, you weren't allowed to work in a Commonwealth Bank. So she had resign. And that was the case, probably, at many other institutions; I'm not just picking out the Commonwealth Bank. She had to reapply for a job. How unfair is that? That wouldn't want to be the situation today in any institution. I always say that life is about fairness and that people should be treated fairly and paid fairly. I have the opinion that, if a woman is doing the same job as a man, she should have the same pay as that man, and that is simply being fair.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you would have been familiar with the Thai Amarin restaurant at Green Square. I remember being there with you one night. During the Christmas break, Silvie and John sold the restaurant and retired. Both came here as refugees from Cambodia. Silvie's father was murdered by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, terrible people who were trying to overthrow the government. Silvie and her six siblings and her mother walked in their bare feet from Cambodia to Bangkok. They slept on the side of the road. They made their way to Australia as refugees and became great Australians, great workers. They set up their restaurant, worked hard and became very successful. That is what Australia's about. It's the land of opportunity. If you have a go, work hard, work smart and do the right thing by your customers, if you're in retail business—you provide a good product or a good service—you become successful. That's how it should be.


I'm very proud to say that I spoke about Silvie and John on Australia Day, both in Inverell and Glen Innes. We see how other countries have had to suffer like this, and luckily we haven't. I certainly hope we don't in the future. John, Silvie's husband, was also from Cambodia. They met in Sydney. John's father was also murdered, because he was in business. Pol Pot was a terrible piece of gear. Luckily, Silvie and John met. They married and were very successful in business. They had two lovely children, Janelle and Sean. They took up the opportunity that Australia offered. They were great refugees, great immigrants, proud Australians. Their siblings are still here. They've all done well. Their mother is still alive. It's a great success story from what was a terrible situation in Cambodia. That is what Australia offers—a land of opportunity.


We have good education. It could be better, of course. It could always be better. The funding has been put forward by Senator Birmingham, with a great program for fair funding throughout Australia for all public and private schools. We have good schoolteachers. I wish there was a bit more discipline, in many respects, in some of the schools. The discipline has probably eased off from our days—I can't say 'our days', Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi; you're a lot younger than me! It has eased off from back in the sixties and seventies, I should say, when there certainly was a lot more discipline.


There is the NDIS, to treat those who are disadvantaged, those who are disabled, to see they have a fair, decent standard of living—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (10:08):  I rise to speak on this private senator's bill, the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, and from the outset I'd like to welcome all senators back. It's good to be here. I'd like to also commend my colleague Senator McAllister for her tireless efforts in producing this bill. Primarily this bill seeks to require, among other things, the Productivity Commission to undertake research on inequality and its effects on the Australian economy and community and to report to the minister and to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.


This bill is a simple yet powerful measure that will ensure that the Australian government, by way of the Productivity Commission, has an easily accessible institution to measure inequality in our country. Many might ask why the Productivity Commission is best suited to perform this function. The Productivity Commission is more than just an advisory body. Its work sets the national agenda and provides a basis for substantial change—as seen, for instance, with the reliance by the FWC on the Productivity Commission's report into last year's despicable penalty rates decision. As stands, the Productivity Commission is not required to take inequality into account. Although its enabling legislation currently requires it to have regard to a wide variety of factors, such as the need to promote regional development and to ensure that development is ecologically sustainable, there is no reference to inequality. This is a problem because there is an emerging consensus that increasing inequality not only has social justice implications but also has macroeconomic consequences. Inequality restricts access to social, economic and other opportunities, which limits intergenerational mobility and imposes society-wide cost through lost economic opportunities.


Inequality influences patterns of consumption and demand in ways that restrict economic growth. This bill aims to correct this by expanding the Productivity Commission's mandate to explicitly include consideration of inequality. It does this by requiring the Productivity Commission to consider the importance of mitigating the negative impacts of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community when exercising its functions and requiring the Productivity Commission to produce a report on the extent of inequality and its effects on the Australian economy every five years on the same timetable as the Intergenerational report.


In determining the merits behind this bill I would like to inform the Senate of some alarming trends currently faced by our nation. Australia's inequality level is the challenge of our time. Inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high. Wealth is growing more quickly at the top. Over the past four decades, real earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen nearly four times faster than they have for the bottom 10 per cent, and the trend of increasing inequality will continue unless we arrest it. Extreme levels of inequality are incompatible with how we as a nation see ourselves. Almost three-quarters of Australians agree the differences in income are too high. Australia doesn't have the extremes of inequality that we see in other countries such as the US, but it is below the OECD average. Two and a half million Australians live below the poverty line. Inequality is a drag on economic growth and a destabilising force. The OECD has estimated that, from 1985 to 2005, inequality reduced growth amongst member states by almost five per cent. Rising inequality in leading nations has been named as one of the drivers of the financial crisis. High wealth concentration was a destabilising factor in extremely deregulated financial markets.


We should talk more about inequality and we should do so armed with the numbers. An inequality report would do three things. Firstly, it would establish measures for economic inequality in different dimensions such as geography, gender and age. The government can't respond effectively if the problem is not measured, and the community may remain unaware of the extent to which inequality is connected to social and other outcomes. Secondly, it would access the effects of economic inequality on the economy and on individuals. It would ask, 'How mobile we are?' and 'How is inequality affecting people's life chances?' You only have to look in the remote regions of the Northern Territory and the rest of Australia to see how people struggle. Accessing the effects of existing government programs on economic inequality is a critical part of the policy development cycle. And, thirdly, it would access personal struggles with inequality—in particular, as I said, in the Northern Territory. The poorest regions in the Territory also have very high inequality. These are the vast regions that encircle the Darwin area, called Daly, Tiwi, West Arnhem and East Arnhem. Of course, there are regions with varying income levels that also have relatively low inequality ratios—for example, the region of Molonglo in South Canberra.


I have to talk about the gap in child mortality. The target to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018 was certainly not on track last year, and the target to close the gap in life expectancy by 2031 is not on track. Interestingly enough, we're coming up next week to the Closing the gap report on life expectancy, health and education for first nations people in this country. The attendance rate for non-Indigenous students remains steady at 93.1 per cent, but progress will need to accelerate for that target to be met. Halving the gap in employment by 2018 is not on track. As our shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, outlined in his recent book, Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age, it's certainly a remarkable achievement that Australia has maintained a record quarter-century of uninterrupted economic growth, especially when this period contained the greatest global downturn since the Great Depression. However, the gains of this growth are increasingly flowing to the top end of town. We see this way too often.


In the Northern Territory, as a Senator for the Northern Territory, I travel to our remote regions and towns. Equality is absolutely necessary in terms of transportation and access. At this time of year, with the wet season, half of the Northern Territory is impacted quite dramatically by heavy flooding, as we've seen with the evacuation of residents from the Daly River region last week to Darwin. Huge thanks, obviously, to the Northern Territory Emergency Service, Red Cross and other personnel involved with the evacuation.


Again, the measuring of inequality is certainly quite critical for the constituents of ours in the Northern Territory and the remote regions of Australia. I am certainly confident that this bill is a step in the right direction. I commend the bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,6,2
"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (10:16):  I rise today to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, a private senator's bill introduced to the Senate by our colleague from New South Wales Senator McAllister. I'm very pleased that Senator McAllister shares the coalition's passion for decreasing inequality in Australia so that all Australians can have a fair go—after all, Australia has long been heralded around the world as the land of the fair go. But what is less pleasing is that Labor would once again commission yet another study into the problem of inequality rather than tackle it head-on.


You see, the Labor Party so often seeks to appear to be taking real steps to solve today's pressing issues, but in reality the Labor Party is unashamedly just sitting on its hands. By contrast, the coalition government is addressing inequality with policies to boost economic growth, general employment and income for hard-working Australians, while targeting assistance to those who need it most. We don't just want to be seen to be doing good; the coalition is actually doing good.


Before I address the substance of this bill, allow me to first highlight what some might view as a glaring flaw in the bill itself. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that Senator McAllister's bill links the timing of the reports to the intergenerational reports that are produced by the Parliamentary Budget Office every five years. An inequality report must be tabled, according to this bill, within 15 sitting days of the tabling of an intergeneration report. However, the intergenerational report is produced by Treasury, not by the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is a significant flaw in the bill that we are discussing today. So this bill can't have any effect, because the PBO won't be producing the intergenerational report. Although, undoubtedly, the intent of the bill is sound, it would appear that it was potentially hurriedly prepared—and, let's be frank, it's a politically motivated piece of legislation that would in fact have very little effect.


Australia's tax and transfer system overwhelmingly directs assistance towards those who need it the most. According to the ABS household expenditure survey, the poorest 20 per cent of households, on average, receive welfare payments and social services worth more than eight times that which they pay in taxes. This is evidence of how our social welfare net is working effectively to assist those Australians who need it the most, ensuring that conditions are available for them so that they too can prosper and grow as contributors to our nation's great economy.


Recent data has supported the notion that income inequality outcomes in Australia have in fact continued to improve since the dark days of the global financial crisis, and that's thanks to a strong and resilient economy. For example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey—the HILDA Survey as we know it colloquially—released in June 2016 found that the percentage of Australians in both relative and absolute poverty has in fact fallen since the global financial crisis around 10 years ago. Absolute poverty has in fact decreased substantially, from 12.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent, and relative poverty has similarly decreased from 13 per cent to 10.4 per cent. Furthermore, the HILDA Survey shows that, thanks to a robust economy that facilitates social mobility rather than fosters inequality, most 'poor' households are not persistently poor, and this is particularly important. Half of those who experience poverty over a 10-year period remain in poverty for only one to two years.


In keeping with these findings, the government took steps in the 2017-18 budget to encourage greater workforce participation, and it also protected the welfare system for those who need it the most. Meanwhile, in stark contrast to our own track record, those opposite are talking. They're prevaricating, they're equivocating and, rather than developing a policy, they are commissioning yet another study. I can't believe that the opposition has not learnt from years gone by, and I remind those in the chamber of the years of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In the lead-up to his campaign he promised study after study after study and, as his term as Prime Minister showed, the people of Australia dismissed this as window-dressing. The people of Australia do not want that kind of do-nothing government, big on announcements but devoid of outcomes. Rather, what Australians expect of their government is a government that gets things done, working in a methodical, logical and timely manner to improve the lives of everyday Australians. Alternatively, the coalition government, on the other hand, is doing exactly what coalition governments are expected to do and what they have done since time immemorial—what they have always done. The coalition government is getting on with the job. Our priorities and our policy agenda are to secure the essentials that Australians rely on and to work to reduce the cost-of-living pressures in this country.


I am thankful for the opportunity this private senator's bill provides me to speak a little about the Turnbull coalition government's program to reduce income inequality in this country. One of the coalition's flagship policies is of course the enterprise tax plan. It was justified by a recently released journal study, courtesy of The American Economic Review. According to that study, titled 'Do higher corporate taxes reduce wages? Micro evidence from Germany', higher company taxes in Germany actually led to reduced wages and thus to greater inequality. The study I cite is particularly useful in the Australian context, given the similarity of our labour market to that of Germany. The study finds that workers bear about half of the total tax burden, a figure that is congruous with the 50 per cent corporate burden often quoted by Treasury. Examining administrative linked data from the 18,000 tax changes across 10,000 municipalities in Germany between 1993 and 2012, this study found that higher company taxes in fact reduce wages most for those who need our help most: low-skilled workers, women and younger workers. The study also noted that higher-skilled employees are not affected at all. All of this points to a simple fact: cutting company tax rates improves inequality.


In spite of this, the Labor Party continue to meet our enterprise tax plan with downright hostility, stubbornly dismissing it as trickle-down or neo-Liberal Reaganomics. As the aforementioned study demonstrates, those who the Labor Party purport to look out for the most—women, young workers and low-skilled workers—are those who stand to benefit the most from our enterprise tax plan. That's right: contrary to the member for Maribyrnong, the Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten's assertion that our tax plan is a cut for the top end of town, it is in fact women, young workers and low-skilled workers who are the main beneficiaries of our corporate tax cut. As per usual, the Labor Party are all talk. They pretend to look after the little guy, but, when push comes to shove, all they want to do is bash job-creating companies and look after union cronies. So artificial, in fact, is the Labor Party's concern for hard-working Australians that they refuse to support legislation to ease the tax burden for those who need it most. When will the Labor Party learn that higher taxes of any kind are not the answer? We cannot tax our way to prosperity.


Furthermore, the coalition government's budget repair measures are designed to reduce debt and deficit—a symptom of the addiction to spending that is solely attributable to the Australian Labor Party; an addiction for which all Australians are now paying dearly. Our measures reduce the debt and the deficit; they increase the ability of the government to respond to economic shocks in a way that supports economic growth and employment—two factors that are key in reducing income inequality. As the most recent round of job figures showed, the coalition's policies to increase employment and grow the economy are working consistently and are working effectively, with a record of more than 400,000 jobs created in 2017, of which, I remind the chamber, 300,000 were full-time. And, furthermore, in addition to our strong jobs growth, we have seen rising profitability and a gradual tightening in the labour market as companies are finding it harder to find skilled workers. As such, all the primary drivers of wages growth are now in place, and we expect, as do many prominent economists such as Chris Richardson and Saul Eslake, that the so-called income recession will now come to a rapid end. Attendant on the expected wages growth is swifter budget repair and an end to the crops of debt and deficit sewn and grown by Labor over those six fateful years.


In addition to creating jobs, the government has introduced a range of measures to rein in spending and improve the sustainability of Australia's social safety net—a social safety net of which we are immensely proud—all whilst ensuring that the welfare system remains one of the most precisely targeted in the world. With the support of the Senate, more than $37 billion worth of budget repair measures have already been legislated, including measures from the 2014-15 budget that comprise part of the omnibus savings bill that passed with the support of the opposition, and for that we thank them.


Our 2017-18 budget, building on the success of the omnibus savings bill, seeks to grow the economy to secure more and better-paying jobs—the kinds of jobs that are required, that are necessary, that are fundamental to a 21st century economy. The budget, as expertly put together by the Treasurer, the Hon. Scott Morrison, also guarantees essential government services that Australians rely on, such as Medicare, hospitals and schools, all in spite of the scare campaigns that emanated from those sitting opposite.


Our budget tackles cost-of-living pressures, many of which are the result of the disastrous former Labor government, and, contrary to our predecessors, ensures that the government lives within its means. All of these measures, working in concert with one another, are about continuing to redress inequality and ensuring that there isn't a single Australian who cannot access the assistance that he or she needs, while fostering the prosperity and growth of all Australians.


One of the core features of this coalition government's agenda has been guaranteeing the essentials, protecting and boosting essential services that Australians rely on. As we have endured the so-called income recession, Australians have come to place even greater faith in the government's range of essential services. And so it should be, for the first duty of a government is to protect and keep Australians safe and ensure that critical services they rely on are guaranteed. These services include health care, housing, disability support, education and, in particular, employment. This coalition government is, most importantly, guaranteeing Medicare, making funding fairer for students and sharing the responsibility of our higher education system. 


Our essential services give Australians the security and confidence they need to seize opportunities as they arise. First and foremost, this government is tackling the cost-of-living pressures on Australian households. The 2017-18 budget eases the cost-of-living pressures on Australians and their families particularly in the areas of energy, housing and childcare costs. On the energy front, the National Energy Guarantee, unveiled by the Minister for the Environment and Energy in October last year, will further ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian households, with expected savings of up to $400 per year on their energy bills. The government's energy security plan will help provide reliable and affordable energy for Australians, with practical reforms designed to meet immediate challenges and lay the foundations for our future energy needs. 


Hardworking families have faced increasing childcare fees, with costs growing by 51.7 per cent between 2008 and 2016. This has placed a significant strain on household budgets and presents a hurdle for Australians considering returning to the workforce. To assist around one million hardworking Australian families, the government is investing $37.3 billion over five years through its Jobs for Families Child Care Package, which will help ease the cost-of-living pressures and provide more affordable access to quality child care. 


Australians will also get a better deal from our financial and banking system, with the government giving consumers access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution services—making banks and their executives more accountable and giving consumers greater access to and control over their banking data, empowering them to seek out better and cheaper services. All of these measures are real, genuine and productive steps in making sure that Australia continues to improve on measures of inequality. 


Finally, as part of our commitment to ensuring that all of our older Australians are able to enjoy a comfortable and dignified retirement, the government will reinstate the Pensioner Concession Card for those impacted by the asset test changes introduced in January this year. This will allow an extra 92,000 people to access the discount offered to holders of the Pensioner Concession Card, including subsidised hearing services, offered by the Commonwealth. Furthermore, these people will continue to be able to access discounts offered by the states and territories. 


So it becomes clear that this coalition government is working to redress inequality by guaranteeing essential services, and the most important essential service is Medicare. Contrary to the despicable 'Mediscare' ad campaign run at the last election by the Australian Labor Party, this coalition government can assure all Australians that not only is Medicare here to stay but also it will be significantly strengthened in the future. The government is guaranteeing vital healthcare services, with Commonwealth health funding expected to increase from $75.6 billion in 2017-18 to $82.6 billion in 2020-21. 


The Medicare Guarantee Fund was established on 1 July last year to secure ongoing funding for the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, guaranteeing Australians access to these services and affordable medicines into the future. The fund provides transparency around the cost of running the MBS and the PBS and guarantees the government's commitment to funding affordable health care that all Australians rely on. Not only is Medicare guaranteed but it will be made stronger under this coalition. The government will provide a billion dollars to lift the freeze on the indexation of the MBS, to encourage GPs to bulk-bill children under the age of 16 and concession card holders. Bulk-billing incentives will also be indexed from 1 July 2017.


When the Gillard government introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme to parliament in November 2012, there was only one small problem—it was not fully funded. As they are wont to do, the Labor Party came up with a piece of legislation and passed that legislation but conveniently forgot that it must be paid for at some point if it was ever to become functional. Fortunately now, though, for those Australians who rely on the services provided through the NDIS, the Turnbull government has acted to fully fund the NDIS scheme. If my memory serves me correctly, I also think it was Mr Shorten, who is part of the party which now rejects the true Gonski funding that excludes unfair and special deals for particular education sectors. The Gonski program is also now fully funded.


The only failures, I believe, are those of the Labor Party, who have wrecked and resisted at every step of the way the government's economic plan to repair the budget, grow the economy and create jobs. Our achievements in implementing the national economic plan stand in stark contrast to those opposite, who show no sign of waking up to the economic challenges facing hardworking Australian families and Australian businesses. I thank the chamber for its time.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (10:36):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. If you needed any more clear or stark reinforcement of why we on this side, and the Australian people, say that this government is out of touch, you only had to listen to that speech or take it off Hansard because, obviously, the government is living in a different community than we are in Tasmania or in Australia. They just don't understand the difficulties. The reality is that there is greater inequality in this country—much greater than there was when they came to power over four years ago.


I support this bill and I'm very proud to be in a party that is so evidently committed to addressing inequality, one of the greatest social and economic issues facing the nation. The bill amends the Productivity Commission Act 1998 to expand the general policy guidelines for the exercise of the Productivity Commission's function to require consideration of inequality. This bill and fighting inequality are things Labor wholeheartedly supports—unlike those opposite—and, unlike those on the other side, we even acknowledge it. Last year, the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, said inequality hadn't got worse. But it's time to come back to reality. Under the Turnbull government inequality is thriving. Wage growth is at an all-time low. The cost of living is paralysing families. Thousands of vulnerable older Australians can't access care, and the government's health cuts are bankrupting families. Homelessness and housing stress are national crises. Where is the Prime Minister on all of this? He is busy obsessing over his own political woes; he's obsessing about whether he's able to keep his own job. When it comes to the recent polling, we note that No. 26 was rung out this morning—so there are only four more before he reaches Tony Abbott's 30 negative polls, which this Prime Minister used to knife that Prime Minister.


The Prime Minister is so preoccupied he has failed to fulfil one of the biggest obligations that a Prime Minister of this great country has, and that is to know and understand what's happening in our community. He has failed to listen, failed to act and failed to understand what Australia's most vulnerable people are struggling with. Those opposite have taken the low road one too many times, and even their most loyal supporters are turning away. If you were to say to me, Senator Bilyk, that Malcolm Turnbull had a bit of a tough time in 2017, I would give you an award for the understatement of the year, because 2017 was an absolute shocker for the Turnbull government. After a particularly tumultuous year you might have expected them to bunker down and re-emerge in the new year with a resolution to be better and to be different. But 2018 started the same way for the Liberals as 2017 ended—in a complete shambles. From their divisive Trump-style comments about gang violence in Victoria to the delay of the GST report to the revelations that our broadband speeds are now lagging behind Third World countries or the clumsy tirade on China's Pacific affairs, we're seeing more of the same old disorderly government. They've kicked off this year with no direction, no plan and, above all, no narrative.


As a former investment banker, you'd think that Mr Turnbull would have the economic nous to manage the economy and address the cost of living that's paralysing families in this country, in particular those on very limited incomes, such as older Australians. But his elitist approach to economic issues such as tax and housing affordability has created an us-versus-them culture. People are switching off and feeling disenfranchised. In Mr Turnbull's first speech of the year last week he vowed that 2018 would be a year of delivery and that families could look forward to cheaper energy prices and lower childcare costs. What a load of bunk and rot from the Prime Minister.


Last week's Productivity Commission report confirmed that childcare costs continue to skyrocket under the Liberals and that it won't get any better under the government's changes, which won't take effect until 1 July. The Liberals don't support early education or our early educators who do such a critical job. Next month, childcare workers will walk off the job in a bid to raise the industrial-law award wages. This will be the third national walk-off in 12 months, but, again, the Liberals aren't listening. It's not like these early childhood educators want to take these measures, but they are left with no choice. Parents support them; this government ignores them. This says everything about this government's priorities. While Australians have suffered record low wages, it has pursued penalty rate cuts and tax hikes for low- and middle-income earners while cutting tax for millionaires and big business. That's what this government prioritises.


Mr Turnbull is an elitist and the Liberals are so out of touch with the Australian people that it's not funny. From that speech, the first speech in this chamber this year from a Liberal, they've demonstrated very, very clearly that this government still doesn't get it. This government still doesn't understand what's happening in its own community. You might recall on Q&A last year when Mr Turnbull condescendingly asked an audience member to explain how he had disappointed her. How disingenuous can you be? That's the level and mentality of our Prime Minister: too worried about his own job and too big an ego to listen to what's happening in the community. Mr Turnbull has spent most of his life within the top one per cent of wage earners in this country. How can someone who has lived a very privileged life relate to parents who will be trying to balance their family budgets as they buy new school uniforms, school shoes, books and lunch boxes for their kids as they go back to school this week in Tasmania? It's no longer a question of whether Mr Turnbull can relate to the majority of the population, because we all know he can't. The magic number, as I said, of 30 Newspolls has arrived, and no amount of smoke and mirrors can hide the fact that he can neither lead and govern nor close the gap of inequality in this country.


This is a government with the wrong priorities and the wrong vision for Australia. The Prime Minister needs to understand the heartbeat of the country's people. The Prime Minister needs to understand the hardship that's been experienced by so many—too many—in this country. The Prime Minister needs to understand the heartache of parents having to say no to their kids when they can't do music lessons, when they can't do swimming lessons and when they can't dance with their friends. He needs to get real and start showing some heart for Australians who are less fortunate.


Those opposite think that if they give a tax cut to the big end of town, to big business, who do not pay their fair share of tax already, there will be economic growth and jobs created. I'd like to ask the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to explain to me and the Australian people when in history tax cuts for big business have stimulated job creation and caused wage growth. I know he can't answer that, because it hasn't happened. The drivers of an economy are the people. How about you focus on them, Mr Turnbull, just for once?


Last week, Mr Turnbull said that life in Australia was good as a result of the coalition's economic policies and that his government are committed to defending the fair go. That is absolute nonsense. It's rubbish. We heard from a government senator just before I began to speak saying that everything is all right, that they've got everything on track. The problem is that they don't understand and they aren't listening to the Australian people. I don't know who these government senators and members are socialising with or visiting or who the constituents they see in their offices are. Obviously they're very different to the people who have contacted me or the people who have talked to me in the supermarket or around a barbecue over the new year.


The government can never defend the fair go until they change their priorities and policies. They are an arrogant government who are so far out of touch it's not funny. Comments from the Prime Minister that everything's all right and that he's going to defend the fair go reinforce the fact that he just doesn't get it. He doesn't listen or understand what is so evident. He doesn't understand the struggles happening in our suburbs and for the rest of us. The Prime Minister doesn't understand the pressure Australian households are under, and he doesn't care that one in four parents are going without food so that their kids have enough to eat. Instead of focusing on big issues like stagnant wage growth, the rising cost of living, access to affordable health care and housing affordability, we've seen a government fixated on itself. It's comments like those from the Prime Minister which reinforce that the government don't understand and that they haven't been listening.


There are so many people in our communities who have legitimate concerns. Most Australians are focused on putting food on the table, paying their bills, paying their mortgage or paying their rent. But this government is too preoccupied with satisfying millionaires and the big end of town. There are single mums and single dads who are trying to make ends meet by having two jobs. They are also many, many two-income families who are still under increasing financial pressure, and that puts enormous pressure and stress on these families and individuals. Mothers and fathers have lost their jobs because industry is under pressure and government has not reacted fast enough.


And then there are the older Australians, the people forgotten by those opposite. We know the crisis confronting older Australians in this country. It's financial, but it's also about care. It's about the 100,000-plus people who are still waiting to get a home-care package, to get assistance to stay in their homes. Let's face it—we all know that the best place for older people to age is in their own homes. It's also a lot less expensive for every government to have people stay in their own homes. Let's not forget that. They still pay their rates. They still have to pay their own hydro bills and their heating and energy costs. So the least that this government can do is to ensure that older Australians who need assistance to stay at home, to live safely and have the dignity and respect they have earned, get it. But this government has failed.


It's not just this government. We remember the Howard days. They were in government for 11½ years and, even though people thought that John Howard was a man of the people and the man of the poor, he always failed to deliver for older Australians. And this government is no better. There are older Australians in my home state of Tasmania who are forced to wait in ambulances or in queues at emergency departments because there are not enough beds in the hospitals. We know that, in Tasmania, older people have been left on the floor in accident and emergency departments. Why? Because the Liberal state government and the Turnbull Liberal federal government have cut funding to health. The Tasmanian health system is in crisis. Only last week, the head of surgery at the Launceston General Hospital resigned because he couldn't reach an agreement with the minister and the government of the day. He left because they took away all his power to make decisions. That's the calibre of Liberals when it comes to health care in this country.


There's never been a more important time for government to be actively promoting equality of opportunity than now. It's in our national interest. The people are sick of hearing those opposite bang on about their sterile, unrealistic slogans, such as 'jobs and growth' and the 'innovation agenda' and the empty rhetoric of trickle-down economics. I don't have an economics degree, but I do know maths and I do know the numbers. I know the number of people who are still trying to get jobs in this country and the number of people who are doing it really tough in this country, and trickle-down economics will not change our economy for the better for those people who need it most.


We need a renewed debate on the role of government in reducing inequality—something that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, continued last week. This brings me to the contrast between Labor and the Liberals. Of Australia's two viable governing parties, only one has a policy approach that will defend opportunities—the Australian Labor Party. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, outlined Labor's vision for 2018 for a fairer, stronger and more inclusive Australia. The contrast between Mr Shorten's and Mr Turnbull's first speeches for 2018 couldn't be more stark. Mr Turnbull used his speech last week to cement the fact that he is the ultimate hollow man of Australian politics. As my colleague Mr Chris Bowen said, 'Malcolm Turnbull talking about income tax cuts is like the English cricket team bragging about winning the Ashes.'


Malcolm Turnbull, in his Toowoomba declaration last week, bragged that he will cut taxes for Australians, when he's increasing the taxes of seven million Australians. The fact is that Malcolm Turnbull is increasing taxes for seven million Australians so that he can cut taxes for multinationals and millionaires. He wants a medal for saying that he might cut taxes, when we know that he is, in fact, increasing them. Under Mr Turnbull's tax increase, someone earning $60,000 gets a tax hike of $300 a year. Meanwhile, he's giving millionaires a tax cut of $16,400 a year and big businesses a tax cut of $65 billion. If Mr Turnbull was really fair dinkum about tax, he would drop his tax increases. All his talk and jibe about tax increases when all this government wants to do is increase tax through the Medicare levy is just hollow rhetoric.


Fact: this is a government that wants to increase income tax, and the Labor Party stands against it in this place. Fact: the only thing stopping Australians earning less than $87,000 a year paying more income tax today is Bill Shorten and the Labor Party's opposition to this government's ridiculous policy. Fact: the Liberals are so delusional and out of touch they think that, if they give a $65 billion tax cut to big business, who do not pay their fair share of tax now, there will be economic growth and jobs will be created.


I could go on and on about the inequality in this country and the fact that this government is still out of touch. Inequality in Tasmania is already impacting many households, as I said earlier. We in Tasmania already experience high levels of inequality and underemployment. In fact, nearly 40 per cent of Tasmanians receive some form of government benefit. This is well above the national average. We know that Mr Turnbull doesn't like Tasmania because we didn't support him; we didn't vote for him at the last election. But he still has to respond to the desires and ambitions of all members of this country, including Tasmanians.


Most income in Tasmania is generated from wages and salaries. Other income is produced in the form of pensions and child payments. However, all income is then further reduced by taxation and other increasing costs. Any impact on our income stream, such as the Turnbull government's cut to penalty rates further, reduces our ability to support normal basic living costs, education and health. Clearly with this low wage growth any rise in unemployment in Tasmania will lead to defaults on mortgages and consumer loans and could have catastrophic results for our state. We have already lost 4,700 jobs in the last 11 months. We cannot afford for this to continue under Malcolm Turnbull or the Liberal state government of Tasmania. We need action. We need leadership. I know I'm asking too much when I ask to have leadership from this Prime Minister, but the Australian people deserve nothing less.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,6,2
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:56):  In December 2014 this Senate brought down a report with the title Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia: the extent of income inequality in our nation. It was a very concerning report, for the very reason that we had seen that the issue of inequality—we're talking about 2014—had been discussed both in our own community and internationally and that a range of recommendations and issues had arisen that focused on exactly what the issues around inequality were. As you know, our process of developing reports includes taking evidence from a range of experts across the nation and, most importantly I think, having the opportunity to visit communities all around our nation and to listen to people who genuinely care about their lives, about their communities and, in this case, about what they perceived as genuine inequality—a situation in which our nation was actually not responding to fairness, not actually going forward with equality but identifying a clear danger that the inequality would impel our society and our community as we knew it.


Well, the report came down, and a number of recommendations were made. I know many people in this place made contributions to the debate, and several months later the government responded and said that in fact there wasn't inequality in Australia. The government's response to that was particularly concerning because it went back over so many of the arguments we've already heard in this place, which were simplistic, and came up with simple answers, saying things like, 'Well, it's not as bad as it used to be' and 'If we get the budget right it will improve' and various other things. I'm not trying to verbal the government, but I'm trying to encourage people who are interested in this topic to go back and have a look at the build-up of evidence, community concern and personal stories showing how people feel about their lives and whether or not they believe that things in fact are equal and whether it's getting better.


So, this report came down. Within that report was a particularly worthy piece of documentation provided by Professors Peter Whiteford and Andrew Podger, which was a graph—and we had many, many graphs in this report—showing results of selected studies of inequality in Australia. It didn't go back to Federation, although it possibly could have. Nonetheless, it took a time frame and gave us a bottom line about which we could have our discussions and look into what we should do next. It began with the Bradbury study in 1992 and then went through over 30 studies up to Bray in 2014. It gave a synopsis about whether or not these reports indicated growing inequality. The reports all looked at our community—not the world, not the international aspects, but what was happening in our own communities. They consistently said that there were serious concerns. I will quote from the ABS's Survey of Income and Housing—and it's a long one which sounds like economics, which is not my strength, but I'm going to put it on the record:


While the mean household net worth of all households in Australia in 2011-12 was $728,000, the median (i.e. the mid-point when all households are ranked in ascending order of net worth) was substantially lower at $434,000 … This difference reflects the asymmetric distribution of wealth between households, where a relatively small number of households had high net worth and a relatively large number of households had low net worth …


This was then illustrated in a series of graphs that came after. The survey went on to focus clearly, and I have deliberately made that quote because we're looking at people who had income, who had strong income, as I noted. We weren't talking about the gap between the wealthiest and least wealthy—those who are very poor in our society—which is sometimes where this debate focuses, showing that great gap. It talked about people who were already in income-solid families and showed how that inequality had increased. However, it went on to show stats, which I know have been quoted in this debate, that over 1.2 million households, which is 14 per cent of our community, had net worth of less than $50,000, with 114 of those households having negative net worth—one per cent of all households. That's where it really hits home, where, despite many protestations made over many years, there is clear acknowledgment that there are people living in our community, who are our neighbours, who have not only limited income but negative net worth. 


Discussions around inequality and income often degenerate into a war of graphs and statistics, and I'm not saying that that is always bad. It's important to understand the statisticians' information, and that we have very clear data—and I'll come back to that later. In the Australian context, we have a range of academic institutions that look carefully at what's happening in our communities and a number of universities have very strong research areas that follow the economic inequalities and livelihoods of Australians. 


The key Australian Bureau of Statistics data came out of two surveys: the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, the HILDA; and the Survey of Income and Housing, the SIH. These surveys provide ongoing statistics that look at what is happening in our community, and it's on that basis that Treasury also make statements about income such as the one I read earlier. 


The whole reason we're having this discussion about this piece of legislation is that we want the Productivity Commission, which is an economic based organisation that lives and breathes statistics and how the economic process impacts on our community, to have a more regular high-profile role in looking at exactly what's happening in inequality in Australia, and putting it to the forefront so that not only does it review these issues but, as often with productivity reports, they come back consistently to the parliament so that parliamentarians are able to discuss what the recommendations and findings of those reports are. The core issue is then to turn that into effective responsive policy. So, where we identify inequality, we're able to consider the reasons for the inequality and access the information that we have across the board. We can then look at how we can develop policy that identifies where people are in need and where people are not benefiting from other advances that are going on in our economy and respond to that. That is the job of policy development, and Senator McAllister's bill makes sure that we have that front of mind and integrally linked to the development of all policy that comes from what's happening in our community. 


We know that we have data. We know that we have information, but I'm particularly keen for people who may be interested in this issue to have a look at Senate committee reports such as Bridging our growing divide: inequality inAustralia and many others that have come here. We have talked many times about individual areas that are disadvantaged and the particular problems some of our community have with getting solid financial security.


Beyond the statistics are the kinds of issues about which Senator Polley was talking. They're the people who have actually had the courage to come and talk with their parliamentary representatives about what's important to them and—sometimes with absolutely admirable courage and devastating honesty—talked to us about the terrible things that have happened in their personal lives and in their communities which have caused them to have the serious inequality issues that have brought them to talk to us. Whilst the 2014 report does not in a final report give a lot of data from communities and from representatives, when people who are interested go into the parliamentary records, read the submissions that people have provided and read the Hansard records of the public hearings, that's when the faces, the families, the immediate impact of financial insecurity and the growing inequality—and I state clearly that it is growing inequality—in our community become most real.


Senator Polley listed a number of gut-wrenching examples in her contribution. I refer meanwhile to the 2014 report, where we have the particular identification of sectors of our community who are most vulnerable. At the moment, one of the areas that is causing a great deal of distress for many of us is ongoing discussion with people who have disabilities and the impact of the absolutely clear evidence that shows that, for people with disabilities, the whole range—their income earning capacity, their livelihoods, their ability to have effective housing and education—is negatively impacted. The contrast between those families that are working with disability and those that are not is a clear area where there is need for effective policy to respond to that and acknowledgment that that is an area of need.


Chapter 4 of the 2014 report looks at particular areas. I want to pick up on one area about which I have spoken many times in this place: people with mental illness. The National mental health report 2013 said:


2‑3% of Australians – around 600,000 people – have severe disorders …


…   …   …


Another 4‑6% of the population (approximately 1 million people) have moderate disorders, and a further 9‑12% (approximately 2 million people) have mild disorders.


The committee recommendations go on to say there's a strong correlation between homelessness and poorer health and wellbeing, especially in relation to mental health. The rates of labour force participation are impacted, and Mr Fear went on to say we know that only about 38 per cent of people with mental illness work full time, compared to 55 per cent of the rest of the population. He goes on to talk about the issues with Newstart and Centrelink. We have much more in terms of other areas, particularly regional disadvantage.


Many years ago there was a report put out that Wayne Swan was involved in which looked at postcodes. If you look at postcodes across Australia, you can zero in and see significant contrast between various postcodes in our community with regard to financial security, access to health and access to employment. That is a clear sign to all of us in this place that we have to acknowledge that inequality exists. We need to acknowledge that not everyone has been advantaged by the statements that have been made about the strength of the economy over many years. We do acknowledge there has been increased wealth, but acknowledging there's increased wealth does not remove the reality that there are people who have not been benefiting from these advances. We shouldn't run away from that, we should try very hard not to allocate blame about that and we should look at how we, working as a parliament, can respond to it most effectively.


At the moment there are a number of issues pulling together that give us in Australia, in our parliament, a very clear encouragement and opportunity to respond to the recommendation from the 2014 Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia report. It called for us to take the issue seriously and look at having a report to parliament about what is happening in our community. That's what Senator McAllister's private member's bill has done in recommending the Productivity Commission amendment.


Also, internationally—and I've spoken about this many times in the parliament—the world has made an agreement, across all continents and in all countries, that we can identify inequality in our own areas and then work together to respond to that. The Sustainable Development Goal: Agenda 2030 looks at reducing poverty and, most importantly, at how our communities can ensure absolutely—and this is the theme that we should all hold dear to our hearts—that no matter what policies are introduced or what happens in the economies, we are going to leave no-one behind. This, to me, sums up the debate around inequality. If we had genuine commitment to effective policy development in our country as we moved our policies forward, as we looked at responding to the various pressures that impact on our nation and if we genuinely made a commitment that we would develop policy that would leave no-one behind, we would not only be ensuring that inequality would be reduced but we would also be acknowledging that people need to have that security—that we can, in fact, have a 'leave no-one behind' agenda.


There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but the first one is to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. I know that's a challenge, but if we're looking at genuine equality we would be looking at removing poverty. The subclauses of goal 1, to end poverty in all its forms, go through the various things that were defined four years ago when we were looking at the evidence around developing the inequality report. We were looking at ending hunger and ensuring food security. There is devastating evidence in the 2014 report that talks about hunger in Australia and the impact that we're having in terms of food banks and kitchens which are being developed to ensure that people in our streets, in our communities, are not going without meals. I'll refer anyone who's interested in this situation to the evidence that was received there.


I think that sometimes we become very comfortable. In our own lives, we become extremely comfortable. When we hear about world poverty, we immediately think of something overseas—devastating malnutrition and things in our Pacific neighbours' countries, as Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells would understand. We don't think about our next-door neighbour in our own street in our own community, but the evidence we have from people who work in food kitchens and food banks indicate that there is poverty in Australia. If we're going to make an international commitment on the world stage to end poverty, that should mean everywhere. We should be looking at the data, the information and the people who are suffering from poverty, malnutrition and a lack of security in our own communities. In looking at that part of the Sustainable Development Goals, immediately we have a responsibility domestically as well as internationally. If we are to respond effectively to the Sustainable Development Goal: Agenda 2030, to which our country has signed up and about which we're going to make our first report back to the UN this year, we need to ensure that the data collection, information and education processes within Australia are addressing the identified issues of inequality, which are the same here as they are overseas.


They may well have lesser impact here. I'm not making a claim that Australia has the same desperate poverty as places that are suffering drought and famine, like central West Africa. I'm not making that claim. But I'm saying there is genuine inequality in our communities and we need to identify and address that, and then, as part of our genuine commitment to ending poverty in all its forms—to leaving no-one behind—we address openly what's happening in our own communities, using the data sources that we have. We have enviable data sources. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is seen as an international expert in looking at data collection, and one of the things we're going to be doing as part of the 2030 agenda is sharing our knowledge in this space with other countries. So let's use that effectively within our own community: address hunger, address homelessness, address housing shortages, address health shortages, address the environmental impacts of disasters and address what is happening in our own community overall—which is causing people to feel they're not respected and that they are not sharing the increasing wealth of our nation. 


That's the hint of inequality. We have the opportunity to do something about it. We shouldn't dismiss it. We shouldn't pretend it doesn't exist or make comparisons showing that everyone is doing better so, therefore, everyone is okay. That's clearly not the case. When you hear people talking about their own experiences, they don't feel as though everyone is doing okay, and we have the capacity, as a nation, to respond.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (11:15):  I'd like to start by thanking Senator McAllister for introducing the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 to the Senate. The provisions in the bill go to the heart of Australian values. There's no doubt that Australia is a prosperous country, but we're also a country that prides itself on compassion and egalitarianism. The principle of equality of opportunity—that old 'fair go' as most Australians call it—is a core Australian value. 


This bill would ensure that the Productivity Commission, one of the key drivers of public policy development in Australia, takes account of this core value when it provides advice to government. The bill will achieve this in two ways. Firstly, it will amend section 8 of the Productivity Commission Act 1988 to add: 


… the need to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.


That would be added to the Productivity Commission's policy guidelines. This will ensure that as well as important considerations such as economic growth, industry performance, employment and regional development, the important Australian principle of the fair go is taken into account in the commission's work. The inclusion of inequality in the commission's policy guidelines has a great deal of potential to guide Australia's response to the issue. After all, while the Productivity Commission is an advisory body, their advice is given significant weight when it comes to devising public policy. 


An example of that, as we have seen recently, is the Fair Work Commission's reliance on the Productivity Commission's report in their recent decision on penalty rates. It would be an interesting exercise to consider how the Productivity Commission's advice on penalty rate cuts for some of Australia's lowest-paid workers might have looked had they been required to take inequality into account. 


The bill will also require the Productivity Commission to publish a report every five years on the extent of inequality in Australia. And this five-year cycle will be the same as that for the intergenerational reports produced by the Parliamentary Budget Office. We only have to look at the contribution of the intergenerational reports to public policy debate to get an idea of the potential impact these reports could have on shaping government's response to inequality. 


What is proposed in this bill should really be uncontroversial, yet we have heard from senators on the other side of the chamber who speak in opposition to this bill. I really am a bit perplexed as to why they do that. On the airwaves, we heard the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, and the finance minister, Senator Cormann, deny that there has been a growth in income inequality in Australia. I am not sure what planet they are on, but it surely is not the same as the planet I'm on. Do those opposite truly and honestly believe that inequality isn't growing? If they do, surely they wouldn't have an objection to an independent report from a respected body like the Productivity Commission that could confirm this and settle the manner once and for all—unless of course they don't actually believe it. The fact is that those opposite know; they know that inequality is growing in Australia. And they know that the policies of their government are contributing to that, but they're obviously embarrassed to admit it. 


The government's denial of growth in income inequality is contrary to the recent evidence. In October last year, the International Monetary Fund said that Australia was among the countries with the highest growth in income inequality. And the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia—or HILDA, as we commonly refer to it—report, released in August last year, shows that following the election of the Abbott government, household incomes started to decline in real terms. The HILDA survey found childcare costs were soaring—I think most of us know that!—particularly for low- and middle-income families, and stated these may be 'acting to increase inequality'. It also found that mortgages for young Australians aged 18 to 39 had more than doubled since 2002. And no more starkly has Australia's growing income inequality been laid bare than in a recent report from Oxfam Australia.


Over the decade since the global financial crisis, the wealth of Australia's billionaires has grown by 140 per cent—140 per cent! But at the same time, average wages have increased by 36 per cent and household wealth by only 12 per cent. The top 10 per cent of Australians own more than half of Australia's wealth, whereas the bottom 10 per cent own only 0.2 per cent. We also had a report in December last year from the Victoria University Centre of Policy Studies, which found that not only had wages growth hit record lows but the wages of the lowest-paid workers had not grown at all. A report in August last year on the Australian Digital Inclusion Index found there was a growing divide between the digital inclusion of people in high- and low-income households.


It's a matter of national shame, I believe, that in a country that is one of the most prosperous in the world in terms of average incomes we have three million Australians, including more than 700,000 children, who live below the poverty line. How can anyone deny that there's a problem with inequality in Australia when we have the 12th highest GDP per capita yet so many Australians living in poverty? But those opposite continue to bury their heads in the sand and deny that there's a problem when it comes to inequality—either that, or it suits them to deny there's a problem because it's their regressive policies that are contributing to the growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. Those on this side of the chamber, when we stand up for equality and fairness, often get accused by government senators of waging class warfare or the politics of envy. If there's one thing those opposite can be trusted to do and do well, it's to turn supporting fairness into a negative.


I want everyone to understand: the term 'class warfare' is just a clever way of ascribing a negative connotation to what is no more than advocating for a more just and equal society. That's what we on this side of the chamber do. Labor believes in fairness, believes in egalitarianism and believes these are values that Australians also hold dear.


As I've said time and time again in this place, the real class war is that being waged by the Turnbull government. It's being waged against the vulnerable and the disadvantaged on behalf of big business. And yet when Labor stands up for disadvantaged Australians it gets accused of starting the so-called class war that those opposite have been perpetuating for decades.


We have seen time and time again the government use their policies to target people on low and middle incomes. Just last year, the government cut $1.5 billion in family tax benefit part A, affecting 600,000 families. They have implemented changes to child care, which will make 279,000 families worse off from July this year. And, in a dodgy deal with the Greens, they made cuts to pensions that see some pensioners worse off by up to $14,000 a year. And this government also, through their so-called Gonski 2.0 education funding changes, will rip billions of dollars out of schools, including $68 million from schools in my home state of Tasmania over the next two years. This is on top of the billions the Abbott and Turnbull governments have already cut from education and health. Australia's access to affordable health care has been further exacerbated by the government's Medicare rebate freeze, which is making it harder and harder for low- and middle-income Australians to even see a doctor. 


It's also worth mentioning the sustained attacks by the Liberals on superannuation. Under Labor a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee was due to commence in 2019, yet under this government the superannuation guarantee remains stuck at 9.5 per cent. Now it's going after the governance of industry super funds, despite those funds providing substantially better returns for Australian workers.


Sadly, while this government continues to attack low-income earners with its policies, it looks after its mates at the big end of town. Mr Turnbull has given a $16,500 tax cut to millionaires, and he's going to give away $65 billion of tax cuts to big business without any evidence that it will have a commensurate economic benefit.


We also have the consequences of inequality, which this government has failed to take any action to address. We have falling rates of home ownership amongst young Australians, who are finding it more and more difficult to get into the housing market. We also know that wages growth has slowed to a crawl, and this is eating into the incomes of ordinary Australian families. Wages growth is now at its lowest level in 20 years and has failed to keep pace with growth in the economy or company profits. Labour productivity has grown by 20 per cent over the last decade, but at the same time there has only been a six per cent growth in real wages—that is, less than one-third of the growth in labour productivity.


As an aside, there are a number of people in this room at this moment who have worked in the union movement—and I think we're all proud to have been union industrial officers or organisers or whatever role we held there, even though those on the other side tend to think there's a negative in that—and it's interesting to note that stagnation in wages growth appears to come at a time when the number of enterprise agreements is falling. But what do we get from the other side? Instead of trying to strengthen the enterprise bargaining system, we've got a government that's doing the bidding of its mates in big business and attacking trade unions at every single turn.


It's bad enough that more and more workers are being stuck on award wages, but many are also being exploited and underpaid. It reminds me of the rip-offs in the 7-Eleven, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Caltex, Bakers Delight franchises—and the list goes on—all the areas exposed by Four Corners.


We all know this government has done nothing—not a thing—to address sham contracting or the use of labour hire arrangements to undermine the pay and conditions of workers. The government has stood by while a pay cut of up to $77 a week has been delivered to 700,000 of Australia's lowest-paid workers.


Late last year there was an opportunity to restore these penalty rates. Mr Christensen had promised he would vote to restore penalty rates, but, sadly, he reneged. He did this spectacular backflip and, amazingly, he voted against a Labor amendment that echoed the provisions of his own bill. Unlike those opposite, Labor will continue to fight for low-paid hospitality and retail workers and the penalty rates that they rely on.


The other issue I'm reminded of, as I speak today about the policy failures of this government in regard to tackling inequality, is of course its lack of action when it comes to multinational tax avoidance. I've said this several times in this place before: not only has this government failed to take real action on multinational tax avoidance; when they came to power they set about reversing a number of Labor's reforms. Our legislation to plug loopholes in Australia's transfer pricing rules and anti-avoidance provisions and to crack down on companies overvaluing assets in international transactions was wound back by this government, handing back more than a billion dollars to multinational companies.


While this government has been crying about their own anti-avoidance laws, the Australian Taxation Office confirmed in the last round of Senate estimates that those laws had not netted a single dollar from multinational tax dodgers. In fact, much of the money that has been clawed back by the tax office was thanks to anti-avoidance laws introduced under Labor, which the Liberals of course opposed. It's pretty shocking, I feel, that more than one-third of large firms and multinationals pay no tax whatsoever, according to the most recent data.


Another failure that we've debated extensively is the failure of the government to crack down on bad behaviour by Australia's banks and financial institutions. I don't know how many years and how many hundreds of stories of inappropriate lending, loan fraud, bad advice and unfairly declined insurance claims the government had to hear before they finally—quite belatedly but finally—backflipped and accepted the need for a royal commission into the banks. They were dragged kicking and screaming into accepting that there was a need for a royal commission into the banks.


Yet another area where the government has failed to act is the use of discretionary trusts to split income and minimise tax. This is a mechanism used mostly by affluent households, and something which Labor has plans to address. Our policy is quite well targeted, in fact, and will not affect charitable trusts, deceased estates or people who work in or run a small business.


It's clear that Labor is serious about tackling inequality, while those opposite are not. While tackling growing inequality is a worthwhile end in itself, we should also recognise that there are other benefits. Often the debate around income inequality is framed as balancing it against the need for economic growth, but that is a completely false dichotomy. Analysis conducted by the OECD back in 2014 found that countries where income inequality is decreasing have faster economic growth than those where it's increasing. This is a view backed up by Nobel Prize winning economist Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who explained that low-income earners tend to spend a larger proportion of their income, thereby stimulating the economy. Inequality, Stiglitz argues, leads to lower consumption and weaker aggregate demand. This argument overturns the whole theory of trickle-down economics that we keep hearing from the other side, to which conservative governments tend to subscribe. Really, there's no proof that it works, but it suits those on the other side to use this process.


Of course, the other positive outcome of addressing inequality is improving people's access to economic opportunities. My colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Dr Andrew Leigh, looked at this in 2009 as a researcher. Dr Leigh and his associates found that, in the 10 countries they studied, social mobility and equality of opportunity went down as income inequality went up. Social mobility and equality of opportunity decrease as income inequality increases. To be honest, this isn't rocket science. It stands to reason that the more resources you have, the more opportunities you have to further yourself. If child care is available and affordable, you can afford to take up regular employment. If primary health care is affordable, you're more likely to avoid the consequences of chronic health conditions. If education is affordable, you have more opportunity to further your career prospects.


As I've said, this bill should not be seen as controversial. It makes sense, if the Productivity Commission is going to take into account such things as ecological sustainability and regional development, that inequality should also be on that list. We know how important the work of the Productivity Commission is in providing advice on driving industry productivity and improving the performance of the economy as a whole. But—and this is what people really need to think about—without this legislation, put forward by my colleague Senator McAllister, we are relying entirely on the private sector for advice about inequality in Australia, because there is no mechanism that compels federal government to routinely examine inequality. This bill provides such a mechanism and makes it far more difficult for any government to avoid the uncomfortable question of whether income inequality in Australia is getting better or worse. This question, of course, is one that would be particularly uncomfortable for the present government, which explains why they are so opposed to this bill. The government, through their actions in some areas and inaction in others, are contributing to worsening inequality in Australia. It is therefore hardly surprising that they oppose measures that would help put a spotlight on inequality. This is just another sign of a government that is becoming increasingly out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians.


What those opposite don't like about this bill is, if the Productivity Commission advice for tackling inequality were to be added, it would place public pressure on the government to actually address the problem. Taking serious action to address inequality goes against the philosophy of those opposite. They hate to admit this, of course, because they know it's not a view shared by most Australians who believe in the fair go. The Liberals believe it is the responsibility of the individual, not society, to further themselves. Rather than it being your circumstances, your resources and your opportunities that influence your outcomes, they believe it is your own personal failure if you can't achieve success in life. This is a party that subscribes to the flawed notion of trickle-down economics, and its members honestly believe tax cuts to millionaires and big business will drive job creation and economic growth rather than just line the pockets of already wealthy executives.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  I rise to make a contribution to Senator McAllister's private member's Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. Inequality is rife in Australia. On this first occasion following the Christmas break, we have to talk about that very expensive and very colourful shirt the Prime Minister wore to a Christmas event in Sydney. The Prime Minister, lit up like a Christmas tree, showed up in a shirt that cost over $700 to feed the most marginalised and most disadvantaged. I think we're going to struggle to find an image in the course of 2018 that shows more powerfully how completely and totally out of touch with the Australian people this Prime Minister is. And it's not just the Prime Minister; the entire party that he represents is in a permanent mismatch between the lived experience of ordinary Australians who are struggling under the burden of increasing inequality and themselves, which is a hallmark of this government. Private members' bill debates, let's face it, in the Senate, do not always attract a great deal of attention. But this bill is actually a very important piece of legislation that, if enacted, has the potential to readdress a very significant flaw in the way in which the Productivity Commission looks at the plight of Australians, and that's why I applaud it.


Senator McAllister's bill would require the Productivity Commission to take inequality into account in the exercise of its functions. It is very important that it does, given the nature of our current society. The reality is, at the moment, it's impossible for it to do that because it is simply not enabled by the current legislative frame. The bill would also require the commission to undertake work to regularly report on the extent of inequality in Australia and its effects on the Australian economy and community. I want to endorse and echo all of the sentiments that were expressed by Senator Bilyk, in particular, her comments around the bifurcation that exists with those who are running businesses getting an advantage from driving wages down and increasing inequality. We know Henry Ford a long, long time ago doubled the wages of his employees so that they would have sufficient disposable income to be able to go out, save, and envision that they might too buy a model T Ford and that's exactly what happened. The reality is people have been cut to the bone in the amount of money they have at their disposal to purchase in their local community.


As a senator who lives on the Central Coast, who is happy to represent the whole of New South Wales, I will speak to the reality of families I met over the Christmas break on the Central Coast who were talking about how difficult it is to get their kids in uniform and back to school because they are so stretched. Energy costs, under the government of the Liberal Party at both federal and state level, have left New South Wales residents in a terrible state. The financial burden of those costs is making it very, very difficult for them to even get their kids off to a good start at the beginning of school—and I hope that I'll have sufficient time to make some remarks about the terrible cuts to school funding that are entrenching inequality into the future. But let me be clear: this issue of inequality should be at the forefront of economic debate, because inequality absolutely adversely affects economic growth and the quality of life of all Australians. 


Senator McAllister's bill embodies core Labor values and reflects what would be the priorities of a Shorten Labor government—to deal with the reality that confronts ordinary, hardworking Australians, not the privileged few who have friends in the top end of town and can afford shirts that are worth $700. It is the Australian Labor Party that is committed to tackling the most significant social, moral and economic problems of our time, and inequality is right at the heart of a core problem for this nation. 


Australians, perhaps in the course of this year, or certainly in the year following, will have a clear choice: a Labor Party that understands and accepts—and is willing to make policy to address—the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country, a Labor Party that's committed to closing the gap, a Labor Party that contrasts with an out-of-touch Liberal government that doesn't see the inequality that it is itself creating and doesn't see inequality as an issue at all. We need a party that is committed to helping all Australians, not just the top end of town to the exclusion of all others. 


Just last week, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, delivered speeches that set the scene and revealed their priorities. The contrast between the two could not have been any clearer. Not once in his major address last week did the Prime Minister mention the word 'inequality'—not once. He doesn't see it. He doesn't get it. This is despite the fact that inequality on his watch is rising to levels that we have not seen in around 75 years. The Prime Minister didn't mention cost of living either, and only once in his entire speech did he discuss wages. This is despite the reality that Australia's record low wage growth is now at around two per cent and despite the latest cost-of-living figures showing that the cost of essential items is crushing Australian families. 


I mentioned electricity, for example. The latest figures from the ABS tell us that electricity costs grew around six times more than wages. No wonder people on the coast and across the great state of New South Wales are feeling the pinch in their pocket, while the Liberal Party continues as if nothing is going wrong. This means that Australians are struggling to keep the lights on. Instead of recognising this reality, the Prime Minister stated that he will 'continue to put downward pressure on energy prices'. If he's going to continue what he is doing, he should at least be honest about what he is doing, which is putting upward pressure on prices. A failure of policy in this area is impacting every hardworking Australian. Take fuel, for another example. Fuel costs grew more than five times the growth in wages, and that means Australians are struggling to pay for petrol for their cars. The situation is not much better for health and education. The cost of hospital services and secondary education grew by more than double wages. Australians are struggling to pay for necessary health treatments and to send their children to school. 


I visited rural New South Wales last year, where families in Cobar were speaking about the extraordinary cost of putting petrol in their cars to get to the health services that they need to access. As a senator for Western Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you know more than many this reality for people in regional Australia. The cost of health in the city is already a very big barrier for people, who are trying to get to a doctor just down the road, where they might be able to get public transport. Add to that, in the regions and the remote parts of Australia, the additional cost of putting petrol in your car—a cost that's risen at five times the rate of wage growth—and we've got a burden that's growing in an extraordinary way in the parts of this country that are supposed to be represented by the National Party, who are meek and mild here in the parliament and do not stand up for the people whose voice they claim they have. They do not fight for fairness for those from the regions. 


Instead of discussing the struggles of everyday Australians of this kind, the Prime Minister's speech was focused on spruiking his $65 billion handout to multinationals and big business—$65 billion—while he's cutting funding from health and education and watching on and doing nothing about a failure of wage growth that's impacting every family pay packet that will be going home this week. 


In 2018, the Turnbull government has learnt nothing. They're still fighting to protect that well-worn trickle-down economic agenda that they have so wedded themselves to. Policymakers worldwide know it's not working. Giving money to those who have the most and waiting for it to trickle down to the poor is a lovely notion that's been totally discounted by all economists worth their salt. Yet this government and a Prime Minister wearing that shirt on Christmas Day, insulting the group of people whom he was meeting that day, are completely out of touch with what's going on. 


In contrast, Bill Shorten was focused on inequality, and Labor promises to deliver better wages for working Australians. This is because Labor's listening. Labor's heard time and time again from hardworking Australian men and women that they're struggling with record low wage growth and rising cost-of-living pressures. 


Just yesterday, with regard to private health insurance, Labor made a very, very important announcement that we will cap the premium increases at two per cent in the first two years and also task the Productivity Commission with the biggest review of the industry in 20 years to improve the quality, value and affordability of private health insurance. It might not mean much to someone who can afford a $700 shirt, but most Australians are not getting the value from putting our money into private health insurance that they once were. Labor understands this, and that's why we want to take some of the pressure off families. 


The reality is that, under Prime Ministers Abbott and Turnbull, average premiums have risen by 27 per cent while we've got the lowest wage growth in 75 years. So, families now, under this Liberal government who says they're looking after ordinary working Australians, are paying over $1,000 a year more than when the Liberals were elected—$1,000. That's a lot of money in any person's language. But, for the people in the seat of Robertson where I live, $1,000, I know, is a life-changing amount of money that I'd rather see in their pockets than in private health insurance. 


According to Oxfam last year, Australia's 33 billionaires increased their wealth by $38 billion while the growth in wages for hardworking Australians hit record lows. And this is what we've seen under the Abbott-Turnbull government: time and time again, millionaires, billionaires and multinationals continue to increase their wealth and their profits while the ordinary hardworking Australian misses out. 


Australian men and women are struggling to make a decent living. They're tired of the anxiety that's associated with insecure work and the rise of casualisation, and more so than ever. This is certainly not their fault. Australia has been described internationally—and we still hold onto this view of ourselves—as the land of opportunity, but fighting for equality of opportunity and social mobility is a fight that must continue every day, and it's certainly a fight that Labor is willing to take up to this government on their watch. 


Research by the McKell Institute tells us that where you live is more likely than ever to determine your income. I grew up in an Australia where it was about how much passion you had to get out and use your talents and abilities that was going to give you opportunities. It used to be that you could get an education at any school across this country and you had a chance. But not under this government. Access to health services and education services and opportunities are dividing us like they have never divided us before. The rich are getting richer and richer by the day; those who are at the edge are being forced and forced and forced downwards.


 Location—not your level of education—playing a large role in determining your income is not the sort of Australia that I want to be a part of. Under the Turnbull government's watch, there is no longer an opportunity for people to make their way out of difficult situations. There have been $65 million tax cuts for multinationals, billionaires and the banks. We know that there was a $16,400 a year tax cut given to millionaires. Instead of helping Australian men and women gain secure work, earn a decent wage and retire with dignity—as well as being able to afford a house and get a world-class education—the Liberals have decided to do what they can to help those who are doing just fine. 


They're cutting funding from education, creating barriers to our world-class education system. Almost 10,000 students this year will miss out on a place in Australian universities because the Turnbull government has cut $2.2 billion from that sector. Our best and brightest, who need an opportunity for a proper education, have been cut away from that opportunity—further increasing the inequality that seems to be the passion of this government. 


Under the Turnbull government, there are now 730,000 Australians unemployed, and, of concern, there are almost 1.1 million unemployed Australians who are looking for work and unable to find it—1.1 million of our fellow Australians, and the Turnbull government think they're doing a good job. They celebrate the unemployment figures, ignoring these nearly two million Australians. For our young people, the situation is even worse, with the proportion of young men and women working full-time continuing to fall in a stubbornly downward trend. That's since the GFC. Importantly, nearly one in five young people in the labour force want to work more but cannot. Again, that is something this government is ignoring. 


The under-utilisation of our labour market is bad for the economy. Our economy will not be as productive as it could be unless people are spending, saving or investing. Beyond this, insecure work can cause, or be caused by, mental illness and mental ill-health; beyond earning an income, work is a source of social interaction and a way to gain a sense of purpose. This is particularly so for young people, and insecure work and unemployment—which we know is the hallmark of the world in which they are seeking work—can have a devastating long-term consequence on their education, on their employment, on their physical and mental health and on their capacity to contribute over a lifetime to the great nation we call Australia. Beyond not recognising the issue of insecure work, again, the Turnbull government fails to mention these sorts of issues in any of their speeches. Certainly, it was absent from the Prime Minister's speech last week. Australians need, want and deserve better wages, but the Turnbull government is doing nothing about that. 


I want to, particularly, put on the record my concern about this absence of policymaking for middle Australia. We really shouldn't be surprised, because it does reflect the ethos of a Liberal Party to govern for the top end of town. They always talk about how close they are to business, but decent businesses—small businesses that are employing people on the ground—are paying good value for good workers. Sadly, they're not getting the support of this government. 


I want to put on the record in the short time that remains to me that it's not just this federal Liberal government that has this attitude; Liberal governments across the country are embodying this same sort of out-of-touch approach to governing by no longer rewarding hard work with decent wages and by continuing to choose big business and the top end of town over middle Australia. Take, for example, the New South Wales Liberal government and their transparent desire to short-change 9,000 Sydney and New South Wales trains employees. These are dedicated workers who are seeking basic working conditions and fairer wages to simply support themselves and their families. For more than six months, the Liberal government—the sister to this government here in the federal  parliament—have failed to make a fair and reasonable offer that the workers there can accept. When the New South Wales Liberal government have openly said they look forward to the day when their transport system is driverless, it is easy to see they have no respect for their workforce. It's been left to the Rail, Tram and Bus Union to fight to ensure that the men and women that they represent are not left behind and have the capacity to earn a decent wage under fair working conditions.


It's also an opportunity for me to put on the record that, as a Labor senator, I stand in solidarity with those workers, who, since having their whole workforce decimated by the Liberal government in New South Wales to the point where a new timetable has come in, are now being forced to work 13-hour shifts for 13 days in a row. They are trying to stand up for the New South Wales residents who use that transport system. There are issues of safety. Do you really want someone driving a train in the 13th hour of their 13th consecutive day? That's what New South Wales has been reduced to because of the cost cutting of the Liberals: essential services put at risk because of a lack of understanding of the need to deliver equality for all workers and for all Australians. In closing, can I say it's left to the Labor Party and unions across Australia to deliver for those most in need in middle Australia, and it's exemplified today by Senator McAllister's bill.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (11:56):  Happy New Year, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle! It's good to be back and engaging in some interesting debate. But I have to say, it is disappointing to come in and listen to contributions like the one just made. I have a lot of respect for Senator O'Neill, but some of the things that have been given to her to read out today don't quite stack up. Often, and over many years, this country's been referred to as the 'lucky country' and—as I think Senator O'Neill said herself—a land of opportunity. People have come here from distant lands over many, many years to make the most of what is on offer in this country, to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities and the level playing field that I thought we had in this country. Everyone has a chance to make a go of it here, no matter what sort of a background they come from.


Recently, we celebrated Australia Day, when many of us have the privilege of representing the minister for immigration and citizenship and reading out the minister's message at the Australia Day citizenship ceremonies. People come from wherever they've come from, countries that don't have the same nature and system of opportunity that we have here in Australia, and they seek out these opportunities that our country provides and offers to them. You talk to these people and you hear their stories about the countries they've come from and the conditions they lived under—often squalor and fear. Many of these people, under certain regimes in different countries, couldn't get ahead no matter what they did. And so they were looking forward to the opportunity to make a go of things here. These people often come here with nothing. Some people have sought refuge here as asylum seekers. Often they are at a disadvantage to those of us who were blessed enough to be born in this country, because they don't speak the language. So they start from way back there. Yet these people will take any opportunity that is thrown their way. I don't hear them complaining about it. They are grateful to have the opportunity here to be able to do these things.


My own mother-in-law came from Albania. She couldn't speak English. They had nothing with them when they came here and sought political asylum. They worked three jobs. My father-in-law, who trained as a cardiologist in Albania, came here and worked as a cleaner for an extended period of time at the Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane. They did not take a cent of welfare. They've worked very, very hard since they've been here. They were at a disadvantage, compared to the situation that those of us who were born in this country started our lives with. But they made a go of it. They've done very well. And that's because this country presented to them opportunities that they did not have in their home country of Albania. They were not allowed to choose their line of work. They were not allowed to live in the town they wanted to. That is the difference.


Listen to Senator O'Neill and some of the other contributions from those opposite and you'd be tricked into thinking we're in some awful dictatorship where people are forced to work against their will at ridiculously low wages, where they don't have a chance to do what they want to do and improve the life of the next generation of their family coming through.


It's about equality of opportunity, which I was so pleased to hear Senator O'Neill mention, versus equality of outcome. We have opportunity. We have the chance to do something: to start a business, to study, to go and do something out of our comfort zone that may well yield a benefit, that may result in a profit or a promotion at work or a new job or something like that, something to improve our lives. In my view we should be nurturing that, not equality of outcome, where no matter what you do, however little you put in, you're guaranteed to get as much as the person who busts their guts over here and risks everything—mortgages their house—to start their business, to employ the 13 or 14 people that they employ in their small business. We should be rewarding those who want to put in, who want to make a go of things, who actually want to do something not only for themselves but also, through paying tax, for this country.


We talk, or at least Senator O'Neill talks, about these business people as if they're big moguls who sit in smoke filled rooms plotting to undercut workers in this country. It's madness. We have small-to-medium business enterprises in this country that make up a huge portion of our economy. They employ a huge number of Australians. They're the ones we're talking about. They're the ones we need to help out.


So I was pleased that Senator O'Neill talked about equality of opportunity, which is important, and we should protect that at all costs. But the rest of the rhetoric, the rest of the baseless claims that were made in her address, didn't stack up with that. They were all plucked out of thin air and they all pointed to the usual Labor stance of equality of outcome, which is the wrong thing to aim for. We should be aiming for and protecting equality of opportunity. We should be empowering Australians—young Australians, older Australians and new Australians. We should be motivating and encouraging them, not shaming them. This debate is all about shaming people who do well. It is talking about profit as a dirty thing. As I said before, people who run a small business, who have started up a business for the first time and have mortgaged or sold their home—maybe they're renting because they haven't been able to afford to buy one yet—are the ones who've risked everything to set up this enterprise which employs other people.


I commend and applaud that. I applaud those people who take that risk, who contribute to the economy, who aren't looking to government to sort their life out for them. They are taking matters into their own hands, and that's what we should be fostering. We should not be shaming these people into thinking they are doing something dirty and something wrong because they have done well in business and can afford to buy a nice car, send their kids to a good school and take their family on a holiday. This sort of debate is all about shaming those who actually want to do well, and that's what annoys me about this. It is something I'm ashamed of, that we in this country have this sort of attitude towards people who take risks, who put everything on the line, who have skin in the game, and—




Senator Carol Brown:
  What schools would those be?




Senator DUNIAM:
  There are many, many good schools, Senator Brown, and I will send you—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Ignore the interjection, Senator Duniam.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I accept your admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President. I'm sure that Senator Brown, as a representative of the great state of Tasmania, agrees with me that we need to be fostering this attitude of reward for effort, encouraging rather than shaming people who wish to make a go of things in this country.


I take issue also with a couple of the things that Senator O'Neill mentioned in her speech—namely about people who can afford to buy $700 shirts. I don't know many, if any, people who would go down to the shop and pick up a $700 set of threads. If they do, good on them. This outrageous example of pointing to someone who buys a $700 shirt and then grouping everyone who is a small or medium business operator with the big end of town as nasty business people—this talk of billionaires and millionaires—who are trying to undercut the worker is madness. The people we are talking about here—people who run businesses, who employ other Australians—are not in that category at all. To inject all this rhetoric into this debate and try to paint a picture of a society in Australia where you've got lots of people drive around in Bentleys and everyone else having to hitchhike is just ridiculous.


So I don't accept the points that Senator O'Neill made in that respect. It is just that: rhetoric. It is just trying to make this debate more emotive than it needs to be. We need to be real about it and we should get real about this sort of stuff. Getting out into our regional communities, where there are lots of small-business people—farmers and the like—you would understand that this $700-shirt business is not real. It is just part of this flourish that they're putting into this.


If I can turn to Tasmania for a moment: I've been observing the state campaign in Tasmania. We're in a state election campaign. One of the Labor Party's candidates in Tasmania, a fellow by the name of David O'Byrne, who was a minister in the last government in Tasmania, penned a—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  I beg your pardon—I missed that interjection.




Senator Polley:
  The last good government!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Polley, interjecting is not helpful.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will take that interjection, because Senator Polley says it was the last good government in Tasmania. Of course, there's another minister in this chamber who was part of that government, but I'd have to invite those in the gallery and anyone listening—the seven people across the country listening today—to go and check the scoreboard because, frankly, it was not a good government. It was one that left us with a mess in our state, and the last four years have been about fixing that mess.


I want to turn now to Mr David O'Byrne—the Hon. David O'Byrne, because he was a minister and has apparently earned the title 'honourable'. He penned an opinion piece for the Mercury dated 31 August 2017, 'Fighting to reduce inequality is the Labor Party's main task'. About two-thirds of the way through his opinion piece, he says in relation to Tasmania:


Inequality is represented by the one in every two Tasmanians who cannot read or write properly.


He's right about that. That's right. We do have a system which has, over many, many years, failed to support young Tasmanians—to teach them the basics. Our education system has not delivered what it should've done. We've been off experimenting with all sorts of different types of curriculums and learning systems. But I find it a bit galling when Mr O'Byrne decides to pen an opinion piece of this nature, having sat in government as a minister around the cabinet table as part of a government that wanted to close 20 schools in regional communities. He signed off on that and now has the gall to write an opinion piece saying that inequality is represented by these one-in-two Tasmanians who cannot read or write properly. If that is the case, in terms of fighting inequality in the state of Tasmania, my home state, how does closing schools—particularly in regional communities, where kids have to travel further to get to the next school if that one shuts, where there aren't all the supports of a bigger community and where the older generations certainly didn't have the educational opportunities that the younger generations may have—address inequality where kids can't read and write properly? That is something that he needs to answer for.




Senator McKim:
  As your own minister!




Senator DUNIAM:
  Senator McKim, I'm sure, would agree that some of the policies brought in in the last four years have been good—us being the last state in Australia to have schools that went through to year 12, kids dropping out at year 10 and often not going on to do anything else. Thankfully, now we are seeing students in these schools going on to finish their secondary education—about time. It is good, and the feedback has been good—from the students, from their families, from the communities in which these schools exist and from the staff as well. I know it's not convenient when the staff take a different line to the AEU in Tasmania, but they are welcoming it. They are embracing it.


Mr O' Byrne also goes on:


Inequality is the look on the face of Tasmanians who are forced to wait 12 months to get in to the RHH after testing positive to a bowel cancer screening because they can't afford to pay to see a private specialist.


There's been a lot of talk of cuts. The last government, the Labor-Green government in Tasmania, oversaw massive cuts. This is something that we see them try and sweep aside—put under the rug—so no-one can deal with it. They cut 250 nurses from our hospitals statewide. How does cutting those supports, those vital frontline workers—which, I might add, the Hodgman Liberal government have reinstated and then some—reduce the inequality that Mr O'Byrne is now concerned enough about that he's written an op-ed about it three years after he lost his seat in the Tasmanian parliament? Words are great, but back it up with actions. He went on, finally, to say:


An interventionist government—


aka big government, with lots and lots of public servants in nice big office blocks in Hobart, is the way to go—


lifting all boats on a rising tide through a strong vision and targeted action …


That sounds great, but to me it sounds like cutting down tall poppies, shaming those who do well, work hard and take a risk, and that is something I think we need to be aware of. 


On the specifics of this bill, I heard Senator O'Neill mention in her contribution that the bill will enable the Productivity Commission to do something that it doesn't currently do. But, as I understand it, the commission under the current legislation isn't precluded from doing that. I feel that, in directing it to study something that it already can, this legislation is not entirely necessary. No-one is stopping it from doing that. It can do that, so, in that sense, it seems mildly superfluous. The bill provides for a report in the end; it enables the Productivity Commission to study, evaluate and compile a report on inequality. It doesn't change anything. The government still needs to do something after receipt of these reports. 


Again, I'm pretty sure those seven people across the country who are listening to this debate, if they haven't tuned out already—




Senator Polley:
  Five have just switched off!




Senator DUNIAM:
  Five have just switched off, said Senator Polley. They knew you were up next! I'm pretty sure those people are sick of us just commissioning reports and having a gab rather than doing the things that address the issues that have been talked about in this debate.


I've already put on record my views about how best to assist those who want to get ahead, how best to provide equality of opportunity and not shame those young people who want to get ahead and try and do well. I encourage my kids to do well. I'm sure there are some opposite who will now say that I'm an elitist because I want my kids to do well, but I'm proud of any young person who does well, who does take a risk in life, who does try and improve the lives of others, particularly in our smaller, regional communities. Directing the Productivity Commission to undertake this analysis and provide a report to government is going to do nothing, other than allow us to line the shelves in our offices with yet another report that may well never see the light of day, that will just gather dust and that will not make a jot of difference to the lives of those people we're talking about now.


I'm a very strong supporter, having done extensive work with Senator Polley and other senators on the Community Affairs References Committee, of supporting those truly in need. We can never shy away from the fact that in this country there are people truly in need. But I don't think having support for those who are in need should come at the cost of assisting those who want to get ahead. That's the thing. I think this debate sometimes comes down to there being mutual exclusivity: you've either got to support those who want to get ahead, or cut them off at the knees and give it all to those who can't do well off their own bat.


You've got to wonder, though, if this bill passed, what would it would do for Australian families? They may be struggling to pay their power bills, as Senator O'Neill talked about. No-one's doing anything to address the cost of living. In Tasmania—and I'll need to double-check this—power prices under the Labor-Green government went up something like 65 per cent in the 16 years of government down there. We had an announcement yesterday in Tasmania, where the Tasmanian government, the Hodgman Liberal government, said that, if re-elected, they would leave the National Electricity Market, which would see a significant drop in power prices. That's the kind of thing that will help Australian families who are struggling with the cost of living and will assist in this debate about trying to make Australia a fairer place in terms of the burdens that are placed on Australian household budgets.


But commissioning a report up here in Canberra, talking about it in this big room and doing nothing much else, I don't think will help those people. It is about practical initiatives. It is about going out and listening to Australians and what matters to them. It's about putting in place measures and initiatives which will assist them to deal with the problems they face, which will assist them to take advantage of the opportunities that we have in this country, which, as I started by saying today, is the lucky country. It is the land of opportunity, as Senator O'Neill said herself. In terms of providing equality of opportunity, we should be nurturing the attitude that we want to see in our young people—of entrepreneurialism, risk-taking and things like that—so that, rather than waiting for the government to fix everything, they can get up and do it themselves.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:16):  I wish you all the best for the new year, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, and I welcome Senator Jim Molan here as well. It's good to see you, Senator.




Senator Payne:
  Team New South Wales!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Team New South Wales—that's it, Senator Payne! Team New South Wales—here to fight for the good side of politics.


During the Christmas break I met with a couple of friends. They had a reunion of the Commonwealth Bank staff in Inverell just a week or so ago. Many of them are good friends, and I met with a couple there. The wife was telling me that, when she got married, almost 50 years ago, she worked for the Commonwealth Bank and she had to resign her job because, if you were married and a female, you weren't allowed to work in a Commonwealth Bank. So she had resign. And that was the case, probably, at many other institutions; I'm not just picking out the Commonwealth Bank. She had to reapply for a job. How unfair is that? That wouldn't want to be the situation today in any institution. I always say that life is about fairness and that people should be treated fairly and paid fairly. I have the opinion that, if a woman is doing the same job as a man, she should have the same pay as that man, and that is simply being fair.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you would have been familiar with the Thai Amarin restaurant at Green Square. I remember being there with you one night. During the Christmas break, Silvie and John sold the restaurant and retired. Both came here as refugees from Cambodia. Silvie's father was murdered by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, terrible people who were trying to overthrow the government. Silvie and her six siblings and her mother walked in their bare feet from Cambodia to Bangkok. They slept on the side of the road. They made their way to Australia as refugees and became great Australians, great workers. They set up their restaurant, worked hard and became very successful. That is what Australia's about. It's the land of opportunity. If you have a go, work hard, work smart and do the right thing by your customers, if you're in retail business—you provide a good product or a good service—you become successful. That's how it should be.


I'm very proud to say that I spoke about Silvie and John on Australia Day, both in Inverell and Glen Innes. We see how other countries have had to suffer like this, and luckily we haven't. I certainly hope we don't in the future. John, Silvie's husband, was also from Cambodia. They met in Sydney. John's father was also murdered, because he was in business. Pol Pot was a terrible piece of gear. Luckily, Silvie and John met. They married and were very successful in business. They had two lovely children, Janelle and Sean. They took up the opportunity that Australia offered. They were great refugees, great immigrants, proud Australians. Their siblings are still here. They've all done well. Their mother is still alive. It's a great success story from what was a terrible situation in Cambodia. That is what Australia offers—a land of opportunity.


We have good education. It could be better, of course. It could always be better. The funding has been put forward by Senator Birmingham, with a great program for fair funding throughout Australia for all public and private schools. We have good schoolteachers. I wish there was a bit more discipline, in many respects, in some of the schools. The discipline has probably eased off from our days—I can't say 'our days', Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi; you're a lot younger than me! It has eased off from back in the sixties and seventies, I should say, when there certainly was a lot more discipline.


There is the NDIS, to treat those who are disadvantaged, those who are disabled, to see they have a fair, decent standard of living—

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Collins today relating to the Medicare levy.


We've seen, time and time again, government senators—even this morning—talking down the fact that this government will increase income tax for Australians. The question that was asked related to the over $1.7 billion a year that Australians pay in Medicare levy and how much of that the Turnbull government's so-called tax cuts will give back to low- and middle-income earners in this country. We know that it's been the government's policy and that it's in their DNA to continually attack and undermine Medicare. It's who they are. It's what we have seen from each and every government of a Liberal persuasion that's come to power in this country since the introduction of Medicare.


People in our communities are talking to us about the challenges in getting access to GPs and hospitals. All of this comes down to the fact that this government is bereft of any real policy on dealing with the health crisis in this country and on ensuring that Medicare is available and that people can see a doctor when they need to. We know that because of the Turnbull government here in Canberra and the Hodgman Liberal government in my home state of Tasmania there is a health crisis in that state.



Senator Duniam interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  We have a crisis when older Tasmanians are being left on the floor in accident and emergency. Yes, it did happen. Senator Duniam can confirm that, yes, that is exactly what is happening in the hospitals. Only last week the head of surgery at Launceston General Hospital resigned—he is now heading for Queensland—because the state Liberal minister failed to negotiate with him to ensure that his duties and responsibilities were not taken away. That's exactly what this government has done in Tasmania. What does it all come back to? It comes back to the fact that the Liberal Premier of Tasmania is gutless and is unable to stand up to the Minister for Health under the Turnbull government.


What we are seeing in this country is that unless you've got a big credit card and come from the right postcode you don't have the access to health that you should. Australians pride themselves, and have for decades, on ensuring that everyone has a fair go, that they have fair access to health. We don't want an American system. We don't want that in this country. Your credit card shouldn't determine whether or not you are able to access a doctor, get into a hospital when you need to, or access pharmaceuticals.


What we see with this government is a government that has its priorities all wrong. It's attacking Medicare. It's increasing the contribution it expects from low- and middle-income earners. It's increasing taxation on these people at the same time that it's giving a $65 billion tax cut to the big end of town. It's really hard, I know, for Mr Turnbull to relate to the concerns of people in this country, but there are far too many people, in particular a lot of older people, who are unable to access good health care.



Senator Duniam interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  For Senator Duniam and others on that side to deny the true and evident facts of what's happening in Tasmanian hospitals is an outrage. I would invite the Tasmanian Liberal senators to go back to our home state, go back during the election campaign, and stand up and defend the Liberal government's cuts to health; to say to the older people who have been left on the floors at Royal Hobart Hospital and Launceston General Hospital—those patients who have had to stay in accident and emergency for up to 48 hours and even beyond—that this is acceptable. We on this side do not find it acceptable and we will always fight to ensure that Medicare is protected. We did it at the last election and we will continue to do it, because we believe in universal health care. We believe that every Australian, irrespective of where they live or how much money they earn, should have access through Medicare, because that's why it was originally introduced—by Labor, I might add.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  I would first like to say, 'Congratulations and welcome,' to my new colleague, Senator Molan, and also wish the previous Attorney-General, who is also in the chamber, all the best in his new career.


Starting off the year on motions to take note of answers, I always find it a little amusing to hear the doom and gloom from those opposite, and this year is absolutely no different. Yes, we all agree with universal health care, but the difference between those opposite and us is the fact that we actually understand that taxpayers' pockets are not a magic pudding.




Senator Abetz:
  Oh, aren't they?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  No, apparently they're not. If you want to spend money on health care and the NDIS, you actually have to raise the money first. So I thought, in the context of guaranteeing the NDIS and of the government's bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme Funding) Bill, I would remind those opposite and those in the gallery of the history to this.


This scheme is supported by all sides of parliament, but unfortunately when we came to government it was not sufficiently funded, so the government have worked very carefully to make sure that the program is fully funded for the 460,000 Australians who will benefit from this long overdue scheme. Again, the money doesn't just come out of nowhere. There is no such thing as government money. As those in the gallery know full well, the money the government spends is their money. To help fund this scheme, the government is asking Australians to contribute to it through an increase of half a percentage point in the Medicare levy, from two per cent to 2½ per cent of taxable income. This means that one-fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy, along with any underspend in any year in the NDIS, will be directed to the NDIS savings fund—a measured and prudent approach. Of course, low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income threshold for singles, families, seniors and pensioners.


This motion gives me cause to reflect on why we've had to do this and the legacy those opposite left us when we came into government. I was working in this place during the years of the Howard and Costello government, and when the Labor Party came into office in 2007 they had a budget surplus and not a cent of government debt—no debt, which meant that the taxpayers of Australia had no debt to pay back. If the coalition had continued building debt at previous levels, the gross national debt would now be over $1 trillion. The coalition has acted responsibly to cut our growth in gross debt by two-thirds to nine per cent in this year's MYEFO.


What else has this government actually done that those opposite will never ever acknowledge? It is not all doom and gloom. Some of the measures the government has introduced to actually fund the NDIS have also created jobs. Last year, in 2017, how many jobs do those opposite think were actually created? How many new jobs were created last year for Australians—brand new jobs? What those opposite will never tell you is that over 403,000 new jobs were created for Australians—the most jobs ever created in a single year. In fact, this government has now created nearly, but not quite, one million jobs since it came to office four years ago. Those opposite sit there like Chicken Little, saying the sky's going to fall down, we're going to ruin the earth or ruin the economy, but the statistics speak for themselves. The best form of welfare, and the best way to fund welfare, is by having Australians in jobs: having jobs, paying taxes, being able to look after their own families, having that sense of pride and providing money into the coffers.


What else has this government done over the last 12 months? We've cut taxes for 3.2 million small businesses which employ over 6½ million Australians. The instant asset write-off was used by 300,000 small businesses last year alone to invest in their businesses, to buy new equipment, to buy machinery and to employ new staff. We've invested a record $75 billion in national infrastructure, which, again, is money into the Australian economy and money which creates jobs. Rural exports, due to the free trade agreements and other measures this government has taken, went up 19 per cent in the last year alone. That is more money for the economy. (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:11):  Whilst I congratulate Senator Cormann on his appointment, I do have to express my disappointment with the rather lacklustre response that was provided today to Senator Collins's very important question. This was the opportunity for Senator Cormann to provide some light on the issue that the Prime Minister ducked yesterday on the Insiders program, where the Prime Minister refused to concede the truth about the impact of the coalition's tax policies on low- and middle-income Australians.


On our figures, we've said that income earners of about $55,000 per annum face a $275 tax hike. Income earners on $80,000 per annum face a $400 per annum tax hike. On our figures, this means low- and middle-income Australians face an increased tax bill of $1.7 billion. There was an opportunity—if our figures are wrong, let's hear from the coalition—but instead Senator Cormann resorted to the tired old furphy that taxes will always be higher under Labor. That furphy is just that. I have raised this issue in the chamber on a number of occasions previously. The facts do not bear out that statement.


I do agree with one thing that Senator Cormann said: if you repeat a lie over and over, it doesn't make it true. This is exactly what's happening with this particular statement. I refer to the research that's been done by Stephen Koukoulas, which I've repeated in this chamber. I know Senator Macdonald is here in the chamber and I know others who like to make these sorts of stereotypical statements about Labor's economic record. Stephen Koukoulas has shown that if we look at the tax to GDP ratio since 1980, we find that in the 10 years with the highest tax to GDP ratio eight of those 10 years were under Liberal administrations. There were only two under Labor governments. If you look at the 10 years of lowest tax to GDP ratio, you find that 10 out of 10 of those years are under Labor governments. In 1992-93 we saw tax to GDP at 20 per cent, going up to 21.5 per cent under a Labor administration in the 2013-14 year. Whilst I know that this is probably not going to stop Senator Cormann from making the same tired old comments in the future, let's just keep the facts on the table. With this particular issue, it's quite clear that Labor has a record of having a very low level of tax to GDP. Let's not hear that furphy anymore in this place.


Now, it's quite clear that this government is looking after the top end of town. They've abolished the budget repair levy. Under the Abbott government, higher income earners paid an extra two per cent on the 45 per cent tax rate, and this has been cut. They're looking out for multinationals. They're attempting to pass the $65 billion in company tax that is a ram-raid on the budget and they've ignored our calls for tax transparency and closing debt deduction loopholes. They've ruled out negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms, despite evidence that these tax breaks mainly benefit the wealthy. Up until recently, they've run a protection racket for the big banks, that have ripped off ordinary Australians, until they were dragged kicking and screaming to a royal commission this year.


Why is this stealth attack on the tax of ordinary Australians necessary? Labor fully funded the NDIS in government. The Productivity Commission said that the NDIS costs were broadly on track, and so any claims by this government that the NDIS is underfunded are absolutely not true.


Whilst the Prime Minister is making plans to take back what he gives out, workers are suffering. Wage growth is at historically low levels. Penalty rates have been cut for thousands of casualised workers, affecting job security for individuals and families. The workforce is becoming more casualised. Enterprise-bargaining rates, which have proven globally to correlate positively with wage growth, have fallen dramatically. The cost of living is going up—medical expenses, private health insurance, energy bills, groceries and education. Only Labor has a plan to restore penalty rates, cap private health insurance premium increases, address the energy crisis and tackle the rising cost of living.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:17):  In my first speech to the chamber this year, I want to wish everyone a very happy and successful 2018. I particularly welcome my new colleague, Senator Gichuhi, to the Liberal Party and to this side of the chamber. It's lovely to have her here. Senator Molan has joined us this morning as well. I wish even the Labor Party all the very best as they try to find some policies that they can afford and that are truthful.


I appreciate Senator Ketter mentioning me, pre-empting that I might talk about Labor's financial record. Senator Ketter, I have been here a long time now. I was here in the Hawke-Keating days and then in the Rudd-Gillard days. I've seen firsthand what Labor does with a budget. The bobby-dazzler of all was when Mr Keating legislated tax cuts before an election. He unexpectedly got elected. The first thing he did when he came back as Prime Minister was to repeal the legislation giving the tax cuts. Of course, we all know the famous, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' What was the first thing Prime Minister Gillard did when she was also elected unexpectedly? She introduced a carbon tax. That's just the by the way.


My colleague Senator Reynolds has already reminded the House that when the Howard government left there was $60 billion in credit—$60 billion of Australians' money in credit for a rainy day and to allow good things to be done by the new government. What happened was that the Labor government came in and, as usual, spent and spent and spent without any regard for where the money was coming from. As a result of that we ended up in a situation where the finances of our country went from $60 billion in credit to what would have got up to about $700 billion in debt if the Labor Party had continued in government on the same trajectory.


The argument, or the mention, today of the Medicare levy and the NDIS is just a subset of Labor's inability to properly manage money. Look, anyone can go out and be popular—go out to the world and promise anybody whatever they want to hear, and win votes from a public that isn't always quite as astute as perhaps they should be. The public doesn't really look at or understand how these things are paid for. So, Mr Shorten goes out and promises his audience of the day what they want to hear—and I know that to my detriment in North Queensland. Mr Shorten is in Batman, where he's having the fight of his life with the Greens political party. So, to try to win or stop the Greens candidate winning, Mr Shorten is now saying he's not going to support Adani. But when he comes to Queensland and Townsville, he's all in favour of Adani. He's all over the shop, depending on which particular audience he's talking to.


Similarly with the NDIS: Senator Cormann, on his first day as leader—and I congratulate him on his appointment, and the very lucid, clear and explanatory way he answered the questions—pointed out that the Labor Party had a good idea about the National Disability Insurance Scheme; it's just that they didn't bother to fund it. They went around and said, 'Yes, we're going to do this,' but not anywhere in the budget papers could you find where Labor had set any money aside for what was and is a very, very expensive process. I'm glad the coalition government is proceeding with the NDIS. It is now fully funded, and it means that people with disabilities will actually have a funded scheme that will assist them into the future. That's the difference between coalition governments and Labor. We don't just talk about things; we actually manage the finances so that they can be paid for. (Time expired)

Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:22):  Three-quarters of a century ago Robert Menzies made what became a famous speech about Australia's forgotten people. I've been told by some senators across the chamber that they actually enjoy hearing Robert Menzies quotes from me, because they don't hear them on any other occasion. Robert Menzies said that those forgotten people were forgotten because:


… they were not rich enough to look after themselves, but nor did they receive the protection that trade unions gave to the working classes.


That speech not only helped shape politics in the postwar years but also, apparently, is a central tenet of the Liberal Party.


But here we have today, this year, this Prime Minister, this Liberal Prime Minister, from the party of Menzies—the party of one-time lower taxes—who has actually increased taxation on Australians. They have increased the Medicare levy. The increase in the Medicare levy has the greatest impact on individuals in the third, fourth and fifth income quintiles. The second quintile—those earning $21,000 per annum—will also have their tax burden increased: $21,000 and paying more tax under this government. Let me be clear and give some examples. Someone earning $60,000 will pay an extra $300 in tax. Someone earning $80,000 will pay an extra $400. This is a tax hike on over seven million Australian workers earning less than $87,000 each year. Yet this government, this Prime Minister, is going ahead with $65 billion in tax cuts for big business. It's clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business in the form of rising personal income taxes.


Now, those opposite, and Senator Cormann during question time, attempted to rubbish the ALP on some of these figures. But let's go to the Parliamentary Budget Office and the report they put out last July, called 2017-18 budget:medium-term projections—and I'm sure the Minister for Finance has a copy. This is what they said:


Personal income tax receipts are projected by the PBO to increase by 1.6 per cent of GDP over the medium term, from 11.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 12.6 per cent of GDP in 2027-28. 


…   …   …


Once the tax 'cap' is reached, personal income tax receipts are projected by the PBO to continue to rise as a per cent of GDP as company tax receipts decline from 2023-24 as a result of the Government's Enterprise Tax Plan. The PBO projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. 


The report states that in 2023-24, personal income tax is 12.4 per cent of GDP while company tax is 4.5. By 2027-28, personal income tax is 12.6 per cent of GDP, while company tax is 4.2 per cent. So from 2023-24 to 2027-28, when the company tax rate is meant to decrease for all companies, personal income taxes rise 0.2 percentage points of GDP while company taxes decrease by 0.3 percentage points. That position was only reinforced by the PBO at the end of last year, where in another report they showed that middle-income earners are set to suffer the greatest tax burden under this government's policies.


What does this mean? First, let's consider how disheartening and frustrating this must be for Australians. What it does show is it's a government with no understanding of the effect that its policies are having on the living standards of lower- and middle-income families, and no amount of bluster from ministers opposite will conceal that fact. Healthcare costs are one of the largest items in the expenditure of ordinary Australian families. Healthcare costs are rising faster than overall CPI and faster than the incomes of most lower- and middle-income families. But I guess if you are a believer in Richie Rich economics, or if you're the Prince of Point Piper, as the Prime Minister is, you don't actually care. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (15:33):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 20 December 2017, of Lady Florence (Flo) Bjelke-Peterson, a former senator for Queensland and Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Senate, places on record its gratitude for her service to the Parliament, and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.


Alongside her husband, former Queensland Premier the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Lady Flo remains, perhaps, one of the most iconic social and political figures of late 20th century Queensland. Yet, despite the heights of political office that she came to attain, she will remain defined by her quiet but fierce devotion to her family and faith, in addition to her home state and regional and remote areas in particular. 


Born on 11 August 1920 as the eldest of two daughters to James Gilmour and his wife, Florence Mabel, Lady Flo's childhood years were spent in the cosmopolitan inner Brisbane suburb of New Farm. In those early days she led a close-knit family life, so much so that she would go on to recall her father, an accountant and company director, often walking home to visit his wife and daughters at lunchtime. These experiences helped to inform her strong focus on the family unit that would come to define much of her world view and agenda. However, the onset of the Great Depression and her father's failing eyesight ensured that her childhood years were not free from hardship.


Lady Flo was educated at New Farm State School and Brisbane Girls Grammar School, excelling in a range of subjects, but she chose to leave early and commence studies at State Commercial High School, where she passed her public service exams with great success. In short order, Lady Flo found herself working her way up the ladder of the Queensland public service, employed as the private secretary to the Queensland Commissioner for Main Roads. It was in this capacity that she would meet the then 40-year-old Joh Bjelke-Petersen, an imposing Country Party member for the district of Barambah, and a peanut farmer. They married soon after, on 31 May 1952, and Lady Flo's transition from inner-city suburbia to doyenne of regional Queensland began in earnest. Years later, Lady Flo would quip to a friend that her initial fear was that she would struggle to learn to milk the farm's dairy cows. Despite these concerns, Lady Flo settled quickly into what would be a happy, lifelong marriage to Sir Joh.


Children followed in short order, with the young couple raising John, Helen, Meg and Ruth. Lady Flo's youth, often spent at religious retreats at Alexandra House on the Sunshine Coast, had instilled in her a devout Presbyterian morality and she took on her motherly role with gusto as her husband commenced his rise towards the premiership of Queensland. Throughout Sir Joh's 19-year tenure as Premier, many of the locals of Barambah came to refer to Lady Flo as their unofficial MP. She could often be found at community events and functions, ensuring that the district's residents enjoyed the quality representation that they deserved. When asked about this, Sir Joh would readily admit, 'Flo ran the electorate for me.' Their son, John, offered a more candid assessment when he said, 'Dad was the one elected, but it was mum who did all the groundwork.' During this time, she also developed her reputation as a homemaker, and her now famous recipe for pumpkin scones remains a fixture in many regional Queensland households today.


Lady Flo's life was not one spent sitting on the sidelines, and 1981 saw her commence a political career of her own. Appointed to fill the casual vacancy left by retiring National Party senator Glen Sheil in March of that year, she entered the Senate as Australia's 15th female senator and only the third from Queensland. Lady Flo often noted that, in her view, Australia's parliament needed more female voices not simply on the floor but in senior leadership positions as well. In her first speech in this place, she did not shrink from raising her concerns about what she perceived as the declining condition of the Australian family unit and the unfair financial burden being endured by her fellow Queenslanders—twin focuses that would remain central issues for her during her time in the Senate.


Brushing past the initial scepticism of some, Lady Flo quickly developed a reputation for her independence of mind and willingness to go her own way in pursuit of what she felt was right. In fact, the first few years of her service saw her cross the floor three times on various votes. However, that independence was never mistaken for a lack of commitment to her party, the National Party. Even in the wake of her husband's split with the National Party in 1987, she remained a fixture in its party room, serving as the party's deputy leader in the Senate between 1985 and 1990. On all sides of politics, Lady Flo came to be well regarded for her non-confrontational senatorial style and emphasis on steadfast service to her state. This strong profile extended outside of the walls of parliament and helped to secure her re-election at both the 1983 and 1987 double dissolution elections.


As a passionate advocate for her state, some of Lady Flo's greatest achievements can be traced back to Queensland. She remained committed to securing investment in its struggling power infrastructure, the cutting of death duties and the lowering of taxation levels. In addition, her efforts in support of the World Expo 88 played a critical role in its success, bringing over 15.7 million visitors to Brisbane between April and October 1988 and showcasing the state that she loved to the world as part of the bicentennial celebrations. Reflecting on her tenure in the Senate, she also noted the value of her time spent on numerous Senate committees, including many years as a Temporary Chair of Committees.


Retiring from the Senate at the conclusion of her term in 1993, Lady Flo's service was not yet over. When Sir Joh was diagnosed with supranuclear palsy, she was ready by his side. As his battle with the disease took its toll, Lady Flo's undimmed love for and devotion to her husband shone through.


The remarkable life of Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen is of a kind that we are unlikely to see again. In her, we can discern a spirit of humble, unassuming and dedicated service, not simply to her state and country but to her family, friends and neighbours. That she did not set out with such high expectations is something that she would openly admit, once stating:


… when I was a little girl, I would have been absolutely amazed if you'd have told me that I would one day be married to the Premier of Queensland and become a Senator in my own right.


Nonetheless, her life has left an indelible mark on the Queensland community that she loved and was one filled with so many who returned that affection. Recent weeks have seen that sentiment borne out in the flood of letters to the editor penned to local and interstate newspapers, with many Queenslanders paying tribute to her life and legacy. I also note the fine tribute to Lady Flo and her husband, Sir Joh, from one of Australia's most consequential Indigenous leaders, Noel Pearson. He wrote last month:


I pay respect now to the couple who came to know our people after the war, who helped break our exile and returned us to our promised land, on the basis of shared religion rather than politics.


To Lady Flo's children, John, Helen, Meg and Ruth, and to all of her grandchildren, on behalf of the government I offer my sincerest condolences.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:42):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of former senator Lady Florence Isabel Bjelke-Petersen, known to all as Lady Flo, who passed away in late December 2017, at the age of 97. I commence by conveying, at the outset, the opposition's condolences to her friends and family.


Lady Flo was an outsized personality in Australian politics. Of course, she is inextricably linked to her husband, Sir Joh, the longest-serving Premier of Queensland, and, of course, she is widely associated with her famous pumpkin scones. There is no doubt that the role she played in Queensland alongside her husband is how many Australians will remember her. However, for this reason, it is easy to overlook her own contribution to national politics as a senator for 12 years.


Born in 1920 in Queensland, Lady Flo grew up in the riverside suburbs of inner Brisbane. Educated at the local state school and then at Brisbane Girls Grammar, she refined her shorthand and typing skills studying at State Commercial High School. She went on to pass the public service exam, becoming secretary to the main roads commissioner before meeting her husband in the course of her work.


As Senator Cormann has described, religion—the practice of faith, her church—was a central aspect of Lady Flo's life. She held what would be generally understood as traditional values. Many would not share her beliefs on many things, including in relation to the role of women in the home and the homogeneity of the family unit. Many would find some of her statements at best outdated and at worst simply unacceptable, but these views were formed early in her life and were solidified over time and remained a consistent and important foundation for Lady Flo in the approach she took to her political life.


Lady Flo won preselection to be a National Party senator, not without controversy given her husband's position, and was subsequently elected, in 1980, to a term commencing in July 1981, although prior to taking her place she was appointed to fill a casual vacancy, and so arrived a little earlier. She would go on to be elected in 1983 and 1987, before retiring at the end of her term in 1993. She was the first woman to be elected a senator from the National Party. During her time, she served on a number of committees, in particular the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, from 1981 to 1985, and the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. In the National Party, as Senator Cormann mentioned, she was also deputy leader in the Senate and briefly the party's whip.


When Lady Flo was first preselected, there were some who commented she would not be up to the job. However, she brought the same quiet determination, discipline and concentration to the Senate as she practised throughout her life. In some ways she might have been old-fashioned, but she was always true to her word and believed in what she did, which earned her respect from other senators across this chamber even if they vehemently opposed her positions. She also brought many years of experience of political life, which made her a perceptive interpreter of the mood of the people in her home state of Queensland, and she channelled this ability to become a politician in her own right.


There were times when her strong beliefs led her to cross the floor. For example, she voted three times with the Labor Party when she thought people were getting a bad deal on a sales tax increase proposed by the Fraser government. I'm sure this was not without consequence. Her principles led her to decline to accept the suggestion that she should serve as an Independent after her husband was deposed as Premier, recognising she had been elected as a National Party senator. She believed in keeping faith with the people of Queensland who had voted for her based on this fact. This is a worthy principle. In one obituary she was described as 'the human side of a ruthless and corrupt political machine'.


She could be tough, but she could be warm, and in character assessments made of her it is this warmth which shone through. A former Labor leader in this place, Gareth Evans, spoke about Lady Flo on the occasion of her departure from the Senate. In his remarks in the valedictory he commented that since her arrival in 1981 'she has unquestionably been a personality in her own right'. He went on to describe what he regarded as her 'genuine warmth and good humour', and he said this made her 'rather irritatingly someone that is absolutely impossible to be irritated with'. I have to say, knowing and loving Gareth Evans as we do, that is quite an extraordinary thing to say—that he finds someone impossible to be irritated with.


In the same debate, the late Senator Pat Giles, whom we spoke about here just a few months ago following her own passing, lamented that Lady Flo's pumpkin-scone-making reputation had overshadowed her own place as the champion sponge-maker of Bassendean for many years. Clearly, competition in politics takes many forms!


By the time she left the Senate in 1993, Lady Flo had outlasted her husband in political office. She retired at the age of 73 but later lamented that she did not keep going, because she felt fine mentally and physically, and she certainly continued to be politically engaged and remained a source of advice for many within the National Party.


The overarching theme from those who served in the Senate with Lady Flo was her humanity. Many senators from all sides of the chamber spoke about her common touch and her ability to form connections with people from across different walks of life. It was this relational touch, the friendships she formed and the impressions she left which underscored her approach to life. Her colleagues liked her, as did many in the community. She was held in high personal regard, and that is a very good way in which to be remembered. A woman of enduring Christian faith, she would have had no doubt about her next destination. On this day we again extend our sympathies to her family and friends.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:48):  I rise on behalf of the Nationals to acknowledge the passing of former senator, First Lady of Queensland and a giant of the Australian political scene, Lady Florence Bjelke-Petersen, affectionately known by many as Lady Flo. It's not often that a public figure possesses and is seen as such a force of life, who is known to so many who have never actually had the opportunity to meet her but who is remembered much by reputation and by her name. Along with her husband, the formidable former Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Lady Flo completely loved Queensland. I was lucky to meet Lady Flo on a number of occasions, and she provided me with such succinct advice, but what was evident to me was the complete love of where she lived and the love of people who identified as Queenslanders. I think she felt an obligation to Queensland because she had such a love for those people and that place. Her time in this Senate was very much influenced by her obligation. That's why she spoke to me—an obligation to look after Queenslanders.


She certainly left a lasting impact on the footprint of our nation. Her reputation for elegance, passion and energy preceded her in this place. Anyone who knew her can genuinely say how much she contributed to the political landscape of Queensland and beyond.


Lady Flo met her husband when she was working as a stenographer for the Queensland government, and their 53-year marriage was something many would see as a perfect story—although I'm not sure a first date at Parliament House is the romantic setting that many would imagine. As we've heard, not only was Lady Flo the driving force of her time here but she also influenced the Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, during his years of leadership in Queensland.


She was a person loved by many—her family, her community and right across the general public. They saw her as someone who would stand up for her country but certainly one who in doing that didn't need to abandon her home life in order to pursue politics. She was known for so much more than just her perfect pumpkin scones; although they were surely Australia's best scones, given their ability to be used to turn a negative story into a positive one with any visiting journalists. They'd get pumpkin scones, and she was associated with turning a few minds in that respect.


Her parliamentary career in this place was a remarkable feat of endurance, leadership and commitment. She made a name for herself. She was no longer just the wife or partner of the Queensland Premier. I can recall that, when I was a young man, so often I was introduced quite naturally to a woman as the partner: 'By the way, this is the wife of someone,' like she was an addition. Obviously, we've changed so much now to acknowledge that. It must have been difficult for her, coming here as the housewife of the Premier of Queensland, but she certainly changed minds then. They recognised that she was, in fact, a hardworking senator, absolutely ruthless in her commitment to her beloved state of Queensland and that she would deliver real outcomes for Queensland.


No doubt, some would argue that Lady Flo's initial election was a bit controversial. But no-one could possibly deny that she took her job very seriously. In the early days, it was just about Queensland—what she believed in. Very early, she crossed the floor and voted against the coalition government in this place on a sales taxation bill. That was quite early in her career; I think she was sending a clear signal about ownership, and I think that was very important. I would like to think that if she were here today all senators in this place would respect Lady Flo's values, integrity, conviction and dedication to her position as a representative, first and foremost, of regional Queensland.


As Leader of the Nationals in this place, I particularly want to acknowledge Lady Flo's devotion to the National Party. Although a Liberal Party member in her younger years in Brisbane, she adopted the Nationals brand so naturally and became what we consider to be a quintessential National Party advocate. She fought for families and businesses in regional Australia, and she was a complete National at heart. Sometimes people talk about what the difference is between conservatives: we have Liberal conservatives and National conservatives. Well, we share the same values. We would say, and I'm sure Flo would agree, that the National Party is really focused on contextualising those values in rural and regional Australia.


Many people will remember Lady Flo fondly, and we are reminded of her often. I'm sure many people in this place, one way or another, have travelled to Lady Flo's heartland country—South Burnett, Kingaroy, Wondai and some of those surrounding towns. She fought tirelessly for those towns, and, in some ways, she really put those towns on the map. When you go there, they still say, 'Welcome to Joh's country,' today. But many say, 'Welcome to Flo's country.' I think that is really a reflection on just how warmly local communities in Queensland felt about their Lady Flo. She showed all Queenslanders and all Australians the importance of fighting in quite a focused way, in her way, for small regional towns. Basically, when you say 'fight for regional towns', the reality is it's against the interests of those people advocating for the larger cities. There are more representatives in the larger cities, and many of those people who represent small businesses and regional Australia in this place would acknowledge that.


I particularly would like to acknowledge, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, that her commitment to Queensland extended to the very challenging practical efforts that she made to support the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. We've just heard a quote from Noel Pearson that the Bjelke-Petersens were 'the couple who came to know our people, to help break our exile and return us to our promised land', which was Hope Vale community. What's not well known is the work that they did to return it so they could have some ownership of their own land. Perhaps it's not well known here in this place either that it was actually Bob Katter from that other place who started the DOGITs. These are all small but significant—from Aboriginal peoples' perspective—changes in their lives. Flo was an absolute champion in that time.


Lady Flo was a real example to us all—a constant reality check about what we're in this place for. We're not here to agree or argue or disagree. We're here to represent all of those we stand for, no matter how small the population. She was a person who believed in people. She believed and loved her communities. As her daughter recalled—and if you can think about this for a moment—at the age of 90, she drove herself around some of these small towns, playing the organ regularly at nursing homes, and, if one of the local priests became a bit ill, she'd stand in for one of the local priests. This is at 90 years of age. She will always be remembered. Lady Flo made a remarkable contribution to this place and particularly to Queensland. On behalf of the Nationals, I give my deepest sympathies and condolences to her four children and all of her family and friends. Lady Flo was a great lady who we could all learn something from. Vale Lady Flo Petersen.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (15:57):  As a Queenslander, just about everyone knows of Lady Flo. Did I know her very well? No, I didn't, but I took the time to go and visit her towards the end of last year at the nursing home in Kingaroy when I visited Kingaroy. Her son, John, was there as well. I spent some time with her and had a talk with her. I remember, in my 20s, when her husband, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was on the political scene in Queensland, I was a big supporter of his. I believed in his politics and what he was doing for Queensland. Lady Flo was a woman who, I understood, started her life and career in the public service and then met Joh. Having spoken to her and her family—she was a very caring mother, a very strong believer in her faith and she was a community leader. She worked tirelessly for her community. She then got into politics, and I'd say that was possibly her forte. In listening to people in this House comment on her actions in this parliament, I understand she was a person who stood up for what she believed in—not so much that she played politics, but she played the person who she was elected to be and was representing the people of Queensland.


I do thank the government and Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Premier of Queensland, for holding a state funeral for Lady Flo. The community turned out and political leaders from all persuasions turned up to pay their respects to this special woman. I call her 'special' because, when I listened to the comments not only from her children but also from other community leaders and people of the town, they believed she was special. I'm sure other people, including myself, believe that she offered Queensland and the parliament a lot. I do offer my condolences to her children, Ruth, Helen, John and Meg. They were a very tight family. They loved their mother very much.


It was quite a blow for them to learn of her death, because it was unexpected. She was quite 'not senile' when I saw her and talked to her. She was still witty and would have a laugh and a joke, and it was only through a fall that she went downhill very quickly. So it was a tragic loss to the family. I would like to offer my condolences, on behalf of the people of Queensland, to the family and to all those who had respect for Lady Flo.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:00):  I'd like to speak to this motion as well. It is perhaps apt, as I spoke in this place in May 2005 on the condolence motion for Flo Bjelke-Petersen's husband, Joh—a motion, I should note, that was not moved by the government at the time but by an individual senator.


Lady Flo died last month in December 2017, which also marked the 30th anniversary of the end of the Bjelke-Petersen premiership in Queensland. I would like to note the positive comments people have made in regard to Flo Bjelke-Petersen's time as a senator in this chamber. I certainly, in a condolence motion, would join in sending best wishes to Flo Bjelke-Petersen's family in what is always a difficult period. No matter how old somebody lives to be, and 98 is a good innings, it is still always hard when a parent or a family member passes away.


Flo Bjelke-Petersen's time in this chamber coincided a little bit with my time as a staffer for Democrats senator Cheryl Kernot and Democrats senator John Woodley, who spent a lot of time around rural Queensland. It is certainly fair to say that Flo Bjelke-Petersen's work as a senator in this place, on behalf of her constituents and the party she represented, was such that people had a lot of positive things to say about her, which are consistent with the sorts of comments that have already been made.


As has been clear from the comments that have also already been made, her work as a senator can't be disconnected from her role as one half of the Bjelke-Petersen couple that ruled over Queensland for so long and had such a massive impact on Queensland for so long. Some people, understandably, in the context of this debate, want to point to the positives of that partnership. I feel it is very important to put on the record, as politely as I can in the context of a condolence debate, the very deep and destructive negatives of their role in Queensland. I speak as a lifelong Queenslander. I was three or four years old when Joh Bjelke-Petersen became Premier and was about 23 when he finally was kicked out by his own party under a massive cloud.


Regarding the Bjelke-Petersen partnership, it is worth noting that, in her final interview to the media before her passing, Flo Bjelke-Petersen wanted to emphasise again her desire to restore the reputation of her husband. I can understand that. That's good to see such loyalty. But I think it is important for the many, many people whose lives were destroyed—deliberately—by her husband that his legacy is not whitewashed. I think it is important to correct the record in regards to the statements of the Prime Minister, who put out a tweet at the time of Flo Bjelke-Petersen's passing. Again, of course, one should express acknowledgement for the contribution people make and express condolences to their family, but to go on and then say that Queensland's 'success and dynamism owes so much to their vision and leadership' is an attempt to whitewash history. If people are going to use somebody's passing to whitewash history, a legacy of corruption and the deliberate destroying of people's lives, then it is necessary to correct the record. Otherwise, there is a great risk of the enormous injustices of that era being revisited. Of course, good was done but a lot of harm was done.


We've had some positive comments with regard to actions regarding Aboriginal people but we have many examples, which I will not detail here, of quite destructive actions towards many Aboriginal people. To use just one example of the stockman, Johnny Koowarta, whose own land in Cape York—



The PRESIDENT:  Please resume your seat for a moment, Senator Bartlett. Senator Hanson, are you rising on a point of order?




Senator Hanson:
  This is a condolence motion for Lady Flo. It's not to talk about the politics of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Queensland and going over this issue. I'm sorry, this is not respectful to Lady Flo.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson, there is no point of order. Given it is a condolence motion, I'd remind all senators there are many forums in the chamber where political issues can be raised, but I'm afraid there's no point of order to be raised there, Senator Hanson. Senator Bartlett.




Senator BARTLETT:
  Thank you, Mr President. As I say, it is appropriate when people use somebody's death to whitewash history to at least put a small component on the record of the negatives of that person's record when it caused so much harm and so much damage to so many people's lives. I would draw attention to an article in the Courier Mail by journalist Paul Syvret at the end of December with regard to this issue and simply say that the legacy of this era is not something for commemorating. Condolences to a family regarding an individual are appropriate, but to use them to commemorate an era that caused so much harm and damage is not appropriate. It must, rather, serve as a reminder that we must never, ever repeat that. When we have a Prime Minister saying that somebody's vision and leadership was so pivotal to the success and dynamism of the state when it was actually a barrier to it, then it is necessary to put that on the record. I'm sorry, but I just know far too many people.


Thirty years later, the hurt is still so deep and so strong. And the damage done to the institution of government is so deep and strong, and there has never been any attempt on the part of those who were responsible to accept or recognise that. If that is not done, then it is up to others to point that out. Otherwise, we run a much greater risk of repeating the injustices and the deep corruption of that era, the major shredding of civil liberties and human rights abuses that occurred and the politicisation of the police force that were all justified and continued to be justified many years subsequently.

Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (16:08):  This is not my first speech. After that thinly veiled attack on Sir Joh by Senator Bartlett, I rise to support the condolence motion for Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen. My wife Fiona and I had the honour of knowing Lady Flo and her husband, Sir Joh. Sir Joh was the patron of the aircraft manufacturing company I was involved in, and our families counted Sir Joh and Lady Flo as friends.


Lady Flo was a wonderful person, filled with genuine warmth. She possessed a genteel eloquence which charmed even her political opponents. She was famous for her traditional pumpkin scones, the recipe for which still adorns the tea towels in many Queensland kitchens. Like her husband, Sir Joh—who was the greatest Premier Queensland ever had, in my opinion—Lady Flo was a staunch advocate of families, especially those from the bush and, even prior to her election, was a tireless supporter, along with her husband, of their political interests. Once elected to the Senate, Lady Flo astonished even her strongest political foes as they discovered that, behind her Country Party roots, Flo had a very shrewd political mind.


Many people who did not know Joh and Flo well did not realise there was a genuine political partnership between them in which they discussed and analysed political developments together, planned together, and together they best tried to serve the people of their home state. Like Sir Joh, Lady Flo was a committed Christian and, in an age of social ratbaggery, stood firmly for traditional values once shared by politicians across the political spectrum. Yet, despite her long political involvement with the hardened leftists who hated Sir Joh, it must often have been a trial. Lady Flo rose above it all and never lost her kind and thoughtful outlook.


In a long life well lived, Lady Flo touched so many people, my family included. It is a great consolation to know that, in passing, she is reunited in spirit with her lifelong partner and soulmate. Rest in peace, Lady Flo, and know that the world is a little brighter and certainly a better place for having had you in it.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-05,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:25):  Conservatives respect history. We mark history, unlike many who prefer to ignore it or not learn the lessons of it. On 3 February 2009 the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, who, I might say, described himself as Mr Austerity during the election campaign, said there wasn't a cigarette paper's worth of difference between his economic management and fiscal discipline and that of the previous Howard government. But on 3 February 2009 he launched what became the start of a debt avalanche, if I can say that: a $42 billion stimulus package.


It was excessive. It was targeted poorly. It delivered bad outcomes. Significantly, the consequences of that debt avalanche have been compounded by decisions on the so-called fiscally responsible side of politics. It's very frustrating. But before I get into that, I should also note that Mr Rudd is clearly a man who cherishes history, too, because he's now suing the ABC for allegedly misrepresenting his history in respect to this stimulus package. Let's remember, the $42 billion stimulus package was targeted at school halls, which many may say was a good thing to do; but those school halls often resulted in massive cost blowouts, a total of $1.7 billion more than was budgeted for them. They were installed in schools that closed shortly thereafter. They were built where they weren't necessary—all in the name of grandiose stimulus for the economy.


There was the infamous pink batts scheme, which I think Mr Rudd is suing the ABC over. Leaving aside the terrible tragedy of the four young men who lost their lives through this scheme, it had an estimated budget blowout of $5½ billion—$5½ billion in rorts and scandalous blowouts because of fiscal mismanagement. Plus there was another $42 million in remediation costs attached to that.


Then we had the cheques sent out to millions of Australians, including those who were deceased: $900 cheques were lobbing into people's post boxes, even if they weren't still alive. If you were a backpacker and had been in Australia and earnt some money, you got a $900 cheque as well. They were sent overseas. It wasn't so much a stimulus for us—it was a stimulus for people to go out and buy Chinese televisions, I think it was at the time. I remember we had those on the then government benches defending the statistics which showed a lot of that money found its way into gaming machines in hotels and saying, 'That's okay, people can choose to do what they like.' But the consequences of that were that $42 billion worth of debt was incurred chasing this stimulus dream that resulted in debt, deficit and disaster and sowed the seeds for where we currently stand: $530 billion worth of debt.


Now, of course, following suit in South Australia, we have Mr Weatherill installing the laptops of the 21st century, sending computers out to kids. That was a dud scheme from the Rudd government as well. Now they're giving free solar panels and batteries—I shouldn't say it's free: it's taxpayer-funded solar panels and batteries—to Housing Trust tenants to cover up for their lack of management of the electricity grid. Now, we are not simply picking on the Labor Party. I regret the fact that when this stimulus was brought in, the $42 billion stimulus package, the then Labor government accepted that there needed to be a fig leaf, a veneer of fiscal control, and installed a debt ceiling—a debt ceiling that would assuage the concerns of conservatives like myself who saw this runaway train before us, this avalanche of debt, that would only continue to build and build and build because politicians are addicted to doing stuff whether the country needs it or not.


We have been told since then that the stimulus package saved us from the onslaught of the financial crisis of 2008. I would reject that in its entirety. There could have been a case made for prudent spending or the application of some of the Howard government's surpluses, to have been invested in infrastructure that was going to increase productivity and that wasn't going to be thrown away to people overseas or wasn't going to be spent in a whole range of other areas. They could have built water pipelines, they could have built dams or they could have built rail lines. They could have built any number of infrastructure projects. But, instead, they chose to build school halls for schools that were closing and to send cheques to people who were deceased. It was wrong.


I would suggest also that it was the mining boom—the rivers of gold—and the exports to China as they were building things, that sustained and protected Australia from the more severe ravages of the financial crisis. This is not some great Keynesian triumph. This is sowing the seeds of economic doom for this country until we can arrest this continuing debt problem.


I might say, as we're remembering dates, that tomorrow is the 107th birthday of the great American president Ronald Reagan. If I may quote Ronald Reagan:


The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is the government spends too much.


Very few people in this place actually believe in that. I happen to. I believe that people are taxed too much and government is spending too much. I think we need to cut taxes and we need to cut the size of government. If we don't, we are going to be sentencing our future generations to intergenerational debt and to the greatest moral theft of our time; that is, we are propping up today's lifestyle at the expense of our children and our grandchildren. That's why I'll be introducing a bill to re-establish the debt ceiling that was abolished by the coalition government to make sure government lives within its means for the benefit of successive generations.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:32):  I find myself again following Senator Bernardi in a debate in the Senate today, and I thank him for raising this important issue. It certainly is a milestone that should not pass without us marking it here in this place—reflecting on it and, as he says, learning the lessons of history.


The February 2009 economic stimulus was completely excessive and obviously wasteful. It led to a shocking legacy of debt and deficit, which we are still grappling with today, not to mention the human tragedies that it caused at the time it took place. In size, $42 billion was obscene and, by its very nature, inherently wasteful. As Senator Bernardi mentioned, it led to cheques being paid to deceased people; school halls going up at campuses around the country, regardless of whether they wanted them or not, or whether it was appropriate for their school or not; and laptops being sent to schools, but no support being provided to install, service and maintain those laptops. Those laptops have long since gone, becoming technologically obsolete, and are probably sitting in landfills somewhere, which I know Senator Whish-Wilson would be very disturbed by. They were of no use to the schools for much more than the 18 months or two years they would've been able to use them. And of course, most spectacularly, there was the home insulation debacle which led to the deaths of several young installers and to many house fires.


But you don't have to rely on my view that the stimulus package was excessive, wasteful and damaging to Australia because there are many economists who share that view. I turn to the archives to take out an article by David Crowe The Australian. I should note he has since moved on to The Sydney Morning Heraldand Fairfax, and I congratulate him on his new appointment. In 17 August 2013, he was writing for The Australian and wrote an article entitled 'The stimulus we didn't really need'. He quotes a number of economists, and I want to share their views here for posterity.


Tony Makin, a professor at Griffith University who wrote three academic papers on the subject in the years following the stimulus package, is quoted as saying:


I believe it was unsuccessful and shouldn't be repeated. It sets a precedent that I think is a dangerous one. 


His view is shared by an economics professor, John Freebairn, at the University of Melbourne, who I was lucky enough to study under when I was an undergraduate student of commerce at the University of Melbourne. The article says Professor Fairbairn 'advised the Labor government on tax policy last year' and quotes him as saying there is no proof the stimulus saved the economy:


I would have thought the exchange rate, China, and the flexible labour market did a hell of a lot.


Warwick McKibbin from the Australian National University has a similar view. He said:


In case the world fell into a hole you had to be ready to put more spending out there, but you didn't need to put it out there all at once.


He was a Reserve Bank member during the crisis and he lists a number of factors that he thought played a more important role in helping avoid recession, such as a financial sector that was in good shape and was well regulated; an Australian dollar which responded to events and fell rapidly, which helped local employers and exporters and effectively led to a boost in our competitiveness; The Reserve Bank's timely action in aggressively reducing interest rates, which were cut between September 2008 and April 2009 from 7.25 per cent down to three per cent; and a number of other factors, including the massive stimulus that occurred in China and which led to an improvement in exports of many Australian products and services to China—most particularly from the mining industry, which was one of the shining lights during and after the global crisis.


It was not just academic economists who held and shared that view. Others included even the Labor Party's own Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, who, in a number of interviews following the loss of government by the Rudd government in 2013, reflected on his time as Treasury secretary and reflected on his role in the stimulus package, particularly in interviews with ABC's Sarah Ferguson in the aptly named The Killing Season, which looked into the Labor years. He was quoted at saying:


My view at the time, and it remains my view, was that there were too many measures.


I think there is no doubt the stimulus package in February 2009 was too large, was poorly designed and was hastily executed, and it has left us with a budget deficit legacy that we are still tackling today. We are still tackling the embedded decisions that were made at that time. We have not yet begun the task of paying back the money that was borrowed at the time. We are trying to get the budget package back to surplus so that we can begin paying that debt down, and it is a legacy that has gone on for too long already.


We in the coalition would have liked to have brought the budget back to surplus much sooner than we are forecasting, and we have worked very hard towards that goal. But much of the responsibility for our inability to do so unfortunately rests with parties in this chamber and decisions that they have made on savings measures proposed by the government. Time after time after time, savings measures put by the government to the chamber, including ones we have taken to an election and won a mandate for, have been refused. Billions of dollars of spending reductions have been opposed that would have helped the budget get back into shape much earlier and would have resulted in us beginning to pay down the debt much earlier than we will.


Nevertheless, we have made some very real and very welcome progress on this, and I want to spend a moment detailing that. Of course, everyone remembers the record of surpluses under the Howard and Costello government, but the Rudd and Gillard governments increased gross debt during their time in office by an average rate of 33.9 per cent per year. If we had continued on that same path when we came to office—if we hadn't changed course in the way we did following 2013—our gross national debt would have reached one $1 trillion by now. Thankfully, it is only a little bit more than $500 billion, although that is far more than any of us would like it to be. But at least it has not gone all the way to a trillion dollars, as it was set to if we had come to office and let the settings stay in place that the Labor government had put there when they lost office.


We are on track, as all the budget forecasts have confirmed—including MYEFO before Christmas last year—to bring the budget back into balance in the 2020-21 financial year and into surplus thereafter. That will be the first down payment on that debt that we'll be able to make, and it's a day that couldn't come soon enough. We're projecting that net debt will peak at 19.2 per cent of GDP in 2018-19, an amount which is $11.9 billion lower than the peak estimated just in the budget last year, and it will decline to 7.7 per cent of GDP over the medium term. 


Gross debt is projected to be $684 billion at the end of the medium term, which is around $40 billion less than was projected in the budget. However, it is still an eye-wateringly high figure of debt that will be a legacy for future generations to grapple with and pay back, if we are not able to make more progress on it in our time in this place. 


As we know, Labor accumulated $240 billion of deficits in just their six years in office, which amounted to 16.9 per cent of GDP and, with many of those spending decisions being baked in the future when we came to office, we've been able to reduce that. Still, deficits of $80 billion have been racked up, although 30 per cent less than what Labor was doing. 


Spending of course was rising again, had we made no changes to the policy settings that we were handed, to 26.5 per cent of GDP by 2023-24. Thankfully, in this financial year, it will only be 25.2 per cent and is projected to fall to 24.9 per cent by 2020-21. But it is still a number of percentage points higher than what was left by the Howard-Costello government. If we are not able to address that, we are going to inherit permanently higher levels of debt and tax, which no Australian should welcome.


One of the real achievements of this government, which was noted in the most recent MYEFO, was that real spending growth in this government has averaged only 1.9 per cent over the budget and forward estimates, which is significantly lower than the four per cent average that we inherited from Labor. Of course, we're still going to have a cash deficit this financial year. It's expected to be $23.6 billion—again, more than any of us on this side of chamber would like, but we're working to get it down—and, as I said before, projected to return to surplus in the 2020-21 financial year which will allow us to start getting those payments down.


Since the 2017-18 budget, because of the good economic news, the 400,000 jobs that were created last year and the positive developments in our economy, we have been making even more progress than we thought we would. That's a very encouraging sign, given some of the scepticism sometimes about budget forecasts. At this stage, on the early figures available, it looks like we are ahead of where we forecast we would be, and that is a pleasing thing.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:42):  I rise to make a contribution with respect to the MPI. I am indebted to Senator Bernardi for raising this issue, and it gives me a second opportunity today to talk about the economic credentials of federal Labor. 


I think Australia is indeed a lucky country in the sense that, at the time the GFC was heading around the world, we had in place a responsible Labor government which was able to take the appropriate steps to avoid the recessionary impact of the GFC. We know that, in almost every other country around the world, the GFC had a devastating impact on unemployment and economic growth, and yet we were able to avoid the worst impact of that. In fact, we continued to sail through with a period of continuous economic growth of something like 26 years through that period. 


I think it's important to remember what was in that $42 billion stimulus package. It consisted of $12.7 billion in cash payments of up to $950 to low- and middle-income earners, farmers and families; and $28.8 billion for schools, roads, housing, energy efficiency and infrastructure. It also consisted of tax breaks for small business, and $14.7 billion over two years for the Building the Education Revolution—investment in school infrastructure in every one of Australia's schools. 


I note that some of my predecessors have indicated they participated in opening many of the school halls et cetera as part of that program, and members of the coalition showed up and were involved in those opening ceremonies. No members of the coalition at any of those opening ceremonies ever complained about the Building the Education Revolution. Those halls—that infrastructure for education—was very well received. 


In 2011, we know that Wayne Swan was named world's best treasurer, winning the global Finance Minister of the Year award. I think it must really stick in the craw of coalition members opposite to know that the only other Australian treasurer to take out that prestigious award was Paul Keating in 1984 for his work in the Hawke-Keating team, which opened up the Australian economy to the introduction of foreign banks and floated the currency, matters which I think are well regarded. So, two Labor treasurers are the only Australians who have actually won the world's best treasurer award.


In the March quarter of 2009, following the stimulus package, the Australian economy grew by 0.4 per cent. In contrast, all of the G7 economies contracted in the March quarter as a group by 2.1 per cent. Of the 33 advanced economies, only two managed to grow in the March quarter. Off the back of that growth, history will record that consumer confidence rebounded. It was a timely response which was, as I indicated, backed up by the opinion of economists around the world. Australian businesses at the time were running down stock. The Australian Treasury estimated that without the package the unemployment rate would have been forecast to peak at 10 per cent instead of 8.5 per cent. With the stimulus, there were estimated to be 210,000 more people with jobs.


It's all well and good for those opposite to focus on the fiscal impacts of the stimulus package down the track, but what Labor was focused on at the time was the unknown of this impact on the Australian economy, regarded as being the most significant impact since the Great Depression. We were very mindful of the fact that as a Labor government our first objective was to ensure that we avoided a recession and the terrible consequences that that would bring. A recession has consequences for Australian families. Recessions put people out of work, and that has devastating impacts on Australian society. So I think Labor was absolutely correct to focus on this issue; to go in early with very well-targeted stimulus spending in order to try to avoid the very human cost which would have resulted had the GFC bitten and had Australia gone the way of the rest of the world into recession.


I note that there were a number of other economists around the world who praised the Australian approach at the time. Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz is one of those. He said:


In Australia the stimulus helped avoid a recession and saved up to 200,000 jobs. And new research shows that stimulus may have also actually reduced government debt over time. Evidence from the crisis suggests that, when the economy is weak, the long-run tax revenue benefits of keeping businesses afloat and people in work can be greater than the short-run expenditure on stimulus measures. That means that a well-targeted fiscal stimulus might actually reduce public debt in the long run.


We also note, and I alluded to this, that there was a Treasury briefing paper for the Senate inquiry into the economic stimulus package, and that briefing paper noted very clearly that the package prevented recession. So, once again, let's not be under any misapprehension about this—if it had not been for our timely, targeted and temporary stimulus package we would have been plunged into a recession.


I talked about that human cost which not only impacts the unemployed and Australian families in that way but also through the loss of small business. And those opposite who claim to care about what happens to small businesses should be eternally grateful that the Labor government at the time was able to prevent tens of thousands of small businesses going to the wall.


I also note that the OECD, in 2009, rated Australia's economic stimulus package quite highly. They said that the package:


… seems to have had a strong effect in cushioning the decline in employment caused by the global economic downturn.


There were a range of other economists as well that came forward and expressed their support for what the federal government had done at the time. There was an open letter, signed by a large number of Australian economists, which said:


We the undersigned economists are convinced by the evidence that the coordinated policies of the Australian Labor Government have prevented the Australian economy from a deep recession and prevented a massive increase in unemployment.


That statement was signed by a range of economists, including Raja Junankar, Professor Harcourt, Peter Kriesler, John Neville, Harry Bloch, the late Steve Dowrick, Roy Green, Elisabetta Magnani, Fiona Martin, John Quiggin, Michael Schneider, Roger Tonkin and a large number of other economists.


Even back in 2009, in a rare spirit of bipartisanship, to his credit, Mr Abbott said:


There's no doubt that the stimulus package has helped in the short term.


Once again, I want to reiterate that point: we were saved from a recession at that time.


There are a number of other sources that I would go to to highlight the importance of this particular response to a very, very serious shock to the Australian economy, but time doesn't permit me to do that. We're yet to hear about the record of the Australian Conservatives. It's easy for them to criticise what other parties do when they're in government, but they don't have a record themselves. The coalition is not serious about debt and deficit. It is proposing to introduce $65 billion company tax cuts and personal tax cuts, although this is a bit of a farce. This is a lacklustre approach.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-02-05,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:52):  Neither Labor nor the Liberals care about living within their means, and neither Labor nor the Liberals care about the next generation. The last decade of fiscal vandalism under both Labor and the Liberals proves this. A decade ago, the Commonwealth government had no net debt. Then, after five years of Labor, net debt rose to more than $6,000 per Australian. Now, after five years of the Liberals, there is more than $12,000 of net debt for every man, woman and child in Australia. And it is the children of Australia that will have to pay this back. This is immoral.


The debt has been racked up to provide handouts for the current generation without any accumulation of assets to help the next generation. For all those who have supported continued welfare spending, funded by debt—you are immoral. For all those who have supported a federal takeover of disability services, funded by debt—you are immoral. For all those who have supported ballooning spending on overweaning childcare providers, underperforming school teachers and privileged university students, all funded by debt—you are immoral.


Since my election, the Liberal Democrats have opposed all spending increases under this Liberal government, and for this the Liberal Democrats are called 'mean'. If only the next generation could contribute to this debate.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-02-05,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:54):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the subject of debt level. The $42 billion of the Rudd government's expenditure is dwarfed into insignificance when one considers the total debt level of Australia as of September 2017. But first let me make comment on the remarks of Senator Ketter. He said that Labor actually stopped Australia from losing 200,000 jobs at the time of the GFC. The fact is: the pink batts and putting money into schools programs were rorted. The whole system was rorted. It would have been better if they'd innovated and put money into infrastructure projects. We would now have dams providing the water; we would have rail; we would have bridges. That would've been far better. We'd have something to show for the money that we spent.


From research backed up by the government's own facts, I would list the following. Government debt to GDP in Australia averaged 22½ per cent from 1989 until 2016, reaching an all-time high in 2016. Australia's record government debt is equivalent to 41.10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product in 2016. As at 11 April 2017, our national debt was described by the Commonwealth of Australia as $551.75 billion; however, other verifiable sources have our debt level at over $600 billion. Australia's GDP in 2017 was approximately $1.5 trillion. These are four appalling records. Australia's net debt, which the coalition, in opposition, promised to reduce by $30 billion, has smashed through the $300 billion ceiling. The interest paid in hard cash to mostly foreign investors is now above $40 million per day, and the coalition government's net financial liabilities are nearly $600 billion for the first time ever.


As a proud senator representing the great Australian population and our economic future, I believe we need to reintroduce the debt ceiling, which was abolished in 2013, to keep the government's spending accountable so that we are not stealing prosperity from tomorrow and spending it today. A case in point: Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, thought it wise to give $90 million to a foreign education program, despite Australian schools ranking 39 out of 41 European Union and OECD countries. She is a member of parliament and supposed to be representing Australia! As One Nation, our economic policy is to manage the economy in such a way that we can assist Australians and small business so that we can create wealth, not destroy our inherent wealth by debt levels which each and every Australian has to pay back by way of tax. With ridiculous levels of debt spiralling out of control, we are committing economic suicide at the expense of the next generation.


Senator Ketter, in his comments, rattled off the names of all these economists. I go back to my maiden speech in 1996, when I said I wouldn't have an economist do my grocery shopping—that's how much faith I put in them. Where the dollars should be spent, how they should be spent, comes down to common sense. They should be put into infrastructure projects that will give Australians jobs. I could show the chamber a graph showing the increasing debt to GDP, which is now at 41 per cent, as I stated previously.


It is the duty of every political party to rein in this ever-increasing debt by reintroducing the debt ceiling. The waste must stop. Budgets based on elections must stop. Australia must begin to live within its means.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:59):  The conservatives' obsession with the stimulus package is deeply cynical and lacks any obvious grounding of any kind in the reality of our recent economic history. The truth is this: if a conservative government had been in power when the financial crisis hit, Australia would probably have looked like parts of Europe—very high unemployment, low or no growth, and austerity measures squeezing the life out of whatever signs of recovery emerged. That's not what happened. What actually happened was this: Australia's performance during the global financial crisis was the envy of governments around the world. They came to us to ask us how it was being done. The stimulus package was held up by economic institutions as a model of how to respond to the downturn.


It is astounding that at the same time that the Australian government—the Labor government—was being lauded overseas for its response to the crisis, it was being savaged at home for entirely cynical, partisan reasons by the then opposition. The legacy of that stimulus package ultimately became victim to a strategy of total war waged for cynical, political reasons by the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott. The very great shame is that that attack continues today by people who might actually know better.


The Rudd government's response to the GFC was a uniquely Australian achievement. It was something that in another universe, where we had a Liberal Party not quite so obsessed with partisan advantage, Australia could collectively have been proud of as a nation. But that's not the universe we live in. In the universe we actually live in, with this Liberal Party and this government, this party and its supporters have done everything they can to undermine and downplay what is a terrific Australian achievement.


The stimulus package worked. Australia survived the GFC, and that was a remarkable achievement. It's one that very few countries managed, and it was in no small part due to the stimulus package. We were one of only three countries out of the 35 most advanced economies that maintained a positive rate of GDP growth in both 2008 and 2009. There were just three countries, and we were one of them. I would have thought that is something to be proud of. The growth rate from 2008 to 2012 was the sixth highest in the group of advanced economies and the second-highest growth rate outside of East Asia. The Australian economy even managed to maintain a positive growth rate at the height of the GFC in 2009, while the United States' economy contracted by 2.8 per cent, the United Kingdom economy contracted by 4.3 per cent—imagine that!—Germany contracted by 5.6 per cent and Canada contracted by 2.7 per cent.


People need to think about what that means. These aren't just abstract numbers. What that means in a practical sense is that whole generations of people—young people, middle-aged people—experienced unemployment and prolonged unemployment. It has an economic impact. It has a psychological impact. It impacts on the human capital of those individuals. It impacts on the balances of those families. It impacts on their family wealth. It has a lifelong impact on those humans. It is a human impact that is incalculably damaging for those people. That's why Labor governments will always prioritise employment. That's why we'll always think that that is the single most important thing that we need to attend to when in government. That's why this nonsense about short-term spending measures to sustain economic activity ought to be put to bed. It's borne out by the statistics, and those on the other side who wish for their own narrow partisan reasons to continue to take this apart ought to think very carefully about the legacy that they are leaving.


Other people concluded the same thing. The OECD concluded that Australia's fiscal stimulus package 'was among the most effective in the OECD'. It not only 'helped to avoid a recession as usually defined' but also 'had a pivotal role in boosting overall confidence'. The OECD attributed the effectiveness of the stimulus to both the size of the measures and the speed at which it was introduced. The IMF commended the 'quick implementation of targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus' and considered that it provided a sizeable boost to domestic demand in 2009 and 2010.


The secretary of the Prime Minister's own department issued a statement a few years ago rebutting criticism of the stimulus package. Dr Parkinson said:


Rapid and large monetary and fiscal policy stimulus played a critical role in increasing effective demand and promoting the early recovery of consumer and business confidence in Australia.


Chris Richardson, the economist and a partner at Deloitte Access Economics, has described the stimulus program in perhaps the simplest terms as the right thing to do. It worked. Why do we still have a debt? Because it's very convenient for conservatives to blame current debt levels on the Rudd government's stimulus package, but there is nothing in that claim. The numbers just don't bear it out. The stimulus package constitutes less than 10 per cent of our current debt. Where did the debt come from? The IMF examined the financial records of 55 countries, drawing on what it claims to be the most comprehensive database currently available. It has identified just four periods between 1913 and 2011 during which there is what it calls fiscal profligacy in Australia's financial policies, and only two of those have occurred in the past five decades. According to their analysis, both of those periods of fiscal profligacy happened during John Howard's prime ministership, in 2003 and again between 2005 and 2007.


Our public sector debt is a continuing legacy of the poor economic decisions made by the Howard government. The mining boom delivered Australia an unusually high economic rate of growth in the mid-2000s. The government was in an extraordinarily strong financial position during that period as a result of increased personal and corporate tax receipts. What did they do with it? They didn't invest it productively. They spent it on tax cuts, middle class welfare and stimulating the economy at exactly the time when we ought to have been consolidating our savings. They did it for cynical electoral reasons, and that spending was only possible because of the mining boom. When the mining boom finished, it became apparent that this expenditure, baked in, was not affordable. Prime Minister Howard used a temporary increase in revenue to fund permanent spending, and this is the cause of the deficit that continues to affect Australia's fiscal position.


This government is now in its fifth year of governing and still looks to blame the Labor Party for every single thing that goes wrong, unwilling to take responsibility for its own decisions. This government has made no progress on addressing this in any meaningful way. Why? First, because when they are in trouble they turn first to the handbooks of the 1980s, the economic policies now so discredited, which argue that the way out of any economic problem is to provide more and more economic benefits to the wealthiest parts of the Australian community. People are over that. There's no way that the Australian public is going to sign on to give support for budgets that take from middle- and working-class families and give to very wealthy people. There's no way that the Australian public is going to sign off on $65 billion worth of corporate tax cuts at the same time as accepting a very significant increase to the personal income tax paid by people earning in that $20,000 to $80,000 range. There's no way that you can put that case to the Australian people and say that it's fair when you're in the process of dismantling the deficit levy that was paid by the top two per cent of earners in our country. Everything this government has put forward is profoundly unfair and recognised as such by the Australian people.


That's why they can't tackle the deficit. They lack the imagination and the courage to think through an economic program that will not only restore integrity to the budget and tackle the deficit but also share the costs in a fair and reasonable way across the Australian community. Until those on the other side come to grips with that and stop blaming the Labor Party, the government will find themselves without any economic plan, as they do not have at the moment.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:09):  Debt is not a dirty word and nor is deficit. Deficit is not a dirty word. It's fascinating that this MPI has been brought by Senator Bernardi to the chamber for us to sit here and debate whether or not we have too high a debt and too high a deficit. Quite simply, it actually is—and I heard his contribution earlier today—a debate about small government. He's all for small government, as are Senator Paterson and the Liberal Party.


When we think about deficits, I think about the current account deficit. The current account deficit is the one to focus on. Interestingly enough, that's both the private sector and the government sector. We look at their total spending and their total debt across the nation. It includes exports. It includes imports. It includes all economic activity. This country has run a deficit since Federation, and I don't hear them ever mention that. It's okay for private individuals or businesses—and I think everyone in this chamber has had some debt in their life, if they don't already have it, as has just about everyone who may be listening to this debate. Debt is not a dirty word; it can be a very useful thing. Governments and businesses are no different. We've run a current account deficit—big debts—since Federation because we needed that foreign investment to finance the establishment of our industries and ultimately create the employment and the communities that we've got right around this country.


Let's talk about small government because that's really what this is code for. It's interesting to hear Senator Leyonhjelm say—it doesn't surprise me, by the way—that anybody who believes in debt being spent on a social safety net is immoral. I would say it's an investment. I would say investing in a social safety net, investing in education or investing in public health care or in public housing is an investment in people and it's an investment in our community. And it pays dividends. It's good for all of us, ultimately even those in the Liberal Party in the language they understand. It's good for the economy at the end of the day. Senator Leyonhjelm also said:


If only the next generation could contribute to this debate.


I tell Senator Leyonhjelm: if the next generation or the next two, three, four or five generations could be here to contribute to this debate, what they might tell us to do is get on and do something about climate change. If we want to talk about intergenerational equity, they might tell us to act on climate change. They might also say: 'Why don't you invest in long-term infrastructure projects, productivity-enhancing projects, investments not necessarily for monetary gain but for the public good? Invest in long-term infrastructure projects if you really care about my future.' That requires going into long-term debt. I don't think there's any decent economist out there that doesn't believe that investment in capital in long-term spending is also, like an investment in people, good for our economy, good for our community and good for our country.


What's important is how you service your debt and debt serviceability, and Australia, on all metrics that measure this, isn't considered to be a risk by the investment community. If you don't want to take that as gospel from a Greens senator, go speak to the ratings agencies. There's a reason that Australian government debt and a lot of our private debt have AAA ratings, and that is that we're not considered to be a debt risk, because we can service our debt. I'd also say here, now that I have the opportunity, that I was proud to be part of a party that led the discussion on debt in the last two years, that led this government to at least state in their national accounts around budget time what kind of debt they are allocating to long-term capital versus the short-term recurrent spending. We can at least get an idea of what they're spending money on for future generation.


Unfortunately, at the moment, most of it's on the defence industry. Most of our long-term capital spending has been hidden with defence expenditure, which I don't believe is necessarily good investment for our future either when there are so many other things we could be investing in, especially continuing our record of investing in renewable energy and medical technology. I could stand here for hours and talk about the things we should be investing in rather than becoming a global arms dealer.


Nevertheless, debt's not a bad word, if it's spent the right way, and nor is deficit. We need some maturity in this debate.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:14):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance submitted by Senator Bernardi which relates to '3 February 2018, the nine-year anniversary of the former Rudd government's $42 billion stimulus package, and the urgent need to address the resultant debt and deficit'. I would like to address this in a few ways. I've heard members opposite talk about the investment by the Rudd government—how successful it was, how it achieved the objective and how it wasn't to blame for today. I'd like to go back to a statement that then Prime Minister Gillard made on 16 July 2010 in an article in The Australian. The article said:


Julia Gillard has conceded the delivery of her school-building program was flawed but she has assured voters she has learned from her mistakes.


After months of defending the $16.2 billion Building the Education Revolution scheme she oversaw when she was education minister, the Prime Minister said yesterday that errors had been made because the program had to be designed in haste to protect jobs during the global financial crisis.


The article quoted Prime Minister Gillard as saying:


Looking back now, … of course, there have been lessons learned.


The article then went on to say:


Ms Gillard said it was now clear to her that it was necessary to apply commercial expertise to the rollout of major building projects.


No surprise there. If you were spending billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, you would have thought that the starting point would be to apply some commercial nous for the simple reason that it not only impacts on the efficacy of the program but also on the unintended consequences of that program. One of those unintended consequences, having spoken to a number of people who at the time were seeking to get tradesmen or other things, was that when there was so much focus in specific areas of industry, supply and demand meant that availability and price for everyone else went downhill. It was hard to get someone at a reasonable price because all this work was being rushed out. I was just using that to highlight what members opposite were saying. It wasn't supported by Ms Gillard who herself admitted that it wasn't the success that those opposite have been saying, in fact lessons were learned. It was a failure that she promised never to do again in the context of that election.


Governments of all persuasions put funding commitments, recurrent funding commitments or spending commitments into legislation. But what we saw was an incredible increase during the period of the Rudd-Gillard and Rudd governments, which meant that Australia's gross debt was increasing at an average rate of 33.9 per cent a year. If that rate of increase had been allowed to continue unchecked, our debt would now be over $1 trillion. I hear the Greens say that debt is not a bad word, and I agree. Debt doesn't have to be a dirty word but it has to be sensible debt well managed. If you put it in the context that people in most homes and small businesses around Australia would understand, you can use debt for a mortgage on a house—or an essential asset like a car, for example, may be something that is justifiable. But, if you spend money on your day-to-day living expenses, if you end up borrowing money on your credit card to pay for your mortgage and to pay for your living expenses because you have been living above your means, most households and pretty much every small business would tell you that that is a path to ruin, which is why you need to get the spending back under control. That's the thing that the coalition government, since election in 2013, has been very focused on doing.


The growth in our gross debt has been cut by two-thirds and so, by the 2017-18 MYEFO, it's been brought back to nine per cent. The Greens were saying the credit ratings say that Australia is not a risk. But it's not because we had huge debt; it's because we have taken steps to manage the growth in our debt.


Those opposite would also have you believe that all of these spending measures have been locked in by the coalition. They are anticipating the fact that the Australian public has a short memory. Go back to the period following the election in 2013, when both Treasurer Hockey and Treasurer Morrison sought a number of times to bring legislation before the Senate to introduce savings measures to reduce the extent of government spending, which was increasing our debt and leading to a situation where we were borrowing money to pay the interest on our existing debt. That legislation was blocked, predominantly by the Labor Party and the Greens but occasionally by the Xenophon party. For those opposite to turn around and say that it's the coalition government's fault that debt has continued to rise—they are the ones who locked in many of the measures. They are the ones who blocked our attempts to cut that back. But despite their best efforts we have worked constructively with the crossbench to put in place measures to reduce growth and expenditure by two-thirds, such that we are back on a track to have net debt peak in 2018-19, at 19.2 per cent of GDP. That's about $11.9 billion lower than the peak that was estimated in the budget, and it shows that the measures taken by this government mean that we are on track to achieve a surplus and get debt under control.


As Senator Whish-Wilson said, debt doesn't have to be a dirty word, but it has to be spent on something that is useful. Much of the feedback I had during the Building the Education Revolution was that while the concept of school infrastructure was good, the focus on school halls meant that quite often people ended up with halls that they didn't really need or necessarily want at a cost that was far higher than they would have wished to pay. They felt they could have done something better with the money.


We've also had criticism from the Greens about the way this government is investing money. We've just had the release of the foreign policy white paper, and last year or the year before we had the defence white paper. Recent developments around the globe show that we live in an increasingly uncertain environment, where great powers are seeking influence and where non-state actors, such as terror groups, seek to disrupt not only our way of life but particularly our economic means of production. Given that Australia is an export nation—most of our exports by volume and, to a certain extent, by value go by sea and our import of critical items such as fuel oils come by sea—safe sea lanes of communication are absolutely important. That is why this government, for the first time, has had a defence industry policy statement and plan that recognises that defence industry is actually a fundamental input to our sovereign capability as a nation to defend ourselves. It recognises that the approach that's been taken in the past, which has seen peaks and troughs in the workload, has meant that companies have been started up, normally with high risk and cost, and then wound down or failed due to a lack of work. This government has put in place plans that will see those peaks and troughs of work levelled out so that we have work flows and jobs that will last for generations delivering the capability that Australia needs to defend our national interests, which include our economic interests.


The defence export policy was criticised by the Greens. The 2015 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, a bipartisan report that highlighted principles that led to the Defence industry policy statement, recommended that Australia move proactively to boost exports in those areas where Defence had identified that defence industry was a sovereign input to our capability. That's actually what the defence export plan does. This is not about wasting money like Building the Education Revolution. This is about a strategic investment in those defence industry sectors that are required to maintain Australia's sovereign ability to protect our national interests home and abroad.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:24):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to India, which took place from 28 October to 4 November 2017. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator HANSON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Just to speak briefly on the matter, when I was first asked to go on this delegation to India I was a bit hesitant about it because India was never on my bucket list. But I thought about it for some reasons. One of them was Adani and the coal mining and comments that I had heard about Adani back in India. I thought it was an opportunity for me to ask questions about that. Also, I wanted to know more about India and its ever-increasing population—how the country was actually moving forward and how they were faring.


I'm very pleased that I did go on the delegation with my other colleagues. It was very informative to meet with the Australian High Commissioner. There were many interesting areas, but visiting Dr Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital, which Australia donates monies to, was very beneficial. I'm very critical about foreign aid. I believe that we need to look after our own, but this hospital receives funding from Australia's Direct Aid Program to assist in training underprivileged women as nurses. It purchases equipment for learning and to support the hospital work. This has taken young girls out of their rural communities, where they'd never have a chance of training or learning, and has given them a life through learning something. But the most important thing of it all is helping the poor who are blind and the aged who would never have a chance of seeing if it weren't for this aid. Australia's aid of around $30,000 a year helps hundreds of thousands of people. That's something that I think is very beneficial.


We also spoke to the police and those dealing with counterterrorism about what they are facing in their cities. It was very interesting to talk to the governor of Telangana. We asked him and he told us that they're putting in the NBN—quite interesting. They're rolling out the NBN to 8½ million homes over five to six months at a cost of approximately US$100 per household. And it's not only the NBN; at the same time they're laying the water as well. Here we have a Third World country that can lay it to that many homes. Admittedly, it's not over the same distances as in Australia, but it did amaze me. The T-Hub, in starting up businesses, was very informative, and I think that Australia could work very closely with them in start-up businesses.


The population—it was quite amazing to see the poverty and how the people live. I think we need to be mindful of the fact that what's important to Australia is our standard of living. Ever-increasing populations—we have to ensure that we can provide housing, health and education to our own population here without increasing it and seeing poverty. I hope that one day it's not like that of India.


I must say that one of the highlights of the trip was to visit the Taj Mahal, but I will also say that it was done on our own time and at our own expense, not the taxpayers'. I'm pleased to have gone on that trip, and I've picked up a lot from my visit to India, which I hope to use on the floor of parliament and in many debates to come. Thank you.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:30):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


These documents are in response to an order of the Senate moved by my Greens colleague Senator Rice in November last year requiring the tabling of the Master Facility Agreements between the relevant state and territory governments, the Commonwealth government and the NAIF—or the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, to give it its full name. It's good to see the government, at least in this case, complying with an order of the Senate, which is becoming more and more uncommon. I acknowledge and appreciate that.


It's worth noting that the Master Facility Agreement between the state of Queensland—that is, the Palaszczuk Labor government—the Commonwealth and the NAIF occurred on 3 April 2017, as did the one with the Northern Territory. The final one was with the state of Western Australia, which didn't occur until 2 November. It took until that was provided and, indeed, an order of the Senate some weeks later, before we were actually able to see these documents. Certainly, I would say as a representative of the Greens and also as a representative of the state of Queensland that this is just another example of the lack of transparency surrounding the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.


As people would know, I am just recently back in the Senate and I am following the current Senate inquiry into the governance and operations of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which had hearings just last week in Cairns and in Darwin. I was only able to attend via phone for part of the Darwin one and my colleague Senator Rice filled in for the other part of it. Without pre-empting the findings of that committee, which still has to consider all of the evidence, a very consistent theme from many of the submissions and the witnesses has been around the lack of transparency.


Just last week in the hearing in Cairns, we had the strange situation of the Queensland Labor government putting in a written submission but then not appearing at that hearing. It's a matter for the committee as to what it does going forward, but it did not have the opportunity at a hearing in Queensland to hear from the Queensland government when everybody knows there is enormous and valid public interest—not just political wrangling of the day, but valid public interest. This is a huge amount of money, $5 billion, that's being made available to assist in infrastructure development in northern Australia. Certainly, speaking on behalf of Queensland, I can say there are some valuable and important opportunities for investment in sustainable infrastructure that assist the community in Northern Queensland.


For example, we heard a representative from the tourism industry in Cairns talk about just how crucial tourism jobs are to all of Queensland—certainly to the northern part of that state. It is a major employer and it is an employer that generates long-term ongoing sustainable jobs, not boom-bust jobs.


It's clear, certainly from the evidence to date and looking through some of these Master Facility Agreements, that we have a real problem with a bias towards megaprojects. The obvious one that has got so much attention is rail links to open up the Galilee Basin and new thermal coal deposits there, the Adani Carmichael mine being the one that has got all of the attention. We had the very unfortunate situation at the Senate committee hearing when, as all of us know you only have a limited time to hear from a witness, the first part of the questioning of the NAIF representatives themselves was about the status of the application for funding for the Aurizon project—have they put one in or not? Is it active? Is it inactive? What does inactive mean? All of that's currently a bit of argy-bargy between the state Labor government and NAIF.


Frankly, it would be much simpler, from the point of view of all of us following this, if the state Labor government said: 'We're not going to support, we'll veto any public funds being used to assist the opening up of new coalmines in the Galilee Basin.' It wouldn't matter what the status of Aurizon's application was, because they would know, as we now know, thanks to the Queensland government's appropriate, although very belated, decision to veto Adani's application for a rail line, that that would stop funding. The federal government has confirmed that.


We need transparency from all sides, frankly, and clarity about the position of the Queensland government, with regard to the opening up of coal deposits in the Galilee Basin. What the Greens would like to see is much greater transparency across the board. We're pleased that these master facility agreements have finally been tabled so that they can be properly scrutinised, but there is an ongoing need for much wider transparency. It's simply about the impact— (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:49):  I present the report of the Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator BILYK:
  by leave—As chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism, I'd like to make a few comments on the report we're presenting to the Senate today.


A vibrant, diverse and free fourth estate is an essential component for any healthy democracy.


Australians rely on quality journalism to give them access to the information they need. This helps them to make informed decisions about how they participate in democracy, as well as enriching their lives more generally. In short, public interest journalism keeps the powerful accountable. It ensures that both the Commonwealth and parliament are transparent and accountable to the Australian people.


The evidence received by the committee was clear: the Australian and global news media sectors still face significant challenges, especially in dealing with the transition to web based news delivery.


A crash in revenues from traditional business models has led to the shutting down or restructuring of many news publications.


Until recently, newspaper classifieds and commercial ads underpinned the revenue of newspapers. This has shifted quickly, and now online aggregators—especially Google and Facebook—dominate advertising in a way that was unimaginable just a few years ago.


This has meant the loss of many journalist jobs. Fewer journalists mean less coverage of important areas of public interest, less scrutiny on public institutions and less coverage of other powerful vested interests in society.


This is especially concerning given the recent spread of fake news, and its obvious corrosive effects on democracies around the world.


As well as these clear challenges, the committee took evidence of the unprecedented opportunities offered by the digital age. 


There are now larger audiences for news medias than ever before. Consumers can access information and news from devices they carry in their pockets, and this has led to the democratisation of information and communication. Perspectives that struggled to be recognised or reflected in mainstream media now can find a platform, a voice and an audience.


The committee was guided by three questions:


(1) What are the challenges and opportunities for public interest journalism?


(2) Where can the Commonwealth contribute positively to the health, diversity and financial stability of the sector, without compromising the principal of the freedom and independence of the press?


(3) If the Commonwealth can proactively support the industry, how could the costs of any initiatives be offset in the budget?


The committee received 75 submissions from individuals and organisations, and held seven hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. The committee also sought information from relevant government departments on notice.


While there was a unanimous recognition of the challenges faced, there was no firm view on how these will play out in the future. But evidence did overwhelmingly support the Commonwealth looking to see how it can assist the sector.


This marks a change. Almost six years ago, the landmark Finkelstein review, commissioned by the previous Labor government, noted challenging trends for the industry, but found there was not a case for government support, on the basis that it was too early to reach firm conclusions on the changes that were occurring at the time. Nevertheless, Finkelstein noted that the situation was changing rapidly, and required careful and continuous monitoring and made a number of recommendations that trends in, and the health of, the industry be charted.


Evidence presented to our committee suggested there is now a more clear case for the Commonwealth to step in, at least in some limited areas. Indeed, even some witnesses who worked on Finkelstein, and felt there was no need for Commonwealth assistance at that time, told the committee that their opinions had changed.


The pace of change in the sector has meant that there have been significant developments even over the course of the inquiry.


Journalists have continued to be laid off, both from large masthead newspapers, as well as from the collapse of smaller new players. As this report was finalised we received the sad news that Crinkling News, Australia's only newspaper for kids, had closed down due to financial pressures.


2017 also saw parliament pass the government's broadcasting amendments. This legislation did not address the problem of Australia having one of the highest levels of media ownership concentration in the world. In fact it made the situation worse through the abolition of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule which, until recently, prohibited a person from controlling all three regulated forms of media—commercial radio, commercial TV and associated newspapers—in the one licence area.


By repealing this rule, the Turnbull government handed unprecedented powers to a privileged few media operators—permitting them to consolidate even further in Australia's already highly concentrated media landscape.


In order to secure passage of the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule in the Senate, the government had to do a number of deals with the crossbench. Some of these are being considered by other Senate committees at the moment, including the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund that was announced at the eleventh hour as a trade-off for Nick Xenophon's support for the repeal of the two-out-of-three media diversity safeguard.


Alas, for outfits like Crinkling News, this short-term fund is a case of too little, too late. The deal done with One Nation is a blatant attack on our national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, who were used as bargaining chips in the media ownership changes. It is obvious that the measures secured by One Nation, which include three bills to tamper with the ABC and SBS acts and charters and a 'competitive neutrality inquiry', are not motivated by any good policy rationale or public good but, rather, a political vendetta by one party uncomfortable with being scrutinised by investigative journalists.


Other developments that have occurred over the course of the inquiry include significant policy announcements by digital platforms on matters which impact the news media, as well as indications that the level of cooperation and partnership between digital platforms and the news media has deepened and will continue to evolve. For example, Google announced the end of its 'first click free' policy in October 2017, Google and Fairfax Media announced an advertising partnership in December 2017 and, in January 2018, Facebook announced changes to News Feed. Most significantly, last year the Commonwealth directed the ACCC to inquire into the market powers of aggregators, and the challenge this poses to public interest journalism. Given the expertise and the resources of the ACCC, this committee has made no recommendations in this area for the Commonwealth, but looks forward to the ACCC's report in 2019.


Given the ongoing pace of change, the committee's recommendations have focused on some practical measures for the Commonwealth to bolster public interest journalism. 


There was compelling evidence that the not-for-profit sector has led a revival in journalism in the US. In particular, private philanthropy has allowed many new or existing organisations to invest more heavily in quality journalism.


Given this, the committee has recommended the Commonwealth develop a framework for extending 'deductible gift recipient'—or 'DGR'—status to not-for-profit news organisations that adhere to standards of public interest journalism.


The committee has also recommended that the government should investigate the value of offering every Australian the ability to claim subscriptions to trustworthy news providers as a tax deduction.


The capacity of the ABC and SBS for public interest journalism has no doubt been impacted by hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts under the government.


The committee recommended that the ABC and SBS, bastions of trusted, public interest journalism in Australia, be funded adequately. This means resourcing for its service delivery in regional and rural areas, and for its fact-checking capacity.


Additionally, evidence suggested that the community media sector should be given some surety for its future funding. This would allow it to plan effectively, especially considering the ongoing rollout of digital services across Australia.


The committee also heard that the Commonwealth should consider where legal frameworks could be reformed or harmonised—in association with states and territories—so that journalists can get on with their important work without undue restriction.


Where there is a lack of clarity in these laws, there should be more information. Where there is injustice, there should be reform. Any review of defamation laws should look at whether they strike an appropriate balance between promoting public interest journalism and the right of individuals to protection from reputational harm. This would allow journalists to get on with the important job of covering issues that are in the public interest.


As the chair for the final stage of the committee, I acknowledge the work of the senators who served on this committee, as well as the committee secretariat.


I would like to thank the many witnesses who gave evidence—either through submissions or public hearings. These included, but were not limited to, journalists, academics and representatives of media and technology companies.


It's with great pleasure that I commend the report to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I'd also like to speak on this report. This was an important inquiry. It was far-reaching and looked at the current state and future of public interest journalism in Australia at a time when we know that trust and public belief in politics, in our politicians, in our public institutions—indeed in big business and even our major banks—is so low. We need, more than ever, a robust and well-supported public interest journalism sector. 


What is very clear from this inquiry is that journalism in this country is under immense pressure. Some of the figures that we got as a committee were very stark. In March last year the committee was told that at least 2,500 journalist jobs had been lost across the country in the past six years. That is, of course, a number that has got worse in the last 12 months. We know that there have been job losses at Fairfax. There have been job losses at News Corp and a myriad of other media outfits and organisations. Senator Bilyk mentioned that Australia's only children's newspaper, Crinkling News, is having to close its doors because it just can't manage to pay the bills and produce good quality journalism for Australia's children. 


We're at a crisis point in Australia when it comes to public interest journalism. We need it more than ever, and yet it has less support. This report and this inquiry tried to outline a number of different things and looked at a number of different ways that we could support public interest journalism in Australia to recognise the crucial role that it plays in our community, our news and our democracy. If the public are disillusioned with politicians and politics, if they don't believe that we are acting in their best interests and if they don't have access to information about what their democratic rights are, what their parliament is doing and what their elected officials are doing, that discontent is only going to grow. I would put to you that, at this moment, when trust and belief in politics is so low, the best thing that we could all be doing is actually supporting one of those institutions that the public so desperately wants to be able to rely on. Our public broadcasters, ABC and the SBS, are by far the most trusted news services in the country. Time and time again they rate as the most trusted institutions and they rate well above the rest when it comes to trust in news.


As parliamentarians in this place and as responsible members of the government on the other side who tick off on their government's budgets year in, year out, I urge you to think about what needs to be done to support our public broadcasters to continue doing the good job of reporting the news, shedding light on democracy and our democratic institutions and ensuring that all of us are held to account to reinstate the trust of the public and the community in our public institutions. 


Since this committee has been gathering evidence and seeking submissions, there have been a number of key changes. We've seen media reform laws pass this parliament. Some elements of those have been welcomed and others have fallen way short of what is needed to support public interest journalism across the country.


One of the most concerning things that has happened since this inquiry has been underway was the tabling of the new espionage legislation announced by the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in December. It is meant to be about looking at foreign donations but in fact is going to put a spear through the heart of journalism in this country because it is effectively going to outlaw particular parts of investigative journalism and the ability of journalists in this country to inquire into and expose what our governments are doing, what our parliament is doing. In fact, under these new proposed laws, those journalists involved in the extraordinary story of the cabinet files discovered last week would have risked 15 years jail. That is what this current legislation, tabled by the Prime Minister, says. 


I've heard a lot of the public commentary about this over the last few weeks and I urge the government to think very seriously about how they can amend this legislation to ensure that we allow journalists to keep doing their jobs. We need transparency in politics. We need transparency in the decisions made by the government in the name of the Australian people, and part of that is to ensure journalists can do their jobs without the fear of jail time, arrest and intimidation. In fact, in the inquiry that this report has come from, the suggestion was that the current laws are actually too harsh, that whistleblower protections need to be strengthened in order to allow journalists to do their jobs properly, to ensure that transparency is protected and that journalists are able to report on things without fear or favour. These new laws, as announced by the Prime Minister, currently being inquired by the Senate, will mean that those restrictions and that intimidation is only going to get worse.


Turkey, China and Egypt topped the list of countries last year for the worst conditions for journalists and the most jail time for journalists. I say to the government, and I see the Minister for Communications is sitting in the chamber here today, let's not make Australia part of that list in 2018. Let's make sure we protect the rights of journalists to continue to do their vital and important jobs.


There are a number of key recommendations that this report has highlighted that go to trying to find ways to support and protect public interest journalism and the very important role that it plays in our democracy. DGR status for non-profits is a good step forward, and I urge the government to think again about how this can be done. I know we've had conversations about this previously. Please consider that this is something that is not going to go away. The calls for proper support for our various journalism and media outlets, particularly those non-profits, are only going to grow louder as the public becomes more and more desperate for truth in politics and truth in our media. There are a number of other recommendations, whistleblower laws, and funding being supported and secured for our public broadcasters—crucial, I would say, in today's age. I urge the minister to look carefully at this report and to consider these issues going into the 2018 budget.


As I finish, I want to reflect on one of the saddest things that has happened in the past week. That of course is the passing of the veteran Age journalist Michael Gordon. When we talk about a contribution to public interest journalism, Michael was well ahead of the pack. He was a fantastic journalist, a beautiful storyteller and one of the nicest blokes any of us in this place has ever met. I say to Michael's family and to his friends and colleagues: we're all very sorry on Michael's passing. This place is going to be much poorer now that he's not around.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:10):  I was intending to rise to speak briefly to the report, but can I commence my comments by supporting those of Senator Hanson-Young in relation to Michael Gordon. He was, as those who knew him know, a wonderful man. He was a thoughtful and an elegant writer, and he was the finest of journalists. His passing is one that brings great sadness to this building and to those who knew him and worked with him. His like comes along very infrequently in journalism.


I also want to remember some former colleagues who are no longer with us in this place but who were part of the drive behind this report—namely, Sam Dastyari and Scott Ludlam. In particular, I acknowledge Scott Ludlam, whom I used to have as one of my shadows. He was a very positive, very constructive colleague to deal with in this space.


All colleagues would be aware that in parallel with this inquiry work we had the media reform package, which the government believes does some practical and concrete things to help improve the viability of Australian media organisations. We need good, strong Australia media organisations to ensure that we have vibrant journalism. As often as we may be frustrated by what they blog and post and print and broadcast, what they do is nevertheless one of the important underpinnings of our democracy and ensures that we have robust, vigorous and accountable public discourse. For our part, we on the government benches do believe we made some positive contributions. I think that is reflected in the fact that essentially all major Australian media organisations supported the package. It enjoyed the support of this chamber and a number of crossbench senators. I know that we weren't able to get colleagues from the opposition and colleagues from the Greens to join with us in supporting that package, but I acknowledge that there are elements of the package that were supported by colleagues opposite and in the corner. Again, I take the opportunity to say that all of the dealings that I had with colleagues in this place on the package, whether they ended up voting for it or not, were positive and constructive. This area of public interest journalism is one that I'm sure we, as a parliament, will continue to discuss. It is important. I do hope that we can continue to work together to ensure that we have good, strong, journalism in Australia.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I'm going to take it that Senator Bilyk moved to take note of the report and I'm also going to ask if it is peoples' wish that we seek leave to continue those remarks. There being no opposition to that, it is so moved. Thank you.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:49):  I present the report of the Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator BILYK:
  by leave—As chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism, I'd like to make a few comments on the report we're presenting to the Senate today.


A vibrant, diverse and free fourth estate is an essential component for any healthy democracy.


Australians rely on quality journalism to give them access to the information they need. This helps them to make informed decisions about how they participate in democracy, as well as enriching their lives more generally. In short, public interest journalism keeps the powerful accountable. It ensures that both the Commonwealth and parliament are transparent and accountable to the Australian people.


The evidence received by the committee was clear: the Australian and global news media sectors still face significant challenges, especially in dealing with the transition to web based news delivery.


A crash in revenues from traditional business models has led to the shutting down or restructuring of many news publications.


Until recently, newspaper classifieds and commercial ads underpinned the revenue of newspapers. This has shifted quickly, and now online aggregators—especially Google and Facebook—dominate advertising in a way that was unimaginable just a few years ago.


This has meant the loss of many journalist jobs. Fewer journalists mean less coverage of important areas of public interest, less scrutiny on public institutions and less coverage of other powerful vested interests in society.


This is especially concerning given the recent spread of fake news, and its obvious corrosive effects on democracies around the world.


As well as these clear challenges, the committee took evidence of the unprecedented opportunities offered by the digital age. 


There are now larger audiences for news medias than ever before. Consumers can access information and news from devices they carry in their pockets, and this has led to the democratisation of information and communication. Perspectives that struggled to be recognised or reflected in mainstream media now can find a platform, a voice and an audience.


The committee was guided by three questions:


(1) What are the challenges and opportunities for public interest journalism?


(2) Where can the Commonwealth contribute positively to the health, diversity and financial stability of the sector, without compromising the principal of the freedom and independence of the press?


(3) If the Commonwealth can proactively support the industry, how could the costs of any initiatives be offset in the budget?


The committee received 75 submissions from individuals and organisations, and held seven hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. The committee also sought information from relevant government departments on notice.


While there was a unanimous recognition of the challenges faced, there was no firm view on how these will play out in the future. But evidence did overwhelmingly support the Commonwealth looking to see how it can assist the sector.


This marks a change. Almost six years ago, the landmark Finkelstein review, commissioned by the previous Labor government, noted challenging trends for the industry, but found there was not a case for government support, on the basis that it was too early to reach firm conclusions on the changes that were occurring at the time. Nevertheless, Finkelstein noted that the situation was changing rapidly, and required careful and continuous monitoring and made a number of recommendations that trends in, and the health of, the industry be charted.


Evidence presented to our committee suggested there is now a more clear case for the Commonwealth to step in, at least in some limited areas. Indeed, even some witnesses who worked on Finkelstein, and felt there was no need for Commonwealth assistance at that time, told the committee that their opinions had changed.


The pace of change in the sector has meant that there have been significant developments even over the course of the inquiry.


Journalists have continued to be laid off, both from large masthead newspapers, as well as from the collapse of smaller new players. As this report was finalised we received the sad news that Crinkling News, Australia's only newspaper for kids, had closed down due to financial pressures.


2017 also saw parliament pass the government's broadcasting amendments. This legislation did not address the problem of Australia having one of the highest levels of media ownership concentration in the world. In fact it made the situation worse through the abolition of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule which, until recently, prohibited a person from controlling all three regulated forms of media—commercial radio, commercial TV and associated newspapers—in the one licence area.


By repealing this rule, the Turnbull government handed unprecedented powers to a privileged few media operators—permitting them to consolidate even further in Australia's already highly concentrated media landscape.


In order to secure passage of the repeal of the two-out-of-three rule in the Senate, the government had to do a number of deals with the crossbench. Some of these are being considered by other Senate committees at the moment, including the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund that was announced at the eleventh hour as a trade-off for Nick Xenophon's support for the repeal of the two-out-of-three media diversity safeguard.


Alas, for outfits like Crinkling News, this short-term fund is a case of too little, too late. The deal done with One Nation is a blatant attack on our national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, who were used as bargaining chips in the media ownership changes. It is obvious that the measures secured by One Nation, which include three bills to tamper with the ABC and SBS acts and charters and a 'competitive neutrality inquiry', are not motivated by any good policy rationale or public good but, rather, a political vendetta by one party uncomfortable with being scrutinised by investigative journalists.


Other developments that have occurred over the course of the inquiry include significant policy announcements by digital platforms on matters which impact the news media, as well as indications that the level of cooperation and partnership between digital platforms and the news media has deepened and will continue to evolve. For example, Google announced the end of its 'first click free' policy in October 2017, Google and Fairfax Media announced an advertising partnership in December 2017 and, in January 2018, Facebook announced changes to News Feed. Most significantly, last year the Commonwealth directed the ACCC to inquire into the market powers of aggregators, and the challenge this poses to public interest journalism. Given the expertise and the resources of the ACCC, this committee has made no recommendations in this area for the Commonwealth, but looks forward to the ACCC's report in 2019.


Given the ongoing pace of change, the committee's recommendations have focused on some practical measures for the Commonwealth to bolster public interest journalism. 


There was compelling evidence that the not-for-profit sector has led a revival in journalism in the US. In particular, private philanthropy has allowed many new or existing organisations to invest more heavily in quality journalism.


Given this, the committee has recommended the Commonwealth develop a framework for extending 'deductible gift recipient'—or 'DGR'—status to not-for-profit news organisations that adhere to standards of public interest journalism.


The committee has also recommended that the government should investigate the value of offering every Australian the ability to claim subscriptions to trustworthy news providers as a tax deduction.


The capacity of the ABC and SBS for public interest journalism has no doubt been impacted by hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts under the government.


The committee recommended that the ABC and SBS, bastions of trusted, public interest journalism in Australia, be funded adequately. This means resourcing for its service delivery in regional and rural areas, and for its fact-checking capacity.


Additionally, evidence suggested that the community media sector should be given some surety for its future funding. This would allow it to plan effectively, especially considering the ongoing rollout of digital services across Australia.


The committee also heard that the Commonwealth should consider where legal frameworks could be reformed or harmonised—in association with states and territories—so that journalists can get on with their important work without undue restriction.


Where there is a lack of clarity in these laws, there should be more information. Where there is injustice, there should be reform. Any review of defamation laws should look at whether they strike an appropriate balance between promoting public interest journalism and the right of individuals to protection from reputational harm. This would allow journalists to get on with the important job of covering issues that are in the public interest.


As the chair for the final stage of the committee, I acknowledge the work of the senators who served on this committee, as well as the committee secretariat.


I would like to thank the many witnesses who gave evidence—either through submissions or public hearings. These included, but were not limited to, journalists, academics and representatives of media and technology companies.


It's with great pleasure that I commend the report to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I'd also like to speak on this report. This was an important inquiry. It was far-reaching and looked at the current state and future of public interest journalism in Australia at a time when we know that trust and public belief in politics, in our politicians, in our public institutions—indeed in big business and even our major banks—is so low. We need, more than ever, a robust and well-supported public interest journalism sector. 


What is very clear from this inquiry is that journalism in this country is under immense pressure. Some of the figures that we got as a committee were very stark. In March last year the committee was told that at least 2,500 journalist jobs had been lost across the country in the past six years. That is, of course, a number that has got worse in the last 12 months. We know that there have been job losses at Fairfax. There have been job losses at News Corp and a myriad of other media outfits and organisations. Senator Bilyk mentioned that Australia's only children's newspaper, Crinkling News, is having to close its doors because it just can't manage to pay the bills and produce good quality journalism for Australia's children. 


We're at a crisis point in Australia when it comes to public interest journalism. We need it more than ever, and yet it has less support. This report and this inquiry tried to outline a number of different things and looked at a number of different ways that we could support public interest journalism in Australia to recognise the crucial role that it plays in our community, our news and our democracy. If the public are disillusioned with politicians and politics, if they don't believe that we are acting in their best interests and if they don't have access to information about what their democratic rights are, what their parliament is doing and what their elected officials are doing, that discontent is only going to grow. I would put to you that, at this moment, when trust and belief in politics is so low, the best thing that we could all be doing is actually supporting one of those institutions that the public so desperately wants to be able to rely on. Our public broadcasters, ABC and the SBS, are by far the most trusted news services in the country. Time and time again they rate as the most trusted institutions and they rate well above the rest when it comes to trust in news.


As parliamentarians in this place and as responsible members of the government on the other side who tick off on their government's budgets year in, year out, I urge you to think about what needs to be done to support our public broadcasters to continue doing the good job of reporting the news, shedding light on democracy and our democratic institutions and ensuring that all of us are held to account to reinstate the trust of the public and the community in our public institutions. 


Since this committee has been gathering evidence and seeking submissions, there have been a number of key changes. We've seen media reform laws pass this parliament. Some elements of those have been welcomed and others have fallen way short of what is needed to support public interest journalism across the country.


One of the most concerning things that has happened since this inquiry has been underway was the tabling of the new espionage legislation announced by the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in December. It is meant to be about looking at foreign donations but in fact is going to put a spear through the heart of journalism in this country because it is effectively going to outlaw particular parts of investigative journalism and the ability of journalists in this country to inquire into and expose what our governments are doing, what our parliament is doing. In fact, under these new proposed laws, those journalists involved in the extraordinary story of the cabinet files discovered last week would have risked 15 years jail. That is what this current legislation, tabled by the Prime Minister, says. 


I've heard a lot of the public commentary about this over the last few weeks and I urge the government to think very seriously about how they can amend this legislation to ensure that we allow journalists to keep doing their jobs. We need transparency in politics. We need transparency in the decisions made by the government in the name of the Australian people, and part of that is to ensure journalists can do their jobs without the fear of jail time, arrest and intimidation. In fact, in the inquiry that this report has come from, the suggestion was that the current laws are actually too harsh, that whistleblower protections need to be strengthened in order to allow journalists to do their jobs properly, to ensure that transparency is protected and that journalists are able to report on things without fear or favour. These new laws, as announced by the Prime Minister, currently being inquired by the Senate, will mean that those restrictions and that intimidation is only going to get worse.


Turkey, China and Egypt topped the list of countries last year for the worst conditions for journalists and the most jail time for journalists. I say to the government, and I see the Minister for Communications is sitting in the chamber here today, let's not make Australia part of that list in 2018. Let's make sure we protect the rights of journalists to continue to do their vital and important jobs.


There are a number of key recommendations that this report has highlighted that go to trying to find ways to support and protect public interest journalism and the very important role that it plays in our democracy. DGR status for non-profits is a good step forward, and I urge the government to think again about how this can be done. I know we've had conversations about this previously. Please consider that this is something that is not going to go away. The calls for proper support for our various journalism and media outlets, particularly those non-profits, are only going to grow louder as the public becomes more and more desperate for truth in politics and truth in our media. There are a number of other recommendations, whistleblower laws, and funding being supported and secured for our public broadcasters—crucial, I would say, in today's age. I urge the minister to look carefully at this report and to consider these issues going into the 2018 budget.


As I finish, I want to reflect on one of the saddest things that has happened in the past week. That of course is the passing of the veteran Age journalist Michael Gordon. When we talk about a contribution to public interest journalism, Michael was well ahead of the pack. He was a fantastic journalist, a beautiful storyteller and one of the nicest blokes any of us in this place has ever met.

Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I've got quite a bit of interest in this bill, particularly where it relates to any action of government that increases efficiencies whilst at the same time reducing bureaucratic burden. My first question is: to what extent did negotiations occur between the government and the states through COAG for the development of this bill?


I ask that question for a particular reason. The states have an interest in the impacts and the delivery of Commonwealth services. We can see that this particular bill covers quite a number of areas that will obviously impact on issues within the states. I also note that this bill has been developed over quite a long period of time. Indeed, it's a product of meeting what have been budget commitments and possibly even election commitments over that same period of time. Before I get into very specific questions relating to specific aspects of the act, I'm interested to know—to the extent that you may have firsthand knowledge—what the process was with the states in the negotiation and the development of matters that have influenced this act that we have before us here today. I'm sure the states have had—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:21):  Could I reiterate very briefly a few of my comments from the second reading debate about this idea of small government and removing red tape and green tape? It's as though, somehow, by raising a small amount of money, we're going to get a benefit for the Australian taxpayer when what we're actually removing plays a critical role in preventing further costs to the Australian taxpayer and to the Australian community down the track—like having in place a holistic approach to waste management in this country.


I'm very concerned that this came from the Commission of Audit and it goes all the way back to the 2013 budget—the zombie budget, the buster budget. I think Senator Bernardi rightly pointed out earlier this afternoon that this is kind of the remnants, the last gasp of the government being seen to be doing something about removing some red and green tape in this country. It's a real shame that they've chosen to target a couple of areas that I'm very passionate about and that I believe are critically important, especially right now when this country has a recycling crisis on its hands. It's not just kerb-side recycling for bottles and cans and cardboard and other products; it's tyres, which are supposed to be covered by product stewardship schemes, and very soon it's going to emerge in photovoltaics. As we start seeing generations of solar panels being phased out, no-one's got any idea on what we're going to do with these kinds of products.


A product stewardship scheme is, intuitively, a really good idea. My question to the minister is about this: the legislation before us is removing the advisory groups of the product stewardship scheme. I'll get to some other points in a minute about ASADA and CAMAC, but on the product stewardship scheme the legislation before us is removing the advisory groups. I understand those advisory groups have been defunct now, essentially, for a couple of years, since the 2014 legislation was put before the Senate. There is currently a review underway into the Product Stewardship Act itself. That review, I understand—and please tell me if this is correct—is due to be released sometime this year in 2018. Could you please clarify that for me?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  While you do that—take your time—the reason I'm asking this question is that I understand—and senators were given this in a Parliamentary Library brief, and it's something we've requested some information on—that if the product stewardship schemes are going to be wound up, then it's important that the advisory groups play a role in advising the government on that wind-up and in the review. But, essentially, no-one has been active in this scheme for a while now—which, incidentally, is why Labor are saying that they're going to support winding this up, because it's essentially defunct already. I want to put on record that that is not a good argument. We should be revitalising these schemes and advisory groups and getting on with the job of solving the waste crisis that we have in this country. I would be very keen to know what is going on with the review of the product stewardship scheme before I ask my next questions.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:25):  Speaking directly to the abolition of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the act has clocked up several years of operation, so the view is that we no longer need that steering group, which was intended to give direction in the establishment phase. The Department of the Environment and Energy now engages with industry experts on an as-needs basis to gather advice on classes of products to be considered for some form of accreditation or regulation. This is a far more flexible and effective way to engage with the best people at least cost, unlike a standing body, which has an inflexible composition of fixed overheads. This approach to consultation means we can get more diversity of input from people who are highly engaged and effective because they're from the appropriate industry or science fields. The 2016-17 product list, I'm advised, was compiled under this kind of consultation and includes products such as end-of-life batteries, photovoltaic systems, plastic oil containers and the products that Senator Whish-Wilson talked about last year in this debate: products containing microbeads.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:26):  I'll talk this out until the dinner break, and perhaps over that time you could check on the status of the Product Stewardship Act. My understanding was that a review of that act was part of an omnibus repeal bill in 2014, but there's a compulsory five-year review. The proposed abolition of this legislation that we're reviewing tonight was announced and amending legislation was introduced in 2014, but I'm very interested in the Product Stewardship Act, which is currently under review pursuant to provisions of that act that require the government to initiate an independent review of its operations every five years. My footnote for that was the Product Stewardship Act, section 109. There's a statement from Minister Frydenberg under in the 'Review of Product Stewardship Act 2011' media release from March 2017, and the Department of the Environment and Energy product stewardship website's also got a statement. I want to confirm that that is the case—that the whole act is under review—and when that might finish.


That's really important here. Not only are we potentially putting the cart before the horse in winding up what we're doing with this legislation tonight, but the expertise that was critical to at least one product stewardship scheme being successful—I have doubts as to whether anything else was achieved because of a total lack of commitment and leadership from the Liberal government since they came to power in 2013 in fixing the waste crisis that we have in this country.


I understand that the e-waste product stewardship scheme was almost too successful. They had such a good result that they almost had too much to deal with. But the Tyre Product Stewardship Scheme, a voluntary scheme, has been a bit of a joke. It hasn't achieved much at all. And other waste streams, like containers, cans and bottles, plastic, aluminium and cardboard—I was optimistic, as were many other campaigners around the country, that they would be included in a full national product stewardship scheme. The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee recommended that we have a national product stewardship scheme for cans and bottles. My fear is that, if we lose the advisory groups, we'll then lose the scheme because there's no-one there with the expertise.


After dinner, I'll get into the terminology used by the minister as to how they might go forward with a product stewardship scheme on an 'as-needs basis'. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Are we actually going to have any product stewardship schemes in this country? Are we going to bring in industry and producers of waste and work with stakeholders and recyclers and the community—the consumers of plastic—and fix the bloody problem that we've got? It's enormous. I'm chairing the committee inquiry into this at the moment. We had a full day of hearings in Melbourne in December, before we broke for Christmas. We had Visy; we had all the players there, and everybody was putting their hands up in the air, going, 'What are we doing?'


Progress reported.

 (Tasmania) (19:30):  I think I might have finished on a question for the minister just before the dinner break, but I will continue until the minister gets here. The explanatory memorandum that all senators have received notes:


The Department of the Environment and Energy will engage with stakeholders on an ""as needs"" basis on the preparation of the list of classes of products to be considered for some form of accreditation or regulation.


It also suggested the scope for ad hoc consultations by the portfolio department. I would be very interested to hear whether there are any other product stewardship schemes being looked at or planned by the department. I know COAG looks at these issues regularly in its meetings, but I am keen to know how we would determine that 'as needs basis'.


I might also make a few brief comments so I don't have to stand up separately. Actually, to make it easier for you, Temporary Chair Reynolds, I will seek leave to move amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8357 together.


Leave granted.





Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I move amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8357 together:



(1) Schedule 2, page 5 (lines 1 to 20), to be opposed.



(2)Schedule 3, page 6 (lines 1 to 10), to be opposed.



(3)Schedule 7, page 18 (line 1) to page 26 (line 5), to be opposed.


I'll continue to talk to them so we can get straight to voting on the amendments, unless anyone else has anything to contribute.


I want to talk briefly on ASADA. We support the move to abolish the advisory group on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, ASADA. We have noted—it's in the explanatory memorandum and we have heard it discussed in second reading speeches today—the group's lack of activity throughout its existence and the fact that there are no current members. But as I know Senator Di Natale, especially, has been involved in issues around the integrity of the current antidoping structures in Australia—indeed, worldwide—we want it noted that questions still remain. It is a bit like the points I've been making in relation to the product stewardship scheme for waste streams. We're abolishing these advisory structures, presumably on the basis that we're going to save a few bucks, but we've still got the issue of tackling the core problems that they were set up to tackle in the first place. You're asking us to support legislation that abolishes the expert advisory groups when we haven't actually solved the problems that they were set up to solve in the first place, so you'll have to forgive us for being a bit sceptical.


Minister, I will ask the question I asked before the dinner break: could you confirm that the Product Stewardship Act is currently under review—that's part of an independent five-year review—and when will that review be completed?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Statute Update (Smaller Government) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-02-05,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (19:34):  I have been advised in relation to the questions you asked before the dinner break, which I obviously wasn't in the chamber to hear, particularly in relation to whether a review is underway on the product stewardship legislation. You also asked whether this had any implications for the future of the product stewardship model or the direction these schemes will take. In response, I can confirm that there was a review that was announced in early 2017. This was the first review of the act following its commencement in 2011, and it's our intention to conclude that review this year—that is, in 2018. The act has a review provision that requires that a broad review should occur on the fifth anniversary of the act, and I can assure you that the government has no plans or intentions of ditching a product stewardship approach. We have not prejudged the findings of that review.


The terms of reference are written quite broadly. They ask the review to look at whether the act is meeting its intention and to look at interactions with state and territory policies as well as international experience in the field of product stewardship. The terms of reference are only narrow in one regard: asking the review to consider issues around the recycling of TVs and computers, and that is an appropriate question addressing a very contemporary pressure point. The review is open to input from industry, the community, state government, federal government, territory government and local government. A consultation paper is planned to be published very shortly, and there will also be public forums as part of this process.


I should emphasise that when it comes to the future accreditation and regulation of different waste products, the government intends to continue to use a contemporary consultation approach involving discussion with experts most relevant to each class of product as different products are looked at. This is an approach we favour regardless of the shape of the stewardship scheme. Having a fixed group of people considering accreditation and regulation of all product types is a 1970s model of industry engagement that is no longer suited to the diverse world in which we live today. There are many technologies and products today that can find their way into the waste system, and we need to tap different skill sets to address each of these challenges that are before us. Under our approach there will not be less consultation; rather, it will be better targeted. We've been using that approach already and we believe that it's been working very well.


You also asked whether any other schemes have been considered. The government is considering an approach to microbeads at the moment.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:37):  I understand a voluntary ban on microbeads has been suggested, and there may be a mandatory ban implemented. Will that be a product stewardship scheme or just a direct ban on microbeads? My understanding is that it was going to be a ban rather than incorporating a stewardship scheme, which involves returns and those kinds of things.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:39):  That was my point. I understand they haven't been active since the legislation was introduced in 2014, when it was made very clear the government would be removing those.


I am glad that you've said tonight that you are going to continue with the product stewardship scheme model and that you are looking at targeting other waste streams. As I said earlier, this country desperately needs some leadership on waste. It's an issue that cuts across the political divide. It doesn't matter what your political colour is or where you live, no-one likes waste. They especially don't like seeing waste in waterways and in the ocean. It's a critical issue all around the world. The World Economic Forum has issued a call to arms for all governments to tackle this issue and look at economic models that work like product stewardship schemes and refund schemes et cetera. I bang on a lot about it in here, but it's absolutely critical that your government shows leadership on this issue.


Very briefly, because I'm moving all three amendments together so we can get through this quickly, I want to make some comments about CAMAC. Our views are very similar to the Labor Party's views on CAMAC. We think it's a shame that it's being abolished. I have heard the second reading speech from the coalition, and there seems to be this assumption, as there is in the explanatory memorandum, that somehow CAMAC is a lobby or—I won't use the words 'advisory group'—an advocacy group for the financial services industry. My experience has been quite different. Actually, they put out independent and very timely research, especially research on legislation and the legality of some of the issues that we've all dealt with in here in the financial services industry in the last five years. I was especially pleased with the report they did on forestry management investment schemes and management investment schemes in general. I must say, the Senate Economics Committee did a fantastic inquiry into that as well—what a debacle they have been and why they shouldn't be in existence. On that note, that's it from me.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:41):  I wish to put on the record the position of the opposition in respect of these three amendments, which I now note are going to be moved together. Any of these bodies that Senator Whish-Wilson refers to in his amendments have played important roles over their life, but the fact of the matter is that they now exist in name only. These amendments will not see these bodies staffed, funded or tasked for advice and therefore do nothing by way of reinstating them. As a result, the opposition will not be supporting these amendments.

The CHAIR:  Yes, it certainly is.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I've got quite a bit of interest in this bill, particularly where it relates to any action of government that increases efficiencies whilst at the same time reducing bureaucratic burden. My first question is: to what extent did negotiations occur between the government and the states through COAG for the development of this bill?


I ask that question for a particular reason. The states have an interest in the impacts and the delivery of Commonwealth services. We can see that this particular bill covers quite a number of areas that will obviously impact on issues within the states. I also note that this bill has been developed over quite a long period of time. Indeed, it's a product of meeting what have been budget commitments and possibly even election commitments over that same period of time. Before I get into very specific questions relating to specific aspects of the act, I'm interested to know—to the extent that you may have firsthand knowledge—what the process was with the states in the negotiation and the development of matters that have influenced this act that we have before us here today. I'm sure the states have had—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I'm waiting for the minister; I want to make sure he fully understands the depth and breadth of my question. I'm sure the minister has some knowledge of what that process has been with COAG over the time that has led up to the drafting of this particular act.

There was consultation, as was necessary, with state jurisdictions. A number of these matters covered by this bill cover different portfolio areas. Just one example where there would have been consultation with the states is in relation to the abolition of CAMAC.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:21):  Could I reiterate very briefly a few of my comments from the second reading debate about this idea of small government and removing red tape and green tape? It's as though, somehow, by raising a small amount of money, we're going to get a benefit for the Australian taxpayer when what we're actually removing plays a critical role in preventing further costs to the Australian taxpayer and to the Australian community down the track—like having in place a holistic approach to waste management in this country.


I'm very concerned that this came from the Commission of Audit and it goes all the way back to the 2013 budget—the zombie budget, the buster budget. I think Senator Bernardi rightly pointed out earlier this afternoon that this is kind of the remnants, the last gasp of the government being seen to be doing something about removing some red and green tape in this country. It's a real shame that they've chosen to target a couple of areas that I'm very passionate about and that I believe are critically important, especially right now when this country has a recycling crisis on its hands. It's not just kerb-side recycling for bottles and cans and cardboard and other products; it's tyres, which are supposed to be covered by product stewardship schemes, and very soon it's going to emerge in photovoltaics. As we start seeing generations of solar panels being phased out, no-one's got any idea on what we're going to do with these kinds of products.


A product stewardship scheme is, intuitively, a really good idea. My question to the minister is about this: the legislation before us is removing the advisory groups of the product stewardship scheme. I'll get to some other points in a minute about ASADA and CAMAC, but on the product stewardship scheme the legislation before us is removing the advisory groups. I understand those advisory groups have been defunct now, essentially, for a couple of years, since the 2014 legislation was put before the Senate. There is currently a review underway into the Product Stewardship Act itself. That review, I understand—and please tell me if this is correct—is due to be released sometime this year in 2018. Could you please clarify that for me?

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  While you do that—take your time—the reason I'm asking this question is that I understand—and senators were given this in a Parliamentary Library brief, and it's something we've requested some information on—that if the product stewardship schemes are going to be wound up, then it's important that the advisory groups play a role in advising the government on that wind-up and in the review. But, essentially, no-one has been active in this scheme for a while now—which, incidentally, is why Labor are saying that they're going to support winding this up, because it's essentially defunct already. I want to put on record that that is not a good argument. We should be revitalising these schemes and advisory groups and getting on with the job of solving the waste crisis that we have in this country. I would be very keen to know what is going on with the review of the product stewardship scheme before I ask my next questions.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:25):  Speaking directly to the abolition of the Product Stewardship Advisory Group, the act has clocked up several years of operation, so the view is that we no longer need that steering group, which was intended to give direction in the establishment phase. The Department of the Environment and Energy now engages with industry experts on an as-needs basis to gather advice on classes of products to be considered for some form of accreditation or regulation. This is a far more flexible and effective way to engage with the best people at least cost, unlike a standing body, which has an inflexible composition of fixed overheads. This approach to consultation means we can get more diversity of input from people who are highly engaged and effective because they're from the appropriate industry or science fields. The 2016-17 product list, I'm advised, was compiled under this kind of consultation and includes products such as end-of-life batteries, photovoltaic systems, plastic oil containers and the products that Senator Whish-Wilson talked about last year in this debate: products containing microbeads.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-05,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:26):  I'll talk this out until the dinner break, and perhaps over that time you could check on the status of the Product Stewardship Act. My understanding was that a review of that act was part of an omnibus repeal bill in 2014, but there's a compulsory five-year review. The proposed abolition of this legislation that we're reviewing tonight was announced and amending legislation was introduced in 2014, but I'm very interested in the Product Stewardship Act, which is currently under review pursuant to provisions of that act that require the government to initiate an independent review of its operations every five years. My footnote for that was the Product Stewardship Act, section 109. There's a statement from Minister Frydenberg under in the 'Review of Product Stewardship Act 2011' media release from March 2017, and the Department of the Environment and Energy product stewardship website's also got a statement. I want to confirm that that is the case—that the whole act is under review—and when that might finish.


That's really important here. Not only are we potentially putting the cart before the horse in winding up what we're doing with this legislation tonight, but the expertise that was critical to at least one product stewardship scheme being successful—I have doubts as to whether anything else was achieved because of a total lack of commitment and leadership from the Liberal government since they came to power in 2013 in fixing the waste crisis that we have in this country.


I understand that the e-waste product stewardship scheme was almost too successful. They had such a good result that they almost had too much to deal with. But the Tyre Product Stewardship Scheme, a voluntary scheme, has been a bit of a joke. It hasn't achieved much at all. And other waste streams, like containers, cans and bottles, plastic, aluminium and cardboard—I was optimistic, as were many other campaigners around the country, that they would be included in a full national product stewardship scheme. The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee recommended that we have a national product stewardship scheme for cans and bottles. My fear is that, if we lose the advisory groups, we'll then lose the scheme because there's no-one there with the expertise.


After dinner, I'll get into the terminology used by the minister as to how they might go forward with a product stewardship scheme on an 'as-needs basis'. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Are we actually going to have any product stewardship schemes in this country? Are we going to bring in industry and producers of waste and work with stakeholders and recyclers and the community—the consumers of plastic—and fix the bloody problem that we've got? It's enormous. I'm chairing the committee inquiry into this at the moment. We had a full day of hearings in Melbourne in December, before we broke for Christmas. We had Visy; we had all the players there, and everybody was putting their hands up in the air, going, 'What are we doing?'


Progress reported.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:39):  That was my point. I understand they haven't been active since the legislation was introduced in 2014, when it was made very clear the government would be removing those.


I am glad that you've said tonight that you are going to continue with the product stewardship scheme model and that you are looking at targeting other waste streams. As I said earlier, this country desperately needs some leadership on waste. It's an issue that cuts across the political divide. It doesn't matter what your political colour is or where you live, no-one likes waste. They especially don't like seeing waste in waterways and in the ocean. It's a critical issue all around the world. The World Economic Forum has issued a call to arms for all governments to tackle this issue and look at economic models that work like product stewardship schemes and refund schemes et cetera. I bang on a lot about it in here, but it's absolutely critical that your government shows leadership on this issue.


Very briefly, because I'm moving all three amendments together so we can get through this quickly, I want to make some comments about CAMAC. Our views are very similar to the Labor Party's views on CAMAC. We think it's a shame that it's being abolished. I have heard the second reading speech from the coalition, and there seems to be this assumption, as there is in the explanatory memorandum, that somehow CAMAC is a lobby or—I won't use the words 'advisory group'—an advocacy group for the financial services industry. My experience has been quite different. Actually, they put out independent and very timely research, especially research on legislation and the legality of some of the issues that we've all dealt with in here in the financial services industry in the last five years. I was especially pleased with the report they did on forestry management investment schemes and management investment schemes in general. I must say, the Senate Economics Committee did a fantastic inquiry into that as well—what a debacle they have been and why they shouldn't be in existence. On that note, that's it from me.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:41):  I wish to put on the record the position of the opposition in respect of these three amendments, which I now note are going to be moved together. Any of these bodies that Senator Whish-Wilson refers to in his amendments have played important roles over their life, but the fact of the matter is that they now exist in name only. These amendments will not see these bodies staffed, funded or tasked for advice and therefore do nothing by way of reinstating them. As a result, the opposition will not be supporting these amendments.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  The question is that schedules 2, 3 and 7 on sheet 8357 stand as printed. 


Question agreed to.


Bill agreed to.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  The question is that the bill now be reported. I think the ayes have it—the noes have it? Division required. Senator Whish-Wilson, before we go to a division, can I confirm that you want a division on the question that the bill be reported?



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  You should be waiting, in that case, for the third reading. Do you still want to go to a division?



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Division is cancelled. The question is that the bill now be reported.


Question agreed to.


Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (21:50):  I begin by saying that this is not my first speech. It is, however, my first day, and it's going really well and just gets better. A newspaper article was published today with the headline 'New Liberal Senator Jim Molan posts inflammatory anti-Muslim videos'. It was in the Sydney Morning Herald. Adam Gartrell published it at about 1.37 pm today. This article infers a sequence of events which is totally and absolutely wrong. It is duplicitous. It infers I became a senator and immediately started posting racist, anti-Muslim videos. That's certainly what the headline says. It's not true. What is being referred to here occurred roughly a year ago. I have not used Facebook for as long as I can remember.


Today, when the article came out, I couldn't remember the videos themselves, but, when I saw them, I was reminded of the nature of them, and the nature of them is about violence and antisocial behaviour. I did not see them and I believe they are not anti-Islam or about racism. I say that because I am not a racist and I am not anti-Islamic as I am accused in this article. Gratuitous violence, antisocial behaviour and rioting are what I am against—not race, not Islam. Supposedly these videos were false, I'm told, because someone in the trail of activities after the videos said that they were false. To me they look to this day very real. I would invite all senators who are interested to look at these videos and judge for themselves whether in fact they have been staged, whether in fact they are faked.


I've lived and worked most effectively in foreign countries, and you cannot do that if you are racist. I spent three years in Papua New Guinea. East Timor I've visited at least 20 times, spending long times there. I lived in Indonesia for five years. In the Solomon Islands I commanded the evacuation force from the Solomon Islands. I spent one year in Iraq when I ran the war in Iraq. I fought for Muslims in Iraq, and many Iraqis were alive when I left because of the actions that I took—not racist, not anti-Islam. Linking me to Britain First is absolutely absurd.


President Trump brought Britain First to our attention well after I shared those two antisocial, violent videos. Supposedly, according to this article, I commented somewhere that this situation is unbelievable. I find violence such as this, even though I'm a soldier and I have lived and worked in a violent world, totally unbelievable. Supposedly I'm asked to apologise for being antiviolent? Bizarre.


A tweet appeared today under the name of 'McKim' saying I was a blatant racist, saying that I bragged about the cruelty of offshore detention, saying that I revel in trampling rights and freedoms. These allegations are totally untrue and should be withdrawn.


I've spent all my life working cross-culturally across races and across religions. I've had many Muslim friends during periods of incredibly intense conflict, periods of incredibly intense tension for me and my Muslim friends over many years in many places, and I have been effective. I and others have done more for the most basic human right that exists, and that is the right to be alive—a right which was not granted, in particular, to 1,200 refugees who drowned at sea. As I said before, many people were alive in Iraq when I left because of my actions, and I suspect that I have made a greater contribution to the human rights of many people—particularly the basic human right of being alive—than many of those that criticise me. Thank you.
