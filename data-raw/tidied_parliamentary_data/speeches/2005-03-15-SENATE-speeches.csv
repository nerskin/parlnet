"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-03-15,"—When this debate was adjourned last night, I was talking about the importance of ensuring that the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 is not seen to be putting the welfare of large corporations above the welfare of poor Indonesians. I know that this was not what ordinary Australians wanted when they dug so deep to provide financial assistance. In fact, what Australians want in this process is to ensure that proper procedures are put in place regarding procurement, auditing, reporting and pay standards. They want reconstruction programs that put money into the pockets of the people who are left without a source of income, such as cash-for-work programs. But credit and microfinance are also important for the thousands of small businesses with no access to the formal banking sector that must access credit through development banks and microfinance institutions. The government should be under no illusion that Australians have lost interest in the plight of the Indonesians or that, knowing the government has pledged a billion dollars in aid, they have handed over responsibility.
We are all aware of local efforts, and I would like to mention some local contributions to the relief effort of which I have been aware. All members and senators have received an email from Senator Marise Payne, as convenor of the Australian Parliamentary Association of UNICEF, seeking support for the ‘School in a box’ program. I contacted schools in Goulburn about the program and encouraged them to participate. I am very proud that the Trinity Catholic College students collected more that $1,400 in that effort. In another fantastic effort, St Joseph’s Primary School at North Goulburn—a wonderful parish school—had a gold coin collection and raised almost $600.
Individuals, too, have made their mark. John Crooks, a dedicated funeral director from Goulburn, visited Aceh to share his expertise. Jack Saeck lent his support to Father Riley’s orphanage project. Tony Flynn, a local potter and materials scientist at the ANU, has invented an ingenious water filtration system—perfect for conditions in Indonesia. What makes this water filter ingenious is that it is based on a handful of clay, yesterday’s coffee grounds and some cow manure. It is simple, new technology that allows water filters to be made from commonly available materials and fired on the ground using cow manure as the source of heat without the need for kilns. The filters have been tested and shown to remove common pathogens, including E. coli. They are simple and inexpensive to make. As Tony Flynn says:
They are very simple to explain and demonstrate and can be made by anyone, anywhere. They don’t require any Western technology. All you need is terracotta clay, a compliant cow and a match.
The ACTU is also committed to ensuring that aid goes directly to the devastated communities so that reconstruction can take place in a genuine partnership arrangement. The ACTU’s overseas aid arm, Union Aid Abroad-APHEDA, worked closely with the Indonesian branch of the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers Associations, the IUF, to send teams of volunteer doctors, nurses, paramedics and engineers from IUF-affiliated unions to Meulaboh, formerly a city of 78,000 people on the west coast of Aceh. APHEDA is also exploring options for a longer term development program through vocational skills training and capacity building for local community organisations.
Given the reality of all these people’s efforts, they deserve to know where and how Australia’s aid money is being spent and to be reassured that there are checks and balances in place to deter opportunistic profiteering. It is no mere quibble to ask for the transparency and wider publicity of the aid budget when the Australian aid budget funds the dispatch of troops for security overseas—for example, in the Solomons—and the salaries of Australia’s Federal Police occupying senior positions in the state bureaucracies of PNG. Money spent offshore persecuting asylum seekers also figures in Australia’s aid budget, as does money for rebuilding Iraq. So, when we are considering the distribution of the enormous current aid package to Indonesia, the Australian taxpayer has a right to be kept fully informed about how the funding is allocated.
We need to be extremely vigilant about the role played by our military assistance. We must not forget that Australian military personnel in Aceh for humanitarian purposes—those unarmed engineers and medical staff who are helping out—are nevertheless a military presence. We need to remember that and ensure that an unwanted effect of the tsunami disaster is not a strengthening of Australia’s military presence in Indonesia. It would be a bitter irony indeed if by administering aid in this form, we actually contributed to the dependence of the people of Aceh rather than fostering their independence and freedom.
Labor support the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development in principle. However, we also wait with interest for more details from the government on how the partnership will be established. Who will represent both Australia and Indonesia on the partnership? How will decisions about funding be made? Labor, like all Australians, are anxious to hear that an administration framework will be established which will ensure participation, fairness, effectiveness, integrity, accountability and transparency to the parliament and the people of Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-03-15,"—I have spoken in this chamber already this year about the tragedy of the tsunami disaster and how, for example, Greens MPs were present in Sri Lanka at the time and the work that we have been doing subsequently to support the people affected by the tsunami. I also spoke last week about Australia’s aid program and the sorts of aid that the Australian Greens believe are most appropriate and that aid workers recognise deliver the best outcome.
I want to focus today on the aid contribution of $1 billion. The Greens support the provision of $1 billion to help the Indonesian people recover from the tsunami tragedy. We have some concerns, as I note the speaker before me has also expressed, about how and where the aid package will be spent. I have already spoken on the issues about the sorts of aid that we support—that is, aid that is directed at a community level, which the people of Aceh are involved in delivering and which is delivered in a way which provides the best services to them on the ground using their local expertise so that they can have an ongoing contribution to their own economic independence.
What I want to talk about today is the fact that we are opposed to the provision of around half the support included in this package in the form of loans rather than a straight-out donation. We are concerned about that because the debt crisis that has become a burning global issue in the last few years is getting worse not better, and Indonesia is one of the countries worst hit by this debt crisis. Around the world, total debt continues to rise while total overseas aid is falling. This is a crisis of monumental proportions. The developing world now spends $13 on debt repayments for every $1 it receives in aid. Every dollar that is spent in repaying debt is a dollar that could be spent on addressing the AIDS crisis, sending a child to school, installing water and sewerage systems in rural areas, or job creation. Ending the poverty that entraps the two billion people living on less than $2 a day will only be achieved if we solve this debt crisis.
The debt crisis is also fuelling environmental problems, with governments under even more pressure to increase resource exports, at the expense of forests and rivers, so as to service their crushing debt payments. The total external debt of tsunami affected countries is over $272 billion. The Prime Minister’s reluctant acceptance of a form of debt relief by supporting the Paris Club’s rescheduling of debt is a belated recognition of this crisis, but it only puts off the problem. Indonesia’s massive debt will remain and it will continue to hamstring future generations. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 will make the problem worse by lumbering Indonesia with a further half a billion dollars in debt at a time when it cannot even deal with the debt it already has. A moratorium on repayments and making the loan interest free do not address the fundamental problem, which is that Australia will be adding to Indonesia’s debt crisis.
Much of Indonesia’s debt was accumulated under the corrupt and brutal Suharto regime, which was supported by both Labor and Liberal governments in Australia. This debt funded, amongst other things, military hardware used to suppress independence movements, including in Aceh. In 1997 the Asian economic crisis, exacerbated by the policies of the International Monetary Fund, devastated Indonesia’s economy and it had not recovered from this when the tsunami struck last year. In the years since the Asian economic crisis, Indonesia’s public debt has doubled, to around $130 billion, and combined with private debt is over $143 billion, an amount equal to or greater than Indonesia’s gross domestic product. More importantly, its current debt service ratio—that is, the principal debt payments plus the interest payments as a proportion of export earnings—is around 50 per cent; that is, half of what Indonesia earns goes towards debt payments. This is why debt servicing consumes as much as half of Indonesia’s budget.
Previous rounds of limited debt cancellation announced by rich countries have not included Indonesia. This is despite the reality of Indonesia’s debt problem and the incredible poverty of its people. According to the United Nations, over 50 per cent of Indonesia’s people live on or on less than $US2 a day. That is less than the price of a cup of coffee or a schooner of beer, and it is all that most people have to survive on each day. Providing support in the form of loans will exacerbate this poverty as successive governments are forced to choose between debt repayments and the needs of their people. There is no reason why this half a billion dollars could not be provided in the form of aid, as a straight donation. This is why the Greens will be asking the Senate to support an amendment that we will move to spell out clearly the Senate’s opposition to increasing Indonesia’s debt.
We believe that Australia could and should be doing more. We can afford to be providing more aid rather than creating a further debt trap for Indonesia. The Greens will support this appropriation for aid. As we said at the beginning, it is a good thing but it is not the very best that Australia could be doing. We should be increasing Indonesia’s aid without increasing its debt. We should be ensuring Indonesian non-government organisations and companies deliver the aid, not the Indonesian military and large Australian corporate businesses. We should support poverty alleviation more than national security and growth-driven inequality in the way in which we deliver the aid. The Greens will continue to hold the government accountable for how this aid is spent and we will continue to campaign for a real aid program so that Australia can genuinely join the global effort to make poverty history.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-03-15,"—The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 are the Australian government’s response to the dreadful events of 26 December last year. There can be no doubt that the approach of the government on this issue is the correct one. The importance of relief operations is not to be underestimated. When these bills were debated in the other place, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Kevin Rudd, outlined that there were five immediate needs that required assistance—a point that was also made in the Senate last night by Senator Stephens. They were, in brief: housing and shelter; enterprise, commerce and income creation; rebuilding the rural economy; provision of public services; and assistance to the vulnerable.
I do not intend to take up any time during my contribution to add to the many valuable contributions already made in addressing these needs. Rather, I want to focus on an area that, although it received much attention in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, still requires constant attention. That area is an Indian Ocean tsunami warning system. I applaud the government for the work outlined in this legislation, but it is also important that we start to plan for a warning system. Australia needs to begin building a warning system that will ensure that people living in the Indian Ocean area are never again struck without warning by a tsunami. Not only must we begin the planning but we must also begin appropriating money in the upcoming budget for the development and deployment of such a system.
In my mind there is no better demonstration of the value of having Australia as a neighbour than the appropriation bills that we are discussing today. A further practical demonstration to our region would be to shoulder the burden of deploying and maintaining an Indian Ocean warning system. Let us be clear that we have to take the lead on this. How can we expect countries such as Bangladesh, Somalia, Kenya, Mauritius or the Seychelles to contribute a reasonable share of the development or ongoing costs of such a system?
Early warning is not just about helping our neighbours, though; it is also in our own best interests. Much of the mineral wealth of this country is located in the north of Western Australia, to say nothing of the area offshore from that north-west coast. Many Australians live and work in areas that are on the Indian Ocean. Even if we do it for no other reason than self-interest, we will be helping many nations not able to do so themselves.
However, unlike many other projects that governments are called upon to fund, in this case the good news is that we do not have to start from scratch. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii provides exactly the sort of system that we should be funding in the Indian Ocean for ourselves and for our neighbours. We also do not have to start from scratch because there are already a number of organisations in Australia that have developed national warning systems for seismic and climate related threats, namely Geoscience Australia and the Bureau of Meteorology. What we do need to do is deploy that necessary equipment, recruit the personnel that are required and provide adequate funding into the future.
I am not attempting to take advantage of hindsight to argue that this should have been done before now. What I am arguing is that we must go about establishing a system as quickly as possible to assist all countries that have Indian Ocean coastlines. I am also arguing that Australia is uniquely placed in the region, due to our relative wealth, to shoulder the lion’s share of the costs of such a system. There can be no better neighbour than one who is prepared to shoulder the costs of a system that benefits many, especially those with a limited capacity to contribute.
For the benefit of the Senate, let me outline the process by which the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre operates. The centre continuously monitors seismic activity and the ocean surface level of the Pacific Ocean. Once seismic activity is noted, the warning centre locates the origin of the event. Once the event has been located and the magnitude determined, the warning centre determines whether to issue an alert. If the magnitude is between 6.5 and 7.5, then a tsunami information bulletin is issued to all participating countries and organisations. In the event that an earthquake of greater than 7.5 is identified, then a tsunami warning bulletin is issued.
The warning centre will, in the event of an earthquake of greater than 7.5, check the water level data from automatic tide stations to determine whether a tsunami has been generated. If there is evidence that a tsunami has been generated, then the warning centre will continue to produce tsunami warning bulletins until that threat has passed. If it is clear from the water level monitoring that there is no possible tsunami, then the warning centre will cancel the warning bulletins.
Australia receives these bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre although tsunamis on our Pacific coasts are, fortunately, not that common. In fact, on 2 March this year the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a tsunami information bulletin for the earthquake that occurred in the Banda Sea. Due to the depth of that event, there was no risk of a tsunami being generated and there certainly was no risk of one taking place in the Pacific Ocean.
It is clear that many of the key elements are already in place to set up such an early warning centre. Geoscience Australia already monitors seismic activity in and around Australia. Geoscience Australia is part of a worldwide seismic monitoring network. From evidence at the estimates committees in February this year, it is clear that Geoscience Australia has a fully automated monitoring system in place. So the first part of the system is in place and ready to go. Australia can monitor seismic activity continuously, although it is clear that Geoscience Australia rely on automated systems to provide around-the-clock monitoring.
The second part of any tsunami warning centre is the capacity to monitor water levels. There are two parts to being able to accurately monitor ocean water levels. The first is the ability to monitor water levels in shallow or coastal waters. In fact, during the tsunami on Boxing Day last year, the tidal recording equipment on the Cocos Islands measured a 50-centimetre increase in water level. Unfortunately, due to the distance from the seismic event to the Cocos Islands, it was some four hours after the initial earthquake. This increase was noted by the Bureau of Meteorology, and this was the first equipment to verify that a tsunami had taken place.
The bureau then issued warnings and contacted Emergency Management Australia. From the estimates round in February it is clear that Australia has a reasonably robust system of tidal gauges and monitoring equipment—some operated by the Commonwealth and some by various state agencies. Therefore, at least for Australia, the tidal ocean water level monitoring is also already in place. The missing part is the deep ocean assessment of tsunamis. Again, we do not have to start from scratch in this area because of the pioneering work in the United States and other Pacific nations.
The United States, as part of its deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunamis project, or DART as it has become known, currently deploys six systems. These DART systems are deployed in areas where destructive tsunamis have occurred. The DART systems consist of an anchored sea floor bottom pressure recorder and a moored surface buoy for real time communications. This system is able to transmit data via satellite to relevant agencies. In standard mode these stations record sea levels every 15 minutes. Once an event has been recorded, these stations record sea levels every 15 seconds during the initial few minutes and then average once per minute for at least one hour after the event and in some situations for up to three hours. This system is able to detect tsunamis as small as one centimetre. The DART systems are able to be deployed at depths of up to 6,000 metres. The average life span of the DART system is one year for the surface buoy and two years for the bottom pressure recorder.
As I said earlier, it is clear that we can build upon the work of other nations in the Pacific who, over the years, have developed and continue to develop effective tsunami warning systems. Australia should and must take a lead in the development of an Indian Ocean tsunami warning system. Regardless of the amount of time that will pass before the next tsunami in the Indian Ocean we cannot afford any delay. Whilst I applaud the government for the funding announced in these bills, I make it clear that I for one will be paying close attention to the upcoming budget to ensure that we take the lead in developing an effective warning system, not only for Australia but for the Indian Ocean community.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (TSUNAMI FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-03-15,"—I thank all the senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005. The Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development has received warm support from ministers in the Indonesian government and has also received widespread recognition within our region. The partnership will not be an ordinary aid program; it will be Australia’s largest ever single bilateral development program. The partnership will be overseen by the Prime Minister and the Indonesian President, with day-to-day responsibility taken by a joint commission of Australian and Indonesian ministers. Australia will be represented by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer. Mr Downer will co-chair the inaugural joint commission meeting in Canberra this Thursday, 17 March.
At its first meeting the joint commission will consider a range of issues which will affect the prompt and effective implementation of the partnership so we can begin reconstruction and development as soon as practicable. We envisage that the grants offered under the partnership will be used to assist communities in Indonesia rebuild and re-establish local infrastructure destroyed or damaged by the disaster as well as participate in education and training opportunities. The concessional loans provided through the partnership are aimed at reconstruction, including rehabilitation of major infrastructure.
In order to manage such a large commitment effectively the $1 billion will be appropriated to two special accounts created under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The relevant instruments issued by my colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration were tabled in this place on Wednesday, 9 March 2005. By using special accounts, the funds will be separated from other aid money and be spent only on the precise purposes for which they have been established. This mechanism also ensures a high degree of transparency and accountability. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance and Australia-Indonesia Partnership) Bill 2004-2005 will provide the financial weight to Australia’s partnership commitment. It will assist with the reconstruction and development of Indonesia and further strengthen our bilateral relationship.
The government is proud of the rapid and very effective Australian whole-of-government response in the aftermath of the tsunami. A range of government departments and agencies banded together in an extremely short time frame and under great pressure made a significant contribution to the emergency relief effort. In doing so, however, the government diverted funding from current programs. The Appropriation (Tsunami Financial Assistance) Bill 2004-2005 replaces that funding, requesting a total of $131.4 million in new appropriations. The tsunami financial assistance bills are representative of the obligation that the Australian community feels to assist those Australians immediately affected by the disaster to help neighbours who are in need and to develop a partnership for the future with our Indonesian neighbour.
It is often said that a crisis brings out the best in us all. The compassion and generosity of the Australian public to the tsunami disaster has been magnificent. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, many Australians on holiday in the region gave whatever help they could on the ground. In addition, by 6 January over 2,000 Australians had registered to work overseas and assist with the relief effort. The Australian public has raised over $280 million to assist relief agencies. I think we can confidently say that we have been seeing the best from Australians in their response to this disaster. The Australian community can also be well satisfied that their government responded quickly and comprehensively to the immediate needs of Australians and our neighbours who were directly affected by the tsunami. I am sure that honourable senators will also join me in thanking not only our military and civilian personnel but also those many Australians who volunteered their time and energy for their efforts since the tsunami struck these Indian Ocean communities.
In conclusion, I am pleased to support these bills. We have created this package because it is the right thing to do. To draw from what my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in the debate on these bills in the other place last week, it is about the common humanity which has been expressed by all speakers in the debate in this parliament. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I rise to speak on theAdministrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. I must say at the outset that the government has been forced to make some substantial changes to this bill, particularly in regard to the president, in the face of overwhelming opposition, but I will come to those changes later and in more detail during the committee stage. This amendment bill is primarily aimed at improving the AAT’s ability to manage its workload and ensure that it operates more efficiently. There are a number of reforms which will provide for a more efficient AAT. It is important that the AAT operates as efficiently and as quickly as justice will allow because we know that delays in the AAT can cause the parties not just much angst but often severe disadvantage. Anything this parliament can do to help this process is important, but in designing a tribunal of this type the balance between efficiency and justice requires very close consideration.
As has been noted during the long process of reforming the AAT, this tribunal is not a chapter 3 court; it is a tribunal within the executive and charged with conducting merit reviews of government decisions. Because of the very fact that the work of the AAT is the primary place of external review for citizens in dispute with the government, when it was originally designed the AAT was heavily weighted with judicial principle and practice. The requirement that the AAT president should be a Federal Court judge and the significant number of judges appointed to the tribunal with tenure demonstrated an early commitment that the tribunal should be seen not just to be a creature of the bureaucracy but an avenue of completely independent review. Great care went into ensuring that the tribunal was seen to be a body completely independent from the executive so that no bias could be attributed to its decisions and they would be respected by parties involved. The history of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal shows that parties, importantly including government, have respected its decisions and its standing. At the same time the tribunal was designed to be a relatively informal process so that it would remain accessible to anyone, regardless of their resources, who needed to appeal a decision to it.
The question we face in consideration of this bill is whether that important and delicate balance has in fact been maintained and to what extent it can be shaved away in terms of the tribunal’s judicial vestige and yet have the essential characteristics to maintain its actual and perceived independence. Labor had serious concerns about the original form of the bill, particularly with regard to the role and standing of the AAT president, and about the terms of appointment and tenure of the senior and presidential members, as they go directly to the question of independence from government. We are naturally happy that the government has taken up a number of Labor’s concerns, but I will come to those aspects later.
The amendments make a number of cosmetic changes to the act to update the language to plain English. This is particularly important for an act which creates a tribunal designed to be accessible to all. The bill also expands the alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, processes available to the tribunal and provides for the president to direct parties to these processes and that the parties are required to undergo ADR in good faith, though sanctions do not apply for failure to do so. As long as disputes are referred to ADR conscientiously and the process is carried out responsibly, there are benefits that can be obtained by resolving disputes in this way. Naturally the resolution of the dispute by the parties themselves is in fact preferable, but care must be taken to ensure that a difference in resources and power of the parties is not exacerbated by the referral to ADR. This is a concern that has been expressed by some organisations, including the National Welfare Rights Network, who argued in their submission to the Senate inquiry that the legislation should be amended to prescribe the factors that the AAT president should take into consideration when considering referring a matter to ADR, such as the power relationship between the parties, that it is optional and voluntary or that there are no factors that make it inappropriate. Whilst this is a concern, Labor is satisfied that good management by an independent and tenured president will ensure that it operates fairly.
Under these amendments the president will have responsibility for referring questions of law to the Federal Court and the Federal Court will be empowered to make findings of fact so that it can completely dispose of a matter without it returning to the tribunal for finalisation. This is a commonsense amendment which Labor supports. But again we note that it relies on the status and authority of the president. It is also beneficial in order to secure a working nexus between the AAT and the Federal Court that the AAT president is a judge of that court.
The powers of the AAT president will be increased by this bill. The existing sections 20 and 23 of the AAT act will be overhauled to remove restrictive provisions and to give the president broad powers to constitute the tribunal in relation to particular matters. The president will also have the power to authorise ordinary members to exercise powers that can currently be exercised only by presidential or senior members. These changes by themselves are reasonable and are designed to give the additional tribunal flexibility, but we can have confidence to bestow increased powers on the president only if the position itself maintains the existing level of independence and status.
Of the 17 submissions made to the Senate inquiry into this bill, not a single one was in favour of this particular reform, while a number of the submissions expressed strong opposition to it. The balance that this parliament has always tried to achieve in this structure of the AAT is to provide an informal avenue of review for citizens aggrieved by government decisions while maintaining the tribunal’s status so that its decisions are perceived as being fair and just. Of course, these two aims can be conflicting ones.
During the creation of the AAT there was a strong emphasis on creating a judicial-style structure. The early composition of the AAT was heavy with appointments of members of the judiciary in order to immediately bestow upon the tribunal both standing and the assurance of independence. We should not take the fragility of the AAT’s independent status lightly. Labor believes that the government’s attempts to completely strip the president of any of the protections which are automatically bestowed on our courts simply go one step too far. We have seen from the circulated government amendments that it seems the government has now completely caved in under overwhelming pressure, including from its own members on the legal and constitutional committee.
This does not, however, erase the fact that the government’s original intention was part of the Howard government’s overall attempts to gradually shut down all of the avenues of review, dissent and disagreement. Applicants must have faith that their case will be heard judiciously, and government decision makers should be aware that their decisions can in fact be scrutinised by a body that is known to be independent and not held or captured by the government or a department. The existence of a strong and independent president provides a positive assurance that this is the case. A president with tenure and with the authority and experience of a Federal Court judge gives the tribunal immediate status above that of a mere internal departmental review body. While we could accept the need for some flexibility in the appointment of ordinary members, we were never going to compromise the standing of the tribunal by relinquishing the status of the AAT president by removing tenure from the position and the need for the position to be filled by a chapter 3 court judge.
Therefore, we can say that we are pleased that the government has backed down in this regard. While the strongest concerns during the Senate inquiry into this bill were with the downgrading of the status of the president, there were also strong concerns about the removal of tenured appointments for presidential and senior AAT members. While the howls of protest against these changes were not as loud as the voices against the downgrading of the status of the president, there were significant concerns raised about this issue. Labor shares many of the concerns about the complete abolition of tenured positions in the tribunal. After all, the tenured positions are the best way of ensuring independence and securing good appointments.
The Senate committee report noted that it has become accepted practice that new appointments to the tribunal have been made on a fixed term basis for over 15 years and that this amendment is consistent with longstanding practice. But, similarly, it could be argued that this simply highlights an existing deficiency in the existing act. The arguments that apply to the importance of tenure in maintaining the status of the president can equally be applied to the importance of maintaining a number of tenured positions through the tribunal, although the symbolism is not as high and fearless standards can to some extent be set at the top by the president.
We understand the importance of flexibility in the appointment process, although Labor strongly believes that, at the very least, minimum terms must be maintained for appointments. The current proposal by the government, in our view, is seriously deficient. While the preservation of a number of tenured positions is preferable, the Senate committee recommended minimum term appointments of three years. Labor believes that five years would be preferable and we will be moving amendments to this effect in the committee stage. This will go some way to giving the AAT members the certainty they need and greater public confidence in their decision making.
This does not totally remove the possible perception that an AAT decision could be clouded by a member seeking reappointment, but Labor thinks it is a significant improvement. The government’s early proposals to reform administrative review in Australia failed because it is not willing to uphold the important safeguards existing in the AAT in its current form. In October 2003, when announcing the government’s intention to legislate current reforms, the Attorney-General signalled an ongoing commitment to the amalgamation of merit review tribunals into a single body. Labor rejected that bill, not on the basis of the amalgamation per se but because it did not make many of the changes and initiatives that would have improved the overall decision making capability of the tribunal. The bill undermined the importance of the AAT as a respected public institution, which it still is in our view. We think that the government got too arrogant and that it still maintains that arrogance when it comes to how it wants to reform institutions such as the AAT. When the government turns its mind to issues in social security, veterans’ affairs, tax, Comcare and so on, it seems to want to insulate itself from the ability to ensure that citizens have a fair appeals mechanism into those areas.
Turning to aspects of the Senate committee report in respect of this bill, Labor welcomes and strongly supports the unanimous recommendations. The committee made a number of sensible recommendations that would be a great improvement on the bill as it stands. Labor believes that the government bill went too far, as I think I have made plain, in undermining the status and standing of the AAT. We made no secret of our concerns about measures in the bill which would undermine the standing of the AAT president.
As I have said, we are glad that the government has come to take Labor’s view on this issue. The AAT president, particularly with the expanded powers proposed in the government’s current bill, needs to be in a position where there can be absolutely no question of political influence. This is essentially to maintain the status and integrity of the AAT. The ordinary applicant to the tribunal must be assured that their complaint about a government decision will be heard judiciously.
One of the AAT’s enduring strengths is that it has always been seen to be much more than an internal departmental review mechanism. Whilst it is not a court, and that is clearly recognised, it is seen to act totally independently. By removing the president’s tenure and status as a Federal Court judge, much of the AAT’s strength would have been undermined. The committee has unanimously recommended that this amendment be removed.
The committee made a number of other recommendations, all of which will make important improvements to the bill as it stands. The committee recommended that the act provide a minimum term for all new appointments to the AAT. This was an issue which was raised during hearings and indeed was a recommendation of the Administrative Review Council’s report, Better decisions, in 1995. The committee also recommended that the minimum term be three years. However, a number of submissions would have preferred a longer minimum period of between five and seven years. It was argued that a greater period would further insulate AAT members against any perception of bias or that decisions could be impugned because of a desire for reappointment. I understand that the government has rejected this recommendation. Labor stands behind that recommendation and will move amendments during the committee stage to give effect to that position.
The committee also recommended that further guidance be provided on the circumstances in which the president can remove an AAT member and reconstitute a tribunal in the interests of justice. We argued—for want of a better word—about what that term in fact meant. The Attorney-General’s Department informed the committee that this phrase was used to provide the president with balance so that they could then balance all the competing interests when making a decision. But it concluded that this phrase was too vague and that greater legislative direction should be given to the president when considering any factors that might warrant a member’s removal or the reconstitution of a tribunal. We do not believe, however, that the form of words in the government amendment is entirely adequate.
Finally, the committee recommended that the minister be required to consult with the AAT president before making assignments to divisions of the tribunal. This, combined with the recommendations that the AAT president remain a Federal Court judge, would add an extra layer of transparency and accountability. Again, we can say that we are pleased that the government has accepted the committee recommendation in this area.
We are left with a position where the government has significantly and substantially picked up the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In this respect, you would normally expect the government to be congratulated on following the lead of the committee. However, it seems that the government in this instance acquiesced to the strong arguments that were put by the committee as to why these amendments should be made to ensure that the legislation allows the AAT the status and the ability to act independently and ensures that the public is confident in and recognises the transparency of its decision making. In that instance, I think the government failed to take the bill and move it through in a considered way.
What the government did do, I think, was try to push the envelope by tilting this too far—allowing the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, in some respects, as the gatekeeper, to try to bring back a bit of sense to the bill. The government should be on notice about the need to start at the beginning and work through bills with a proper intent, in my view, rather than rely on committees in that instance to try to add balance. Alternatively, you could take an adverse view and consider that the government was up to mischief and did want to downgrade the tribunal. I will leave it, I suspect, to the public to make that decision. We can certainly argue it, and argue it we will. The committee stage will give us an opportunity to propose additional amendments to the bill and to put our particular views.",SENATE,<title>ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-03-15,"—The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] makes a range of amendments to the procedures and composition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—or the AAT, as we know it. The AAT was established in 1976 to undertake a review of governmental decisions. It is a fundamental element of democracy that citizens can appeal the way in which a government decision adversely affects them. Given the size, power and resource disparity between the government and most citizens, it is very important that any process for reviewing government decisions is fair and accessible.
In establishing the AAT, the underlying objective was to create a system of administrative review that was efficient and accessible but fully focused on substantive rather than procedural issues and committed to ensuring adequate disclosure of relevant information and reasons for decisions. In other words, the aim was to create a system which was committed to accessibility and efficiency on the one hand and procedural fairness on the other. Efficiency was not to be achieved at the expense of procedural fairness.
The government argues that the changes in this bill will improve the capacity of the AAT to manage its workload and ensure that reviews are conducted as efficiently as possible. The focus of this bill is undeniably on efficiency. We Democrats support initiatives to make the AAT more efficient, but we are not advocates of efficiency at any cost. In striving to make the AAT more efficient, we must be very careful not to compromise the proper processes of the tribunal—in particular, those which serve to promote fairness, transparency and good decision making. In this respect, some of the changes proposed in the bill go too far.
The bill reforms the current regime in five key areas. Firstly, it makes a range of changes to the procedures of the AAT—for example, empowering the President of the AAT to give directions regarding the procedures. Tribunal members will be invested with new powers to determine the scope of a particular review by limiting questions of fact and the issues and evidence to be considered. The bill expands the range of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, processes available to the tribunal. In addition, the president will have the power to direct that a proceeding or a class of proceedings be referred to ADR. The president will not only have the power to direct that a particular matter be referred to ADR but be invested with a broader power to make general directions regarding certain categories of disputes. The bill also places a restriction on the use of evidence produced during ADR by preventing its subsequent use in court proceedings or arbitration other than with the express agreement of the parties concerned.
The second way in which the bill amends the current regime is by making changes to the composition of the AAT. Currently, when the tribunal constitutes more than one member, at least one of those members must be a presidential or senior member. The bill removes this requirement so that the tribunal could be entirely made up of ordinary members in any given case. In addition, the bill increases the powers of ordinary members by enabling the president to authorise ordinary members to exercise powers that can currently only be exercised by the president and/or senior members. Under the current regime, questions of law arising in proceedings before the AAT may be referred to the Federal Court. While the bill retains this mechanism, it inserts a new requirement for the president to consent to such a referral. The government indicates that this is intended to ensure that referrals are only made in exceptional circumstances, which, it is hoped, will speed up AAT processes.
Finally, the bill changes the qualification requirements for the President of the AAT. Under the current regime, the president must be a judge of the Federal Court. However, the bill proposes to broaden this so that a current or former judge from any federal court, a former judge from any state or territory Supreme Court or a person who has been enrolled as a legal practitioner for at least five years may be appointed as president of the tribunal. In addition, the bill will remove tenured appointments that currently apply to presidential members who are judges. All future appointments to the AAT will be for a fixed term.
While the Democrats welcome some of these changes, we do have serious concerns about others. For example, the fact that there will no longer be any requirement for the inclusion of a presidential or senior member when the tribunal is made up of multiple members means that it will be possible for an entire panel to be made up of members who have no legal qualifications. Given the often complex legal issues which can arise in AAT proceedings, coupled with the new prohibition on referring questions of law to the Federal Court without the consent of the president, this change is concerning. The requirement for the president to consent to referrals of questions of law to the Federal Court also creates the potential for a conflict of interest if the president is required to consent to the referral of one of his or her own decisions.
There are also very serious issues associated with the relaxing of the qualification requirements for the President of the AAT. The new provisions create the potential for seriously underqualified persons to be appointed as president. In fact, they would permit a person who has been enrolled as a legal practitioner for only five years to be appointed as president. Considering the wide range of powers conferred on the President of the AAT, not only by this bill but also by other pieces of legislation, we believe that it becomes clear that the qualification requirements should be stringent and specific.
Let us not forget that the president may authorise the use of telecommunications interception warrants and the incommunicado detention of ordinary Australians under the ASIO Act. In other words, this is a person who is vested with the power to authorise significant violations of privacy and deprive individuals of their liberty without trial or charge. These are not insignificant powers and they should not be vested in someone who has been enrolled as a legal practitioner for only five years.
Of course, this issue was canvassed at length by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which inquired comprehensively into the bill and recommended that the requirement for the president to be a Federal Court judge be retained. I take this opportunity to commend the committee on its thoughtful and comprehensive report on the bill and, in particular, on its recommendations to improve the bill. The evidence provided to the committee regarding the need to retain the current qualification requirements for the President of the AAT was compelling. Witnesses provided two primary reasons as to why the AAT president should continue to be a Federal Court judge.
The first of these reasons was that a Federal Court judge would have the appropriate skills and experience to do the job properly. As the Public Interest Advocacy Centre argued:
The President’s broad powers and responsibilities necessitate that the incumbent be a person of extensive legal and management experience. A Federal Court Judge is the ideal candidate as they have considerable experience as practitioners and adjudicators, and in managing proceedings.
The second reason advanced for requiring the President of the AAT to be a Federal Court judge was that this would ensure that the president was, and was perceived to be, independent of the government. Mr Graham McDonald, a deputy president member of the AAT, argued:
It is the independence guaranteed by having a Federal Court judge appointed which gives citizens lodging appeals against decisions of government ministers, departmental officers and government instrumentalities the confidence that their matters will be dealt with in accordance with the highest possible quasi-judicial standards.
                  …         …         …
This is of particular importance where the decision being reviewed always involves the Government as a party.
For both of these reasons, we Democrats strongly support the recommendation of the committee that the requirement for the President of the AAT to be a Federal Court judge be retained.
While we largely support the other recommendations of the committee, as we pointed out in our additional comments, we would go further in seeking to address some of the problems with the bill. For example, the Democrats took a different view from the committee on the issue of tenured appointments to the AAT. The bill proposes to limit the term of appointments for all AAT members to a maximum of seven years, with eligibility for reappointment. This will have the effect of removing the possibility for tenured appointments. Although it has been government policy over the past 15 years not to make tenured appointments to the AAT, we Democrats firmly believe that this option should remain in the legislation. This view was shared by the Law Council of Australia, the Law Society of New South Wales and the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Service, all of which argued that the removal of tenured appointments would be likely to compromise the independence of the AAT and inevitably result in a drop in public confidence in its processes.
The committee recommended that the bill be amended to specify a minimum term of appointment of three years. I understand that the opposition proposes to take this one step further by moving an amendment to specify a minimum term of five years. While the Democrats will be supporting that amendment, we believe that the option to make tenured appointments should also be retained. Retaining this option will place no obligation on the government of the day to actually make tenured appointments. Indeed, it would be entirely possible for the government to maintain its practice of making only fixed term appointments. Nevertheless, we believe there is merit in retaining both options and we will move an amendment to ensure that tenured appointments are available in the future.
Another area in which the Democrats advocate amendments beyond those recommended by the committee is in relation to the constitution of multimember panels. In particular, we do not believe that the requirement for multimember tribunals to include at least one presidential member should be removed from the act. The National Welfare Rights Network noted:
... the practice of the Tribunal is to constitute multi-member Tribunals in cases involving significant questions of law, complex issues of fact and detailed consideration of scientific or medical evidence.
Similarly, the Law Council of Australia argued that, on account of the legal complexities associated with multimember tribunal hearings, it is vital that at least one member of the tribunal be legally qualified. We Democrats concur and we will be moving an amendment to oppose the removal of that requirement from the bill. In summary, this bill makes a range of improvements to the legislation governing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Democrats welcome those changes. We are, however, concerned about a number of issues associated with the bill and intend to canvass those issues further as debate on the bill progresses.",SENATE,<title>ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-15,"—The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] is relatively uncontroversial. This is very unlike the violent change the government sought to make through a similar bill some years ago. That bill sought to destroy the independence of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by making each tribunal financially dependent on the relevant department. As well, it sought to introduce more accountability by insisting on the introduction of performance indicators. It is good to be able to say that that flush of new managerialism seems to have abated. This was due in large part to public objection to the government’s motives, which at that time were plain. Those motives were generated by government frustration at AAT decisions which contradicted government policy. But, instead of changing policy and the law, the government sought to change the umpire. Veterans, for one, saw that and rightly objected to some of the changes that were mooted at that time. The independence of both the Veterans Review Board and the AAT from government control was and remains paramount. In contrast, this bill only seeks to make a number of procedural changes to streamline the operations of the tribunal. None of these relate to that earlier doctrinaire approach. In the interests of time, I will not repeat those mooted changes, but I should mention the recommendations of the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.
The committee’s first recommendation is that the appointment of a president continues to be made from the ranks of Federal Court judges. The reason for this is more than just status. The AAT by its very nature is much more than an administrative body. It deals with the law, not administration—despite its title. The position of president is not just a chief executive officer or a manager; the president presides over a legal entity making legally-binding decisions about matters where decisions made under the law are in dispute. The AAT’s role is to adjudicate on the application of the law. Its decisions are appealable to the Federal Court. Given the complexity of the AAT’s own procedures, as instanced in this bill, we believe that nothing less than a Federal Court judge is appropriate.
In a similar vein, the committee recommended that a minimum term of appointment of three years be introduced. Again, we support that recommendation and, hence, the amendment that will be moved. One element is paramount in the law, and that is certainty. Appointments such as these must be above the political ruck. There must be both certainty and continuity. There must be no opportunities for political patronage just to suit the transient interests of the government of the day. The other main recommendation was for the mandatory consultation of the president in the allocation of tribunal members by the minister. If nothing else, one would regard this as a simple courtesy. But, as we all know, ministers are not always renowned for this quality. It is better provided for in the legislation.
This bill provides an opportunity to express a few other views on administrative law. My particular interest is in the veterans jurisdiction. The Senate will appreciate that the veterans jurisdiction is quite complex. Indeed, some regard it as cumbersome. The efficient working of review processes in that context is very important. As in other jurisdictions, there has been an intensification of review of decisions in more recent years. As well as having access to the AAT, veterans have their own tribunal in the Veterans Review Board. Many outsiders see this as an unnecessary duplication of review. Occasionally governments have been daring enough to try to abolish it or wrap it into the AAT. In fact, the Howard government tried just this, in a way, with the new military compensation legislation last year. It sought to exclude serving personnel from its purview. Needless to say, the ex-service community objected. The end result was that all appeals against unsuccessful military compensation claims can now go to the VRB as well as the AAT. The process is now the same for veterans, as is set out in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. There is double access to review and everyone is treated in the same fashion.
It is said by critics that the availability of an extra layer of review not only is costly but also adds time. It is also said that it unwisely creates or maintains an appeals culture. That may be true to a limited extent, though that overlooks an intrinsic feature of veterans law—that is, onus of proof, to which I will return in a moment. It should also be said, as the Administrative Review Council has noted, that the Veterans Review Board is a high-volume, low-cost operation. To that extent, it performs a very real function for those in real need. As well, veterans believe that review should be conducted by membership with some military experience. In this way they can be assured of greater empathy with military service, which is often beyond civilian comprehension.
Certainly the procedures are non-threatening, and I know that members always seek to facilitate cases rather than deal only with the facts as presented. This is consistent with the requirement of the Veterans’ Entitlement Act that the department carry the onus of proof, not the claimant. This is a significant difference from other jurisdictions and tribunals. This was a matter considered by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee in its inquiry into administrative review in the veterans jurisdiction in 2003.
This reversed onus of proof excuses veterans from fully proving their claims. It is up to the department to investigate the claim and to find the evidence to support it. The reversed onus of proof means that the department must disprove all claims—beyond reasonable doubt, in many cases. Hence the problem of the quality of evidence presented. Associated with this is the problem of records which are of variable quality. This means ultimately that administrative review in this jurisdiction rests largely on the quality of evidence as presented. Hence the entire review process turns, in most cases, on new evidence—and the better the advocacy, the better the chances of successful review. Good advocates know the ropes, but unfortunately they come at a price—at the AAT at least.
Affordability remains a major issue for real justice in administrative law. Many simply cannot manage the complexity of the law or the processes. This is despite the aims that administrative law as dispensed by the AAT should be accessible and inexpensive. Veterans are very fortunate for a couple of other reasons. One is that ex-service organisations have a key role in looking after their mates. The assistance they provide in helping people through the review process is very substantial. This has been recognised by government through the provision of funding for training of ex-service advocates. It also provides some modest resources for administrative support, including computers, software and staff. The other reason is that veterans are entitled to non-means tested legal aid. For those people who are critical of these benefits, it should be said that these are traditional policies based on commitments made long ago when troops were sent overseas to war. It is an entitlement from a grateful country to those who chose to serve. Of course, nothing has changed, and both sides of this chamber abide by that commitment. Hence the support we gave on this side to the amendment to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill providing for access to the VRB.
To return to the bill for a moment, the introduction of new evidence through the review process has always been controversial. On one side the argument is that reviews should be restricted to the claim and the decision made in the first instance. New evidence, the critics say, should see the case returned to the primary claim decision maker. Yet, as I have set out, obtaining evidence is probably the greatest problem in most jurisdictions. Quite often, it is not available in the first instance. Often the shortcoming cannot be realised until the hearing has been conducted and all the facts are on the table. Thus we have elaborate conciliation processes prior to hearing where these matters are sorted out.
In this bill there are two new provisions which will assist this further. The first is the new capacity of the president to direct an alternative dispute resolution process—that is, the parties are sent off to negotiate an outcome. Inevitably, this will centre on the evidence. Rather this than the cost of a full hearing in which evidence might still be deficient. Further, a new provision is made requiring the engagement in this process of the primary decision maker. This seems quite sensible, although the reservations expressed by the Parliamentary Library on the practicality of this should be noted. With respect to the assertion that new evidence should be returned to the primary decision maker, the practicality is that the tribunal deal with it. This pragmatic attitude has now also been applied through this bill to the Federal Court. Instead of remitting a case to the AAT, the Federal Court, through this bill, will also be able to determine or realise a decision. Again, this is a practical move to streamline reviews in everyone’s interests.
I venture these views so that they are on the record. Too often, the importance of administrative review is overlooked or not even understood. As we all know from representations made to us, primary decisions can be fraught with error. In many cases, such as migration, it involves the personal future of applicants. Human rights are therefore paramount in this context. In other cases, such as social security, it is simply about ensuring that claims for entitlement are not wrongfully denied. As I have said about veterans, in those cases it is about honouring past commitments to those who served overseas in the service of our nation. For ex-service people, like social security claimants, it is about ensuring that entitlements are properly and fairly determined. In large part, I believe we can have some certainty, particularly in this jurisdiction, that the system is working effectively. There are, however, always exceptions. They occur sometimes through evidentiary shortcomings. Sometimes they flow from a lack of clarity in the law. Despite expressed intentions, they often happen because the claimant does not have the skills or the means to properly represent and argue their perspective.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-15,"—There remain only a few moments before question time, but I will commence the reply so that the debate is concluded. There are a number of reforms in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] which are the result of longstanding consultation. As well, I foreshadow amendments to the bill in the committee stage, which stem from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report. We have accepted some of those recommendations, and I will be dealing with that in more detail during the committee stage. I understand that there will also be some Democrats amendments to deal with as well. This is a very important bill, one which has been a long time in coming, and of course it is essential that we pass it this week. I thank speakers for the contribution they have made to the debate, and I will deal with a number of issues when the debate resumes on this matter.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-03-15,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Is the minister aware that a detailed Senate report into skills shortages entitled Bridging the skills divide was tabled in the Senate on 6 November 2003? Is the minister also aware that this report contains over 50 recommendations, the vast majority of which were supported by government senators on the committee and could form a valuable blueprint for fighting the current skills crisis? Can the minister explain why, nearly 18 months later, the government has still not managed to even formally respond to the report, let alone put this constructive blueprint into action?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skills Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. As the minister would be well aware, in this area it is not what you spend the dollar on, it is how you spend the dollar. Obviously, with the current skills crisis we have, you have not spent the dollars wisely. I ask the minister: when she seeks a response to the committee’s report from the appropriate minister in the other house, could she also ask the minister to indicate why the government did not implement all the recommendations of that report, given that they had received broad support from all members of the committee?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skills Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-03-15,"—I thank the senator for his question. Yes, I am aware of the report to which he refers, and it may well be the case that the government has not responded. I note in the latter part of his question he says, ‘let alone put anything into action,’ which creates the impression, not necessarily intentionally on the senator’s behalf, that the government is not in fact doing anything about skills shortages, in particular the domestic supply for skills shortages, which of course brings you to the training system. I say first up that I will make an inquiry of the minister as to when we might expect a formal government response. I will also ask him, in the context of that, to indicate what the government has been doing in the meantime. I am sure the minister does understand, from his long history with the union movement and their arguments with governments, that governments do not simply do things because a report recommends something and they certainly do not stop doing things because there is a report—a lot keeps happening in the meantime.
You would understand, Senator, the very strong commitment the coalition government has to a training system for vocational education. You would understand that in the election the government announced $1.06 billion in new funding over three years for vocational education and training. That is, as I am advised, one of the most significant boosts to vocational training ever undertaken by any government. The government has increased overall VET funding by 35.5 per cent between 1997-98 and 2003-04. In fact, if we look at the increase since the 1995-96 budget, the total Australian government contribution to VET has increased by 57.5 per cent in real terms. As I am advised, that is not a nominal dollar increase; that is real bucks in the pocket, in either today’s dollars or 1995 dollars. In any event, in real terms, in the same dollars, it is a 57.5 per cent—nearly 60 per cent—increase.
This year, the Australian government will spend a record $2.1 billion on vocational education and training. That includes over $1 billion to the states and territories under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act to support the states and territories in their training systems. The Australian government’s contribution to states and territories under the VET Funding Act has grown from nearly $800 million—$778 million, roughly—under Labor to $1.15 billion under the coalition government in 2005, a very substantial increase of some 48 per cent. That one is not in real terms; it is a 22 per cent increase in real terms.
I have made this point here before: in 2004-05 most of the states and territories cut their training. All states and territories rejected the Australian government’s offer for the proposed new agreement of $3.6 billion—a 12.5 per cent increase. If they had accepted that offer, that offer would have created up to 71,000 new training places. They would be in addition to the extra 15,750 places for aged care training announced in the 2004-05 budget. The government’s offer of a further six months rollover of the current ANTA agreement to 30 June this year, when ANTA’s functions will be transferred to the Department of Education, Science and Training, has been accepted by all the states and territories. The minister has also given them a guarantee of the level of Australian government funding to 2005. That will provide certainty in the current academic year for vocational education and training.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skills Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-03-15,"—Of course I will I do that. The senator gives me the opportunity to point out that 38 per cent of new apprentices are in the trades and related occupations, covering trades such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians, while those occupations make up only 13 per cent of the work force. So 38 per cent of new apprenticeships have been in an area that comprises 13 per cent of the work force. For the 12 months to 30 September, there were 68,500 new apprenticeship commencements—an increase of 19 per cent on the previous year. What does that tell you, Senator? It tells you a well-managed economy runs well; there is increased demand and growing demand for jobs. This is in stark contrast to the previous time of a Labor government.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2005-03-15,"—My question is to the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald. Will the minister outline to the Senate the Howard government’s global leadership role in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing? How is this strengthening the protection of Australia’s borders? Is the minister aware of any alternative policy approaches?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fisheries: Illegal Operators</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-03-15,"—Senator Scullion, through his long leadership in the seafood industry, would be well aware of the damage that illegal fishing causes to national economies and also to our very fragile world marine ecosystem. In large part due to the Howard government’s leadership in protecting its own borders and its fish stock, there is at last movement internationally to recognise the worldwide-scale serious criminal activity involved in illegal fishing.
As honourable senators will know, I have recently returned from a meeting in Europe of the ministerial High Seas Task Force, which involved nine ministers and some non-government organisations, including the heads of WWF, IUCN and Greenpeace, who, like me, are frustrated at the slow pace of international action against illegal fishing. As a result of this task force of ministers, we have agreed to extend and better resource the international global monitoring control and surveillance network into illegal fishing. We are going to establish a list of vessels permitted to fish on the high seas. Some people might say, ‘So what?’ about that. There is a list of all vessels allowed to carry cargo and oil on the high seas, but there has never been one for fishing vessels. That has enabled illegal fishing to expand.
We are also going to do work to benchmark and highlight the performance of flag states and port states with a view to naming and shaming flags of convenience so that the incident which happened in the Southern Ocean last week, where an Australian patrol vessel was unable to deal with vessels that were fishing not illegally but in an unreported way in areas that were closed to fishing, will not be repeated. As well, as a result of this meeting I will be getting the Attorney-General to advise me on whether we can actually, as a nation and with like-minded nations, take legal action against flag states who do not honour their international obligations.
I was delighted whilst in Paris to meet with two French ministers, Mme Girardin, the Minister for Overseas France, and M. Bussereau, the minister for maritime and fisheries matters. I am delighted to say that the French are very keen to assist us, not only in the Southern Ocean as they are now doing but also, importantly, in the Pacific Ocean, where we share many interests with the French.
I then went to Rome to the FAO ministerial meeting. I had the very great honour to chair this ministerial council. Over 121 nations were present. More than half of them were represented by ministers, and it was really an honour for me to be able to chair that meeting. We presented our national plan of action and we dealt with and joined in completing a ministerial declaration on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. I table that for the benefit of the Senate.
I am asked by Senator Scullion whether I am aware of any alternative policies. It is very easy for me to answer this because the answer is no. Before the election the Labor Party actually had five different policies on border control and illegal fishing. But since the election they have no policies at all. The Labor Party is a policy-free zone. Their leader has indicated they are not even going to look at any new policies. It is with some regret that the Labor Party has withdrawn from policy debate on border control and fisheries control. (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
—Buy yourself a tape recorder and play yourself back!
—Thank you for that contribution, Senator Vanstone. I am actually going to talk about Senator Vanstone’s answers in question time—or her failure to answer, yet again, questions about the skills shortages which have developed under this government. The minister was asked about two reports, one presented to the Senate in 2003 and one presented to the House of Representatives this week, in which the Howard government’s failure to deal with the skills shortage is documented. The fact is that under this government we have seen skills shortages emerge which are now a substantial constraint on economic growth.
Government senators interjecting—
—This is not something that just the Labor Party are saying; this is something that the Reserve Bank is saying. You do not like hearing this, do you? You do not like the fact that you have been warned about skills shortages over a number of years and—you know what?—you have done nothing about it. What you have seen since 1996 is a reduction in the share of new apprenticeships in the traditional trades. You do not have an answer to that.
The fact is that the Reserve Bank, other commentators and Senate and House of Representatives committees have been saying that there is a skills shortage emerging, and what has this government done? It has done nothing. What it has done is ensure that we have increasing numbers of new apprenticeships in areas where there are no skills shortages and a reducing share of apprenticeships in areas where there are skills shortages. This is hardly a sensible policy towards vocational training; it is hardly a sensible economic policy.
Why is this a concern? Clearly it is a concern because skills shortages are a constraint on economic growth. Under this government what we have had is neglect or wilful ignorance which has allowed the skills shortage to build into a substantial economic constraint. It is not just a constraint in terms of economic growth; it is clearly also a constraint in terms of people’s capacity to fill jobs in the Australian labour market. This is not a new issue—it is an issue that has been documented for some time—but it is clear from more recent employment data that these skills shortages or skills deficits are growing as a constraint on people’s ability to enter the labour market.
Just last week we had the ABS statistics of persons not in the labour force, where it was clear that of the discouraged job seekers—these are people who have given up because they do not think they can find work—almost 50 per cent, that is, 48 per cent, identified a skills related issue as the reason they were discouraged; 25 per cent indicated that they lacked the necessary schooling, training, skills or experience; and 23 per cent indicated ‘no jobs in locality or line of work’. That is clearly a skills and job-matching issue.
Also, just today other ABS figures have been released which show that around 55,000 part-time workers in Australia identified that there are no vacancies in their line of work—that is, their skills do not match the current vacancies—and a further 30,000 lack the necessary skills or training for the work that is advertised. Now what does this mean? What this means is we have a gap between the skills which are required by employers and those which prospective employees have—a significant gap, a significant loss of employment potential and a significant effect on employment outcomes for Australians.
What is the government’s response to that? Again, we see a short-term fix response from this government. We see an emphasis on skilled migration, on bringing in people instead of training Australian workers. What do the government say to the unemployed young people in Newcastle? What do the government say to the unemployed young people and mature age workers in Geelong? They say, ‘Sorry, we haven’t worked on this enough since 1996, so we’re going to bring a whole range of skilled workers in from overseas to take these jobs.’ Perhaps one of the most damning things that has happened this week in relation to this is that in the report tabled in the House of Representatives the government’s own backbenchers have confirmed that they know there is a skills shortage. They know that the Howard government need to do more. They know what seems to have escaped the ministers in this place: that more needs to be done by the government if we are going to address the skills shortage. Even the government’s own backbenchers have identified the skills shortage and identified that the government have to do more to address this shortage and to maximise the uptake of traditional apprenticeships. In tabling the report, the member for Deakin noted one modeller’s predictions that in 2020 there will be half a million jobs in Australia with no-one to fill them. (Time expired)

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2005-03-15,"—I rise to speak on the answer given by Senator Vanstone to Senator Wong’s question on skills shortages. We do have skills shortages at the moment, but let us contrast this with what happened under the Labor government in the late eighties and the early nineties. There were absolutely no skills shortages at all. The reason for that was that unemployment was so high. There were so many jobs not created at that time because of the Keating-induced recession that it obviously was not a problem.
—You know that is not the only reason.
—Senator Wong, the corollary of that is that, if you have high employment and unemployment is dropping rapidly, then obviously you are going to get skills shortages. You reported on a House of Representatives inquiry that brought down a report last week. The Senate held inquiries into this matter back in the early nineties and into the late nineties. The reason we held those inquiries is that we were trying to solve the major problem facing the country at that time, which was unemployment. The Keating-induced unemployment created problems with youth unemployment in this country. We held an inquiry into youth unemployment. It created enormous problems with long-term unemployment. We held a Senate inquiry into long-term unemployment. It created enormous problems with the older people in the work force who could not get jobs. We held an inquiry into that. We were trying to get people into work. We were trying to create schemes to find work for people. But the world has moved on. Australia has moved on. Areas of Australia that used to have very high unemployment have moved on.
Senator Wong referred to Newcastle. Let us compare what was happening in the nineties to what is happening now. Regional unemployment under the Hawke-Keating government was up around 16 per cent. What is it today? It is six per cent. Senator Wong said that the youth of Newcastle would be missing out. They were sure missing out under the Labor Party! Up to 30 per cent were missing out because they were not getting jobs under Labor. The Hunter economy is now booming, along with the rest of the Australian economy, and these people are getting jobs. That does not mean that we should not be undertaking measures to try to fix the skills shortage, but keep in mind that the basic underlying problem is the fact of high employment in this country. That is why we are now running out of workers—because of the Australian economy booming.
—They are running out of skills! There’s a difference—
—Let us have a look at the short-, medium- and long-term solutions to this. The short-term solutions are obviously in the area of having people from overseas with skills coming into the country to fill in where we do have shortages. That will help the economy develop and boom. In the medium term, we need to retrain our people and train more in the specific skills areas that are missing. In the long term, as I said in this place last week, we need to encourage the return of those people with very high levels of skills who have gone overseas and not returned. There are now one million highly skilled Australians working overseas. A population the size of Adelaide is working overseas. If we can encourage more of those people to come back, that will certainly help ease the skills shortage. There are proposals for programs in place to actually do that.
Senator Campbell has been interjecting about our inquiry into this. With regard to the medium-term solution of improving the skills of our youth and getting them jobs, one of the things that we did discover was that the attitude of parents and teachers was putting young people off going into trades. They say everyone should go to university. That is not a realistic outcome. The Prime Minister has made comments on that recently—that we need to change those attitudes and get more of our young people to see the trades as a really worthwhile occupation. The government, through New Apprenticeships, has brought in a series of programs to do that.
—Did somebody switch the lights on? That was part of our report months ago, which you just ignored. The minister did not even have the courtesy to respond to it!
—Senator, in the nineties, when you were in government, the traditional trades kept declining year after year. Now, with the New Apprenticeships scheme and other schemes in place, we have the mechanisms for improving that if we can change attitudes. (Time expired)

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I rise to speak on Senator Vanstone’s answer to Senator Wong’s question on skills shortages. Just as a sign of friendship towards Senator Tierney, if I get time before I leave this place at the end of June, I will try to sit down with him and explain that a skills shortage does not necessarily equate with unemployment rates. In fact, it does not have anything to do with it. This is the problem with this government: they look at one thing and say, ‘We’ll fix our problem by diverting attention to something different.’ That is what they are trying to do here. It seems that it is terribly late for the government to wake up to the fact that we have this skills shortage. There is no doubt, as you go around industry and talk to industry leaders, unions and workers, that there is a crying shortage of people trained and ready to do those jobs, particularly in the traditional trades. There are a number of reasons that this has come about, and it has come about since this government has been in power.
I argued many times before coming to this place with employers and told them not to go down the line of saying: ‘We don’t need people who are non-core to our business. We don’t need tradespeople. We’re manufacturers. We’re producers of a product. The tradespeople are incidental.’ Try as you might, you could not convince these employers that they were taking the wrong approach in using labour hire companies to bring in tradespeople to do the work. They have botched it because the labour hire companies simply do not want to train tradespeople. They want someone else to train them, but who is there to train them? They are all labour hire. So the companies made that choice, supported by government policy.
Companies were more interested in buying out older workers and indeed young workers with packages and incentives to leave the industry. They said, ‘If you don’t want to leave your trade then we’ll offer you a job as a production worker.’ All those skills have been lost, thanks to the policy of this government. Then they have the hide to stand up in this place and try to take us back in history to unemployment rates, which have got nothing to with it. You will have unemployment or full employment regardless of what the skill levels of people are. There will be work for people who want it if it is offered in the proper way. But this government just simply want to take advantage of a situation they did not see coming.
The majority of Liberal senators agreed with the recommendations contained in the 2003 report but did not have the courage to press it with the government—to press their point of view—and get the minister to do something about it to address the needs of industry. I took part in much of that inquiry. We went to industry and asked the questions. Time and time again they were saying, ‘We can’t get people to come into traditional trades.’ As a parent with young sons going through school, I understand that we all aim to have our children achieve the highest possible results. We all get caught up with the idea that they are going to university. That is what the schools want. Outcomes at school equate to going to university, and that is supported by this government.
But suddenly the government are saying, through the Prime Minister, that there is nothing wrong with being a tradesperson. Yet it is too late to catch up with what we have got in front of us now. The shortage is immediate. We cannot overturn it immediately. It is a demonstration that this government just took their eye off the ball yet again. They tried to whack the workers and say: ‘We’ve got it right. We’ll get a highly educated, highly motivated work force.’ But they had it already, and they bought it out. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-03-15,"—In the latter part of last year, I had the privilege of opening a vocational training facility, the St Joseph the Worker training centre, at Cardijn College in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. This is a facility which is providing training opportunities leading to apprenticeships in the building industry for young people. It will be open to not only students of Cardijn College but also students from other schools in the region. This is just one example of the initiatives that the Howard government is taking—this was a centre largely funded by the Howard government—in fostering cooperative efforts to overcome the skills shortage.
That skills shortage has become evident, as Senator Tierney said a few moments ago, because of the outstanding success of the Howard government in reducing the high levels of unemployment it inherited from the Keating and Hawke Labor governments and indeed in maintaining strong levels of growth in the economy, which is demanding that jobs be filled. Senator Tierney also alluded to the fact that there was no problem with regard to a skills shortage in the period of the Labor government because of those high levels of unemployment.
Another reason that this problem of a skills shortage has emerged is that, during that era of the Labor government and particularly during the period when John Dawkins was minister for education, the view was that everyone had to obtain a university degree. Under Dawkins, all tertiary institutions—previously colleges of advanced education, teachers colleges and the like—were converted to universities. All graduates from those institutions suddenly became university graduates because of this demand that everyone must have a university degree. The consequence was that the status of other post-secondary qualifications, such as apprenticeships, was downgraded. That is another source of this particular problem that is being addressed by the Howard government—by statements from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, and others indicating that a university degree is not an indicator of job status but indeed that trades qualifications are extremely important in the context of Australia’s development and that those with trades qualifications will make an enormous contribution towards the development of Australia.
This government is addressing quite strongly this issue of skills shortages, particularly in traditional trades. Not only are we providing those educational opportunities but we are working with industry to address identified skills shortages. Additional focus is being placed—
—How?
—If you listen, Senator, you will hear just exactly how we are doing it. We are placing additional focus on the traditional trades. As I said, Australia’s economic boom has been a major factor in this dramatic increase in the demand for skilled workers.
—Tell us how you are doing it. Come on, give us an example.
—Let me tell you, Senator. A substantial 38 per cent of new apprenticeships are in the trades and related occupations—covering trades such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians—while these occupations make up only 13 per cent of the employed work force. The percentage of new apprentices entering this field is almost three times the percentage of the work force that those trades make up. For the 12 months to 30 September last year, there were about 68,500 new apprenticeship commencements, which was a 19 per cent increase on the previous year in trades and related occupations. There has also been an increase of 18 per cent in new apprentices in trades and related occupations since September 1996—the year that the Howard government came to office. That means that there were 126,100 new apprentices in trades and related occupations in 1996, and that went up to 148,400 by September 2004. Additionally, during the last five years, employment has grown in trades and related occupations at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, while the rate of new apprentices training in the same occupations has grown 3½ times faster, at an average rate of two per cent. Since 1996 there has been a 55 per cent increase in the number of young people commencing in trades.
All of those statistics clearly demonstrate the success of the Howard government’s initiatives with regard to addressing the skills shortages. These initiatives have not been undertaken just in the last year or so but in fact commenced to address the neglect that was a feature of the previous Labor government. We addressed that neglect as soon as we came to office in 1996. Since 1999, $12½ million has been contributed by the federal government towards investigating and addressing future skill needs.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I would like to speak about the answers to questions asked of the Minister for the Arts and Sports today. I must begin by pointing out that the recent trend in arts programs highlights just what a mess the cultural program of this government is in. The major arts funding agency, the Australia Council, is now faced with a series of funding crises that cannot be solved individually. Yet that is the approach the government seems to take when it comes to dealing with cultural policy. It seeks to isolate individual companies and individual problems and then tie future government funding to economic performance indicators that a number of states have demonstrated to be of dubious value.
The Sydney Dance Company is the latest cultural institution to face insolvency. The Australia Council is facing massive protests against its attempt to abolish the community cultural development programs.
—This is all the fault of the government, is it?
—Indeed it is. We have a situation where the Strong review has highlighted that the accumulated deficits of the orchestras is approaching $7 million. The review projects that by 2010, on a reasonable assumption as to the future movements in costs and revenue, the Queensland Orchestra, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Opera Australia and the Australian Ballet could all face accumulated deficits which approach or exceed the orchestras’ total annual revenue in that year. The financial situation of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra is similarly precarious, with a projected accumulated deficit by 2010 of $3.8 million or 44 per cent of the orchestra’s projected revenue in that year.
We have got a central problem running through all of these difficulties, Senator Hill, and it is simply this: the government’s financial program is unsustainable—and that is what the CEO of the Australia Council has told the council and also Senate estimates. What we have got now is a core problem whereby the government has failed to maintain proper indexation arrangements to maintain the quality of grants programs. Not only that; it has insisted on an efficiency dividend which has seen a situation where, on a base indexation grant of 2.2 per cent, a one per cent efficiency dividend is also subtracted, which means the effective rate of indexation for our cultural institutions is 1.2 per cent. With average cost movements in wages alone of around four per cent, it is not difficult to see what happens. We have got a growing gap between the amounts of money that the government is providing as core funding and the amount of money required to sustain programs.
Equally significant is the fact that the average cost has not been met. If we look at the accumulated deficit—currently about $7 million—and take into account what would have happened if the government had maintained indexation, it is about the same amount of money, about $6.8 million. They zero each other out. The key issue here is the failure of the government to provide an effective indexation arrangement to ensure that these important cultural institutions are able to do their jobs.
We have a situation now where 72 per cent of the orchestras’ base and core costs are devoted to salaries and on-costs. There is not a lot they can do, other than—as the government are now proposing they do—cut staff. The government’s answer to this financial crisis is to cut back on skills—to cut back on the people who maintain these important programs. That is the government’s answer to everything, isn’t it? Sack workers. They do not provide increased investment, they do not provide adequate indexation; they sack the musicians. That is their answer to the problem: sack the musicians. What an extraordinary proposition it is that the government do not seem to appreciate just how important these institutions are in cultural terms and economic terms. They do not understand that they have got to look beyond Sydney and Melbourne when it comes to the provision of support for cultural institutions.
What we have to say to the government is: reject these recommendations from the Strong review. It is a good report; the problem is that the recommendations are just wrong. They have got to look to a new funding model so that various other cultural institutions will not also be faced with a financial crisis like the one that has been exposed with Australia’s orchestras.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-15,"—Firstly, I would like to add my support as a Queensland senator to ensuring that the symphony orchestra in my own state is not degraded and devalued as a result of the report that has just been spoken about. I would also like to speak to some of the other issues that were addressed in question time, particularly the questions regarding skills. We have a debate in this country about whether we should increase the skilled migrant intake or increase the spending on training, trades apprenticeships and skills development. It is not so much a matter of either/or of course; there can be an approach for action in both areas. Clearly, the fact that there needs to be such a huge increase in the skills section of the migration program or that we are also considering increasing the number of people who can come on temporary visas with skills or on temporary business visas is a clear indication of how this government has fallen short of the mark and does not have a long-term vision about skills, about trades, about apprenticeships and about education at the elite level and at the tertiary level more broadly. It is a clear indication of failure.
There are a few other aspects that need to be emphasised. I have spoken a number of times about how I do not believe the degrading of the family aspect of the migration program has been in Australia’s interests. The minister today said that the government has shifted the focus of the migration program much more towards skills and reduced the number of people who can come in under the family aspect of the program. I want to refer to a comment by Minister Vanstone’s predecessor, Minister Ruddock, which was made a few years ago when he was the immigration minister and the skills intake was around 35,000. There were calls then, as there always are from the business community, to increase it and to let in more people on permanent skilled visas. At the time, he said—and, I think, with a lot of validity—that if you dramatically increase the intake under the skills program, you will have to set the bar so low that you would be degrading the effectiveness of the program and not getting the skill level, in some aspects, that is necessary. Yet, four or five years later, we are looking at having a program close to 100,000—almost three times the amount it was when Mr Ruddock made those comments. There is some scope for an increase, but to say that you could increase it nearly threefold and not have some of the problems that Mr Ruddock pointed to is, I think, misleading people.
I think, in many ways the government know that it is not going to be feasible in some of the skill areas to actually get the people from overseas. It is not as if there is this huge number of highly skilled people in all of the areas we want who are just sitting around with no country that will take them. In many of these areas there is a highly competitive market. Australia actually offers lower salaries than many of the other countries for some of the skills that we are short of. Unless we dramatically increase salary payments—and that would put pressure on interest rates as well as create issues of equity—then we are simply not going to get them. The only way to get people for the amount that we pay in Australia would be to reduce the level of qualifications required. I think there is a misleading aspect to the suggestion that there is a quick fix here.
The second aspect I would point to is that we should not forget that we have many skilled people in Australia, including migrants, who are being prevented from having their skills used to full effectiveness. We have thousands of refugees on temporary visas who are excluded from English language classes and from going to the various educational institutions that would allow them to upgrade their skills. I draw attention to a report in the Independent about UK refugees and the loss of the skills of those people. Compare the cost of training a new doctor to the small amount required to fund a person who is already trained as a doctor to upgrade their skills to Australian standards. There are people right here in our community with the skills. The same applies with family reunion. People cannot bring their family with them because the government has reduced the program. They are also less likely to come here for that reason. It has actually been the crackdown on some aspects of the refugee program, through temporary visas and the separation of family that attaches to temporary protection visas for refugees, as well as the crackdown on the family program, that is hurting the supply of skills.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I withdraw general business notice of motion No. 98 standing in my name for today relating to the production of documents regarding roadworks near the Anzac commemorative site. I seek leave to make a very brief statement on this matter.
Leave granted.
—Earlier today Minister Ellison offered a private briefing to the opposition on this matter. I thank the minister for that offer. As the Australian Democrats and Greens were supportive of the original motion, I would ask that the minister extend to those parties the offer of a briefing if they so desire it. In doing so, may I note very briefly that it is interesting that the government seeks to negate this motion. The motion would have required the government to table a letter. That letter was written last August by the former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mrs Vale, to the government of Turkey and, according to Foreign Minister Downer, the letter requested roadworks be undertaken near the Anzac commemorative site at Gallipoli. There is considerable concern in the Australian community that remains of Australian war dead at Gallipoli may have been disturbed by the roadworks. There is great concern that this government has not done enough to protect Gallipoli from the pressures of tourism. These concerns need to be urgently addressed and, whilst it is disappointing the government has indicated it would refuse to table the letter in question, I do acknowledge the government offered us a private briefing and thank the minister for the courtesy of that.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,NOTICES,12,1,speech

—I move:
That the Senate endorse the findings at paragraph 1.36 of the 121st report of the Committee of Privileges.
This report involves references relating to the unauthorised disclosure of two separate draft reports of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. The matter of particular concern to the Committee of Privileges was that each report had been leaked to a favoured journalist before either of them had been considered by the community affairs committee as a whole.
Notwithstanding the potentially serious nature of the disclosure, in the first case only two of the members regarded the issue as so serious that it should be raised as a matter of privilege. Although the second matter was referred on behalf of the community affairs committee, several members, when asked directly by the Committee of Privileges, did not regard the unauthorised disclosure as constituting substantial actual or potential interference with the operations of the committee. These attitudes brought into focus a matter which has concerned the Committee of Privileges for some time: the question whether unauthorised disclosure of committee deliberations and draft reports should be regarded as constituting a substantial interference, thereby constituting contempt of the Senate.
As a consequence, and also because two members of the privileges committee were, because of their membership of the community affairs committee, unable to participate in its deliberations, the committee has decided that it needs to examine the whole question in isolation from consideration of individual cases. For this reason, at the end of my statement in support of the motion I have just moved, I intend to seek leave to give a notice of motion to refer the question to the Committee of Privileges.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-15,"—I would like to speak to this motion on behalf of the Democrats as a whole but also, perhaps more importantly, on behalf of our staff and others. As you know, Mr President, I have raised this issue before. This motion in effect seeks the right to extend the time that the temporary vehicle barriers are kept up outside Parliament House. They are usually referred to as the oversized white Lego blocks—horrendously unsightly things, as I think we would all agree; certainly, we would all welcome them going as soon as possible. I recognise of course that they are there for security purposes and therefore should not be removed until the security issues are dealt with, which is what this motion goes to, but I do think it is appropriate to take up some of the Senate’s time to comment briefly on matters surrounding this and matters raised in the documentation that was tabled along with the motion.
Basically, the construction of the wall around the outside of Parliament House should be complete by the end of May. As I understand it, that means that the large white Lego blocks will be removed from that area as the wall will meet the security concerns. But they will still be required in other parts of the surrounds of Parliament House until the bollards that are intended to prevent access to the slip-roads going up to the Senate and the House of Representatives entrances are activated. The intent—as was made clear, I should note, when these works were first proposed—was to prevent vehicle access to those slip-roads on the basis of a security analysis that that was too high a risk. I acknowledge that, in that situation, of course the officers of the Department of Parliamentary Services have to act on those security concerns and seek to reduce them to a more acceptable level.
It is always a difficult balancing act, but I have to put on the record that there are still significant concerns about how adequately the new arrangements will work for occupants of this building who are waiting to be picked up, whether by others in a car, by a cab or through other arrangements. As I understand it, this is not going to apply to parliamentarians: the bollards will retract and Comcars will still be allowed access to the Senate and House of Representative entrances. But, for all other Parliament House occupants, cars will not be able to get to those areas and they will need to be picked up elsewhere.
I realise these matters are still being considered; a discussion paper will be provided. The aspect that concerns me is that the large white Lego blocks cannot be removed until the bollards are activated, and the bollards will not be activated until issues regarding people being collected from outside parliament are resolved. I am not sure how quickly that will happen. All the proposals I have heard to date seem to me to be problematic, particularly for disabled access—that is not just for people in wheelchairs but for others who have mobility problems more generally. Requiring them to walk further distances does not strike me as desirable if it can be avoided. Again, I know that this is being done on the basis of a security report and there is a duty of care obligation to all occupants of the building in relation to those matters, but there is also a duty of care for occupants of the building with regard to waiting outside, particularly in inclement weather. As people know, as well as when it is raining, it does get rather cold in Canberra in the evenings for parts of the year. And there are security issues for people waiting outside at night as well.
Firstly, I am not sure whether 30 June will be sufficient time to get those issues resolved. If not, we will need to come back to get a further extension for the use of the large white Lego blocks, and that is a concern. Secondly, I am worried that we are now basically setting up a dynamic where the Lego blocks will remain unless there is agreement reached about activating the bollards and requiring all other building occupants to be picked up elsewhere than immediately outside the entrances. The public focus may well be, and usually is, on the 226 politicians that occupy this building for 15 weeks or so of the year—that is not as many weeks as we should, in my view, but that is a matter for another debate. But there are many thousands of other people who occupy this building, many of them every working day of the year: the different attendants, various staff, the committee secretariats, people in the library, many parliamentary staff and other service staff. All of them occupy this building far more frequently than the parliamentarians do, and I am concerned that their interests are adequately considered as part of these arrangements.
I know it is a difficult balancing act—I know there are difficult issues there—but I think it appropriate to put on the record my concern. I voiced concern some time back, when the authorisation was given to set forth on constructing the wall, that there was no satisfactory resolution to this problem to date. As you would know, Mr President, that is still a matter of contention for many people here. I am not suggesting that I am the only one with this concern but I think it is appropriate to put on the record that it really does need more thought, because I am certainly not convinced that the solutions that have been put forward to date will be workable.
When considering how to balance out those solutions versus security risks, I think perhaps the views of the occupants of the building in the broader sense need to be taken into account a bit more than they have to date. Putting forward discussion papers is good, but the authorisation only extends to the end of June for the large Lego blocks and there was a specific statement that they will not be removed until the bollards are activated—and they cannot be activated until agreement is reached. There is a bit of an underlying implication that this is all going to be sorted out pretty soon. Obviously I hope it is, but I think, in that context, that time pressure should not be used as a reason to short-cut getting the fullest views possible of the occupants of the building, who, of course, extend much further than the staff of parliamentarians—although they are certainly the ones who have been in my ear about it. There are many other people who occupy this building and provide a magnificent service, as I am sure we would all agree. There are thousands of people who make this a bit of a community of its own, and their interests also need to be considered as day-to-day occupants of this building.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-03-15,"—I have just been made aware that Senator Brown may be introducing an amendment. I would like to say that a discussion paper about access to the side and ministerial entrances will be circulated in the next few weeks. The Speaker and I have given an undertaking that the bollards which are to be installed on the slip-roads will not be activated until access arrangements for people who work here are settled. This issue in itself does not affect the request which has been made here today to extend the deadline for the removal of the last white plastic barriers.
I would like to remind the Senate that, in regard to the issue Senator Bartlett raised about the white barriers, the papers that have been lodged with the Table Office make it quite clear that the majority of the white plastic barriers will be removed by the original deadline—that is, the end of this month. But, because of delays in shipments of certain equipment from the USA, that was beyond the power of the Department of Parliamentary Services. That means that this extension to the end of June has been necessitated. The white plastic barriers will be removed from the front of Parliament House by the end of March, as originally planned. Other barriers will be progressively removed over the following three months. I think I explained about the unavoidable delay at the estimates hearings of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. The matter has now been considered by both the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee and the Joint House Committee, so I was hoping that we could commend that motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-15,"—Thank you, Mr President, for that explanation. The difficulty that arises here is the consultation with the thousands of people who work in the building. While you are flagging a draft plan for visitor access, staff access and indeed members’ access to the parliamentary building after the security walls—28 kilometres of them all told—which are being erected around Parliament House have been completed, the concern that we have is that the thousands of people who enter this building each day on a working day are not aware of those plans and have not been asked for input. It is important that they are.
We have a duty to them to explain, for example, that there has not been a determination about disabled access. My reading of the draft plan is that disabled people will of necessity now have to come from the car park at the front of the building, away from the Senate, ministerial and House of Representatives entrances, and may be able to exit through the Senate entrance but that there will be no approach in the future. This will apply also to people who are not pass holders. It means that all visitors to the parliament will have to come through the main entrance and be met there by parliamentary staff. At the moment there are three entrances which are providing that access. I have seen nothing in the draft discussion paper which shows how the main entrance is going to cope with all non pass holders coming through it, let alone the traffic of staff of the building going to receive those visitors at the desk and all the consequent signing in that is required.
As far as disabled people are concerned, I see no assessment here, for example, of a lift being placed on Parliament Drive outside the Senate or the House of Representatives entrances so that disabled people with passes will have the same access as everybody else who is a pass holder, so that they can continue to come through the Senate entrance by the alternative of the Senate door rather than having to use the internal lift access. It is very important that these folk be accommodated. That is not detracting from this security measure that is costing $12 million as far as Parliament House is concerned. What concerns me is that the $12 million is being spent so that we can be not alarmed in Parliament House, apparently, but where is the considered accommodation for disabled people or indeed the wider public? How much is that going to cost? Are alternatives that are going to be brought forward to facilitate people coming to Parliament House when the bollards are in place going to be simply dismissed as too expensive?
It would have been reasonable, I would have thought, Mr President, for the committees involved to have made an assessment of the overall cost of these security measures at the outset instead of putting the security measures in place and then finding out how to overcome the problems these create for the efficient and indeed friendly functioning of Parliament House. We should not allow the fear that has swept the world since September 11 to turn this great parliament into a bunker, nor should we allow it to make access more invidious for some members of the public—or some staff, for that matter—than others.
I cannot see in the draft discussion paper where those matters have been canvassed and they ought to have been. I know, Mr President, that you have just talked about what happens before the bollards are activated. For those people who are listening: the walls will go around Parliament House, but bollards are those poles that come up out of the ground to prevent access to the slip-roads which come up to the Senate door, the ministerial door and the House of Representatives door. They are going to be put in place, and you mentioned that they are coming from the United States. Before they are put in place and activated, we ought to have sorted out how people currently using those doors are going to get access to this place. What is abundantly clear from your draft discussion paper is that, if we take the Senate door as one example, only senators arriving in Comcars will be able to use the Senate door through the current vehicular access. What will happen is that in future, when the bollards are in place, the Comcar carrying a senator will approach the Senate door by turning onto a slip-road. The first bollard will be lowered and the car will then proceed and be stopped by a second bollard further up the slip-road. When the first bollard is again raised into place so that nobody can tailgate the Comcar, the second bollard will be lowered and the senator in the Comcar will approach the Senate door. For everybody else it is pedestrian access to the Senate door. For disabled people there is no access to the Senate door under those circumstances. That ought to have been debated.
What I also note here is a determination that it is too costly by and large to have human surveillance of who comes and who goes, that the alternative of having guards at the slip-roads who could raise and lower the bollards is simply too expensive. That worries me. I think the discernment of a guard at such places would make for a much more efficient approach both by senators and by the public alike if the public were to be allowed. Of course, on great ceremonial occasions when heads of state or ‘VIPs’ approach one of the parliamentary doors then special security arrangements will be available. People will be brought in to judge how and when they will be allowed to use the slip-roads.
I do not think that adequate thought has been given to the human dimension. This is our parliament. By that I mean that this is the people’s parliament—the 20 million people of Australia. There has been precious little debate about how we keep it that way, given the changed circumstances in the world. One article referred to how we can best ‘retain the vision of a sylvan capital city’ that Walter Burley Griffin gave a lesson on a century ago in designing this city. That debate should take place and it should have taken place before.
By the way, I note that there will be bombproof antiblast lining at the ministerial windows, not at the House of Representatives or Senate windows. I guess that indicates that the ministers had a very strong hand in determining this arrangement. However, as one who has windows facing the Senate slip-road, I would prefer that the public were still able to come and go, judged by a guard. I will take the risk rather than have those roads closed in the way that has already been effectively determined here. Mr President, I have an amendment to this motion, but you will notice that it is not obstructive. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and that because of the impending operation of retractable bollards on the slip roads, further urgent consultation be undertaken with occupants of Parliament House to find an acceptable solution for alternative access to Parliament House for pass holders and visiting members of the public, including disabled people”.
At the moment there is not an acceptable solution because there is none on the public record. I heard you say, Mr President, that a discussion paper will shortly be available. I recommend that that not just go to MPs but to every staff member of this place. If we used the think tank of this parliament, worthwhile suggestions would come back. I put it to you that the thousands of staff at Parliament House, including staff of MPs who come and go, be canvassed for ideas in the wake of this plan as to how we overcome the increased difficulty of future access—not least by the disabled—to this parliament. The security needs must be met. Sadly, this is an example which shows the need for discussions with everybody involved when enormous changes such as this take place in the functioning of our parliament. After all, it is the people’s parliament.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-03-15,"—As I said before you took to your feet, Senator Brown, the Speaker and I have given an undertaking that the bollards which are to be installed on the slip-roads will not be activated until arrangements for the people who work here are settled. Yesterday, we had a long, extensive meeting of the Joint House Committee to discuss these matters. Matters are still to be resolved and discussions are still taking place. I believe that this amendment that you are putting forward pre-empts any decisions that the Presiding Officers and the Joint House Committee make.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-03-15,"—Firstly, I indicate some disappointment that the government have taken this position. I would also like to thank all of the minor parties, the Greens and the Democrats and other senators who supported these amendments. They are worthy amendments and it is only through the debate in this place that we have been able to shift the government on some important issues. It is only through your support, Senator Brown and Senator Cherry, that we have made a difference to hundreds of thousands of Australian soccer fans around the country. We have actually got the government to move part of the way to resolving the debacle that they created when they removed the soccer World Cup from the antisiphoning list.
These amendments will ensure that the World Cup soccer will be seen on free-to-air television, something that was in danger because of this government’s decision to delist. The way to absolutely clear this up is for it to be part of the legislation, as we moved by way of amendments. As I said the other day, I take Senator Coonan at her word; she is an honourable woman. Her word would have been enough for me. But a few of her colleagues are a little bit suss—they do not understand like you do, Senator Coonan, the importance of the soccer World Cup to hundreds of thousands of Australians. So I am disappointed that the government have rejected our amendments. It calls into question their bona fides that they will never delist it in the future. I wish you had had a bit more success there, Senator Coonan, in batting hard against those antisoccer people in the government.
Equally, on the loophole issue, there is again disappointment. This is an issue that will not go away, Senator Coonan. As your own colleagues on the Senate committee said, this is an issue that you need to look at—that is, whether the intent of the antisiphoning list is being undermined either directly or indirectly. I think these are issues that you will need to consider. So, with reluctance, I indicate that Labor will not be insisting on our amendments. But, again, I thank the chamber for supporting our amendments. It has made an important difference in this particular instance.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,24,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-15,"—The Democrats will not be insisting on these amendments on this occasion either. I would note—and I think Senator Conroy should claim it as a personal victory—the campaigning on the issue of the World Cup soccer. We are very pleased that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has given a commitment to include that in legislation. It is something which has been raised in this chamber on a number of occasions. We accept her statement that this will be included in the antisiphoning list and we look forward to that occurring. I am sure there will be a lot of soccer fans around Australia pleased with that.
With respect to the second set of amendments that deal with the concern that the antisiphoning list contains a flaw in that it allows non-licence holders to acquire rights and thereby get around the issue, I note the government’s argument that there are legal flaws in the argument put by free TV in that it is not possible for such rights to be utilised in terms of being broadcast on pay TV. I also note that the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee—even the majority report of that committee, signed off by government senators—called on the government to ensure that this matter remains under review and that the government monitor very carefully the operation of the antisiphoning list and whether this loophole does exist and does in fact operate in the way that the free TV operators say it does.
I hope that the minister takes on board that advice from the committee. It is very important, particularly given that, over the course of the next two years, the two biggest contracts in sport come up for review—that is, the AFL and the NRL. We would certainly hate to see the football fans around Australia suffer by having less football on their free-to-air television than they do now. I think the government needs to monitor this area very carefully. There is a lot of money in sport and a lot of interest there, and we do have to make sure that the antisiphoning list operates for the objectives that parliament set.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,24,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-15,"—I will just make some very brief concluding remarks in response to Senators Conroy and Cherry. The government acknowledges the opposition’s intention in relation to its amendments to this bill. It has sought to add the 2010 FIFA World Cup to the antisiphoning list and to address a purported loophole in the antisiphoning scheme which has been the subject of much debate. However, in both cases, the amendments are unnecessary and have significant additional impacts on the operation of the scheme, as has been outlined in the course of the debate. Accordingly, the government has—I think quite properly—rejected the amendments. The government has consistently stated that it is monitoring the operation of the antisiphoning scheme to make sure that it operates effectively, not just for free-to-air and pay television licensees but also for rights holders and audiences, and it will continue to do so. It will also continue to balance the competing interests inherent in such a scheme.
In adding the 2010 World Cup to the list, the government have responded to calls from audiences and broadcasters. This is the very way that the list is meant to operate. It was always intended to operate as a living document that can respond to changing circumstances. As I indicated in my remarks in the debate last week, the opposition would have changed this approach, with, I think, unacceptable—even absurd—consequences. The issue of the purported loophole has been widely debated, including in the ECITA committee considering the bill. Once again, the government will continue to monitor this issue. At this time, however, we can see no evidence that the antisiphoning scheme or its intent are being undermined—in fact, we have recently seen a very successful operation of the scheme—but, should that evidence be forthcoming, the government will consider the issue afresh.
I also outlined a number of concerns arising from the impact of the opposition’s attempt to address the purported loophole. These concerns demonstrate the significant problems of altering the operation of a scheme that is working effectively—and which is so finely balanced—in order to achieve what we believe would have been uncertain outcomes on an issue where no problem, at least at this point, has been demonstrated. The amendments would have serious consequences—not merely for pay television licensees but also for the entire television sector. On this basis, I have thought very carefully about these amendments, and I do not believe there is any reason to further delay the passage of the bill. I commend to the chamber the government’s recommendation that the bill be passed without amendment.

Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,24,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-03-15,"—The Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004 and related bills represent a belated and inadequate response from the government to the regulatory issues posed by the process of convergence. However, the ALP will support the bill insofar as it goes, subject to a small number of amendments. While the bill fails to make many of the reforms necessary to effectively deal with the challenges of convergence, the minor changes it does contain should be beneficial and have already been delayed long enough.
The bill is primarily a response to convergence. Convergence is the long-recognised process whereby digitisation and other technological innovations blur the boundaries between the delivery mechanisms available for services. As a result of convergence, consumers now have a multitude of ways in which to access telecommunications and media services. Today, a person wanting to speak to a friend can choose whether to dial from a fixed line telephone, pick up a mobile phone or have the conversation over the internet through voice over internet protocol. A person wanting to read the morning news could pick up a newspaper, turn on a PC to log on to the internet or get up to date using their mobile phone. A person wanting to follow their favourite sports team could watch highlights of the game on television, satellite subscription TV, cable subscription TV, broadband internet or a 3G mobile phone. The permutations of the ways in which services can be delivered to end users will undoubtedly continue to multiply with ongoing technological progress. These new methods of delivering services have been actively pursued by companies around the world keen to develop innovative ways to service their existing customers and create fresh markets for new customers.
However, as well as increasing commercial options for suppliers and choice for consumers, convergence has also placed pressure on existing regulatory frameworks. Regulatory distinctions based on the method by which a service is provided rather than the substance of the service have become increasingly antiquated and inefficient. As regulatory distinctions of this kind are relatively common in the Australian regulatory regime, reform is needed. Delaying reform or employing bandaid solutions will inevitably result in the distortion of the development of markets for convergent technologies. Businesses that are confronted with regulatory uncertainty as a result of being forced to apply outdated and inflexible legislation to new technology will be discouraged from commercialising that technology. As a result, some innovative, commercially viable services may be denied to consumers merely because of an outdated regulatory regime that imposes inappropriate burdens on the service. Conversely, other new services may receive inappropriate levels of investment because of regulatory advantages they possess in the marketplace as a result of existing regulation failing to extend to the new service. These inefficiencies will harm not only the Australian consumers but also the competitiveness of Australian companies’ global marketplace for convergent technologies.
This is obviously not a good outcome for the Australian communications sector. The prospect of these problems should not, however, have come as a surprise to the government. The Senate inquiry established by the ALP and the Democrats to investigate the bill heard evidence from the Australian Consumers Association that the problems that convergence poses have been apparent for 10 years if not 15 years. Further, the governments of other countries recognised these issues and took concrete steps to address them long before the Australian government turned its mind to legislative reform. The government of Singapore created the Infocomm Development Authority through a merger of a number of government bodies in 1999 with the specific objective of more adequately dealing with the issues of convergence. The United Kingdom commenced a similar process in the same year and ultimately merged a number of its communications regulators in 2002 to form Ofcom. However, instead of following the lead of these countries, the Australian government has delayed implementing serious legislative reform. The government’s pace of reform on this issue has been glacial.
The government has considered the issues associated with convergence in not one but two discussion papers: ‘Options for structural reform in spectrum management’ in 2002 and ‘New institutional arrangements for the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority’ in 2003. However, instead of implementing legislative reform, the Australian government has delayed implementing reform until convergent technologies have actually arrived. Instead of proactively preparing the Australian communications sector for convergence, the government has prevaricated until the shortcomings of the existing regime have become obvious. It is only now that 3G phones and VOIP systems are commonplace that the government has been forced to act.
The committee established to review this legislation heard from the Australian Consumers Association that:
... Australia has erred on the side of delay, and the changes proposed in the creation of ACMA are belated and do not sufficiently address the imperatives in the marketplace.
This delay has led to inefficient overlaps in regulation and regulatory responsibility in some areas, and gaps in regulation in others. It has led to some services being subject to regulatory burdens disproportionate to the substance simply due to the form of the technology that was used to provide it. The committee also heard evidence that the government’s delay has resulted in ‘weird interim regulatory responses’ and a ‘poorly coordinated’ reaction to new technologies.
The committee heard that the government’s lack of leadership had led to the ACA and the ABA taking a reactionary approach to dealing with the new technologies. The Competitive Carriers Coalition stated:
The ACA has increasingly been seen as a follower rather than a leader in terms of regulatory guidance and oversight. This has caused significant duplication and regulatory burden on the industry as a whole.
Areas that have particularly suffered as a result of the government’s reactionary approach have been mobile content and voice over internet protocol telephony. With respect to mobile content, there has been significant regulatory duplication by the ABA and the ACA in their response to the emergence of this convergent service. Both organisations, as well as industry participants, expended significant resources considering the regulatory issues involved with the emergence of mobile content. Both organisations subsequently produced rules addressing separate aspects of mobile content regulation. This issue clearly should have been dealt with by a single body in order to avoid the unnecessary doubling up of activity—by the ACA and the ABA—and the burden on industry in having to comply with two regulatory regimes.
In relation to VOIP, the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee heard evidence that the government’s response had been poorly coordinated and required industry participants to respond to separate inquiries from the Australian Communications Authority; the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; and the Australian Communications Industry Forum. Understandably, having to deal with a multitude of organisations, essentially asking the same questions, placed a significant compliance burden on industry participants. This lack of coordination clearly demonstrated the inability of the current regulatory regime to deal efficiently with convergent technologies.
The need for reform has been clear for some time. Despite that, the ACMA Bill constitutes the government’s first attempt to deal with these changes. Unfortunately, instead of making the changes necessary to the underlying regulatory regime to deal with convergence, the bill constitutes a superficial makeover of the government’s regulatory approach. The ACMA Bill provides for a purely administrative merger of the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Broadcasting Authority to form the Australian Communications and Media Authority. As this is an administrative merger, the ACMA Bill makes only minor amendments to the existing regulatory frameworks for telecommunications and media.
Labor supports the merger, as the formation of a single authority to regulate the communications sector will allow for a more holistic response to the challenges of convergence in the future. However, the pursuit of a purely administrative merger by the government is an entirely inadequate measure and represents a significant missed opportunity. As was pointed out in evidence given to the committee, joining the ACA and the ABA at the top without engaging in reform of the underlying legislative regime will result in a conjoined rather than a merged regulator.
The bill gives no consideration to the appropriateness of the existing legislative arrangements in accommodating the challenges of convergence. Much legislation in the Australian communications sector is still largely technologically specific and will only become more anachronistic as the pace of convergence increases. Examples of areas in which existing legislation draws potentially unwarranted technological distinctions include spectrum management, consumer protection, ministerial direction powers and content regulation.
In many cases it is not the uncoordinated approaches by separate regulators but the inconsistent objectives and technologically specific provisions contained in the underlying legislation that have caused the inefficiency. As such, legislative reform, rather than simply administrative reform, is necessary. The need to engage in a wholesale review of the underlying legislation, in addition to the merger into ACMA, was recognised in the majority of submissions made to the committee. The committee heard that, as the bill currently stands, ACMA’s response to convergence will be limited by legislative constraints. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance commented:
It is difficult to see how the new authority will be better placed to take a strategic view of the wider convergence issues in the absence of the policy review that is so critically needed.
The Communications Law Centre commented that it would have been ‘preferable to address substantive reform at the time of the enabling legislation’. Without reform, ACMA will merely continue to apply the outdated and inflexible existing regulatory regimes and to develop ad hoc and reactionary subordinate instruments to deal with those regulatory pressures. ACMA will still be forced to use exemptions, determinations and other subordinate instruments to bend the existing regime to accommodate new convergent technologies.
The committee heard evidence that the best way to deal with the pressures posed by convergence is to aim for a legislative framework that is outcome focused and draws technological distinctions only when it is explicitly justified. The ACMA Bill does nothing to bring the Australian regulatory regime closer to this position. The failure of the government to reform the underlying legislation defers yet again the government’s response to convergence and represents a missed opportunity in the context of the bill.
At the end of the day, after half a decade of waiting for the government’s response to convergence, the result is nothing more than a clayton’s merger. The bill is the product of a government that thinks it is just all too hard. The bill, instead of outlining a strategy for dealing with the challenges of convergence, places on the bureaucrats the onus of dealing with the issues. The bill, instead of addressing the issue head-on, hopes that the problem will go away. The bill gives participants in the communications sector absolutely no guidance as to how the government believes innovative convergent technologies should be treated in principle.
In the final analysis, the ACMA Bill is devoid of a vision for the development of the Australian communications regulatory environment. In addition to the fundamentally inadequate premise of the bill, Labor has a number of concerns about the way the bill anticipates that the merger will be implemented. The first concern the ALP has about the bill is that the explanatory memorandum and the comments of the previous minister for communications indicate that the merger will be revenue neutral. The ACA-ABA merger will be the first merger of two organisations in history that will not result in any cost savings. The fact that the government cannot manage any cost savings—as a result of a merger that will integrate finance, human resources, IT support and other functions—is a significant organisational failure. The committee heard evidence that the failure wastes both taxpayers’ and industry participants’ money, as ACMA’s telecommunications functions are funded by money raised through carrier licence charges.
Our second concern is that allowing ACMA to divide itself into divisions and retain the existing bureau offices of the ACA and the ABA will result in an internally divided regulator that does not realise the potential benefits of the merger. The organisational and geographic divisions envisaged by the bill run the risk of creating a situation in which ACMA divides itself along the delineations of the legacy regulators. Such an arrangement would undermine the objectives of the merger and destroy many of the regulatory efficiencies sought by this bill. While we ultimately do not consider that legislative amendments are the best way to prevent this situation arising, we call on the government to liaise with ACMA to attempt to ensure that this situation does not arise.
Labor also have a number of concerns that we will be moving amendments to the bill to rectify. The first amendment that we will be moving jointly with the Democrats addresses the concern that I have already expressed regarding the government’s failure to consider the need for reform of the underlying legislative regime. This amendment requires the minister to undertake a review of the adequacy of the underlying legislative framework in accommodating the challenges posed by convergence within 18 months of the formation of ACMA. The amendment largely reflects the statutory review provided for in the United Kingdom when it created its merged regulator, Ofcom. You will remember that we heard a lot this week from Senator Coonan and the government about Ofcom having the right model for the future in a whole range of areas. One of the reasons they have that is that they have some decent and proper scrutiny, so let us take a leaf out of the UK example. The amendment is not onerous and we would consider it to be the bare minimum that the government should commit to in order to respond to convergence.
Labor will also be moving two amendments designed to increase the transparency of ACMA. The first amendment addresses the process that ACMA must follow in dealing with a conflict of interest on the part of an ACMA board member. Where an ACMA board member has disclosed a conflict of interest in relation to a specific matter and the board has allowed that member to continue to act on that matter, the amendment will require that it be publicly disclosed. This amendment is designed to avoid the outrageous situation that recently arose in relation to the conduct of the former Chair of the ABA, Professor David Flint. This is a bloke who still does not get it. He is still railing about it today: the unfairness and the injustice of it all. He did not understand the meaning of the words ‘conflict of interest’, and ultimately his own board was so embarrassed by him that he walked the plank. So let us get it all out in the open. The amendment is designed to ensure that, in situations like this, conflicts are brought to light more quickly than has been the case in the past.
Labor’s second amendment requires ACMA to include in its annual report details of the number and types of complaints received by ACMA concerning alleged breaches of the Broadcasting Services Act and related codes of practice. This amendment is designed to bring ACMA’s broadcasting reporting requirements more closely into line with its telecommunications reporting requirements and to increase the transparency of ACMA’s activities. The committee heard substantial evidence that to date the ABA has not taken effective enforcement action in response to complaints about alleged breaches of broadcasting regulation. This amendment is designed to increase the transparency of the ABA’s enforcement activity in order to better hold it accountable to its regulatory responsibilities. Labor considers that these amendments, while not substantial, will increase the accountability of ACMA to the public.
Finally, we note that the inquiry by the Senate committee into the ACMA Bill also raised a number of questions about the broader telecommunications regime. In this regard, the ACMA Bill is a worrying sign of things to come from this government. The bill fits into a long line of regulatory cop-outs from this government in the communications sector. While not directly within the scope of its inquiry, the committee heard much evidence from industry participants concerning the ineffectiveness of the telecommunications competition regime.
The Labor Party is concerned that this bill demonstrates what the country can expect when it comes to the regulatory reforms necessary when the Telstra sell-out begins. No doubt the government’s response to privatisation will be more of the same as we have seen here. On current form we can expect the government to avoid making the tough decisions for telecommunications regulation. We can expect the government to privatise and hope that it all turns out okay down the track—privatise and hope that the bureaucrats can work out how to control the 900-pound gorilla the government has just let out of its cage. Of course, when the government brings this lazy policy approach to privatisation, the result will not be something marginally better than the status quo, as will result from this ACMA Bill. Instead, when the government privatises without taking the tough decisions on the regulatory reform required to accommodate a fully privatised Telstra, the result will be a catastrophic disaster for competition and consumers. That being said, the Labor Party will support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-15,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2004 and related bills before us, which merge the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA, and the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, into a new authority with a new acronym, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA. The idea of merging the ACA and the ABA was first contemplated by the Productivity Commission in its report on broadcasting back in April 2000. In 2003 the government released a discussion paper focusing on the key issues that would need to be addressed if the two bodies were merged. In the paper the government argued:
The case for merging the two communications regulators arises from developments that have been occurring in the communications environment over the past decade. Digital technologies are reshaping communications industries. Previously distinct sectors now compete across increasingly convergent markets using a range of different delivery platforms.
                  …         …         …
The convergence of communications technologies and markets is placing growing pressure on the current regulatory institutional arrangements. In Australia, different components of the same industry are currently subject to regulation by two different agencies.
Yet this package of bills, whilst achieving the administrative merger of the two authorities, makes minimal changes to the existing regulatory arrangements. It is very much of an administrative nature.
In December last year I moved—and I thank the Labor Party for its support at the time—to establish a Senate inquiry into this bill to examine the powers and the effectiveness of the proposed regulatory body. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee considered the proposal and took evidence from 24 organisations over two days. It came to the conclusion that, whilst the proposed merger of the two authorities was welcomed by most of industry and consumer bodies, there were some major concerns.
There was deep concern that the government had failed to deal with the underlying problems of holes in the regulatory frameworks of both the ABA and the ACA as they currently exist. The committee found that the two regulators were perceived not to have sufficient pro-consumer focus in terms of their attention. It also found that both organisations, the ABA and the ACA, rely very heavily on the self-regulation of industry by industry and essentially have a light-touch approach to regulation.
The ACMA, to some extent, is modelled on the British super-regulator Ofcom, which was established two years ago from the merger of five regulators in media, broadcasting and telecommunications. Yet Ofcom, as a model, has ended up with powers far greater than those proposed for the ACMA. In establishing Ofcom, the UK government saw the need for the new regulator to be able to undertake its regulatory duties effectively. Its white paper said:
It is important that OFCOM has sufficient powers to carry out its duties. It has to be able to take tough action when necessary and to ensure that regulated companies take the action which is required of them.
                  …         …           …
In addition, we will give OFCOM Competition Act type powers to levy financial penalties for breaches of the sector-specific regulatory requirements.
As the committee report notes, the Blair government’s vision for Ofcom was that the new regulator was to be significant in creating a dynamic market. The necessary powers were outlined in the white paper. In particular, the white paper said:
OFCOM will have concurrent powers with the OFT to exercise Competition Act powers for the communications sector.
                  …         …           …
OFCOM will also have additional sector-specific powers to promote effective competition in the communications services sector for the benefit of consumers.
For most providers of services, the sector-specific rules will cover only the essential issues such as consumer protection, access and interconnection. Stronger sectoral competition rules will, however, be applicable to companies having significant market power.
The white paper talked about the need for a spectrum management framework and the need to ensure that health and environment issues were properly reflected in the regulatory framework, particularly in relation to communications structure.
I have now chaired three Senate inquiries that have all touched on the regulation of the telecommunications sector, and all have found that the regulatory system is sadly inadequate. In all three inquiries we have heard evidence that competition has not developed far enough. I am reminded again of the 2001‑02 telecommunications report of the ACCC which concluded:
While reforms implemented to date have been positive in terms of increasing competition in communications services and in increasing benefits to consumers ... competition has not developed as extensively as generally expected after full competition was introduced in 1997 and that various telecommunications markets are not yet effectively competitive.
Evidence given to the Senate inquiries suggests that Telstra’s market power stifles competition and challenges the regulatory regime, which is not adequately equipped to deal with that market power. The effect is to deter infrastructure investment, to suppress the take-up of broadband services and to produce prices for broadband other telecommunications services which are higher than in many other OECD countries.
The Senate committee report into this bill noted that in the current self-regulatory landscape the competition model has demonstrated that it cannot, alone, deliver on issues such as regional equity, community equity of basic services within a region and national competitiveness in terms of advanced infrastructure deployment. Many witnesses, both in the recent inquiry and in previous inquiries into telecommunications, argued that structural problems in the telecommunications market rendered regulation largely ineffective. Telstra is one of the most vertically integrated telecommunications carriers in the world and the only government owned provider with a stake in pay TV in addition to its holdings in mobile phones, landlines and, of course, advertising through Sensis.
The Democrats have been calling for Telstra to, at a minimum, divest its share in Foxtel and for the government to commission research into structural separation to once and for all determine the merits of structural separation in our current environment. I note the continuing comments from Senator Coonan that she recognises the benefits of at least some operational separation of the wholesale and retail aspects of Telstra, at least to the extent that that has already occurred with BT.
The Australian Consumers Association has questioned the effectiveness of the regulatory approach of self-regulation in the current environment. It says:
The regulatory approach taken to instil competition into the telecommunications market of Australia seems only to have advanced sufficiently to diagnose what would work better.
The view of the association is:
... Australia may have reached the end of what can be accomplished by extending and enlarging the regulatory apparatus in telecommunications. It is trying to manage access to the infrastructure of a huge, vertically integrated incumbent supplier that retains near monopoly control over essential and pivotal infrastructure. This incumbent wields superior power to the regulator in political and economic terms.
Clearly, what is needed here are structural solutions to competition and structural solutions to that market power. That is something that the government continues to shy away from. To paraphrase the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, the government appears to be intent on having a maximum price for Telstra in a future float. It is unfortunate that the issues of competition and the best outcomes for telecommunications policy play second fiddle to maximising the price in terms of the return to government from selling an intact, integrated monopoly supplier.
The committee inquiry also found that there needs to be a closer working relationship between the ACMA and the ACCC. We found that the ACCC needs additional resources to do its job of regulating telecommunications and that there needs to be a better understanding between the two authorities of the overlap between technical regulation and competition regulation, as one frequently feeds and determines the other. As I said earlier, the ACMA is modelled on Ofcom, yet it does not have the same consumer emphasis that is present in Ofcom in the United Kingdom. Ofcom has a content panel which deals with issues of broadcasting standards, ensuring that there is community input into those standards. In addition, it has a consumer panel to keep that emphasis on consumer issues to the forefront of its thinking. Most importantly, it has a strong mandate from the parliament to regulate communications in the interests of consumers. That is what the committee found was very much missing from the ACMA Bill and was probably the worst flaw—that lack of emphasis on consumer outcomes.
The committee report noted that, at present, the interests of consumers are poorly recognised in both the Telecommunications Act and the Broadcasting Services Act. The evidence highlighted a number of problems in the areas of legislative recognition, industry codes, funding for consumer participation and community awareness, and the need to develop a simplified consumer complaints process. The Australian Consumers Association argued that, historically, both the ABA and the ACA have a poor record in dealing with consumer issues. I note that the Acting Chair of the ACA, Dr Bob Horton, acknowledged that before the committee. In his evidence, he said:
While I think we have made great strides in achieving the objectives of industry self-regulation, certainly in operational codes and technical matters, we have in a way left consumers some distance behind us and we have sought to make up some of the distance over the last 18 months or two years.
I acknowledge that the ACA has been seeking to engage with the consumer sector, commissioning a large report from a consumer panel on ways to improve that consumer focus. The report, Consumer driven communications: strategies for better representation, is currently being considered by its board. I commend that report to the ACA board. If the recommendations in the report were taken up, it would improve quite a number of the issues that people have had with the ACA in the past. Many of the recommendations in that report are of a legislative nature in trying to get a better balance between self-regulation by industry on the one side and promoting better consumer outcomes on the other side. In the committee stage, the Democrats will be moving a series of amendments to make the regulation of telecommunications much clearer.
The Communications Law Centre, in their submission to the Senate inquiry, argued:
... self-regulation is effective and appropriate in some circumstances, while in others a stronger emphasis on compliance and enforcement is called for.
They said that we needed to refine the legislative process and to provide strong signals to the regulator about what parliament expects in terms of a better balance as to when self-regulation is appropriate and when the consumer protection regime needs to take precedence. The committee recommended that section 4 of the Telecommunications Act be amended to remove the strong preference for self-regulation and to state more clearly that the regulatory policy is very much in favour of promoting the interests of consumers. We also suggested that the revised section should make it clear—and I will be moving an amendment to this effect in the committee stage—that telecommunications should be regulated in a manner that promotes the use of industry self-regulation where this will not impede the long-term interests of end users and will enable the objects mentioned in the act to be met in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on participants in the Australian telecommunications industry.
I will also be moving an amendment to ensure that at least one member of the ACMA board has a background in consumer advocacy and representation. It is time that consumers were put first and foremost in the regulation of telecommunications and broadcasting. It is time to ensure that the enforcement of standards and consumer protection are much more to the forefront of our regulators. We have been experimenting with self-regulation in this country for a very long time—since 1991 in broadcasting and since 1997 in telecommunications. We know the experience. We know what works in the regulation of technical issues and codes of operation. We know what does not work in relation to complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. We know that it does not work in the roll-out of structure, as we have seen under the wing of the Australian Communications Authority since 1997. Almost every year Telstra has progressively reduced its spending on infrastructure investment as a percentage of revenue. Australia’s telecommunications providers now invest a lesser percentage of their revenue in infrastructure than probably most OECD countries that I have looked at.
When we look at the ACMA bill and at what the government has proposed for it, the merger of this organisation without a change to its underlying powers represents very much a lost opportunity. That lost opportunity arises because we have failed to look at and fix the flaws that we know exist in the current regulatory system. We have failed to ensure that ACMA does address the issues of convergence that are emerging by looking at these things in a holistic way in a strategic review over the next two years. That is something that Ofcom is currently in the process of doing, and it is something on which Senator Conroy and the Democrats will be moving a joint amendment, to establish a strategic review to look at the role of the regulators in a converging communications market and how those new challenges would best be met by the regulators.
I would like to conclude by quoting a statement to our committee by the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. It said:
Such a merger [between the ACA and ABA] would provide the opportunity to be more than simply an administrative change. It offered the opportunity for functional change and for an audit of the existing regulatory framework for communications and broadcasting. Unfortunately, what is now occurring is simply an administrative change. Whilst a merged regulator will be better placed to have an overarching view of the economic, social, cultural and technical policy issues confronting Government and the industries it regulates and be able to better serve the general public, the broader opportunities that the merging of the two regulators offers are being overlooked.
That sentiment was reflected by a number of witnesses from industry and consumer groups, and that is why we will be moving to have that strategic review and to try to get some of those synergies working better in the future.
The ACMA finds itself regulating a range of services that are absolutely vital to the national security and economic and social development of Australia. Australians are increasingly relying on e-commerce, e-health and e-banking. For many businesses, especially small businesses, efficient and effective communication systems are critical. For example, high-speed internet access is essential for successful engagement with the modern economy and the modern society. A cost-effective, reliable communications system is especially critical for Australians living in regional areas, where the tyranny of distance, isolation and lack of services can be overcome to some extent through modern technology.
It is critical for the future prosperity of Australia that we get it right. I urge the government, as a very first step, to consider the amendments which I will moving in the committee stage, because at least they send a strong message from this parliament to the new regulator that it is in the business of regulating for the interests of consumers and end users, not for the interests of industry and media moguls. That fundamentally must be what we are about in this place. We need to send a very strong message to the new regulator about exactly what we want it to do. We need to send a message that, whilst this is primarily an administrative merger, and whilst at this stage we are not proposing radical changes to the powers of the regulator, we want it to exercise those powers in a way that benefits consumers far more than the system has to date. That would be a strong message, and that is the message that the amendments which I will move in the committee stage will seek to send.
I wish to note in conclusion that the government advertised for expressions of interest for the position of ACMA chair on Saturday. As a senator who was dealing with this legislation I found this passing strange, because the legislation is not yet through parliament. Whilst the Democrats and the Labor Party have made it clear that we do support the establishment of ACMA, I do find it inappropriate every time the government—whether it be this government or the previous government—pre-empts decisions of parliament by spending public moneys on advertising or promoting particular initiatives which have not yet been passed by the parliament. I would certainly hope that the government has not engaged in any excessive expenditure ahead of the formation of the authority with the passage of this legislation through the Senate. I would hate to think that the government shows such contempt for the Senate’s processes that it assumes a fait accompli and starts spending moneys before the Senate has had time to adequately and properly consider these matters.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ellison) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-15,"—I was previously addressing the Senate in reply to the second reading debate on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. I place on the record the appreciation of the government for the work of the members of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, who completed the inquiry into this bill. As I mentioned earlier, the government has taken on board a number of their recommendations.
Today’s debate is important because it is about ensuring accountability and efficiency in government administrative decision making. Since it commenced operation almost three decades ago, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has provided fair, impartial prompt and relatively cheap access to review of government decisions. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has a longstanding, well-earned reputation for excellence. Organisations which enjoy such a reputation for excellence do so because they are committed to a program of continual improvement. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] will build on the tribunal’s reputation for excellence.
As the Senate committee’s report notes, most submissions to its inquiry endorsed the initiative to update the tribunal and expressed support for those provisions of the bill that aim to improve the review process. The bill contains a range of significant reforms, including a number which have been proposed by the tribunal itself. These reforms do not involve a fundamental change to the purpose, structure or functions of the tribunal. Rather, they build on the tribunal’s experience of almost 30 years of operation to make the tribunal more efficient, more flexible and more responsive to the ever-changing environment in which it operates. The government believes these changes will assist the tribunal to better respond to the needs of users.
The committee’s report made six recommendations in relation to certain aspects of the bill. Two recommendations support the passage of the bill subject to acceptance of other recommendations. The government has considered all the recommendations carefully and accepts three of the four recommendations for change to the bill. The recommendations which the government accepts are as follows: recommendation 1, which is for the continuation of the requirement that the president of the tribunal must be a Federal Court judge; recommendation 3, which is for the provision of guidance as to the circumstances under which the president should exercise the power to remove a member and reconstitute a tribunal in the interests of justice; and recommendation 5, which recommends that the minister should consult with the president before making or altering any assignment of members to divisions of the tribunal. The government will be moving in the committee stage amendments to implement these recommendations.
The government does not accept recommendation 2, which is concerned with the time period for appointments. In particular, the government considers that setting a legislative minimum term of three years for appointments is unnecessarily rigid. It could impair the ability to make appointments in particular circumstances to allow the tribunal to respond flexibly to peaks and troughs in its workload. There is no need for such a restriction. Such a restriction is not present in relation to appointments to other federal merits review tribunals.
This is a very important bill. It is there as a safeguard for all Australians who are the subject of government administrative decisions. It is therefore very important that we keep the tribunal up to date in response to its ever-changing environment. There are a number of amendments proposed for the committee stage. I note that the opposition and the Democrats have amendments, and I have alluded to the government amendments. I will not canvass those in detail but I thank again senators who have contributed to this debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
On behalf of Labor MPs I am pleased to welcome the intentions of the 2004 access and equity annual report of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It is a good idea to ensure that all government departments and agencies are fulfilling their obligations to offer services to all Australians. The idea of an annual access and equity report is so that DIMIA can provide an assessment of how each department or agency is meeting its requirements under the Howard government’s Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society.
That is all good in theory but, like so much of the Howard government, this is a policy driven solely by the minister’s hot air. Let us have a look at the executive summary. On page 9, over the page where the minister has signed off, it says:
DIMIA does not verify the accuracy of reported information or the scope of its coverage.
You then have to ask the question: what is the point of doing this? But the idea is a good idea. It is an excellent idea to ensure that there is access and equity, that it is reported on, that there is an annual report on it and that there is a Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society.
If you keep reading the executive summary, it gets better: ‘This level of subjectivity in reports is a limitation of the assessment process.’ Minister, you don’t say! Let me continue. Look at 2004: agencies were assessed as meeting a performance indicator where they provided at least one example to demonstrate that relevant processes were in place in the organisation. So, basically, each agency was given the task of finding a way to pat itself on the head by finding the best possible example of how it met the charter. That is what it looks like. I am happy for the government to disavow me of that view. But, faced with the minister’s stringent demands, a full 30 per cent of government agencies simply ignored the task as well. I think that says a lot about how seriously the Liberal government takes the issue of multicultural affairs. It is a serious issue; it should be taken seriously. It gets even worse. Of the 63 agencies that replied, more than half—that is, 32 agencies—scored 50 per cent or below on their relevant performance indicators. I did note, however, that under this rigorous process the minister has managed to scrape through an award—a gold star and a smiley stamp—as DIMIA managed to score 100 per cent on the charter. That is not surprising.
To summarise, the minister has delivered us a weak access and equity reporting system. It is so weak that it requires self-selection for all agencies concerned, and they do not seem to be able to give themselves a 100 per cent tick, even under that process. This minister’s reporting system is weak, and the department cannot even bring itself to stand by the assessments. It says: ‘We can’t even stand by the weak assessments. They’re subjective and we can’t verify them.’ Thirty per cent of agencies failed to bother with a reply, and, of those that did, more than half failed, even on their own self-selected evidence, to meet the principles of the charter. You really would have to worry about that.
This report says a lot about this government’s commitment to the principles of multiculturalism. That the government can come up with such an abysmal process for assessing the right of ordinary Australians to access and equity from their own government departments and agencies highlights the arrogance of the Howard government in its treatment of multicultural issues. As always, with the Liberal Party it is a case of all talk and no action. Sadly, the 2004 access and equity report is no exception.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-15,"—This week we see the last sitting week for Senator John Tierney during his time as a senator for New South Wales. I must say that is a role that he has fulfilled with distinction, integrity and a good deal of humour, and that is something for which Senator Tierney is renowned. I met Senator Tierney when I came to this place in 1993. The first impression I gained was: here is a person who is passionate about education and training. Indeed, his history is in academia.
When I was Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, I soon realised that Senator Tierney knew a lot more about education than I did. I certainly relied on his input in the Senate committee on education, employment and other matters. In fact, Senator Tierney presided over many estimates hearings. He chaired those meetings in quite difficult circumstances but with fairness. His in-depth knowledge was demonstrated by the way in which those committees were run. As a person who has represented New South Wales, and in particular the Hunter region, Senator Tierney has done an outstanding job. In his first speech he referred to the Hunter region and to the fact that he set out to represent that region—indeed, he did so very well. I hope that is appreciated by many people.
I wish Senator Tierney, his wife Pam and their family all the best for the future. It has been an absolute pleasure to have worked with Senator Tierney in relation to a wide variety of matters, particularly in the areas of education, training and employment, which he held to be so important and for which, as I said, he has an ongoing passion. The state of New South Wales was indeed lucky to have the representation of a senator of such quality as Senator Tierney.
