The SPEAKER
 (09:01): On 7 February I informed the House of my desire to make question time more spontaneous by allowing as many as five supplementary questions each day. In setting out the details of my proposal I said the new arrangements would be reviewed at the end of these sittings. 


I wish to thank honourable members for their cooperation in the trial of the new arrangements. The ability to ask supplementary questions has introduced a welcome new dynamic into question time. My preliminary conclusion is that the trial has been a success. Nevertheless, before making arrangements for the remainder of the year, I would welcome any comments or suggestions that honourable members may have. 


I am considering expanding the number of supplementary questions and also allowing one side to ask supplementary questions to an original question asked by the other side. Honourable members are welcome to contact me in person, by telephone or email. I would very much like to receive any comments by 27 April this year.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:39):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012 makes amendments to four Commonwealth acts to facilitate telecommunications interception and access powers for the Victorian Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission (IBAC).


The bill will:


remove the Victorian Office of Police Integrity (the OPI) as an authority eligible to intercept communications;


enable the Victorian Inspectorate to receive intercepted information as part of its oversight and complaints functions;


enable the IBAC and the Victorian Inspectorate to use and communicate information for relevant purposes under the Interception Act;


enable the Victorian Public Interest Monitor (Victorian Monitor) to be provided relevant information and appear at applications for interception warrants by Victorian interception agencies; and


make amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, Privacy Act 1998 and Crimes Act 1914 to replace references to the OPI with references to the IBAC.




Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission



Victoria will abolish the existing Office of Police Integrity and is establishing the IBAC. The IBAC will become the body responsible for overseeing the Victoria Police.


However, the IBAC will have a broader jurisdiction as it will also be responsible for investigating, exposing and suppressing corruption involving or affecting all public officials in Victoria.


The amendments contained in Schedule 1 are the first pre-condition to be met before the Attorney-General can declare the IBAC to be an interception agency for the purposes of the Interception Act.


The ability to be able to access information under the Interception Act is imperative in investigations of serious corrupt conduct.


People participating in corrupt conduct often do so using clandestine communications methods in a bid to avoid detection by law enforcement.


Accordingly, these powers are critical to ensure that the IBAC is able to access information which proves that corrupt conduct is occurring.


Other States such as New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have already established anti-corruption commissions which can access these Interception Act investigative powers. The inclusion of such a commission in Victoria increases the application of the interception and access regime nationally.


The Interception Act already strictly regulates how agencies that receive intercepted information are able to use and communicate that information – this is important in ensuring that privacy and oversight considerations are part of the interception regime. Accordingly, there are detailed provisions which set out the circumstances in which interception agencies can use and communicate intercepted information.




Consequential amendments



Schedule 1 to the bill also contains consequential amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, Privacy Act 1998 and Crimes Act 1914 to replace references to the OPI with references to the IBAC.


The Crimes Act currently allows a constable or Commonwealth officer to make available to OPI documents or seized things, to be used by OPI for specific purposes, including preventing, investigating or prosecuting an offence against a Victorian law. The bill will remove the reference to the OPI and provide the IBAC with access to such documents or seized things, for the same specific purposes.


The amendments to the Taxation Administration Act will allow the Australian Taxation Office to disclose taxpayer protected information to the Vic IBAC for law enforcement purposes, including investigating serious offences and enforcing the law.


The amendments to the Privacy Act will include the Vic IBAC within the definition of 'enforcement body' which is used in the National Privacy Principles in relation to the law enforcement exemptions to the use and disclosure, and access and correction obligations.




Victorian Inspectorate



To oversee the functioning of the IBAC, Victoria has established the Victorian Inspectorate.



Schedule 2 to the bill makes amendments to the Interception Act to ensure that the Victorian Inspectorate is able to receive and use intercepted information in support of its oversight and complaints handling functions. Victorian Public Interest Monitor


The bill also makes amendments to support the establishment of a Public Interest Monitor in Victoria (Victorian PIM). 


This body has been established to represent public interest during applications for a range of covert warrants by Victorian agencies. 


This is not the first time that the Commonwealth has recognised the role of a public interest monitor. The Queensland monitor currently has an oversight role for control orders under the Criminal Code and in applications for interception warrants by Queensland interception agencies.


Schedule 3 of the bill will enable the Victorian Monitor to receive information about an application for an interception or surveillance warrant by a Victorian agency so that the Victorian monitor may:


i. appear at an application before a person who is eligible to issue a warrant


ii. make submissions and ask questions, and


iii. require the person issuing a warrant to take the submissions of the PIM into account when considering the application. 




Conclusion



This bill is an important step in ensuring that the state body responsible for detecting, investigating and prosecuting serious criminal activity is able to access investigative tools imperative to support their functions. 


This bill balances access to communications with appropriate record keeping and independent oversight to ensure the ongoing protection of privacy for individuals. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House.

 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:41):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development and construction of housing for the Department of Defence at Ermington, New South Wales.


Defence Housing Australia proposes to develop a 16.3 hectare 'in-fill broadacre' site in the Sydney suburb of Ermington, New South Wales. The site was formerly a naval stores depot. The proposal will provide an additional 209 dwellings, made up of three- and four-bedroom townhouses, courtyard-style homes and detached homes.


The proposal will also yield nine 'super lots' for the construction of an additional 228 apartments. The 'super lots' will be sold to private developers for private sale, creating a mixed civilian and defence community and reducing DHA's net outlay. The proposal is part of ongoing activity to increase the number of houses in the DHA portfolio in Sydney and reduce the number of ADF personnel living in subsidised private rental accommodation.


The Ermington site is very well located with significant frontage on the Parramatta River and is only 15 kilometres from the Sydney CBD. It will be especially convenient for those ADF members posted to CBD locations such as Fleet Base East and Victoria Barracks.


The project cost of $90.6 million, inclusive of GST but excluding cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the sale and lease-back program.


In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in May 2012 and be completed by December 2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed fit-out of Commonwealth Parliament Offices at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney, New South Wales.


The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to undertake a fit-out of new Commonwealth Parliament Offices (CPO) at 1 Bligh Street, Sydney. The Sydney CPO provides office and meeting facilities for the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, office holders and visiting senators and members.


The current CPO is located at 70 Phillip Street and, due to the age and condition of the accommodation as well as inherent faults that cannot be overcome by a refit, it is not desirable to enter into a new long-term lease of the premises. 


However, a three-year lease has been signed to allow sufficient time to relocate and make good the current premises.


It is also proposed to provide office facilities for the Prime Minister, the current Leader of the Opposition and the operation of cabinet. In the past, the facilities for the Prime Minister and the operation of cabinet have been co-located with the CPO but have been on a separate lease and managed and fitted out by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. This proposal will achieve significant efficiencies and greater flexibility both in the fit-out project and ongoing operation of the facilities.


The Sydney CPO will occupy three levels of 1 Bligh Street, covering a fit-out area of 4,891 square metres.


The Bligh Street address retains the financial business district location with easy access to public transport and to the airport.


The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out is $21 million, plus GST.


A stakeholder reference group has been engaged which will provide regular input into the design of the new CPO.


Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in July 2012 and be completed by December 2012.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:51):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee’s report entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2011 (First Report), together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—Australia continues to enjoy near ideal conditions by every relevant measure of international comparison. Despite the disturbing persistence of uncertainty throughout much of the global economy, especially the eurozone, the fundamentals of the Australian economy remain strong.


Our public debt and unemployment rate are low by international standards. Our underlying inflation is at the midpoint of the inflation target range. We remain an attractive location for a wide range of both foreign and domestic investors. We are well placed to benefit still further from the current historic surge in business investment, particularly in the resources sector. This surge assures Australians of more growth in output and national wealth. 


As this report demonstrates, the RBA's central expectation for the next two years is for growth to closely follow the trend and for inflation to be close to the target. But there is evidence of a fundamental realignment within the national economy.


As the bank has testified, the drivers of growth in our economy have changed quite recently. The long-term, structural effects of the export oriented resources boom are now working their way through the nation, across region after region. The resulting investment boom continues to grow in strength. This is expected to last for the foreseeable future, although it has already taken the share of business investment in GDP to its highest level in at least 50 years.


It is now clear that the household behaviour has changed, with Australian households taking advantage of the current conditions to save more and spend less than they have done in the recent past. This will provide Australian families with an enhanced degree of financial resilience.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to express our best wishes to Mr Ric Battellino on the occasion of his retirement as deputy governor and our congratulations to Dr Philip Lowe on his appointment as deputy governor.


Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing at the hearing on 24 February 2012. The committee will conduct the next public hearing with the RBA on 24 August 2012 in Canberra. Further details will be circulated in the weeks prior to the hearing. 


I commend the report to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:53):  by leave—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Leigh, how apt that you should be in the chair. I rise to second, in many respects, the comments that were made by the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. Of course, the committee did undertake its most recent review of the annual report of the Reserve Bank, and it was interesting to hear the Reserve Bank governor's testimony in a range of areas.


Unlike the Labor Party, members of the coalition take the view that Australia's good fortune is not a consequence of brilliant economic stewardship by the Labor Party nor a consequence of the fiscal policy settings that the Labor Party has put in place. Rather, it was—in the view of the coalition members, and we sought to verify views on this with respect to economic stewardship—a legacy issue of the former coalition government. That is not to say it has all been bad, but the evidence, very clearly, from the Reserve Bank is that much of Australia's ongoing economic success, much of the resilience of the Australian economy, much of the strength of the Australian economy, flows from the fact of our geographic location more than it does from any brilliance by the current Treasurer.


In that respect, the testimony from the Reserve Bank governor was clear: Australia will continue to have economic challenges in the future as we undertake a very significant period of structural reform across the Australian economy. An inflated Australian dollar, in comparison to the situation historically, will continue for some time. We will continue to see pressures being placed on banks with respect to their funding costs and, in addition, there will need to be continual revisions of interest rates and the official cash rate by the Reserve Bank with respect to trying to get the balance right for Australia going forward and balancing the issue of inflation with, of course, economic growth.


Taking all those matters into account, there was also some questioning by the member for Casey of the Reserve Bank on a couple of outstanding issues with respect to Securency, and it was good to clarify those matters as other members of the committee have previously.


All in all, the committee members from the coalition side were grateful to the Reserve Bank governor for his continued cooperation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. We were grateful, too, to the committee secretariat for all of their assistance and hard work. And like the chairman of the committee, we are certainly pleased to congratulate Dr Philip Lowe on his ascension to the position of deputy governor and to thank Mr Ric Battellino for his contribution over a number of years as he steps down and retires as deputy governor.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:00):  I am sorry that quorum was caused. But the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is simply not on top of his portfolio. He has amendments to his own amendments in relation to FoFA and he is not even here to explain them, and he has amendments to other bills and is not here to explain them either. I have not seen in this place a more incompetent legislative minister.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  The member for North Sydney will direct his remarks to the bill.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 represents a number of proposed legislative changes flowing from the government's response to the super system review, commonly known as the Cooper review. In particular, this bill is focused on changes to the governance of superannuation funds and gives the power to APRA to make prudential standards for superannuation. These are important matters. The superannuation industry, in large part, owes its success to government policy. The industry is boosted by the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions, which are currently at nine per cent, and the concessional tax treatment afforded savings in a superannuation fund.


Super funds under management now amount to $1.3 trillion, broadly the annual size of the output of the Australian economy. Superannuation savings are a key form of private sector saving. For many individuals, their funds in superannuation accounts would almost be their only significant savings other than the family home. The increasing size of the superannuation industry and its critical importance as a savings vehicle mean that good governance is of paramount importance to financial stability and to household confidence. It is also of critical importance that the superannuation industry be soundly supervised by an appropriate regulator. The government needs to protect the interests of superannuants just as it needs to protect the interests of depositors in authorised deposit-taking institutions—obviously without the same explicit guarantees for funds under management.


Schedule 1 provides for additional statutory obligations for trustees. These covenants become the default rules for trustee governance and superannuation, and replace existing covenants in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. For the most part, these seem pretty worthwhile. They are the sorts of duties that trustees should already be performing, but it certainly does not hurt to define these responsibilities more carefully. MySuper trustees must promote the financial interests of beneficiaries, with particular focus on the returns that are earned. The trustees must annually assess sufficiency of scale of the MySuper product. That is known as its scale test. The trustees must include in their investment strategy an investment return target over 10 years as well as the level of risk for the MySuper product.


There are also obligations for trustees of registrable superannuation entities. These trustees must, among other things, give priority to the interests of beneficiaries where conflicts arise. They must exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee. They must have regard to valuation information, the expected tax consequences and costs in their investment strategies and they must offer a range of options sufficient to allow members to choose a diversified asset mix. They must have an insurance strategy and must meet additional duties in relation to insurance. They must formulate, regularly review and give effect to a risk management strategy. And they must maintain and manage financial resources to cover operational risk.


Again, many of these requirements are in no way contentious and these duties are really what trustees of registrable superannuation entities should already be doing. The existing covenants that apply to self-managed superannuation funds will continue to apply under the changes and the peak industry body, the Self-Managed Super Fund Professionals Association of Australia, SPAA, sees little or no implications from this legislation.


Schedule 2 of the bill deals with prudential standards for superannuation funds. It gives APRA the power to determine those standards. The standards will be legislative instruments within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and will be disallowable by parliament. APRA currently has the power to issue prudential standards in relation to authorised deposit-taking institutions, life insurance companies and general insurance companies, but not for superannuation funds. Currently, APRA can issue guidance material on expected standards for superannuation funds, but these materials are not legally binding. The Cooper review recommended APRA be given a standards-making power in relation to superannuation. Bringing superannuation funds within the prudential net of APRA is a good idea and one which will enhance the protections for superannuants.


The coalition has two issues with this bill. The Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system handed down its report in June 2010. It recommended a large range of initiatives in relation to the governance of superannuation. These included: first, that the disclosure of conflicts of interest be mandatory; second, that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply for publicly listed companies; third, that there should be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation fund boards; and, fourth, that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. Unfortunately this bill does not address any of these fundamental issues. This is a wasted opportunity. There is still much work to be done to elevate the corporate governance of superannuation to an acceptable level.


The second issue concerns the 'scale test' for MySuper funds in the new subsection 29VN(b) and (c). This requires trustees to determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale, in terms of assets and beneficiaries, such as to not disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative to the financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products in other funds. The explanatory memorandum notes that where a trustee determines that its scale is insufficient, the trustee will be required to take appropriate action to rectify the insufficiency so they continue to meet their general obligation to promote the financial interests of beneficiaries. APRA will provide prudential guidance on processes trustees could adopt to rectify insufficient scale.


The scale test is based on a presumption that larger funds invariably provide lower fees and higher returns for members. However, there is no evidence to indicate that this presumption is correct in practice. Indeed, it may be the case that smaller funds will be more nimble and better able to quickly exploit market opportunities. In this way they may offer returns superior to those offered by larger less flexible funds. At best this provision of the bill seems redundant and an unnecessary intrusion into the workings of the market.


The scale test may also confer an advantage on the larger industry superannuation funds because they have existing scale. In this sense it may operate as a barrier to entry for new funds. This would reduce competition in superannuation. This concern is shared by many of the stakeholders. As part of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into this bill, a public hearing was held on 2 March 2012. The union controlled Industry Super Network said of the scale test:


We agree that is problematic.


Given that the government takes its instructions from trade unions you would think they would listen to this. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia stated:


We believe the current wording of the scale test is problematic.


They further stated that it should be removed. Mercer, a fund with around $16 billion of funds under management and 230,000 Australian clients, commented:


… the scale test is not needed if the trustees have that responsibility to act in the member's best interest.




Mr Danby:
  Bought and sold for $4 billion dollars.




Mr HOCKEY:
  If I were you, old sunshine, I would be worried about the Greens.


The Financial Services Council noted:


Our view is that a scale test should not be in law. Not only is it a barrier to entry but the test, as suggested in the current drafting, is very subjective, very open.


Industry stakeholders are largely all on the same page in believing that a scale test is problematic, confusing and redundant.


The government cannot claim to be blind to these issues. Treasury released draft legislation in December 2011 with submissions closing on 13 January 2012. Submissions to the Treasury raised a number of issues relating to the scale of fund requirements, including that the comparison with other funds would lead to a focus on short-term returns. Other concerns of industry participants included that the scale test could become a de facto test of investment outcomes and that there was uncertainty about terms such as 'promote' and 'financial interests'. Predictably, the government failed to resolve these issues in their exposure draft. This is yet another example of Labor pretending to consult, but not listening to the people they expect a opinion from.


I indicate to the House that I will be moving an amendment to remove sections 29VN(b) and (c), which impose the flawed scale test. If our amendment to remove sections 29VN(b) and (c) is successful, we will not oppose the bill in the House.


The coalition have supported 86 per cent of all the bills that have been through this place in this parliamentary term—86 per cent of the bills, and they like to portray us as negative. It seems to be the government that is negative.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (11:13):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. In December 2010, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, the Hon. Bill Shorten, announced the Stronger Super reforms. Stronger Super represents the government's response to the review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system and the Super System Review. To provide input on the design and implementation of Stronger Super reforms, the government undertook a very extensive consultation program with industry, employers and consumer groups. On 21 September 2011, the government announced its decision on the key design aspects of Stronger Super reforms. This bill is the second part of the legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms, as part of Stronger Super. The first tranche of legislation was introduced to parliament on 3 November 2011 as the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011, known as the MySuper core provisions bill. There have been criticisms of the way we govern superannuation in Australia. As Ross Jones from APRA said:


We have better supervisory controls over a building society in remote NSW or a credit union in the sticks than we do over a multi-billion-dollar super fund.


Also, the Cooper review stated:


… governance in super has not kept up with developments in the industry. There have been difficulties for trustees in understanding what is expected of them and, as the industry consolidates, conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty arise regularly.


In the light of these criticisms the government is now taking logical, important and necessary steps to reform governance of this industry.


This bill addresses these issues by introducing the power for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, to make prudential standards, which is in line with banking and insurance, and amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) Act—to expand and enhance the duties of the 4,000 or so trustees of superannuation funds. It is important to note that there are no changes of substance for trustees of self-managed super funds.


In brief, this bill introduces the power for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to make prudential standards; amends section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to expand the duties of registrable superannuation entity licensees; applies new trustee duties to RSE licensees of an RSE that offers a MySuper product; and applies duties to the directors of corporate trustees. Trustees that elect to offer a MySuper product will have to meet new obligations, in particular to promote the financial interest of members.


The government has decided to introduce enhanced trustee obligations for trustees of funds that offer MySuper products, recognising that trustees should have increased responsibilities for default members who generally delegate all aspects of their superannuation to them.


APRA must be satisfied that a trustee will comply with the enhanced trustee obligations and that individual directors of corporate trustees will comply with the enhanced director obligations to authorise an RSE licensee to offer MySuper as a product.


Power will be given to APRA to make prudential standards in superannuation. Currently, detailed prudential requirements expanding on the SI(S) Act requirements are contained in regulations. These are less flexible and are unable to be quickly amended to respond to industry developments. Prudential standards will provide APRA with greater flexibility to effectively adapt to industry developments and the ability to provide regulated entities with clearer and more tailored legal requirements. This is a sensible change.


As we raise the bar in areas such as financial planning, it is also fair that we ensure there are improvements in other areas of our super system, including in the operation of the funds themselves and the conduct of trustees. Twenty years ago the Keating Labor government introduced one of the great economic reforms: nine per cent superannuation for every worker. This year sees the Gillard Labor government progress the next steps: stronger super, by progressively taking the universal compulsory savings rate up from nine to 12 per cent; stronger super, by getting rid of unfair fees and charges, leaving a lot more money in people's balances; and stronger super, by finding lost super, consolidating multiple accounts and improving the duties of trustees.


Thanks to our superannuation system, Australia now has the fourth largest number of privately managed funds in the world—a huge achievement. It is the envy of the Americans and a fiscal protection that our European mates would give their eye teeth for right now.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank Treasurer Swan and Senator Sherry for their work in the area of superannuation, ensuring Australia's future and steering our economy in the right direction. Labor's response to the GFC, led by Treasurer Swan, saved jobs and avoided a recession. We have delivered a strong economy with low taxes, low unemployment and low interest rates.


Our nation faces a choice, as our region of the world becomes the centre of economic growth in this century, as the resources boom and the high Australian dollar transform our economy, as our technology changes, as our society ages and as we tackle climate change. Our nation can choose to either give working people a fair share of the resources boom and today's economic strength or let only a few feel the benefits. We can choose to get ready for the future or stand still. We can choose to face up to the hard decisions now or take the easy way out and leave the hard decisions to our children and our children's children.


As a government, we have made our choices. We stand for supporting working families with a package of policies that helps them through, giving working people a fair share of the resources boom and making the hard decisions that will build a new Australian economy and get us ready for the future. By putting money into superannuation, Australians steadily build up capacity to have lifetime income security and that goal, lifetime income security, is a Labor vision, a Labor goal for the whole nation—not the Liberal way of super just for private or public fat cats. The more of our own money we have in retirement, the less we will have to rely on the age pension. So it is fiscally responsible. It also improves the circumstances decades ahead for our children. The more private savings older people have in their retirement, the less younger workers need to pay in tax to help support those retirees.


Our super reforms mean that, on Treasury estimates, we will be saving $10 billion a year to the budget by easing the pressure on the age pension. It is in the national interest to encourage Australians to save more for their retirement. But it is also fair that the superannuation industry contributes to higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees.


Fundamentally, what we are doing here is making super more efficient. The Gillard Labor government believes that every worker should take an active interest in their superannuation accounts. But, let us face it, most of us do not until we are much closer to retirement. The problem is that most superannuation funds charge you fees as though you take a regular, active interest in how your money is invested.


The most important question for federal parliamentarians is the same one as that for most modest, ordinary Australians: what can we do to bring about a better future for our kids? I am so very proud to be part of a government that is making key reforms that will make life easier for our children and their children. We know that the world is changing and that Australia faces challenges and big opportunities in the years ahead. Superannuation is part of the Australian economy. It is the largest source of long-term savings in Australia and after the family home is the second most significant source of wealth for many Australians. By ensuring that the superannuation system is more efficient, these reforms will also improve the productivity of the Australian economy.


The Gillard Labor government understands that cost-of-living pressures extend beyond working life. That is why we are delivering a world-class retirement income system and increasing support for pensioners to meet day-to-day living costs. The Leader of the Opposition is mindlessly negative and opposes everything but has no real plan for building retirement incomes for Australian workers. He acts out of political interest—the interests of the privileged, not the national interest. We all know that the member for Warringah has extreme views on compulsory superannuation. In 1995 he said:


Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.


He obviously still believes this. In his book, Battlelines, he outlines a plan to dismantle it and increase the pension age to 70. 


On all of the big calls, the Liberals get it wrong. The only policies the member for Warringah has are the ones he is trying to hide: reintroducing Work Choices, cutting family assistance and pensions, abandoning the action on climate change and abandoning support for industry. When he talks about the economy, he is speaking not for everyday Australians but for the vested interests of big tobacco, mining magnates, climate change deniers and all Liberal Party donors. When the Liberals think about the economy they do not put families and workers first. That is why they opposed Labor's stimulus package, which saved 200,000 jobs.


We understand the cost-of-living pressures on working families. We are easing those pressures through tax cuts, by making family payments fairer and more sustainable, through assistance for child care, through our education tax refund and through Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. We have a proud history when it comes to families and seniors. We are making the hard decisions now, giving working people a fair share of the resources boom and getting our nation ready for the future by building a new Australian economy. We are managing the economy for working people—fighting for jobs, as we did during the GFC and are doing now in the manufacturing and auto industries. Building a new Australian economy means rolling out the NBN, which can be used to make business more productive and deliver better government services; bringing in a mining tax to increase retirement savings, cut small business taxes and increase the tax-free threshold; and increasing our skills base through trade training centres, workplace skills programs and extending all of the education system from primary to tertiary, equipping Australians for current and future jobs.


The Gillard Labor government is getting things done. Those opposite are holding this country back. Superannuation is a proud Labor government achievement that represents a triumph of the nation over vested interests. We now have a chance to use our past achievements to build a new economy based on clean energy jobs, on technology and on skills. Our super reforms are just another piece of the puzzle. I commend this bill to the House.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:00):  I am sorry that quorum was caused. But the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is simply not on top of his portfolio. He has amendments to his own amendments in relation to FoFA and he is not even here to explain them, and he has amendments to other bills and is not here to explain them either. I have not seen in this place a more incompetent legislative minister.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  The member for North Sydney will direct his remarks to the bill.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 represents a number of proposed legislative changes flowing from the government's response to the super system review, commonly known as the Cooper review. In particular, this bill is focused on changes to the governance of superannuation funds and gives the power to APRA to make prudential standards for superannuation. These are important matters. The superannuation industry, in large part, owes its success to government policy. The industry is boosted by the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions, which are currently at nine per cent, and the concessional tax treatment afforded savings in a superannuation fund.


Super funds under management now amount to $1.3 trillion, broadly the annual size of the output of the Australian economy. Superannuation savings are a key form of private sector saving. For many individuals, their funds in superannuation accounts would almost be their only significant savings other than the family home. The increasing size of the superannuation industry and its critical importance as a savings vehicle mean that good governance is of paramount importance to financial stability and to household confidence. It is also of critical importance that the superannuation industry be soundly supervised by an appropriate regulator. The government needs to protect the interests of superannuants just as it needs to protect the interests of depositors in authorised deposit-taking institutions—obviously without the same explicit guarantees for funds under management.


Schedule 1 provides for additional statutory obligations for trustees. These covenants become the default rules for trustee governance and superannuation, and replace existing covenants in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. For the most part, these seem pretty worthwhile. They are the sorts of duties that trustees should already be performing, but it certainly does not hurt to define these responsibilities more carefully. MySuper trustees must promote the financial interests of beneficiaries, with particular focus on the returns that are earned. The trustees must annually assess sufficiency of scale of the MySuper product. That is known as its scale test. The trustees must include in their investment strategy an investment return target over 10 years as well as the level of risk for the MySuper product.


There are also obligations for trustees of registrable superannuation entities. These trustees must, among other things, give priority to the interests of beneficiaries where conflicts arise. They must exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee. They must have regard to valuation information, the expected tax consequences and costs in their investment strategies and they must offer a range of options sufficient to allow members to choose a diversified asset mix. They must have an insurance strategy and must meet additional duties in relation to insurance. They must formulate, regularly review and give effect to a risk management strategy. And they must maintain and manage financial resources to cover operational risk.


Again, many of these requirements are in no way contentious and these duties are really what trustees of registrable superannuation entities should already be doing. The existing covenants that apply to self-managed superannuation funds will continue to apply under the changes and the peak industry body, the Self-Managed Super Fund Professionals Association of Australia, SPAA, sees little or no implications from this legislation.


Schedule 2 of the bill deals with prudential standards for superannuation funds. It gives APRA the power to determine those standards. The standards will be legislative instruments within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and will be disallowable by parliament. APRA currently has the power to issue prudential standards in relation to authorised deposit-taking institutions, life insurance companies and general insurance companies, but not for superannuation funds. Currently, APRA can issue guidance material on expected standards for superannuation funds, but these materials are not legally binding. The Cooper review recommended APRA be given a standards-making power in relation to superannuation. Bringing superannuation funds within the prudential net of APRA is a good idea and one which will enhance the protections for superannuants.


The coalition has two issues with this bill. The Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system handed down its report in June 2010. It recommended a large range of initiatives in relation to the governance of superannuation. These included: first, that the disclosure of conflicts of interest be mandatory; second, that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply for publicly listed companies; third, that there should be appropriate provision for independent directors on superannuation fund boards; and, fourth, that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. Unfortunately this bill does not address any of these fundamental issues. This is a wasted opportunity. There is still much work to be done to elevate the corporate governance of superannuation to an acceptable level.


The second issue concerns the 'scale test' for MySuper funds in the new subsection 29VN(b) and (c). This requires trustees to determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale, in terms of assets and beneficiaries, such as to not disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative to the financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products in other funds. The explanatory memorandum notes that where a trustee determines that its scale is insufficient, the trustee will be required to take appropriate action to rectify the insufficiency so they continue to meet their general obligation to promote the financial interests of beneficiaries. APRA will provide prudential guidance on processes trustees could adopt to rectify insufficient scale.


The scale test is based on a presumption that larger funds invariably provide lower fees and higher returns for members. However, there is no evidence to indicate that this presumption is correct in practice. Indeed, it may be the case that smaller funds will be more nimble and better able to quickly exploit market opportunities. In this way they may offer returns superior to those offered by larger less flexible funds. At best this provision of the bill seems redundant and an unnecessary intrusion into the workings of the market.


The scale test may also confer an advantage on the larger industry superannuation funds because they have existing scale. In this sense it may operate as a barrier to entry for new funds. This would reduce competition in superannuation. This concern is shared by many of the stakeholders. As part of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into this bill, a public hearing was held on 2 March 2012. The union controlled Industry Super Network said of the scale test:


We agree that is problematic.


Given that the government takes its instructions from trade unions you would think they would listen to this. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia stated:


We believe the current wording of the scale test is problematic.


They further stated that it should be removed. Mercer, a fund with around $16 billion of funds under management and 230,000 Australian clients, commented:


… the scale test is not needed if the trustees have that responsibility to act in the member's best interest.




Mr Danby:
  Bought and sold for $4 billion dollars.




Mr HOCKEY:
  If I were you, old sunshine, I would be worried about the Greens.


The Financial Services Council noted:


Our view is that a scale test should not be in law. Not only is it a barrier to entry but the test, as suggested in the current drafting, is very subjective, very open.


Industry stakeholders are largely all on the same page in believing that a scale test is problematic, confusing and redundant.


The government cannot claim to be blind to these issues. Treasury released draft legislation in December 2011 with submissions closing on 13 January 2012. Submissions to the Treasury raised a number of issues relating to the scale of fund requirements, including that the comparison with other funds would lead to a focus on short-term returns. Other concerns of industry participants included that the scale test could become a de facto test of investment outcomes and that there was uncertainty about terms such as 'promote' and 'financial interests'. Predictably, the government failed to resolve these issues in their exposure draft. This is yet another example of Labor pretending to consult, but not listening to the people they expect a opinion from.


I indicate to the House that I will be moving an amendment to remove sections 29VN(b) and (c), which impose the flawed scale test. If our amendment to remove sections 29VN(b) and (c) is successful, we will not oppose the bill in the House.


The coalition have supported 86 per cent of all the bills that have been through this place in this parliamentary term—86 per cent of the bills, and they like to portray us as negative. It seems to be the government that is negative.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (11:13):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. In December 2010, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, the Hon. Bill Shorten, announced the Stronger Super reforms. Stronger Super represents the government's response to the review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system and the Super System Review. To provide input on the design and implementation of Stronger Super reforms, the government undertook a very extensive consultation program with industry, employers and consumer groups. On 21 September 2011, the government announced its decision on the key design aspects of Stronger Super reforms. This bill is the second part of the legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms, as part of Stronger Super. The first tranche of legislation was introduced to parliament on 3 November 2011 as the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011, known as the MySuper core provisions bill. There have been criticisms of the way we govern superannuation in Australia. As Ross Jones from APRA said:


We have better supervisory controls over a building society in remote NSW or a credit union in the sticks than we do over a multi-billion-dollar super fund.


Also, the Cooper review stated:


… governance in super has not kept up with developments in the industry. There have been difficulties for trustees in understanding what is expected of them and, as the industry consolidates, conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty arise regularly.


In the light of these criticisms the government is now taking logical, important and necessary steps to reform governance of this industry.


This bill addresses these issues by introducing the power for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, to make prudential standards, which is in line with banking and insurance, and amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) Act—to expand and enhance the duties of the 4,000 or so trustees of superannuation funds. It is important to note that there are no changes of substance for trustees of self-managed super funds.


In brief, this bill introduces the power for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to make prudential standards; amends section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to expand the duties of registrable superannuation entity licensees; applies new trustee duties to RSE licensees of an RSE that offers a MySuper product; and applies duties to the directors of corporate trustees. Trustees that elect to offer a MySuper product will have to meet new obligations, in particular to promote the financial interest of members.


The government has decided to introduce enhanced trustee obligations for trustees of funds that offer MySuper products, recognising that trustees should have increased responsibilities for default members who generally delegate all aspects of their superannuation to them.


APRA must be satisfied that a trustee will comply with the enhanced trustee obligations and that individual directors of corporate trustees will comply with the enhanced director obligations to authorise an RSE licensee to offer MySuper as a product.


Power will be given to APRA to make prudential standards in superannuation. Currently, detailed prudential requirements expanding on the SI(S) Act requirements are contained in regulations. These are less flexible and are unable to be quickly amended to respond to industry developments. Prudential standards will provide APRA with greater flexibility to effectively adapt to industry developments and the ability to provide regulated entities with clearer and more tailored legal requirements. This is a sensible change.


As we raise the bar in areas such as financial planning, it is also fair that we ensure there are improvements in other areas of our super system, including in the operation of the funds themselves and the conduct of trustees. Twenty years ago the Keating Labor government introduced one of the great economic reforms: nine per cent superannuation for every worker. This year sees the Gillard Labor government progress the next steps: stronger super, by progressively taking the universal compulsory savings rate up from nine to 12 per cent; stronger super, by getting rid of unfair fees and charges, leaving a lot more money in people's balances; and stronger super, by finding lost super, consolidating multiple accounts and improving the duties of trustees.


Thanks to our superannuation system, Australia now has the fourth largest number of privately managed funds in the world—a huge achievement. It is the envy of the Americans and a fiscal protection that our European mates would give their eye teeth for right now.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank Treasurer Swan and Senator Sherry for their work in the area of superannuation, ensuring Australia's future and steering our economy in the right direction. Labor's response to the GFC, led by Treasurer Swan, saved jobs and avoided a recession. We have delivered a strong economy with low taxes, low unemployment and low interest rates.


Our nation faces a choice, as our region of the world becomes the centre of economic growth in this century, as the resources boom and the high Australian dollar transform our economy, as our technology changes, as our society ages and as we tackle climate change. Our nation can choose to either give working people a fair share of the resources boom and today's economic strength or let only a few feel the benefits. We can choose to get ready for the future or stand still. We can choose to face up to the hard decisions now or take the easy way out and leave the hard decisions to our children and our children's children.


As a government, we have made our choices. We stand for supporting working families with a package of policies that helps them through, giving working people a fair share of the resources boom and making the hard decisions that will build a new Australian economy and get us ready for the future. By putting money into superannuation, Australians steadily build up capacity to have lifetime income security and that goal, lifetime income security, is a Labor vision, a Labor goal for the whole nation—not the Liberal way of super just for private or public fat cats. The more of our own money we have in retirement, the less we will have to rely on the age pension. So it is fiscally responsible. It also improves the circumstances decades ahead for our children. The more private savings older people have in their retirement, the less younger workers need to pay in tax to help support those retirees.


Our super reforms mean that, on Treasury estimates, we will be saving $10 billion a year to the budget by easing the pressure on the age pension. It is in the national interest to encourage Australians to save more for their retirement. But it is also fair that the superannuation industry contributes to higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees.


Fundamentally, what we are doing here is making super more efficient. The Gillard Labor government believes that every worker should take an active interest in their superannuation accounts. But, let us face it, most of us do not until we are much closer to retirement. The problem is that most superannuation funds charge you fees as though you take a regular, active interest in how your money is invested.


The most important question for federal parliamentarians is the same one as that for most modest, ordinary Australians: what can we do to bring about a better future for our kids? I am so very proud to be part of a government that is making key reforms that will make life easier for our children and their children. We know that the world is changing and that Australia faces challenges and big opportunities in the years ahead. Superannuation is part of the Australian economy. It is the largest source of long-term savings in Australia and after the family home is the second most significant source of wealth for many Australians. By ensuring that the superannuation system is more efficient, these reforms will also improve the productivity of the Australian economy.


The Gillard Labor government understands that cost-of-living pressures extend beyond working life. That is why we are delivering a world-class retirement income system and increasing support for pensioners to meet day-to-day living costs. The Leader of the Opposition is mindlessly negative and opposes everything but has no real plan for building retirement incomes for Australian workers. He acts out of political interest—the interests of the privileged, not the national interest. We all know that the member for Warringah has extreme views on compulsory superannuation. In 1995 he said:


Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.


He obviously still believes this. In his book, Battlelines, he outlines a plan to dismantle it and increase the pension age to 70.

When the Liberals think about the economy they do not put families and workers first. That is why they opposed Labor's stimulus package, which saved 200,000 jobs.


We understand the cost-of-living pressures on working families.

Superannuation is a proud Labor government achievement that represents a triumph of the nation over vested interests. We now have a chance to use our past achievements to build a new economy based on clean energy jobs, on technology and on skills. Our super reforms are just another piece of the puzzle. I commend this bill to the House.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:26):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am privileged to be introducing this legislation into the House of Representatives today.


In public debates here in Canberra, and elsewhere, we tend to hear and talk a lot about mining workers and construction workers, smelter workers or nurses and teachers, community workers, and that is a good thing. But rarely do we hear the stories of those who work in the textile, clothing and footwear sector.


They are amongst some of the most productive, hardworking and vulnerable Australians. 


They are predominantly female. They perform insecure work, sometimes with poor English language skills and no great understanding of the laws and practices that should apply in Australian workplaces. Yet they raise their families and they are generating children who grow into adults and become marvellous Australians.


Often, however, they are not represented at work. 


I believe firmly that governments should be focussed on helping those who need it the most. 


It is hard to think of another group of workers who require the support of our national parliament more than our outworkers do.


In a previous occupation I worked proudly as a union representative in workplaces where the workers all came together in one place to perform their labour, with one employer, and even in those circumstances it can be difficult to ensure that there are proper terms and conditions and a safe workplace. 


I cannot imagine how a textile, clothing and footwear outworker, with little grasp of their second language, English, and little awareness of their rights at work, can follow up on nonpayment for her work, given the multiple hands her work passes through. That is why this government has introduced this legislation. 


The Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill 2011 will provide overdue and enhanced workplace protection for Australia's most vulnerable and productive workers—in particular, outworkers.




Who is a TCF outworker?



When I talk about a TCF outworker, a textile, clothing, footwear outworker, I am talking about someone who works in the textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing industry—covering all stages of production of TCF products, from the processing of raw materials through to the production of the final goods that we wear. 


Clothing and footwear manufacture, in particular, are labour intensive, with limited scope for mechanisation or automation of significant parts of these processes. That is why outworkers are used to perform so much of this work.




Existing protections



The government's Fair Work Act already contains a number of important protections for TCF outworkers—including scope for awards to include targeted 'outworker' terms, and enhanced right of entry arrangements. 


Additional entitlements and protections for outworkers are contained in the modern award known as the Textile, Clothing, Footwear and Associated Industries Award.


Where outworkers are entitled to fair minimum conditions, they can have difficulty accessing them. 


Even our Fair Work Ombudsman faces difficulties in identifying and assisting outworkers because outwork is, by definition, not performed in traditional workplaces and it can be difficult to identify for whom the work is being performed.




What is the issue the 
b
ill is designed to address?



There have been any number of reviews over the past 15 years that have raised concerns about the situation of outworkers in the TCF industry. 


Recently, a report by the Brotherhood of St Laurence found that outworkers experience poor working conditions and are frequently underpaid, sometimes as little as $2 or $3 an hour. 


These reviews have found, and the government accepts, that outworkers in the TCF industry suffer from unique vulnerabilities as a result of their engagement or employment in non-business premises. 


It is because of those vulnerabilities that the government recognises that the TCF outworkers require specific regulatory protection in order to control the proven exploitative conditions under which too many find themselves engaged. 


I acknowledge that governments of all persuasions and at all levels have recognised the importance of this issue.


Most states have legislation that protects TCF outworkers; however, there are differences in the approaches that they take. For example:


in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, legislation deems contract outworkers to be employees, while more limited deeming applies in Victoria; 


there is provision for the recovery of unpaid amounts up the supply chain in most but not all states; and 


there is a mandatory code of practice in place in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. 




Key features of this 
b
ill



Although most jurisdictions have recognised that special measures for outworkers are required, there is no single uniform approach to regulation across our nation.


That means that outworkers have inconsistent levels of protection across Australia.


That is why our Gillard government is committed to developing arrangements to ensure all TCF outworkers are engaged under secure, safe and fair systems of work. 


The government's intention is to achieve this by implementing nationally consistent rights to legal redress and protection.


This bill implements that commitment by:


ending the artificial distinction by deeming contract outworkers in the TCF industry to be employees, by extending the operation of most provisions of the Fair Work Act;


providing an effective mechanism to enable TCF outworkers to recover unpaid amounts up the supply chain;


addressing a limitation that currently exists in relation to right of entry into premises provisions in the TCF industry operating under 'sweatshop' conditions; and


allowing for a TCF outworker code to be issued.


In relation to the extension of the specific right of entry rules to premises in the TCF industry operating under 'sweatshop' conditions, there will be an exception for the principal place of business of a person with appropriate accreditation. 


In such cases, the standard right of entry rules will continue to apply.


The existing power of Fair Work Australia to include outworker terms in awards will not be limited. Additional protection for outworker terms will be provided by ensuring that these important industry wide standards cannot be undercut by the use of flexibility terms in enterprise agreements.


These changes will promote fairness and ensure a consistent approach to the workplace entitlements and protections for a class of workers that are widely recognised as being uniquely vulnerable to exploitation.




Extending the operation of the Fair Work Act



This bill extends the operation of most aspects of the Fair Work Act to TCF contract outworkers. 


This ensures that outworkers in the TCF industry have the same terms and conditions, as well as other rights and entitlements, as other workers regardless of their status as employees or contractors. This approach is consistent with the approach that has been taken in many states.


Under the changes proposed in this bill the person who directly engages a TCF contract outworker will be treated as their employer.


The objective of these amendments—clearly stated in the bill—is to ensure that contract outworkers are taken to have the same rights and responsibilities as employees in the same position. 


The bill recognises that there may be instances where technical modifications or clarifications are required and allows regulations to be made to ensure the effective application of particular provisions to contract outworkers. 


However, the bill makes clear that such regulations can only be made to ensure the effectiveness of, and not to undercut, the extension of the act to contract outworkers.




Recovery of unpaid amounts



The bill provides a mechanism to enable outworkers to recover unpaid amounts up the supply chain.


The Productivity Commission's Review of TCF Assistance (in 2003) reported the findings that outworkers are often not paid for the work they do and that, because the supply chain consists of numerous subcontractors, outworkers may often find it difficult to pursue any unpaid moneys or entitlements.


Provision for the recovery of unpaid amounts up the supply chain is a feature already of outworker protection legislation in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, and recognises the fact that TCF outworkers are engaged at the end of a sometimes long and confusing supply chain.


Under the government's bill:


an outworker may recover an unpaid amount from another entity in the supply chain for whom work is done indirectly;


the amounts that may be recovered under these provisions include wages or commission as well as other amounts owing in relation to particular work;


where an outworker reasonably believes an entity to be indirectly liable for an unpaid amount, the outworker can initiate a claim for payment against that entity; 


the entity will then be liable for that payment unless the entity has proved that it is not liable under the provisions to pay the amount claimed, or the amount unpaid is less than that alleged to be owing; and


if an entity pays an unpaid amount in reliance on the outworker's claim, the entity will be able to recover the payment from the person who was responsible for the payment, plus interest, or offset it against other amounts that they, in turn, may be owed.


These arrangements are designed to supplement existing arrangements—these new provisions do not limit any action that an outworker might otherwise have in relation to unpaid money, including remedies available under state law. 


I also want to make the point that this provision does not extend to include retailers who sell goods produced by, or of a kind often produced by, outworkers, where the retailer does not have a right to supervise or otherwise control the performance of the work.




Code of 
p
ractice



This  bill allows an outwork code of practice to be issued dealing with standards of conduct and practice in the TCF industry.


The code may impose reporting or other requirements on employers or other persons engaged in the TCF industry to enhance the transparency of supply chains that result in outwork being performed.


An outwork code will enable arrangements for the performance of TCF work through the supply chain to be monitored. 


Provision for a code will assist in ensuring that no economic advantage can be gained by the avoidance of responsibility for a worker's entitlements.




Right of entry



The Fair Work Act already recognises the importance of right of entry to workplaces in securing fair working arrangements, and provides enhanced entry rights in relation to outworkers. 


This bill seeks to ensure that protection applies not only to outworker arrangements, but also other exploitative practices in the industry, and in particular sweatshops.


At present, entry to such premises generally requires 24 hours notice of intention to enter. The nature of sweatshop operations, and the ease with which they can relocate, mean that the current requirements can be easily circumvented.


This bill will extend specific right of entry rules that apply to suspected breaches affecting outworkers (which allow entry without 24 hours notice) to the industry more generally, with an exception for the principal place of business of a person with appropriate ethical standards accreditation.


This proposal recognises that poor practices in the TCF industry are not confined to work conducted in people's homes but also take place in conventional workplaces operating under sweatshop conditions.


The Gillard government believes that strong action on this issue is required, as reports continue of people working in sweatshops in the TCF industry. 


Members of the House may have seen reports following a film crew visiting a Melbourne TCF sweatshop in November 2011 and discovering squalid working conditions unimaginable to the ordinary person, unimaginable to exist in our nation. 


Members of the House may have read reports in major newspapers last year about sweatshops and outworkers producing school uniforms for as little as $7 an hour (less than half the award rate).


Enhanced right of entry will assist in locating, identifying, remedying and stamping out these exploitative practices.


I note that this element of the bill does not apply to the principal place of business of a person with an appropriate accreditation. In such cases, the standard right of entry rules will continue to apply.


Linking right of entry to accreditation is smart. It is intended to increase the level of scrutiny given to supply chains and encourage improvement in standards in those corners of the TCF industry that do not currently operate appropriately, for the benefit of both workers and businesses in the industry.




Impact of the changes



These changes will go a long way to ensuring that vulnerable workers in the TCF industry receive fair and decent working conditions. 


These changes will make it easier for the Fair Work Ombudsman to identify businesses that engage outworkers and investigate and enforce breaches of the Fair Work Act and the TCF award. 


These changes will improve the ability of the union to identify sweatshops and assist workers working in unacceptable conditions to receive what is justly theirs.


The government recognises that some businesses in the TCF industry may be concerned about these changes, but if a business already complies with the outworker provisions in the TCF award and relevant state legislation then the bill will have a very limited impact on them. 


It is only those that flout existing laws—by exploiting outworkers, by forcing them to work in sweatshop conditions, and by taking advantage of the vulnerable position of migrant workers—that should be concerned. It is those with something to hide that should be concerned.


This bill reflects the government's commitment to make life a little easier for some of Australia's most productive yet most vulnerable workers—to make it easier for outworkers to receive their minimum entitlements.


It is also clear that the demand for clothing and footwear that is made ethically and sustainably is growing all the time. 


As consumers we are increasingly made aware that the decision to buy is a decision that comes with responsibility.


This bill reflects the future of the Australian sector where consumers are confident that goods are produced ethically, with hardworking workers receiving fair and modest wages and decent conditions. 


By improving compliance with the existing provisions across the board and by introducing consistent provisions for outworkers, large retailers and clothing brands will have additional assurance that the garments they sell have been manufactured in an ethical way and that the values of the brand they promote are being upheld throughout the whole supply chain. 


Finally, let me make this one important commitment—the Gillard government will continue to work on ways to ensure all those who need the protections outlined in this legislation receive it. 


I understand there are outworkers forced to incorporate in attempts to avoid these and other important protections. This is unacceptable. I understand there are supply chains so complex and long that even with the patience of Job no-one could be expected to easily undo it. That is unacceptable. There are a number of ways these challenges can be approached and the Gillard government will work through them. We will persevere to ensure that this the best possible protections for some of Australia's most hardworking, productive yet vulnerable workers are enshrined in law.


I thank the members who have indicated they will support this bill and I encourage all members who are concerned about some of Australia's most hardworking, productive and vulnerable workers to support this important legislation.


Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (11:42):  —I am pleased to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill 2012 and express the coalition's very real concerns. I must begin by picking up on the disingenuous remarks of the minister at the end of his speech where he indicated that if you are doing nothing wrong then you have nothing to fear. In fact, by extending the provisions of this bill to independent contractors, and I do not just mean people who work as outworkers but people who might have recently graduated from a fashion design course at university and be designing a new Australian label in their own home, they will be caught up and described as outworkers and forced to apply the principles of an employer-employee relationship to somebody that they may engage just to sew something that they have designed and bring it back to be considered or put it into a fashion show. The suggestion that if you are doing the right thing already you have nothing to fear is not a good one from the minister.


I want to make it very clear that nobody in this House, and that includes the coalition, supports any type of sweatshop labour in Australia. Nobody in this House approves of the exploitation of generally migrant women. Nobody in this House approves of the most vulnerable workers being taken advantage of. But that is not really what this bill is about, and that is not really why the minister is bringing this legislation to the table today. Just by way of background on the bill itself, it extends the operation of most provisions of the Fair Work Act to contract outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry by deeming contract outworkers to be employees. It provides a mechanism to enable TCF outworkers to recover unpaid amounts, including from contractors, up and along the supply chain. It extends specific right-of-entry rules that apply to suspected breaches affecting outworkers which allow entry without 24 hours notice to the TCF industry and it enables a TCF outwork code to be issued.


The TCF industry, particularly the garment industry, has become dependent upon and structured around subcontracting, outsourcing and the prolific use of outworkers or home based workers, most often migrant women with limited English skills, forming supply chains of manufactured items with each other for final completion and distribution to retail outlets. That is a fact. The development of supply chain production systems through subcontracting methods has posed unique challenges to the traditional award based and state and territory based occupational health and safety systems and the worker compensation schemes as well. We accept that. However, we do not accept that the situation has not had considerable adjustments to it and that the conditions that once did exist for so-called sweatshop workers do not exist and are in fact against the current provisions of the Fair Work Act.


I only have to go to the minister's second reading speech in the Senate to see that he clearly makes the point that the Fair Work Act already contains a number of important protections for TCF outworkers, including scope for awards to include targeted outworker terms and enhanced right-of-entry arrangements. Additional entitlements and protections for outworkers are already contained in the Textile, Clothing, Footwear and Associated Industries Award. So it is not correct to suggest that if we do not move on this legislation this group of, yes, vulnerable workers are somehow unprotected. They are not.


When we are faced with evidence of endemic and inappropriate conduct in workplaces in a specific industry the coalition are always willing to consider industry-specific legislation that addresses that conduct. It was on this basis that we maintained protections for outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in various iterations of workplace relations legislation between 1996 and 2007. It was on this basis that the coalition implemented the workplace legislation specific to the building and construction industry so recently wound back by the government. So we do know there are specific provisions in the Fair Work act that protect outworkers and we know that there are equivalent provisions in state and territory legislation.


But the whole point of this is: why does the government feel it necessary to introduce additional amending legislation to the Fair Work Act when the Fair Work Act itself is already the subject of a post-implementation review—a long and exhaustive process? Perhaps it is because the government does not want to see what that review will finally come up with. The reality is that the modern award system is failing in many areas. When I say 'failing', I mean that it is not passing the government's own disadvantage test. It is in fact reducing the wages of a range of lower paid workers in society. So in the middle of a process where the government is reviewing its own Fair Work Act, and spruiking that review with every step it takes, it is inserting this specific piece of legislation about the textile, clothing and footwear industry into that act. We in the coalition say, 'Bring it on when you bring out the review of that act. If there are problems with this, introduce them at that stage.'


I then come back to the rationale for the legislation that we are seeing here today. The minister just now and the minister in the Senate have both mentioned that it relates to two reports. Its justification, as proposed by the minister at the time, Minister Evans, was based on a reference to a 2007 report by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and a 1996 Senate economics reference committee inquiry. Both these reports had been completed prior to the passage of the fair work bill. If these reports constituted such a strong case for this proposed bill then why has the government waited until now to act? Why did the government not address those concerns as soon as it had its first legislative opportunity, which was the introduction and subsequent passage of the Fair Work Act? I put it to you, Deputy Speaker, and members of the government that there was no problem to correct at that stage, that the protections that were already in place were sufficient.


I want to come now to the concerns that were expressed by those who made submissions to the Senate review of this legislation. The government does not like its legislation being referred to Senate committees because it does not like the truths and the realities that come forward from people who live and do business in the real world. It was reluctant but, yes, we got the Senate inquiry up. However, the inquiry's process was guillotined at the first opportunity and so the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia—that is, the industry body that represents textile, clothing and footwear—was not even allowed to appear at the Senate inquiry. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia was, and it was entirely appropriate that it was. I appreciate, as the shadow minister reflected in the Senate, that it made a professional and well-written submission and the briefing that it gave to the opposition was both those things as well. That is entirely as it should be. But why would a Senate committee prevent the industry body that looks after this industry coming to talk to senators from all sides of parliament about a piece of legislation that will make such a difference to that industry? What is the government running and hiding from? What are the deficiencies in the existing legal system?


The minister mentioned just now the Channel 9 story on a Melbourne TCF sweatshop. I am sure there were real difficulties to address, but I am sure they were in breach of the current legislation. Why is the minister relying on Channel 9 stories to move such complex legislation? The Sunday Herald Sun report on sweatshops and outworkers producing school uniforms is something else the minister just referred to. Where is the evidence base? Where is the rationale for bringing this legislation to the table if all you can come up with in your second reading speech to the House today is two media reports?


The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, while they did not appear before the Senate committee, were nevertheless able to make a submission. They have said that the argument for introducing the legislation is based on research conducted nearly five years ago, not current evidence, and fails to acknowledge the gains made in 10 years of existing legislation and four years of investment by the federal government in Ethical Clothing Australia.


If there was such a strong case for change, why did the now Prime Minister when she introduced the Fair Work Act as minister for education and employment say:


I believe the Fair Work system is right …


We worked hard to get the balance right and I believe the Fair Work Act is right.


These amendments were not imagined for this particular industry at that time. So we are led to the inescapable conclusion that the government's motivation for this amendment is more about appeasing the trade union movement in the lead-up to the next federal election. As I said, the review of the Fair Work Act is currently underway and will pick up any deficiencies that had not been identified when the act was introduced.


I will turn to some of the submissions made by people who work closely with small businesses. They are people who took time to make submissions to the inquiry. They are people who understand the realities of life in a small business environment. I remind the House and those listening to the broadcast today that we are talking about the fashion industry, in large part, and the clothing industry in Australia. Many women, like me, really do look at the labels of the clothes they buy. We seek out labels whose clothing is made in Australia. We love the fact that we have bright young designers here in Australia, but they are threatened by this legislation. Australia has a fabulous fashion industry; we have great home-grown designers: Carla Zampatti, Sass and Bide, Dion Lee, Alannah Hill and Lisa Ho to name a few. The next generation of design superstars is threatened by this legislation. 


One submission to the committee came from a young woman who describes herself—I draw directly from her submission—as an emerging Australian fashion designer who is: 'starting a label from home. The textile, clothing and footwear modern award regime and this associated amendment defines me as an outworker, despite my four-year degree in fashion from Ultimo TAFE. The catch-all modern award has a catch-all definition where anyone working from home in the fashion industry is an outworker. Yes, I can be considered an outworker if I sell to a boutique or a department store.' With this bill we are stifling the young, innovative and entrepreneurial in this country. This young woman continues:


… as a fashion student/designer, if I hand out work to a 'maker/outworker' to sample a design I am obligated by law to employ them with full benefits and entitlements, and that is against the law for me to employ them casually. Further I am aware that in the final form—


of this bill, the parliament will deem—


all outworkers to be employees for most purposes of the Fair Work Act 2009 … including the National Employment Standards, Superannuation and unfair dismissal laws. As a start-up business, in the beginning it will be challenging to pay myself, never mind employ a ‘maker/ outworker' …


who is knocking up a design on a casual basis so you can put it on the catwalk next weekend. Suddenly, the outworker becomes an employee and the designer becomes subject to all of the draconian—they are not always draconian—aspects of the legislation. It is absolutely unworkable. In trading in such an environment this woman, as she says, faces prosecution in breach of the modern award. She finally states: 'The risks are too great.'


For ladies—and it is generally ladies—who like to buy fashion labels in Australia, I want to place on the record that it is that activity that is under threat from this legislation. It was not mentioned by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations when he gave his second reading speech earlier, and it was not mentioned when this bill was introduced in the Senate, but it is clearly something that would be scooped up by the catch-all provisions of this legislation.


Making a submission to the Senate inquiry was Apl Financial Pty Ltd. They are chartered accountants who deal with small businesses on a day-to-day basis, unlike this government. They have a unique insight into the difficulty of applying some of the fair work legislation to the real world. They state:


The Fairwork outworker legislation is so restrictive and draconian that it is no longer viable and administrative possible to engage outworkers.


Why? They state:


The amendment deems outworkers to be employees …


If the amendment is passed then outworkers and the contractors supplying the work will be required to choose between complying with the Income Tax Act and the Fair Work Act.


That is quite a neat point. There are no amendments to the Income Tax Act to take away from the real world situation where you are either an employee or an independent contractor. That is decided under the Income Tax Act. It is a matter of fact, not a matter of interpretation. Their submission is right: it is not possible to comply with both. They state:


The amendment will cause the direct costs of using outworkers to increase … Businesses engaging outworkers will now be liable for unfair dismissal claims.


There is no research to indicate that the exploitation of workers in the clothing industry is greater than other industries.


There is no research which defines the number of outworkers in Australia.


Apl Financial's submission continues:


How can such a situation arise; an industry in crisis, no definite knowledge of whether a problem exists, no definite knowledge of the size of the problem, introduction of draconian legislation which will place further costs on production to be carried by small business which cannot be complied with and will not fix the issue.


Because people who operate outside the law, as I am sure we saw in those media reports that the minister quoted, will continue to operate outside the law. The submission continues:


The major proponent of the legislation is the TCFU(Victoria).


A review of the audited financial statements of the union for the years ended 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2010 shows a 48% fall in membership to 2,617 members.


On current trends by 2015 membership of the TCFU will be nil.


It appears that the reduction in membership income is being replaced by government funding.


For the year ended 30 June 2010 the union received $1.15 million of funding.


The TCFU is fighting for its survival.


Is the exploitation of outworkers issue a ruse run by the union so the government has a reason to keep funding the union?


This is a question that has been raised in submissions to the committee. It is a question that I am not necessarily taking a position on, but is one that needs to be put on the table so that the House can understand all aspects of the situation in relation to this legislation. As Apl Financial said in its submission:


Special provisions in the Act are not required protect outworkers. The general provisions of the Act together with the Contractors Act and the Income Tax Act are adequate to prosecute and shut any business exploiting outworkers


There are many reasons this legislation will not improve the conditions of outworkers. That is what we should come back to. As I said at the outset, nobody in the coalition supports sweatshops or the exploitation of vulnerable workers, but we do want to make sure that we do not shut down an industry altogether. Perhaps it will become too difficult—too expensive, too overburdened with paperwork, too unrealistic. The minister mentioned a code of conduct. It sounds good, but my goodness: imagine the paperwork associated with that code of conduct. Some regulations will probably come in later on that will require an enormous amount of bureaucratic compliance to be done by those who work in this industry. Regarding the supply chain recovery of money aspects of this bill, you might be performing quite well in your position in the supply chain of clothing manufacture, but now all of a sudden you can be caught up as a notional employer and be required to fix one of the wrongs that has been done by somebody further down the supply chain whose activities you have no knowledge of. That is really quite ridiculous.


The clothing industry has lost 13,000 jobs in the last 12 months, according to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia. With the high Australian dollar and the global financial crisis, designers and Australian manufacturers cannot afford a further impost on their production costs. As one manufacturer advised, 'We will stop manufacturing in Australia and just import all our garments from Asia.' Anyone involved in the clothing industry and the designer fashion industry has seen that trend inescapably over the last 10 to 15 years.


Manufacturers who remain in Australia and who endeavour to comply with the additional red tape will of course pass part of the cost of compliance on to the outworkers, thus reducing their income. How counterproductive is that? As designers and manufacturers move work to Asia there will be less work for the outworkers. These changes are dramatic and will increase production costs substantially, which will cause businesses to fail, reducing the work available to outworkers. The Fair Work Act will create a situation whereby the cost of preparing and monitoring the paperwork on small, low-volume production runs will be greater than the price the designer will be prepared to pay to have the garments manufactured.


Unethical, unprofessional and disreputable businesses that exploit outworkers are not concerned with government legislation, because, as I said, such businesses will always find a way around legislative changes. When such businesses are prosecuted, as we see all too often, the assets are dissipated.


According to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia there are now sections in the act covering instances where an outworker is exploited, the contractor is prosecuted and all funds have disappeared. Then the organisation or individual providing the contract to the contractor is liable. Liability continues up the supply chain until funds are available to meet the underpayment and penalties of up to $30,000. If you are a person of high integrity and ethical standards with a good reputation you would have to consider your position now in that supply chain, as well as what you might be liable for from those further down the supply chain and what that might then do to your reputation in this somewhat precarious industry.


This legislation is nonsense; it is unworkable. It will be impossible to determine which entity or individual in the production chain should pay the underpayment and penalties. Why penalise companies and individuals further up the supply chain when in fact they have complied with all of the legislation?


We want to demonstrate our faith in the protection that the parliament, its legislation in the Fair Work Act and the albeit flawed modern award process should offer to Australia's most vulnerable workers. Therefore, I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to this legislation that focus on quite reasonable things. One of these things is the time line within which this is introduced. In other words, it should actually wait until the post-implementation review of the Fair Work Act is completed. As I said, anything that arises from a situation in the textile, clothing and footwear industry as it now exists should be dovetailed and fed back into that review and brought to the parliament in legislation that brings other aspects of the review to the parliament. So that is one modest amendment that we will be moving.


The other amendment concerns the fact that we actually want to make sure that no-one is worse off after this legislation is passed. We are not interested in contractors being turned into employees to boost union numbers and memberships. We know that is an agenda. What we are really concerned about is the reality for these vulnerable workers. So we will be moving an amendment that focuses on the fact that they actually should not be worse off after this passes through the parliament, if in fact it does. I thank the House.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (12:04):  Really I should not be surprised at this point. In the same week that we saw the Tories in this place oppose safe rates and safe working conditions for truck drivers in our country, we now see them exposing vulnerable workers—largely a female workforce—to unfair work practices and working conditions. I am afraid I do not take particularly seriously the somewhat disingenuous concerns that have been expressed by the member for Farrer for some of those vulnerable workers, because at every stage of the development of workplace legislation the opposition have revealed themselves to be completely unconcerned with the rights of working people. Each time we present legislation in this place which aims to make work rights fairer for some of our most vulnerable people across the most vulnerable industries in this country, they stand in this place and indicate their disdain for those working people and for those who represent them.


It is extraordinary that, in addition to opposing safe rates and opposing this legislation, the opposition are trying to claim that they represent small business interests in this place. So much of the rhetoric of the member for Farrer went to the opposition's apparent concerns about the interests of small business and the opportunities presented to small business. I am afraid you really cannot have it both ways. You cannot come into this place and say that you are going to be opposing tax cuts for small business, you cannot come into this place and say that you are going to be opposing the change in the company tax rate to assist business generally in this country, and then pretend to be representing small business. On every count those opposite fail the test of a responsible opposition, fail the test of compassion towards workers and fail the test of reasonableness for industry.


It is extraordinary that the third point the member for Farrer raised—indeed, I am sure members of the opposition generally will raise this in the course of this debate—is that there has not been sufficient opportunity for consultation in relation to the legislation before us, that there is not sufficient opportunity for industry input. Well, one only has to look back at the development of the Fair Work legislation in this country and compare it to the development of Work Choices legislation in this country to see the very stark difference between the approach taken by those of us on this side of the chamber and the opposition. The Work Choices legislation was brought to this place by stealth, with rather limited consultation, and certainly very limited consultation for working people in this country. However, this government, after what was effectively a referendum on workplace rights at the 2007 election—when the Australian people resoundingly rejected the approach taken by the Tories in relation to fair workplaces and workplace rights—undertook a rigorous process of review and consultation and developed its legislation appropriately to reflect a fair balance, a balance which ensures that the rights of working people across industries, including the TCF industry, are supported and to ensure fairness for all.


The contortions of the opposition, as they come into this place pretending that they are concerned about vulnerable workers and pretending that they are concerned about small business, are extraordinary. Frankly, like most contortionists, they deserve to be in a sideshow—and indeed they are a sideshow. We know that this government stands for ensuring that vulnerable people have appropriate rights in their workplaces, and this legislation is absolutely about that. It is as a result of an ongoing effort by those in the TCF workforce and by those who represent people in the TCF workforce that we are ensuring there is justice in the workplace. So I am very pleased to speak on this legislation today.


The Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry is a major sector of our economy, with industry estimates of over $9 billion in annual sales. It accounts for 10 per cent of manufacturing establishments. Business analysts report that 50 per cent of clothes sold in Australia are manufactured domestically. Manufacturing employment in the industry is characterised by outworkers, and the legislation before us is concerned with them. The Productivity Commission estimates that outworkers comprise 40 per cent of the workforce. While the nature of the industry makes it difficult to be specific, the number of Australians working in the TCF industry is by any measure significant. The Senate Economics Reference Committee's inquiry into outworkers in the garment industry reported in 1996 that at that time the number of outworkers in Australia ranged from 50,000 to over 300,000, with over 140,000 in my state of Victoria.


Despite the size and contribution of this major sector of the economy, the poor working conditions of its outsourced workforce have been of major concern. Many reviews over the past 15 years have identified these issues, so it is appropriate and timely for this legislation to come before the House today. The Senate inquiry found problems with payments and hours of work as well as confusion and misinformation about rights and responsibilities in workplaces. It found that noncompliance with award wages and conditions was so widespread that it was considered normal.


The Industry Commission in 1997 and the Productivity Commission in 2003 found that outworkers received payment and conditions significantly lower than their award or statutory entitlements. A study in 2007 by the Brotherhood of St Laurence reported that outworkers themselves were stating that conditions had worsened over the past 10 years, with continuing poor working conditions and underpayments, sometimes as low as $2 or $3 per hour. One of the outworkers interviewed for this study stated:


If we work eight hours a day, five days a week, we would only earn $100 so it is not enough. It's impossible to work less hours and clear the same as workers in the factory.


Another outworker stated:


We do the sewing: the factory then gives it to (company name) and they say it is all wrong and they don't pay the money. Then the factory does not pay me.


This study also reported the continuing lack of awareness throughout the industry of the need to comply with relevant workplace laws and award conditions for outworkers. The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia reported to the Senate inquiry that they were 'extremely concerned' about exploitative employment practices in the industry. So it is appropriate, timely and critical for this legislation to come before us today. These reviews have found—and the government certainly accepts—that outworkers in the TCF industry suffer from unique vulnerabilities as a result of their engagement or employment in non-business premises. These vulnerabilities are made worse by the fact that these workers are often migrants, with poor English language skills and a lack of knowledge of Australia's legal system and employment arrangements.


Since our election in 2007 and the referendum on fair work in Australia, Labor has acted to improve the situation of these workers. The government's Fair Work Act includes a number of important specific protections for outworkers, with additional entitlements and protections contained in the industry award. While a number of states have legislation providing special protections for TCF outworkers, this is far from uniform. Even where these protections have been enacted, outworkers still have difficulty using or enforcing them. The difficulty of identifying employers and work locations throughout the supply chain has also limited the ability of the union representing outworkers—the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia—to gain right of entry to explain workplace rights to outworkers and to represent its members. This problem has been highlighted by the Fair Work Ombudsman, who has reported difficulty in identifying and assisting outworkers due to the fact that they do not work in traditional workplaces and that there is inherent difficulty in identifying employers.


For all these reasons, this government is acting. This bill responds to the concerns I have outlined by providing enhanced workplace protection for outworkers. It represents a major step forward for Australia's outworkers, most of whom are women. It extends the operation of most provisions of the Fair Work Act to contract outworkers in this industry, and it provides a mechanism to enable them to recover unpaid amounts up the TCF industry supply chain. It enables a TCF outwork code to be issued. Most importantly, the bill addresses limitations on right of entry provisions to assist in ensuring that workplaces comply with Australian law and award conditions. It will extend outworker-specific right of entry rules to all premises in the TCF industry operating under sweatshop conditions. So it is appropriate and timely that this bill has come before the House today.


I would like to acknowledge the work of two organisations which have long advocated on behalf of Australian outworkers—FairWear, which has brought together a network of community organisations and for many years has advocated the elimination of exploitation of sweatshop workers and home-based outworkers in the Australian clothing industry, and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, which has been at the forefront of representing the industrial interests of outworkers and raising awareness of their legitimate rights and entitlements.


I finish with the words of Mr John Ryan from the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations, who said in 2006:


A measure of our humanity is how we assist the vulnerable. Outworkers need fair pay and conditions to support their families and to live with dignity. The safety nets for outworkers, and other industrially weak workers, need to be maintained.


These are vulnerable Australians who deserve the support of this parliament and they certainly have the support of those on this side of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (12:15):  I rise today to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill 2011. The bill is set to extend more provisions of the Fair Work Act to outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry by deeming them employees. The bill will also extend right of entry provisions to circumstances in which suspected breaches affect TCF outworkers so that the provisions may apply to the industry broadly, with an exception for normal right of entry rules to apply for the principal place of business of a person who possesses appropriate accreditation. Other changes will allow TCF outworkers to recover unpaid amounts up the supply chain, a restriction of the flexibility clauses in enterprise agreements that deal with TCF provisions, and the ability for a TCF outworker code to be issued.


Currently, the Fair Work Act describes an outworker in the textile, clothing and footwear industry as an individual who performs work in the textile, clothing and footwear industry for the purposes of a contract for the provision of services but does so at a residential premise or another premise that would not conventionally be regarded as being a business premise. The bill, however, will amend the act to allow for contracted TCF outworkers to be considered as employees if they directly or indirectly perform work for an employer considered to be a Commonwealth outworker entity, which includes corporations and the Commonwealth itself.


Here we see Labor again trying to define more independent contractors as employees in its fair work regime, as this bill has the potential to cover many independent contractors in the TCF industry, to their disadvantage. Only a couple of weeks ago, I spoke in this place on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill, in which the government is trying to cover independent contractors and owner-drivers under new provisions that bear the mark of the fair work regime. I think it might actually have been last week. The bill being debated today will extend the scope of the provisions in the current act. It means that upcoming designers with university degrees who do not want to be bound by an employee-employer relationship will nonetheless be treated as employees. Further, the changes will act as a disincentive for businesses, who will not want to hire outworkers because they will have to adhere to the same conditions as they have to for normal employees.


The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia noted in its submission that, due to the definitions of what an outworker is and what TCF work is in this bill, many outworkers who do not display the characteristics of vulnerability due to their possession of qualifications, knowledge and skills will be treated in the same manner as those who do bear those characteristics. This bill assumes that all outworkers do not want to be outworkers, and that is simply not the case.


The current Fair Work Act allows for employees and their employer to create an individual flexibility arrangement based on the genuine needs of both parties. This can be done via the modern award or through an enterprise agreement. Even though this bill will classify outworkers as employees in many cases, the bill points out that, if the enterprise agreements include terms that would be considered outworker terms in the modern award, the flexibility term of that enterprise agreement 'must not allow the effect of those outworker terms to be varied'. Yet this provision may deny outworkers, whether they be TCF outworkers or not, the ability to attain an IFA, despite the better overall test, which ensures that outworker terms are not able to be undercut by IFAs or other enterprise agreement terms. As the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia put it:


If this proves to be the case, the intention to provide nationally consistent rights for those outworkers, regardless of whether they are employees or contractors, may not be achieved.


In the majority report from the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the Labor members stated:


… the committee was struck by the words of Deputy President Riordan of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, who presided over a case in 1987 …


The comments expressed by the then deputy president that the committee referred to were in relation to the plight of outdoor workers, or outworkers, who he considered were an unorganised section of the workforce. It was true that, at that time, outworkers were largely an unorganised section of the workforce. There was little union organisation of that sector at the workplace, and that situation continues to a large extent today.


I have a lot of respect for Deputy President Riordan, who went on to be Senior Deputy President Riordan, whom I appeared before on numerous occasions. But I believe the comments he made in relation to outworkers, which the Senate committee has put so much weight on, must be viewed in the context of what was happening in the TCF industries at that time. We are talking about the late 1980s through until the early 1990s. The TCF industries in Australia were undergoing unprecedented change. The industry had been receiving high levels of assistance though tariffs and quotas, but this was being reduced. I do not intend to discuss the merits or otherwise of tariffs and quotas right now—I may well do so at a later date—but it is important to recognise that these issues had a significant impact on TCF industries from the late 1980s and that this continues today. In the late 1980s and early 1990s in particular, many textile, clothing and footwear manufacturers found themselves under huge cost pressure and found themselves competing with countries such as China which had, and continue to have, much lower labour costs. There were three main areas that employers focused on at that time. First was implementing total quality management principles to increase the quality of their products and also to maximise output from their production processes. Second was downsizing their production capacity or closing altogether. Third was reducing labour costs through reductions in overtime and casual work in the first instance but later through reducing the working week from five to four days. There were many enterprise agreements entered into and certified by the commission that provided for a four-day working week in order to secure as much employment as was possible.


This was especially the case in the footwear industry. Ultimately, and very sadly, this was a relatively short-term solution as factory after factory closed. Many workers in the industry were migrants, and it was fairly common for the male in the household to work in the textiles or footwear industries and for the female in the household to work in the clothing industry as an outworker from home, where she would also care for children or older family members. It was absolutely devastating for those families when one lost work and it was often the female outworker who had the responsibility for earning the income for her family. For many of those women, working in a factory environment would not have been an acceptable option. They needed and wanted to continue to work as outworkers.


Were their conditions poor in the 1980s? For some that was undoubtedly the case. Have circumstances and provisions for outworkers improved since the time of Senior Deputy President Riordan's statement? Most certainly they have. Should there be an opportunity for people to continue as outworkers? Absolutely. Outwork provides many opportunities for increased workforce participation, and we have a responsibility to take appropriate action to ensure that workforce participation is maximised, particularly for women, who are already underrepresented.


I listened to the member for La Trobe speak on this bill and I was disappointed with her level of negativity, particularly in her opening remarks. If, as the member for La Trobe said, the government are all about workers and fairness then why will they not vote for an amendment that no worker or contractor be worse off as a result of this bill? I question the motives behind the government introducing these bills now.




Mr Mitchell:
  That's because you don't care about workers!




Mrs ANDREWS:
  I do care about the workers and I have had a lot more to do with them then you have.


Why did the government not seek to make these changes when it brought in the Fair Work Act 2009? Further, why has the government waited—




Mr Mitchell:
  How many years did you spend in the TCF industry?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! The member will be heard in silence.




Mrs ANDREWS:
  Further, why have the government waited all this time to bring this legislation forward if they knew the issues were not thoroughly dealt with when the Fair Work Act was first passed? The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry both expressed concerns over the references used to justify the bill and the fact that there is a failure here to acknowledge the gains made in recent years.


I believe that this casts doubts over the judgment of the Prime Minister, who said back when she was the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in the Rudd government:


I believe the Fair Work system is right.


…   …   …


We worked hard to get the balance right and I believe that the Fair Work act is right.


If the Fair Work Act is right, as the Prime Minister claimed, then why is it necessary to make these amendments today?


The coalition recognised when it was in government that there was a need to provide the TCF industry with additional protections, which were granted. At about the same time, the coalition government established the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, recognising that the building and construction industry required additional protections as well. The Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner worked. In 2010-11, the ABCC found 900 contraventions of Commonwealth workplace relations law. It conducted 401 investigations and successfully prosecuted 74 cases. It saw a drop in the number of working days lost per thousand employees and saw a 10 per cent increase in productivity in the building and construction industry. Yet the Prime Minister—the same person who claimed that the Fair Work Act was right, the same person who claims to want a robust industrial relations framework—is taking the sledgehammer to the ABCC and all the headway it has made in making the building and construction industry stable again.




Mr Mitchell:
  What's this got to do with the TCF?




Mrs ANDREWS:
  If you had actually been here at the beginning of the speech, you might have understood.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member will fail to respond to interjections. The member will be heard in silence.




Mrs ANDREWS:
  The government claims to be removing the ABCC because it discriminates against certain workers, and because industrial relations in this country should be determined by a one-size-fits-all approach. However, the government comes to this place today with this bill that will affect only the TCF industry and outworkers. In short, this bill clearly contradicts Labor's view with regard to the ABCC and workplace relations as a whole.


It is no surprise that this government is of two minds about workplace relations. The Prime Minister herself was of two minds when it came to the carbon tax: one month she did not want it; the next month it was back on the agenda. Australians have certainly come to expect this two sided approach to policy from Labor and we are, quite frankly, sick of it. I note that at the present time the government is conducting a review into the Fair Work Act. I think the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations need to explain why this bill and its provisions have not been made a part of that review as they should have been in the first place.


The most disturbing part of this bill is the effect it will have on businesses. With a harder export market due to the higher Australian dollar, rising operating costs and higher labour costs compared to other countries such as China, TCF businesses across the country would struggle under these changes, especially considering the latest industry figures show that there are only 1,701 clothing businesses in Australia that earn more than $200,000.


This bill should have been part of the Fair Work Act review being conducted rather than brought before the House. This would have allowed for a thorough review of this country's workplace relations scheme and what it is currently lacking. By bringing the bill before the House today, the government is running away from scrutiny and kicking the union movement a free goal. Further, many up-and-coming designers will be disadvantaged by these changes, and that is not good enough. Rather than providing a disincentive for this, we need to provide encouragement to those people. We need to maximise workforce participation, and the government should not be putting obstacles in the way of achieving this.


Patterns of work have changed over the years and need to continue to do so. Manufacturing industries are critical to the future of Australia, and we need to be proactive and forward thinking to make sure that we maintain at least as broad a base of manufacturing as we have now. The government has failed to provide evidence that its changes are in the best interests of the industry and those who work in it, whatever their capacity. This bill should not be passed.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (12:30):  I rise in strong support of the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill. This bill seeks to amend the Fair Work Act to ensure appropriate protection and rights for contract outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The three major areas of change include: recognising TCF contract outworkers as employees under the Fair Work Act; creating a system that would allow outworkers to go up the supply chain to recover any overdue payments; and adjusting the rules of entry to allow inspection of sweatshops and other potentially suspicious places of employment with little notice or without notice.


Because outworkers are employed in non-business enterprises they often suffer unique challenges. These challenges are exacerbated by poor language skills and a lack of knowledge of their rights under the Australian legal system, as most outworkers are recent arrivals to this country. There is a general lack of knowledge of workplace relations.


I get to see firsthand the good work that people such as Hung Nguyen, an organiser with the TCFUA, do to address the issues of outworkers in my electorate of Fowler. Given that 30 per cent of my electorate is made up of Asians, many of whom are refugees, particularly from Vietnam and Cambodia, there is certainly a market for exploiting those who are most vulnerable, particularly women outworkers. So I personally praise the efforts of Hung and the TCFUA in advocating for the protection of outworkers and for the application of industry-wide standards that will not be undercut by exploiting outworkers.


Earlier this week I had the opportunity to attend an event organised by the union, led by the National Secretary, Michele O'Neil, who is in the gallery here today. This was a joint effort by the TCFUA and FairWear, with their spokesperson Shelley Marshall, and a number of women from Asian Women at Work, including the organisation coordinator, Lina Cabaero. FairWear is a coalition of organisations, including Asian Women at Work and the union as well as a number of churches and other organisations that are committed to fighting exploitation of workers, particularly women, in the clothing industry. So when those opposite want to bang on about unions, I wonder whether they take the same stick to those churches and other organisations also working against exploitation—




Mr Briggs:
  We bang on about union bosses, mate, not unions.




Mr HAYES:
  Well, the member for Mayo will have an opportunity to add to that.


I was particularly touched by some of the guest speakers from Asian Women at Work. This organisation works to inform and empower migrant women who work in disadvantaged working conditions in places such as sweatshops. The main speaker on behalf of the outworkers came from the suburb of Cabramatta, right smack bang in the middle of my electorate. Nguyet Vu brought her autistic daughter, Anna, with her to Canberra, where she spoke of her experiences and the challenges of being an outworker working in poor conditions. Ms Vu had many challenges in her life. She was dealt a very hard hand and is raising a daughter with autism. Nevertheless, she worked, and worked hard, for her family. She drew attention to the unique circumstances that often limit choice and the balance of power when it comes to predominantly migrant based employment conditions.


Another Vietnamese lady from Cabramatta, Kim Thanh, in front of us all sewed a picnic blanket on which she embroidered the words 'Justice for outworkers in 2012'. That was very powerful imagery of the work that many of these people do in conditions that we would certainly not want for our families. The main message from this event, titled 'A Fair Deal for Outworkers and their Families', was that it is time for our nation to take steps to ensure fairness and equality for all its citizens, especially those in disadvantaged living and working conditions.


A number of reviews and investigations have taken place in recent years, including the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry in 1996. A Brotherhood of St Laurence investigation in 2007 found that outworkers had appalling working conditions. The investigation made findings on a number of issues connected to working hours and extremely low, delayed or missing payments. Not even the opposition would want to criticise the Brotherhood of St Laurence for its charitable works. It found that outworkers were being paid as little as $3 or $4 an hour. These people pay the same amount for their groceries and household necessities as we do. Indeed, they pay the same rate of GST on the goods and services they need to support their families. Such extreme breaches of workers' rights should not happen in Australia in this day and age. We have come so far in the area of workers' rights and we cannot leave a large number of fellow Australians behind.


In fact, 40 per cent of all factory based employment in the TCF sector consists of outworkers. Numerically, that means about 20,000 workers in total. The review I mentioned also found widespread lack of knowledge regarding the rights and responsibilities of workers in this country. The majority of outworkers are migrants with poor language skills. Long working hours and exhaustion as well as domestic commitments often prevent these workers, many of them women, from gaining an education and acquiring and developing greater language skills. This in itself creates a vicious cycle of a lack of knowledge and a need to remain in less than satisfactory working conditions without the prospect of advancement to better-paid work.


I previously mentioned Asian Women at Work, a wonderful organisation advocating on behalf of migrant working women. This organisation has a significant presence in my electorate. As members here know, 50 per cent of my electorate was born overseas. Another interesting statistic is that 30 per cent of my electorate is Asian. Many individuals find themselves in poor working conditions with poor knowledge of their rights and their ability to get out. Asian Women at Work has been empowering migrant women in these conditions since 1993. The organisation offers a wide range of programs designed to inform, empower and support migrant women in low-paid employment. Asian Women at Work works hard to increase the confidence levels of migrant working women, who are generally isolated from information and support services due to long hours, as well as being forced to work in what many of us would refer to as conditions of exploitation.


The current system of monitoring the recovery of payments in the TCF outworker sector is very difficult. It is hard for individual outworkers to work their way up the supply chain in order to identify the source of the payments, let alone recover those payments. This is why this bill is critical. It is doing the right thing for people who are at risk of being left behind. This bill will encourage fairness and ensure consistency in the protection of the types of workers who can clearly be seen to have unique challenges and disadvantage throughout their workplaces. I commend this bill to the House. This is a bill which all Labor members should be proud of.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (12:40):  I also rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill 2012. It is a bill which is basically a long note to the parliament to admit failure, because this bill says that the much heralded so-called Fair Work Act has failed. It has completely failed this group of workers, presumably, because if the so-called Fair Work Act is so good and works so well why are we back here adding additional protections for another group of workers? I think the Prime Minister is on the record as saying:


I believe the Fair Work system is right.


…   …   …


We worked hard to get the balance right and I believe the Fair Work Act is right.


If the Fair Work Act was drafted well by the current Prime Minister and by members opposite, what are we doing today before this House adding additional protections? Why are we here?


We are here because they failed. They failed completely. They have misled the country. We are seeing it day in and day out. We are seeing strikes shut down coalmining in Queensland. We see strikes shut down wharves. We see strikes shut down airlines. We are seeing small businesses dragged through the good old days of 'go-away money' with adverse action claims and unfair dismissal claims. And now we are seeing this group of workers apparently being ripped off under the very system that members opposite claim is protecting the country so well and protecting the working people so well.


We know that to be true because those members opposite are not about protecting workers; they are about protecting their mates. They are about protecting their vested interests. They are about ensuring that their privileged position in the bargaining process continues, that they are legislated in, because they know most workers want to be out, and the stats tell you that story every day of the week. We know why workers are walking away from the trade union bosses in droves. Why wouldn't they, when people who are members of unions such as the HSU see their money, from their hard work, used up against the wall for the personal benefit of certain members—




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  Order!




Mr BRIGGS:
  and certain senior members of the union leadership.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr BRIGGS:
  You should be ashamed, Rob. You should be ashamed of the treatment of these workers.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I ask the honourable member for Mayo to resume his seat. I think I understand the honourable member for McEwen's point of order, so I ask him to resume his seat. I ask the member for Mayo to come back to the bill and to address the matters before the parliament. Thank you.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I will indeed continue to talk about the failure of the Fair Work Act and the reason that we are here. The reason we are here is the workers at the bottom end who genuinely need the protection of a union movement that is focused on protecting their rights and obligations under the system, because if people are being ripped off they should have recourse, they should have legal protection and they should have people who are willing to represent them. And there are many good unionists out there who work very hard to ensure that people have their rights pursued in an appropriate way.


In fact, the coalition, when in government, had specific provisions in this area because this area is obviously one which has had, in the past, difficulties. Therefore we believed that, like the building industry, this needed industry-specific legislation. I note the difference in approach by this government, which says you do not need industry-specific legislation for one group of workers when it comes to the building industry but you do when it comes to this industry and you do when it comes to their TWU mates. You need it in two industries, but not in the building industry. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, why is it that Labor members, the proud union officials that they are, have not spoken up about the disgraceful misuse of HSU credit cards? The Health Services Union represents the lowest-paid workers in our society. I ask you that question. 




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, direct relevance is one point of order, but I certainly think that the imputation that he is making against members of this House—and I would suggest that you listen very carefully to the accusation that he is making—is wrong. Of course, he is cowardly in doing so in here because he would not have the guts to do it outside.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member's point of order is taken. I ask the honourable member for Mayo to come back to the bill before the House and to address his remarks that way.




Mr BRIGGS:
  We know that the member for McEwen has been so strong in his outrage about the treatment of those poor workers and their hard-earned money by people whose behaviour is undoubtedly the most questionable in the history of the trade union movement—and there is a fair bit more to come on this one. Ultimately, what we see with this legislation is an admission of failure by a government that does not know what it is doing. The commander at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, knows it. He has been brought in to try and add some heavyweight gravitas to the ministry. I do not think the commander at the table actually comes from a union official background. I think he was a Labor mayor. So I am not sure that he will be 'bucketed up' with those who should be defending the HSU workers. In any event, what we see here is a bill that will ultimately put this industry at risk. That is the problem with this bill, and it is not just us but people in the industry who are saying that.


I draw the attention of the House to some concerns that have been expressed by people who work in this industry, who run these small businesses and who are trying to make their way. I will quote, with the indulgence of the House, from a letter by one of these people:


I am an emerging Australian Fashion Designer starting a label from home.


And good on her for being an entrepreneur. She continues:


I would like to draw to your attention the Fair Work Act and the Textile, Clothing, Footwear and Associated Industries 2010 (the TCFAI Award), Modern Award regime which defines me as an outworker, despite my 4 year degree in fashion from Ultimo TAFE. The current TCFAI Modern Award definition has a ""catch all"" definition where anyone working from home in the fashion industry is an OUTWORKER … yes, I can be considered an OUTWORKER if I sell to a boutique or a department store, because of the deeming provisions of the award.


This legislation is about ensuring that entrepreneurs do not exist, that independent contractors do not exist. They are all workers. They are all employees as defined by the law so they can, of course, be targeted by and brought into the union movement. That is what this legislation is about. We saw the same with the TWU bill that was debated in the House last week. This legislation is being brought in under the guise of safety and protection but it is really about getting rid of the definition of 'independent contractor', because the Labor Party has always hated it. They have always hated the independent contractor. They voted against the specific legislation in 2005. They have moved bill after bill in this place to continue to get rid of the definition of independent contractor in this place and in our country. We know that because this bill, putting aside that it is admitting that there is failure in the Fair Work Act, is designed to do exactly that.


I will continue with the letter from this hardworking entrepreneur, who is working from home trying to make her way in this industry. She says—




Mr Mitchell:
  Name them.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I will name them. If you want me to name them, I will name them when you name all those workers who have to pay Craig Thomson's bills. I will name them then. In the letter she says she is aware that the final form of the legislation deems all outworkers to be employees, 'including the National Employment Standards, superannuation and unfair dismissal laws'. She says:


As a start-up business, in the beginning it will be challenging to pay myself, never mind employ a 'maker/outworker' on a regular basis, and pay all these entitlements. Again this is unworkable and in trading in such an environment, I face prosecution in breach of the TCFAI Modern Award 2010. The risks are too great.


She continues:


I would like you and your government to consider this letter and make the necessary changes to allow me and other graduating & emerging Australian Fashion Designers making samples and small orders (with business turning over less than $100,000 per year) to apply for exemption to this onerous and impractical regime, as part of the Modern Awards Review 2012.


This is the problem. It all sounds great in theory to add additional protections, drag all these people in, get rid of the independent contractor label and make them all employees, but in doing so you will destroy the industry. You will destroy opportunities for these people to make their own way and to create their own opportunities in our economy. These people—the entrepreneurs and the small business people, people who are wanting to employ other Australians—should be encouraged to make the best of their opportunities. But the Labor Party will not hear of it, because that runs against how they want society to be, which is that you are all employees, you are all members of the union, even though people are walking away from it. Why wouldn't they walk away when they see the behaviour of senior union officials in this country, when they see the utter and absolute abuse of their money by senior leaders in this country? This bill should be opposed—




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I distinctly heard you on a number of occasions attempt to draw the member for Mayo back to the legislation which we are debating. The point of order is relevance. He is debating legislation from somewhere else, I am sure, but not the matters that are before the House. So I would ask you, if you could, to draw the member back to the legislation before the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Mayo will come back to the bill and address the matters before the House.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I have been. Indeed, I am very surprised that the member for Throsby has now entered the chamber, not knowing what has gone on in here for the last 15 minutes of a genuine contribution to this bill. We say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the House and to the Australian people: this bill is just another admission of failure by a government who likes to talk a lot but who has not delivered anywhere near its rhetoric. The Prime Minister said: 'I believe the fair work system is right. We worked hard to get the balance right and I believe the Fair Work Act is right.' If we had a fair work system operating as the Prime Minister said, we would not be debating this bill in this place today. We would be debating more substantial legislation dealing with genuine problems, such as Labor's deficit and Labor's mistreatment of our economy. This is a bad bill. It will add to the record of this government. They pretend to represent workers when all they do is represent the filthy trade union officials who are ripping off workers in our economy.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (12:52):  I once called the member for Mayo 'the Barbara Cartland of Australian politics' because of his romantic novel writing on the subject, but today we could call him 'the trash mag writer', because he basically spent 15 minutes growing his nose and telling stories that were not true. Remember, this is the member who complained that the TWU was soiling his clothes when he was writing the Work Choices act. That is where he goes back to. Going back to Work Choices is all he considers.


I have to confess that I know a little bit about outworkers. My mother was one. I was also a member of the footwear industry, very proudly, for five years. Those opposite have absolutely no idea about that industry and no idea about the working conditions of outworkers, because, I am tipping, they have never, ever seen one, let alone seen the work of making shoes and understood what has to be done and the hours that people get put on.


I am sure the member for Mayo is going back to have another glass of champagne, but I hope that the speaker is on in his office and that he can listen to the truth. The only time in the history of this country that those opposite ever stood up for workers was at National Textiles. 'What's National Textiles?' you might say. 'Who owned National Textiles?' Of course, it was the brother of John Howard, Stan Howard. That was the only time, when a company went out the door, that the coalition stood up for the workers of that company. Every other time, they wiped their hands. They have absolutely no interest in what happens to workers when companies go broke, unless of course it is the company of the brother of the former Prime Minister John Howard.


As I was listening today, there were two different emotions going through my head. There was laughter at the stories that were being told by the opposition and there was anger at the inability of the opposition to understand what they were talking about. We heard the member for McPherson. The biggest point she made was about the effect on businesses—not one concern for the people who are actually working in them.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  I'm sure you've never worked a day in your life either!


They admit that they look for labels and they do this and they do that, but they never show concern about how the items are made. They are never concerned about the people sitting at home working on them. The member for Higgins is over there yapping away. It is mainly women working in these industries, mainly those with English as a second language, with poor English skills—




Ms O'Dwyer:
  That's you!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Oh please, Mr Ed, please!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  Order! The honourable member for McEwen will not respond to interjections. I will deal with the interjections.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I will do my best, but it is sometimes awkward.


The opposition do not understand that most of the outworkers in the TCF industry are women with English as a second language and they work extremely hard. When I worked at Koala Shoes—it is getting to be a bit long ago now, when I think back to it—there were a large number of people who worked there who had just arrived in Australia. That was back in the days when we welcomed people to come to Australia. That would have been their first job. Quite often such people were treated very shabbily in those sorts of workplaces. I think back to when I was a kid and my mum was an outworker and she was packing shoes and a whole range of other things. She worked for a large automotive component manufacturer and her job was to put needles on speedos—and, let me tell you, that was the most boring thing you could ever do in your life. But that is the kind of thing people do, and they do it for very minimal pay and they work extremely hard.


This legislation is about protecting them, so they know that when they go to work they will get what we would consider a fair and reasonable value—a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It is not something that we should be mucking around with. We should be ensuring that people get paid properly for the work they do and the contribution they make to the Australian economy. This legislation protects some of our most vulnerable workers. It applies special provisions for TCF workers which ensure that outworkers employed are engaged under a secure, safe and fair system of work. Those words should be on everyone's lips. Our main goal should be to make sure that people have safe workplaces. The member for Mayo was rabbiting on about attacks on truck drivers, because he does not believe that they and their families should be entitled to a fair day's work in a safe and secure workplace. It is absolutely amazing, when the opposition put their silver spoons to the side of their mouths, what they start spouting about. They have never actually experienced these conditions.


There is a large textile and clothing place in Wangaratta. A quick discussion today revealed that the local member had never actually been there. Four hundred people are employed there and she has never walked in the door. Probably for them that is a great thing because they do not get to know her, but it is a sad thing that, while the members opposite spout how much they care and how much they worry about things, they do not go to places and see the people that make things. They are quite happy to sit there in their labels and spout off about their lovely shirts and shoes, but none of them have ever looked at how these things are made, the people that put them together and the conditions they work in. That is why we are very thankful to have people like the TCFU out there protecting people and making sure that their workplaces are safe and making sure that they get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.


This is an important bill that we should pass very speedily. We should not be mucking around with this. We should get this through and ensure that people who earn as little as $3 to $5 get protected so that, when they do the work and the goods get picked up by a supply chain of subcontractors, they can be assured that they will get paid. That is another big issue that seems to escape those opposite: the people who are doing the work are getting ripped off by not being paid. Usually, if they have got low English skills and they are working from home, it is very difficult to chase that up. They should be given the opportunity to ensure that when they do the work they get paid. That is one of the most important things out there. I am not by any stretch of the imagination saying that all employers are bad. There are many, many good companies that pay their workers fairly and should reap the benefits, but we have always got to make sure that those that do the wrong thing are followed up and workers are protected from them. As we know, with the Liberal government not everyone is a Stan Howard. That is a rare one—National Textiles. That is one of the most important things to remember: when it comes to protection of workers these guys opposite have absolutely no care, no idea and no plan to help them apart from bringing back their Work Choices, the great fabled god they look at when they think about stripping away the wages and conditions of people and trying to make us compete with China. Well, it is not going to happen, because our living standards are higher—and they should be higher. We should ensure that people are paid properly and that they have a safe workplace. With those few comments, I wish this bill a speedy passage.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (13:00):  Unfortunately, I had to listen to the contribution by the member for McEwen. I would encourage him to stay in the chamber and listen to my contribution. He mentioned just before that he wanted to understand what impact this legislation would have on individual workers. I will outline the circumstances and the impact that it will have. As somebody who is very concerned about jobs and about having a productive economy, I believe it is incumbent upon us in this place to argue for good policy.


Unfortunately, however, the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill 2012 is not such a case. This bill is simply an expression by this government that the Fair Work Act that it brought into place has failed. By their own admission, in bringing forward this bill they have said that the Fair Work Act has failed, that it is deficient, that they are required to bring forward this bill. They do so because they have been waging a war against independent contractors. This is something that is deep within the marrow of the bones of those who sit opposite. They do not support independent contractors and they are progressively trying to legislate them away.


We have already seen in this place that the government has brought forward legislation which was passed recently with respect to independent contractors in the transport industry. This was, again, an expression of how the Fair Work Act is not working. They brought this forward and it was designed to bring independent contractors under the purview of the union movement by classing them as employees. That is what this bill will do as well to so many people in the textile, clothing and footwear industry.


What will this bill do? It will extend the operation of most provisions of the Fair Work Act to contract outworkers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, deeming all outworkers to be employees. Why is it a problem to deem independent contractors as employees? The government says that this in some miraculous way is going to eliminate sweatshops and safeguard those who are supposedly vulnerable. Yet the evidence does not bear this out. A person in the industry who will be affected by this bill, Rita Tu Lan Ly, recently submitted a letter to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. She said:


I am a very capable, professional machinist who is running a successful, flexible, profitable business from my own home, which allows me to be with my children and meet my family commitments as well as do the work in my own time and to be paid well. I see myself very much as a contractor not an outworker. I feel I have the support and capability to run my own business just as IT specialists, hairdressers, bookkeepers and all tradespeople along with many consultants such as psychologists, accountants, business and educational advisers do. I am feeling there is an issue of discrimination in this particular case as my profession—


and that is what it is; it is a profession—


as a machinist isolates my role away from all others who are allowed to work from home. I believe the amendments to the Fair Work Act currently under discussion are unbalanced, inconsistent and extremely unfair.


She goes on to say:


I am currently paid above the award and work for ethical companies and like my current conditions. I do not wish to be an employee. I want to remain an independent contractor just as many other professionals are allowed under the same act. Why is it that only the people working in the textile, clothing and footwear industry are discriminated against? I have serious concerns that these new amendments will harm me greatly. It will restrict my ability to operate as an independent and autonomous business. I will not be able to claim business expenses for my phone, electricity, depreciation of machinery etc—it's unfair. I have my own ABN and pay my taxes. I negotiate my own hours and have built professional and ethical relationships with companies I feel happy to work with and for.


If the amendments as suggested by Fair Work Australia in relation to our industry are passed, I would be unemployed and this would then be a further burden on the government as I would have no choice but to apply for assistance through Centrelink.


For the member for McEwen, those are the words of somebody who works in this industry, who currently has a job and who is making a contribution to our country, paying their taxes and going about their business lawfully. In her own words, she says that this bill will discriminate against her and her business and put her out of business. Why is it that this government is so determined to talk the talk of jobs and yet discriminate against independent contractors?


These people want to protect vulnerable people from those who would exploit them. Make no mistake: we on this side of the chamber do not condone abuse of power or exploitation of vulnerable working people. On this we can all agree: that is not what is being brought before the House today. The government says that the bill will have a fairly limited impact, that it is really just going to affect and attack those people who are doing the wrong thing, but this is not the case. I quote from another submission to the Senate committee by Richard Thomas, who said:


Limited impact is a massive understatement. Concern stems from the fact that a complete and unworkable company restructure is required to treat independent contractors as employees, failure to do so will result in legal action instigated by the TCFUA. The only viable option that remains is to close down. This will leave many, whom are not vulnerable and happy with their chosen arrangements, without work. In order to protect vulnerable outworkers, the legislation will destroy the lives of all the outworkers, vulnerable or not.


Even if factories can somehow comply with the laws in treating outworks as employees—sweatshops will hence be unaffected. In instances where people are exploited nothing will change. The 'middleman' outworker will be paid as an employee rather than a company and then continue to exploit the vulnerable as before.


The people who choose to do the wrong thing will continue to do the wrong thing. We know that. This legislation will do nothing to fix that but it will penalise a number of people who are lawfully and correctly going about their business in their small businesses and making a contribution to this country.


The government recently made a lot of arguments in this place about how they did not want to see special treatment for particular industries. That is why they said the Australian building and construction commission needed to be abolished. They demanded that everyone be treated the same and that the ABCC be abolished. They said there should be a one-size-fits-all approach on the issue of industrial relations. They said that those in the construction industry were discriminated against. Yet they have brought forward legislation in this place that will discriminate against people in the clothing, footwear and textile industries. The hypocrisy of this government knows no bounds.


This legislation also fails to understand the seasonal and fashion nature of the industry. It does not understand that there needs to be flexibility in the industry and that so many in this industry rely on a pool of very specialised contractors. By classifying them all as employees, flexibility will be removed, flexibility that is so critical to this industry. Another submission to the Senate inquiry from a company which employs a number of people in this industry said:


Due to the wide variety of Fabrics many different machines and machinists are required to complete the sewing of a garment. One contractor will specialize in certain garments and using certain machines only. Therefore a pool of many contractors is required to complete various orders. Many contractors will work for a number of factories to generate their required turnover. One factory alone will not be able to provide consistent work.


Further to this the fashion industry is highly seasonal, within a year there can be many quiet and busy times, determined by the clients, not the factories. A factory has no guaranteed work, therefore to provide minimum hours to contractors on a weekly basis or up to 5 weeks notice of termination … is not possible.


There is a fundamental lack of understanding of the nature of this industry but that does not concern this government. They are too busy waging an ideological battle against independent contractors so that they may bring them within the reach of the union movement in order that the contractors, too, can pay their union dues which can then contribute to the expense accounts and credit card payments made by those officials, some of whom currently sit in this place.




Dr Leigh:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the honourable member is straying far from the bill and casting unwarranted imputations on other members of the chamber. If she wants to do that there are substantive motions through which she is able to do so.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The honourable member for Higgins will address the matters before the House.




Ms O'DWYER:
  I was addressing the matters before the House, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know it is very uncomfortable for those opposite to be reminded that union leaders have a responsibility to their members. It is a responsibility they should take seriously. 


If you want to talk about the abuse of individuals who are vulnerable and who pay their dues you need look no further than the HSU. Yet we have heard nothing from the government stating that they have any problem whatsoever with how this has occurred. I simply restate in the remaining time available to me on this bill that this is yet another expression by the government to show that their Fair Work Act has failed. This is an expression by this government that they are going to continue to wage a war against independent contractors. This is a government that is not concerned about jobs unless they are the jobs of their union mates. It is very unfortunate that we have a government so concerned with their own vested interests that they would put those before the national interest.


We believe that it is important for people to be paid properly for the work that they do. We believe that it is important for people, in whatever industry they are involved in, to have a safe, secure and fair working environment. But this bill certainly does not achieve that. It will enforce a discrimination against those who are independent contractors, people who are making a significant contribution to our country. It is yet again a demonstration of the multiple failures of the Labor government.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:15):  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Bill. The government is to be commended for introducing this legislation. I have a great deal of personal experience with this sector, having brought actions on behalf of the Textile Workers Union and many underpaid outworkers before the Federal Court over many years. After doing that for over a decade I can say with some certainty that pretty much every supposed factual comment made in the contributions from those on the opposition benches was wrong.


It is all well and good to talk about independent contractors but I have lost count of the number of times that I have encountered a worker who has been told that they will not get any work unless they get an NBN and pass themselves as an independent contractor. They can talk about people working up at the high end, but it is not at all uncommon to see a shirt that cost $200 selling in Burke Street and find that the person who made it was paid $2. With all that context, what is the worker going to do? The worker often finds themselves at the mercy of a middleman. If they stand up for their rights they simply do not get work in the future. I must say that in all my time working in this sector I never once saw a Howard government inspector ever set foot inside an outworker's home where they were doing work to ensure that that worker was getting super, work cover and annual leave.


We heard some outstanding comments about how this is going to destroy not only the industry but also outworkers. I will hold the member for Higgins and the member for Mayo to that. I think that we will find that it will not destroy the sector. But we will see ethical clothing made in this country. I will let the remarks that I have made many times before, both here and elsewhere, speak for my strong support for this bill. I commend the union, the church groups, the ethical clothing groups and the brave home workers who have had the courage to campaign for many years to bring this bill into being. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (13:19):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2):


(1)   Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit the table item, substitute:





2. Schedule 1




1 January 2013




1 January 2013










(2)   Schedule 1, item 61, page 25 (after line 10), after section 789EA, insert:




789EB  TCF outworkers not to be worse off



(1)   This Part applies in relation to a TCF outworker only to the extent to which, in a particular respect, the outworker would not be worse off.


(2)   A reference in subsection (1) to this Part includes a reference to any regulations made for the purposes of this Part.


(3)   The regulations may prescribe:


   (a)   what a particular respect is for the purposes of subsection (1); or


   (b)   the circumstances in which a TCF outworker would or would not be worse off for the purposes of subsection (1).


The first amendment relates to no worker being worse off. While we understand that there are numerous agendas—especially union agendas—being incorporated into this legislation, I restate the point that if amendments are required to the Fair Work Act they should be included with the review of the implementation of the Fair Work Act, something that is ongoing, something that is presumably quite comprehensive because it has been ongoing for a while and something that, when it comes back to this parliament, will include any problems that may exist as a result of this bill.


The amendment that no worker be worse off addresses the concerns of many outworkers—and I refer the government to the submissions that have been made to the inquiry that they so callously guillotined—that they will be worse off as a result of this amendment. The then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard, now Prime Minister, promised that no worker would be worse off as a result of the Fair Work Act. Given that this is an amendment to the Fair Work Act we in the coalition are seeking to enshrine that promise within the bill. But we also wish to allay the concerns that have been raised with the coalition and also with the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee about the fact that workers may very well be worse off after this legislation is implemented. I remind members of the House of that promise that no worker would be worse off. Literally thousands of Australian workers are now being ripped off under the so-called modern awards. The flaws are being made obvious daily despite the ironclad promise from Labor that no worker would be worse off.


I ask the minister and the government to show some courage on this matter and accept that, in responding so energetically to the union agenda around the dwindling number of members of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, and in seeking to characterise people who actually are independent contractors as employees—something that offends the principles of the tax act, offends the principles of natural justice and is nonsense when considered in the context of this bill—the perverse outcome might very well be that workers will be worse off.


We stand by the most vulnerable and marginalised workers, who may be working in workplaces that have been described in the context of this bill. Those workers and their circumstances should never become a political football in this place. Those workers and their circumstances should be protected. Women who take an interest in the fashion supply chain in this country certainly understand that we want the clothes that we wear with pride—because they are made in Australia—not to be manufactured under conditions that have been described in media outlets from time to time, and which are entirely offensive.


I remind people in this place that the examples brought to the table in the context of this debate are already out of order and illegal, and are against state and federal legislation and the Fair Work Act itself. We stand by those workers and we will be moving an amendment that no worker will be worse off.


The second amendment concerns the time frame. If the government wants to jump into the process of examining and possibly amending its own Fair Work Act—and on the surface of it you would think was a sensible thing to do because if you implement an act and make major and extraordinary changes to it you should review how those changes are playing out in the system—then the government should incorporate the changes it thinks are so necessary that it has brought this legislation into the review process of the modern awards and into the review of the Fair Work Act. We therefore say that we want to delay the commencement of any legislation passed today that allows for the completion of the review into the Fair Work Act, and the government's response, prior to the commencement of this legislation. We believe the provisions of this bill should be considered only as part of that review, along with any changes proposed in any final and publicly available report resulting from that review, prior to commencement.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (13:22):  I wish to voice my disappointment and concern at the way this government has trivialised the importance of successful businesspeople in this country, particularly Gina Rinehart, Clive Palmer and Twiggy Forrest. It is as if being successful in this country is open to being scorned, that success in this country will only invite the pettiness of Labor governments to trivialise these achievements. Well, to you I say: shame! It is as if being successful in this country means that this Labor government automatically has the right to attack what is beyond its capacity. It is easy to attack and ridicule what can never be yours—a profitable, sizable business. You detest it because you detest success. The ALP scorns success because you have never tasted it yourself. You have always relied on the sector to provide employment, from which Labor prospers. Australia needs modern-day business pioneers, just as we needed Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson. We need modern-day pioneers to invest in this nation and we need to recognise them. If you take anything from my statements today, take this: Labor's crippling taxes and cost-of-living pressures are hurting families and businesses in my electorate of Wright. You scorn what you do not understand, and you do not understand this economy and the pressures that exists for businesses out there at the moment. When will you learn that you cannot tax and legislate a nation into prosperity?

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (14:00):  My question is to the Treasurer. At the time of the last budget the Treasurer promised Australians that the deficit would be $23 billion. It is now expected to be at least $37 billion, a deterioration of $14 billion. At the last budget the Treasurer promised the government's net debt would peak at $107 billion. It is now expected to be at least $136 billion, a deterioration of at least $29 billion. Why should we believe that this year's promises on budget night will be any more believable than last year's promises?

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:01):  I would like to make a couple of points. We have a AAA credit rating from the three major financial credit rating agencies globally for the first time in our history. We came through the global financial crisis in better shape than any other advanced economy. We have a strong economy. But, of course, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, the floods in Queensland and events in Europe, there has been a dramatic impact on our budget bottom line.


Those opposite come into this House and talk down our economy and pretend that the global financial crisis and the global recession never happened. That is what they pretend. They pretend that there has been no impact on our budget revenues, which have been written down by $140 billion over five years. They want the public of Australia to somehow believe that that never happened. Well, the fact is that it did happen.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Treasurer will return to the substance of the question.




Mr SWAN:
  The consequence of that is that we have been running a deficit. But we have been putting in place strict fiscal discipline to come back to surplus. This has been recognised by the OECD and most particularly by the IMF, who have said that the Australian government's fiscal discipline it is an example for the rest of the world. While the IMF, the OECD, the World Bank and other agencies recognise that in the circumstances no other government in the Western world has done a better job than Australia, those opposite come into this House and trash our economy and our public finances with questions like the one we have heard today.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Treasurer will return to the substance of the question asked by the honourable member for North Sydney.




Mr SWAN:
  I am coming to the substance of the question. The reason we have a deficit is that revenues have been written down. It is not because, as those opposite allege, we are somehow out there on a spending spree. We have supported employment and small business in our economy. We have done it with a responsible fiscal policy that has given us an economy that is the envy of the world. Everybody on this side of the House is proud of our employment performance and is sick of the trash talking about our economy. (Time expired)

The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer is aware that he is not being relevant. He will become relevant.




Mr SWAN:
  Mr Speaker, it was a question about our surplus and it was a question about the profile of a particular piece of expenditure across the forward estimates. What I am saying is that we have strict fiscal discipline, which is bringing our budget back to surplus. That stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. To fill that crater they want to put up company taxes by 1½ per cent.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:47):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately—That this House calls on the Prime Minister to apologise because in breaking her promise not to introduce a carbon tax she is compounding the world’s highest electricity prices with the world’s biggest carbon tax.


Standing orders must be suspended because the election in Queensland on Saturday will be a referendum on the Prime Minister's carbon tax. It will be a referendum on political leaders who do not tell the truth. It will be a referendum on political leaders without honour and principle. That is why standing orders should be suspended. This Prime Minister should not scurry out of the chamber to hide in the whip's office. She should face this chamber; she should face this motion. The voters of Queensland will be passing judgment on her tax and her government as well as on Premier Bligh and the Queensland government. This is why standing orders should be suspended.


Standing orders should be suspended because Australians pay the world's highest power prices already. Our power prices are 70 per cent higher than those in the United States. They are 130 per cent higher than those in Canada. And it is going to get much worse under the Prime Minister's carbon tax, which she will not defend in this parliament. She scurried out to hide in the whip's office rather than stay to defend her carbon tax in this parliament on the eve of the Queensland election.


The Energy Users Association—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—told us this week that power prices had already risen by 40 per cent. They are your constituents, Madam Deputy Speaker, and they have paid 40 per cent more on the power bills every quarter since this government came into office. Now those bills are going to rise by another 20 per cent under the carbon tax thanks to this Prime Minister, who is too frightened to face the parliament on this subject. That is why standing orders should be suspended.


This Prime Minister is making a bad situation worse with a carbon tax based on a lie. The voters of Queensland know that six days before the last election this Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' The voters of Queensland know that. They have not forgotten; they remember. And this Prime Minister has not forgotten, either—that is why she is hiding out in the whip's office rather than facing this motion for the suspension of standing orders, which should take priority over all other business in this House.


The situation of the consumers of Queensland is getting desperate and it will only get worse because of this government's carbon tax. Already the consumers of Queensland pay power prices that are higher than those in every single country in the European Union. The consumers of Queensland pay power prices that are higher than those in every single state of the United States. And it is going to get much worse under the carbon tax which this Prime Minister said would never happen under the government that she leads. That is why standing orders should be suspended.


The Prime Minister says that it is all right, because people want a clean energy future. Tell that to the pensioners of Queensland facing a 20 per cent increase in their power bills. Tell that to the people who ride the bus, who are facing an increase in their fares. Tell that to the ratepayers of Queensland facing an increase in their rates. Supposedly, it is all about a clean energy future. It is not. If you look at the government's modelling, under the government's carbon tax, our emissions are 578 million tonnes a year and are projected to be 621 million tonnes a year with the carbon tax. So electricity prices go up by 20 per cent and emissions go up too. What a completely fraudulent statement that is from the Prime Minister. That is why standing orders must be suspended.


It is all very well for the Prime Minister to come into this parliament and play the class war card. The people of Queensland want real answers and they want good policies. They want to get rid of this carbon tax and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister comes into this parliament and, yes, we know her words attack billionaires—people who succeed—but her policies attack the decent, ordinary families of Queensland. Her policies attack the forgotten families of Queensland and aren't they waiting to pass judgment? Their baseball bats are not there for Anna Bligh; their baseball bats are there for the Prime Minister hiding out in the whips office. That is why standing orders must be suspended.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will return to the suspension.




Mr ABBOTT:
  The voters of Queensland are not mugs.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will return to the suspension before the House.




Mr ABBOTT:
  We need to suspend standing orders to give the Prime Minister a chance to explain, on the eve of the election in Queensland, just what she meant when she told the member for Griffith that she was not going to challenge him. We have a Prime Minister who was not straight with the member for Griffith about the prime ministership, she was not straight with the people about the carbon tax, she was not straight with the member for Denison about pokies and she was not straight with this parliament about Senator Carr. Standing orders need to be suspended because this Prime Minister is suffering. I think she really is suffering. I am trying to be charitable. I think she has a new form of clinical disorder—TDD: truth deficit disorder—but there is a cure. This is why standing orders should be suspended.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will be silent. The Leader of the Opposition will sit down. If you are not going to let me be heard, you will sit down. I am in the chair and I am trying to get your attention. I am going to ask you to withdraw and return to the suspension.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am happy to withdraw. There is a cure and this is why standing orders must be suspended.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will go to the suspension and will get off this attack, or I will sit him down.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It is very important that we suspend standing orders, because this Prime Minister needs to make amends to this parliament, to the people of Australia and to the people of Queensland for her words before the last election:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


She needs to make amends and that is what my motion gives her the chance to do. Imagine if the Prime Minister had gone to the last election saying, 'Yes, there will be a carbon tax under the government I lead.' Image if Premier Bligh had gone to the last election saying, 'Yes, there will be privatisation under the government I lead,' and, 'Yes, there will be a petrol tax under the government I lead.'


This is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister needs to be given the chance to atone for this breach of faith with the Australian people, because—



Mr Danby interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a).



The member for Melbourne Ports then left the chamber.





Mr ABBOTT:
  I am trying to give this Prime Minister a chance, belatedly, to apologise. That is why standing orders ought to be suspended. If she does not take this chance, if she does not apologise, the people of Queensland and Australia will not just conclude that you cannot trust this Prime Minister, they will conclude that the Labor brand is toxic right around this country.


Standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister must stop hiding out in the whips office. She must come into this chamber and explain herself.


The people of Australia are waiting to pass their verdict. We do not have a federal election but we certainly do have a state election. And isn't the whole of Australia waiting for this!

It is important that standing and sessional orders be suspended because the most central promise that the Prime Minister made in the last election was, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Then, within weeks of the election—not months, not years, but weeks—she broke that promise. For that reason she must apologise. She said one thing to get elected, to fool the Australian people, and she chose to do the opposite to save her political skin.


This Prime Minister's epitaph will be, 'Here lies Julia Gillard, lying to the end.' Or: 'Here lies Julia Gillard. She chose to mislead when the truth would do.'




Mr Melham:
  I rise on a point of order. The member should be required to withdraw in relation to those matters. He is using a mechanism to undermine the existing standing orders, to disparage a member of this House, the current Prime Minister. It is unparliamentary.



The SPEAKER:  Order! We are debating a motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. The comments made were inappropriate. The honourable member will withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  Mr Speaker, I withdraw any imputation from the word I used, but I was not using it in the way that has been suggested by the member. But I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will withdraw unreservedly.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw unreservedly, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, do you know what the Prime Minister also had the gall to say before the last election? She said 'The Labor Party is the party of truth telling.' We go out into the electorate and make promises. Do you know what we would do in government? We would keep them. We gave our word to the Australian people in the election—and this is a government that prides itself on delivering election promises.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will return to the substance of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition.




Mr PYNE:
  Exactly, Mr Speaker, and that is why standing orders must be suspended, to allow the Prime Minister to apologise to the House for making these promises before the last election and then breaking them when she got elected. In fact, she not only broke them but trumpets them as great successes. She told the press gallery on Tuesday that they had said she would never get a carbon tax in, but she had done it. She now wants to be congratulated for breaking these promises. She wants to wear them as a wreath of victory, as a wreath of success. She mocks the Australian people by saying things before the election, fooling them into voting for her, because nobody believes she would be in The Lodge today if she had told the truth before the election. She now mocks the Australian people by expecting to be congratulated, by being triumphed through the streets of Canberra for breaking this promise and introducing a carbon tax.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will withdraw his accusation of untruthfulness.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker. I am sure the Australian people think this Prime Minister tells the truth on a daily basis. What concerns me and why the suspension of standing orders should be carried is how can the Prime Minister simply disown her words? How can she calmly and so ruthlessly and without any regret simply refuse to accept the statement that she made before the election and that she has broken? When her own unambiguous words are put to her, she personally denigrates the questioner. That is why the Australian people have no faith in this Prime Minister. It no longer matters what this Prime Minister says—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will return to the substance of the motion to suspend standing orders.




Mr PYNE:
  Mr Speaker, standing orders must be suspended, because the Prime Minister should apologise. We now have a situation in this country where, whatever the Prime Minister says, whatever she tells the Australian people, they simply do not believe her. She has no credibility—she has betrayed the trust of the Australian people and, on Saturday, the verdict the Queensland people will deliver will be a verdict on this Prime Minister and this carbon tax.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:02):  We have just seen, if we needed any reminder, why the Leader of the Opposition is simply not up to the highest office in this land. What we saw when the Leader of the Opposition said across the chamber that the Prime Minister and I had targets on our foreheads—from the political party that quite proudly introduced John Howard's gun laws—was an outrage. Earlier on today we saw a Mark Riley moment from the Leader of the Opposition directed at the chair. Day after day we see that he simply does not have the temperament required of a Prime Minister. 


That is why we should not suspend standing orders, because we in this chamber have some big tasks ahead of us. There are challenges ahead—the economy, the environment and social policy. There are a range of issues that we could discuss and that we should be discussing. Yet what we have had, on 50 separate occasions, is the Leader of the Opposition having a premeditated suspension of standing orders attempt, shutting down question time. That is telling the Australian people that he is not interested in trying to hold the government to account on the issues of the day.


The Leader of the Opposition is not interested in debating the economy or jobs. Did we have a single question today about the announcement by Holden, which is significant not just for manufacturing jobs but for all those who depend upon the manufacturing industry? There was not a word. The opposition shut down question time after six questions. In the 43rd Parliament we have already lost 27 hours of question time as a result of their shutting down question time. That is enough time to watch all the Harry Potter movies—all 18 hours—and the Lord of the Rings trilogy as well—another nine hours. It is enough time to fly to Los Angeles and back and it is enough time to complete a course in basic Spanish or Italian. Those opposite have wasted 27 hours and more than 230 questions have been abandoned. No other opposition since Federation have said: 'We don't care about question time. We'll move motions to suspend standing orders day after day, because we're not interested in holding the government to account, we're not interested in debating the economy, we're not interested in debating jobs and we're not interested in debating climate change.'


They are condemned by their own actions, because it is all about the politics. That is what this motion today is about and that is why we should reject it. It is all about cheap political point-scoring and there is no line that is uncrossable by the Leader of the Opposition, as shown by his comment 'targets on foreheads'.


We know there are consequences behind that sort of language. We saw it in the United States last year. We should not hear, from the Leader of the Opposition, the sort of provocative language used by extremists. But, once again, there is no line incapable of being crossed. Perhaps we should not be too harsh, because he is struggling. He said himself, about losing office: 'We all need grief counselling. It's like a bereavement. Not as bad as losing a child or a spouse, but up there with losing a parent.'



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion for suspension.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During the Leader of the Opposition's contribution, and my contribution, a great deal of time was used by the government to take up our time—



The SPEAKER:  The member will explain his point of order.




Mr Pyne:
  We were asked to withdraw statements which I would not have regarded as offensive, but I was happy to withdraw them. The Leader of the House has made a quite unpleasant imputation against the Leader of the Opposition and therefore he should be asked to withdraw it.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat; otherwise, he will join his colleague outside.




Mr ALBANESE:
  What we see in here day after day is motions for suspension of standing orders based on spurious reasons. Today we have it yet again. House of Representatives Practice makes it very clear that suspensions of standing orders happen when there is an urgent item before the parliament, when there is some momentum—not worked out at eight o'clock in the morning, typed out, presigned and brought in here day after day. In the past fortnight we have had this motion for suspension, motions for suspensions demanding a royal commission and motions for suspensions over police investigations and over issues of guns on the streets of New South Wales. We have had all sorts of bizarre attempts at suspension. I am only surprised that we did not get a motion for suspension blaming the government for Ian Thorpe's failure to make the London Olympics! We have had everything else because everything is the responsibility of the government and the responsibility of the carbon price—or perhaps the CIA and the connection between the two. 


In these motions to suspend standing orders we have an attempt to distract from their failure to engage in the real debates, their failure to engage in debates on the economy, their failure to debate issues of climate change and its substance. We saw today the Leader of the Opposition trying to distance himself from some of the rhetoric of those who were demonstrating outside—not a demonstration against the carbon price but a demonstration called the 'global warming hoax rally'. They were the same people who demonstrated outside my electorate office.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The reason we should not support this motion is that we might have got a question about that from those opposite. They might have asked, 'Why didn't the minister for climate change go outside and have a chat with the global warming hoax people?' He might have been able to get a question. We might have asked him if they did not. 


We are quite happy to debate issues of substance and not to engage in this nonsense day after day, because when you get into issues of substance you actually see how little those opposite stand for. You see the extreme rhetoric that we saw today. You see the connections that they have with the bizarre behaviour of those outside—Clive Palmer and the CIA-Greens conspiracy that is going on. You see the associations with Lord Monckton,  Mick Patel and others like them. That is why standing orders should not be suspended.


What we want to debate in this House is issues of substance. Earlier today we had a vote trying to shut down the parliament rather than deal with issues of financial advisers. A standard procedural motion was put on the blues that we move at the end of every session. Never before has it been divided upon by those opposite. Never before has it been voted against. I have been in this place for 16 years and it has never been voted against. But of course there is nothing that those opposite are not prepared to say no to.


At the start of this session the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition said we would have an economic debate. We should not suspend standing orders—so that we can continue to engage in these economic issues, including the financial advisers bill, which is up—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.



Mr Albanese interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  No. The Leader of the House will be able to seek indulgence after the question has been put. The time allotted for this debate has expired. Indulgence is not given. The question is that the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition for the suspension of standing and sessional orders be agreed to.

During 2011, the Department of Veterans' Affairs conducted an open tender process for booked car arrangements when travelling for approved medical treatment. Over 250 preferred tenderers were selected and these were announced during February. The number of contracted taxi and hire car providers has, in fact, been increased. I would invite the member for Macarthur to contact the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who will arrange for the specific matter he raised to be investigated.

The SPEAKER
 (15:30):  I present report No. 49 of the Selection Committee relating to the consideration of bills. The report will be printed in today’s Hansard. Copies of the report have been placed on the table.




The report read as follows—





Report relating to private Members' business and the consideration of bills introduced 19 to 22 March 2012



1. The committee met in private session on 21 and 22 March 2012.


2. The committee determined that the following referrals of bills to committees be made—


Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry:


Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: Concern that Australia will lose its place as the premium supplier of wheat to our two biggest competitor countries Canada and the USA, both of which have quality assurance processors with exports.


Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade:


Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: Concern over the international implications of the bill which have been expressed by Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea in their submissions to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry.


Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications:


Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012;


Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012;


Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012;


Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2012; and


Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: An initial draft of the Coastal Trading Bill was available for comment just prior to Christmas. Serious deficiencies were found with the original bill so a second draft was released for comment, together with the other bills in the package, in March. An extremely short consultation period was proposed. Two weeks later the bill has been introduced so it is unlikely that any of the concerns raised in the consultation process would have been incorporated into the bill. As such, the committee should consider the impact of the bills on the Australian shipping industry to determine whether they will have their desired effect, that is, to revitalise the Australian shipping industry and increase the number of Australian flagged vessels. Additionally, if the package is deficient the Coalition may look to formulating amendments.


3. The committee recommends that the following items of private Members' business listed on the Notice Paper be voted on:

As required by standing order 46, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Chifley, namely:


The urgent need for responsible fiscal management in the upcoming budget to deliver real reforms for working people.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (15:34):  I am pleased that we are discussing this matter of public importance today because it is critical for a whole range of reasons. We at this point in time are gearing up and the next time we come back here we will be discussing the federal budget. That federal budget will be delivered at a time when there is global uncertainty about the state of the economy. A few years ago, as a nation we were confronted by one of the worst economic circumstances in 75 years in the shape of the global financial crisis, where economies around the world were freezing up as a result of financial systems and where people simply did not trust each other with money. They did not trust each other in terms of lending money. As the banking system started to feel the reverberations of that, we saw in our case—particularly, for example, in the construction industry—projects faltering and not going ahead, and a serious concern about what would happen with jobs.


But, despite all that, as a result of the quick, thorough moves taken by this government that ensured that jobs would not be lost, we have now come out of it with solid growth. The economy is on track to grow at trend this year. We have an unemployment rate that is the envy of the world. It is 5.2 per cent here compared to about 10.7 per cent in Europe. In some parts of the world there is up to 20 per cent unemployment and large numbers of youth particularly, who are seeing the best years of their lives waste away because they are simply unable to find work. Here we have been able to bottle inflation, with underlying inflation sitting squarely in the Reserve Bank's target band and a cash rate sitting at 4.25 per cent, which is incredible when you consider in the 11 years that those opposite were in government how long they were able to even get that cash rate. It was about six months. Six months of 11 years is about as good as it got for those opposite. We have 4.25 per cent.


The Treasurer mentioned today—and it has been mentioned on a number of occasions—that when you look at how much investment is in the pipeline you will see that there is $455 billion in resources alone. The other great thing is that we have very low net debt. It is less than a 10th of the levels across major advanced economies. We will return the budget to surplus while keeping the tax to GDP ratio lower than the level that it reached at its peak when those opposite were on this side of the House. It is probably worth noting again that, when those opposite were sitting here, tax as a percentage of GDP was about 24 per cent; now, under us, it is down to 21 per cent.




Mr Fletcher:
  Why don't you look at expenditure as a percentage of GDP? That's a different story!




Mr HUSIC:
  Despite the impact of the ongoing turbulence that I mentioned earlier, our public finance is the strongest in the world. Let us go back to net debt. I heard the member for Bradfield interject. If you compare net debt and expenditure—let us look at net debt.



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Berowra and the member for Bradfield ought to know better.




Mr HUSIC:
  Net debt is expected to peak at 8.9 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. That, as I said, is less than one-tenth of the average net debt of major advanced economies, which is some 92.9 per cent of GDP. We will return to surplus light years ahead of major advanced economies.


Let us look at expenditure: through MYEFO we delivered a further $11.5 billion in new savings through spending cuts, building further on the $100 billion of savings across four budgets. Again, our record of fiscal discipline is there to be seen and has been endorsed by the international community. Our discipline has seen us get AAA credit ratings from all three global ratings agencies. That was never achieved by those opposite. They would have loved to have got it, but they never achieved it. 


The IMF, the RBA and the global ratings agencies continue to back the strength of our position, that we will be getting back to surplus in 2012-13. Our fiscal settings have been endorsed by the IMF. Jorg Decressin, of the IMF, told ABC Radio National: 'where you have these strong investment plans in the pipeline, where the growth prospects are still quite good, this strikes me as appropriate.' That is the result of our being able to navigate our way through the worst economic circumstances in 75 years. We have seen jobs grow at a faster rate than anywhere else in the world, our overall growth rate is fantastic, we have bottled inflation and we have got net debt lower. We see the benefits.


What does that mean for my neck of the woods? Look at the types of things we have been able to achieve for my community in the course of the last few years. In my electorate unemployment is still stubbornly high and has been for years. There are a number of reasons for that: there are students who leave school way earlier than they should. They have decided that they will not go to university and so drop out of school. They get a job quickly, but are among the first to suffer whenever there are economic contractions. We are trying to build in students a personal bank of skills and we are doing that in a number of ways. I have been proud to see a number of trade training centres open up in my neck of the woods. Trade training centres open up education pathways for students who are necessarily interested in staying longer at school and who might otherwise have placed themselves in a vulnerable position for the future. 


Earlier this year, we announced the investment of $1 million into a new trade training centre in Mount Druitt for Chifley College Senior Campus. This is part of an overall $2.5 billion program to help build schools and upgrade trade training facilities and comes on top of the $15 million spent in the Chifley electorate alone on a trade training centre for Doonside and Evans high schools, which, I was pleased to see, was opened by the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer. A trade training centre was opened last year at Tyndale Christian school. Loyola Senior High School, in Mount Druitt, has always had a strong tradition of providing students who do not want to go on to university with opportunities to learn a trade. The trade training centre at the school, which I toured recently, and which the member for Kingsford Smith came out and saw, is very close to being opened. It will include an automotive centre and cater for electrical apprenticeships, hospitality and hairdressing.


These centres match skills that are required in the local area, as advised, for example, by industry groups such as the National Electrical Contractors Association. These groups are working hand in glove with schools such as Loyola to make sure that we have schools that can train people up for jobs that are waiting for them. You cannot do that if your budget finances are not in order. You cannot do it if your values do not look at what will best help people on the ground, particularly in Western Sydney. That is the case whether it be through building trade training centres or, for example, setting up homes for vulnerable Australians who live in my area. 


We have built 259 new homes under the Social Housing Initiative; they are providing safe and secure accommodation for my community's most vulnerable people. These are people who sleep in cars, with friends or with family. Over the course of the last few years we have been able to build new homes for these vulnerable people. We have also ensured that about 30,000 people in my electorate who earn under $37,000 a year will pay no tax on superannuation. That will help hardworking people such as mums who might be working part time, contract cleaners, shop assistants, childcare workers, hairdressers and aged-care and disability workers. All these people on low incomes, because of the low-income superannuation contribution, will not pay tax on their superannuation. If they currently pay up to $500 a year in tax, they will save more for their retirement. Again, these are good things that are a result of the financial management and fiscal discipline that we have demonstrated.


On top of that, we have been able to see 1,000 former students take up places in 2012 to work as GP registrars in hospitals and doctors' surgeries in urban and rural areas across the country. The Minister for Health visited the Chifley electorate recently to announce that initiative. In an area where we experience workplace shortages, where people sometimes have to wait an hour to see a GP, we are bringing on line more doctors to make sure that we can cut those times and make sure that people can get to see a doctor. That is on top of the $20 million we have invested in Blacktown hospital, which services the electorates of Greenway, Chifley and Parramatta, to make sure we train in Western Sydney doctors who will stay in Western Sydney. You cannot do that if you do not have the fiscal discipline necessary to ensure that you can deliver those types of programs. 


Again, on our side of the fence we have demonstrated the ability to manage our finances and get triple-A credit ratings from all three major agencies. We have been able to achieve higher growth, lower unemployment and inflation contained. We are in a minority government and the pressure is on for both sides to demonstrate their ability to manage finances. I have outlined already what we have been able to do. Those opposite do not have a proud record in demonstrating how they would manage their finances.


You may recall that yesterday I referred to the fact that, when the razor gang of those opposite were meeting in August of last year,  a figure had to be put to them for the savings they would need to find. The figure was different for all of the principals in that meeting. That was deliberately done, not in the interests of economic policy but in the interests of finding out who, on their side of the fence, was leaking. A figure of $70 billion was deliberately put out there. As a result of that, we have a situation where those opposite—who could not even last year find $6 billion in savings because they claimed we did not need a flood levy in response to the worst natural disasters that Queensland had faced in living memory—were unable to find savings of their own, but now think that they can find $70 billion in savings.


As I pointed out yesterday, they have been working very hard and long, late at night, to try and find those savings. The member for Goldstein, I think, proudly announced—and I will stand corrected if I am wrong—that in terms of trying to find that $70 billion in savings they had reached for what always gets reached for when you are trying to demonstrate you have been able to discover some sort of waste or mismanagement: they found $50 million in government consultancies. Fantastic work that! $50 million in consultancies—




Mr Hockey:
  It was $500 million!




Mr HUSIC:
  It was $500 million? You know what, Member for North Sydney? I will give that to you. So that is $69,500 million to go in finding savings. What does $70 billion mean? As we have previously said, that is like stopping Medicare payments for four years, aged pensions for two years, assistance to people with disabilities for three years, or family tax benefit payments for three years. It requires savings equivalent to 1½ times GST revenue for a year.




Mr Hockey:
  Come on, Ed—you're better than this!




Mr HUSIC:
  Member for North Sydney, I would be interested to find out where you are able to find those savings. The member the North Sydney interjects and says that I am better than this. But, Member for North Sydney, we do not run our ERC on the basis of entrapment! You deliberately hand out different figures amongst yourselves to see who the leaker is. Who manages an economy that way? If in opposition they behave that way, how do you expect them to manage a $1.4 trillion economy? That is what they have to do. They have been unable to demonstrate that level of discipline. 


I think the biggest thing, too, that needs to be explained is getting $4 million in support from one particular person and then pushing as hard as you can to get rid of all the revenue gained out of the minerals resource rent tax. You have another serious problem there. You have Clive Palmer effectively helping run the coalition's economic policy when you have the biggest—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley will resume his seat! I was almost going to say, at the end of his speech, that he had stayed within the reference rules. Member for North Sydney, are you seeking the call?




Mr Hockey:
  No, I was just having a wander, actually.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You were 'just having a wander'! You have upset me. I have sat him down. Member for Chifley, go, but relevancy would be good.




Mr HUSIC:
  He has to walk around. He is always walking around trying to find savings!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Don't go to the dispatch box, though!




Mr HUSIC:
  He has a big job and I want him to be fit, because he is going to have a hard job finding $70 billion in savings. (Time expired)

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:49):  Thank you, Member for Chifley, for caring about my good health! I am delighted the member for Chifley has chosen to debate the need for responsible fiscal management. I could not have chosen a more appropriate topic on the last sitting day before the presentation of the 2012-13 budget.


The main focus of the coalition in this budget will be on whether the government actually can deliver an underlying cash surplus in 2012-13—not whether they promise a surplus but whether they can actually deliver a surplus—and we will not know that until September 2013.


Australians would be wise to subject the budget's numbers to particularly close scrutiny, as we will do. The bottom line is that the budget numbers, no matter what they are, simply cannot be believed. The government has an appalling record in forecasting its budget and economic numbers. There has been a massive error in forecasting this year's budget deficit. The 2010-11 MYEFO forecast a deficit of $12 billion. Six months later the forecast budget deficit was $23 billion. Six months after that the forecast budget deficit was $37 billion. That is a blow-out of over 200 per cent in a budget deficit in just 12 months. And the Treasurer says, 'Well, this is all the GFC.' In fact, there is a whole lot of expenditure going towards increasing the budget deficit, such as the expenditure associated with the carbon tax and the money the government is choosing to spend this financial year rather than next financial year.


The end result may be even worse. The current estimate of a surplus next year is based on a massive increase in tax receipts for the Commonwealth. In fact, the Commonwealth currently projects a $38 billion increase in receipts between this year and next year. That is based in part on ongoing high commodity prices. This is now looking unrealistic. Economic commentator David Uren has observed that, if company tax receipts perform as poorly in the June half year as they did in December, the government could face a deficit of $50 billion in this current year—$50 billion! That would be the second-highest deficit on record, exceeded only by Labor's previous spectacular effort—a $55 billion deficit in 2009-10. 


The economic growth numbers on which the budget is based have also been all over the place. The 2010 budget forecast real GDP growth at an above-trend four per cent in 2011-12. Six months later in the MYEFO it was revised down to 3¾ per cent. Six months after that, the growth figure was revised back up to four per cent, and the latest forecast is that it is back down—this time to 3¼ per cent. So up down, up down, up down—they are the economic growth forecasts from this government over the last two years. Now, even that estimate looks too high. Growth has averaged under 2½ per cent for the first two quarters of this financial year, and it will take a mighty rebound to get anywhere near the forecast growth figure. 


The most damaging example of Labor's budgetary incompetence and bungles is of course the mining tax. This has now been through five versions. The original RSPT was predicted to raise $12 billion over four years. The compromise negotiated by the real Three Stooges—the Prime Minister, the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Treasurer—was forecast to be $10.5 billion. Then we had the 2010-11 MYEFO, which said it was $7.4 billion. The 2011-12 budget said it went back up, to $11.1 billion. Then, the last MYEFO said it was back down to $10.6 billion. Even these numbers seem dodgy, because the government has not taken into account the nearly $1 billion impact of the increase in mining royalties from the New South Wales government.


This government claimed that it had not been informed of the change in the royalty regime in New South Wales. The only thing is, it was in the New South Wales budget papers. It was released in the New South Wales budget. There was a press release from the New South Wales government. But this government chooses to ignore all that and says they just were not told about this increase in royalties. Therefore their numbers, according to them, stand. We had the extraordinary situation earlier this week with the Treasurer saying on Radio National that the difference between the first mining tax and the second mining tax was not $60 billion and that a 10-year estimate was never produced by Treasury, and within four hours we released to the Treasurer his own Treasury document that said there was a $60 billion hole and that there were 10-year estimates. The Treasurer had that on his own website, and he denied that it existed. Not only have the invention, creation, development and implementation of the mining tax been a shambles but I can assure the House that, when the budget comes around and we try to find the revenue figures actually delivered by the mining tax, there will be yet another Labor Party black hole.


Labor continues to boast about spending commitments worth tens of billions of dollars, but they are unfunded or not included in the budget bottom line. This includes the $50 billion National Broadband Network and the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These programs are funded by additional borrowed money which will take the Commonwealth gross debt position to over $250 billion. In addition, the government has refused to explain where the money is coming from for 12 new submarines, costing $36 billion; the Commonwealth's 30 per cent share of the Gonski education plan, starting at $5 billion a year; up to $6½ billion each year for the National Disability Insurance Scheme; or for its promise to the Greens to have a dental program, which could cost $4 billion a year. On top of this there are structural holes, as I have pointed out many times, in the carbon and mining taxes which amount to more than $6 billion over the next three years.


It is only the Labor Party that could introduce new taxes and leave the budget worse off. They are the only people capable of introducing new taxes, increasing taxes, and somehow making the budget worse off, with a bigger deficit. This unfunded hole is now well over $100 billion. In addition, future governments—I suspect we will be one of them—will have to find $136 billion to repay just the principal on Labor's debt. Labor's debt is going to cost Australians $8 billion a year in interest alone. On current numbers, it will take 63 years to repay this government's $136 billion of net debt. Where is the member for Longman? He will be getting a letter from King William on the occasion of his 100th birthday when Labor finally gets this debt paid off.


Labor has also been moving money around in the budget. My colleague the shadow finance minister provided last Friday a full account of the trickery engaged in by the government, and I will mention just a few examples. Labor will spend just over $1 billion this year to support energy markets through its Energy Security Fund. It will also spend just over $1 billion on guaranteeing our energy security in 2013-14 and $1 billion in 2014-15. But there is a big gap. It is a billion dollars on energy security this year; next year it is not a billion dollars—they have deleted the 'b' and put in an 'm': it is a million dollars. But, then, the year after it is a billion dollars and the year after that it is a billion dollars. So what is the deep, dark valley that represents a billion-dollar hole in the Energy Security Fund in 2012-13? It must be going towards their so-called surplus. But it is not real. It is unbelievable. There is a billion dollars this year, a million dollars the next year, and a billion dollars in each of the two years after that, and that represents accounting trickery.


Another example is that Labor's coal sector jobs package will spend $222 million this year, $10 million next year, $247 million the year after and $257 million the year after that. So this year it is a quarter of a billion dollars, next year it will cost only $10 million but the year after that it is a quarter of a billion and the year after that is a quarter of a billion.




Mr Ruddock:
  They're not cooking the books, are they?




Mr HOCKEY:
  I do not believe they are cooking the books; I think they have cooked the books. They are not cooking; they have been burned in the microwave. It is amazing! The government brought forward the disaster relief payments for Queensland at $1.4 billion. That means it is spent this year, and the deficit gets worse this year. They have brought forward $1.4 billion on infrastructure spending for New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. It was meant to be next year but it is now this year, and they have been engaging in other tricks in other areas.


This chicanery all adds up. This trickery all adds up. What it means is that the government is trying to make this year's deficit worse. Next year, they are going to claim to have a surplus, but the problem is that they have built in structural expenditure. In the year after and the year after that and all the years after that the spending gets larger and the debt burden gets higher. All they are trying to do is trick the Australian people into believing that they will have a sustainable surplus next year when the truth is that they are building tricks into the budget.


The other thing we will be looking for on budget night is new or increased taxes. I know it is hard to believe, but the Labor Party loves new taxes. They love increased taxes—in fact they have had 20 of them since they were elected in 2007. Of the $22 billion in announced saving measures in the last budget, a third were from new or increased taxes. As I have said before, the $38 billion surge towards a surplus in the coming year is overwhelmingly higher taxes. 


We will also be looking for waste. Where in its $370 billion of expenditure is the government finding the savings and cutting back? We all know the story: a $1.7 billion blow-out on school halls, $2.4 billion wasted on pink batts, $900 cheques going to dead people or to people living overseas, a $1.4 billion blow-out in laptops in schools, an $850 million blow-out in the solar homes program, $300 million wasted in green loans programs and they are giving set-top boxes to people at up to $1,500 each when Gerry Harvey said that he would personally go around and install them for $170. Only this government would do it.


There is the broadband costing of $50 billion with no business plan, and what about $40 million for bike paths? Leo McLeay would have loved having a proper and decent bike path, wouldn't he? As we heard in question time, the government is spending $145,000 to study sleeping snails; $340,000 to see whether climate change is affecting the fiddler crabs; and $314,000 to see whether birds are shrinking—they are certainly not Ingham's chickens. They are not shrinking, are they? They are all on the 'roids'. No, they are not. Last but not least, there is $578,000 to research an ignored credit instrument in Florentine economic, social and religious life in the 1500s.


This is the Labor way: waste of taxpayers' money and absolute disregard for the hard work and effort of everyday Australians who have to pay that tax. This is the Labor way: chicanery and trickery in the budget numbers in order to try to fiddle the surplus promised for the next financial year by moving money around—but at the end of the day there is the structural expenditure. This is the Labor way: to make promises that are not delivered—and the promises that are made are never kept. It is the Labor way to be dishonest with the Australian people not just about the carbon tax, not just about the events on Australia Day this year involving the tent embassy and not just about the member for Dobell; it is the Labor way to be dishonest about the state of the nation's accounts. What that leaves is a nation bewildered by its incompetent government, a nation that does not understand the lack of direction out of Canberra and a nation that does not have the confidence to grow as its destiny determines.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:04):  I am very grateful to the member for Chifley for raising this matter of public importance in the parliament today because, after a very long parliamentary session, we have found it very difficult to find a matter of public importance raised by the other side. It falls to Labor and this side of the House to talk about the issues that are important to the Australian people, that should be debated in this parliament. The Leader of the House demonstrated forcefully today the number of hours that have been wasted by those opposite on spurious suspensions of standing orders so that the Leader of the Opposition could get up, day-in and day-out, and sometimes twice a day, to raise his stunts, to absolutely no effect—wasting the time of the parliament. If you want to talk about waste of taxpayers' dollars, just think about the amount of waste that has been caused by the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business in the House coming in here day after day, wasting important parliamentary time, suspending standing orders and preventing us from talking about the issues that really are the matters of public importance in this House. So I am very grateful to my friend the member for Chifley for raising this matter of public importance—ensuring that we have fiscal responsibility as we approach the 2012-13 budget.


While the opposition is spending their time on stunts, the government is getting on with the important business of government. If there were a week in this parliamentary schedule when that could not have been more clear it is the week we have just gone through. The government has introduced and seen through this parliament some spectacularly important legislation, all of it opposed by those opposite because it is in their DNA is to say no to everything.


They said no to safe rates. They said no to ensuring that, when we and our families and friends get in our cars and share the roads with heavy vehicles, we have a safe motoring and a safe trucking industry. They say they cannot see the link between the number of hours a truck driver has to spend on the road and how safe the working conditions are for that truck driver. They beggar belief. That legislation was supported by this side of the House and all right-thinking Australians but was opposed by those opposite. We saw introduced into the House this week important maritime legislation. There, in the 11 years of government—




Mr Van Manen:
  I rise on a point of order. Looking at the wording of this matter of public importance—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Forde will resume his seat. Although the issue of relevance does apply, MPIs are always wide-ranging debates. 




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I am simply making the point that when we are discussing matters of public importance—the importance of ensuring that we have responsible fiscal management—it should be seen in the light of the broader of context of what we are trying to do on this side of the House and in the light of the frippery and the stunts which seem to dominate the obsession of those on the other side of the House.


It is seen in their attitude to the important maritime legislation, including the changes in taxation arrangements which will form part of the 2012-13 budget, which was introduced by the Leader of the House, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, this week. No doubt, that will be opposed by those on the other side of the House, because their idea of a maritime policy was to pull on a damaging one-month strike and confrontation with the maritime union. That strike had us in the High Court and had the nation's ports crammed up and jammed for several months. That is their idea of a maritime policy, while on this side of the House we believe that it is in the national interest to have a shipping line—to have Australian owned and operated ships—and that it is in the national interest that we have a trained domestic workforce that is able to work on those ships. 


That is why in this budget and in the legislation before the House today we are putting in place tax incentives and other measures to ensure that we have an Australian shipping industry and that we have Australian workers working on those Australian ships. Those on the other side of the House put in place tax arrangements and other laws which encouraged foreign ships with foreign workers to ply the coastal trade around our great trading nation.


With regard to superannuation, we on this side of the House are introducing laws to ensure that workers get a real shift in their superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Those on the other side of the House are voting against that. They have form: in their 11 years in government the ordinary Australian men and women—wage and salary earners—never saw an increase in their superannuation as a result of any laws passed by those on the other side of the House, because they are opposed to dignity in retirement and retirement savings for ordinary Australian men and women.


I will move, now, to tax cuts. As a result of the legislation that we are moving in the House you will see 2.7 million small businesses in this country enjoying a tax cut—a tax cut opposed by those on the other side of the House. The reason that it is important that we have responsible fiscal management is that we can do things for pensioners. We have made historic reforms to the indexation of the pension system. That was something that was neglected by those on the other side of the House. In their 11 years in government they had a blind spot for the pensioners of this country. 


When the economy was raining gold bars, do you think they could find it their dark hearts to properly index the pension systems in this country? It was beyond them. They opposed that. We on this side of the House are seeing through their stunts and their frippery and introducing important reforms, including the National Broadband Network. It is opposed by all of those members of the other side of the House when they are here in Canberra, but when they get back to their electorates they cannot love it enough. Liberal and National Party member after Liberal and National Party member are rushing back to their electorates and signing off letters to the minister. They are giving great speeches in their electorates about how they are working hard to ensure that they get the National Broadband Network in their electorates. 


They talk a lot about deficits on that side of the House, but here is one deficit that you will not hear them talk about—that is, the $60 billion infrastructure deficit that we inherited when we came to government in 2007. You would think that the members opposite who represent rural and regional electorates would get this issue. You would think that in 11 years of government those National Party members would have found their voices and said, 'What are we doing while the economy is raining gold bars? Why aren't we spending money on the ports and on the rail and road networks of this country?' They could not find their voices. They were silenced in the coalition. They have found their voices now, but in the 11 years of government there was not a whisper, not a squeak, from the rural and regional members of the coalition parties. 


We will bring the budget back into surplus. Labor will introduce a budget in May this year, which will be back in surplus. We will do that because we have put in place tight fiscal rules—tight fiscal discipline—in a way that was unknown to those on the other side of the House when they were in government. When it was raining gold bars they could not send the money out the door quickly enough. In fact, if you listen to those on the other side of the House, you hear that they say, 'We have a philosophy of introducing surpluses. Irrespective of the economic conditions, we will introduce surpluses.'


Pause for a moment and think about what that means. It means that the philosophy on that side of the House is that they are committed to taxing Australians more than the government actually needs to. That is what they are committed to doing. That is why the tax-to-GDP ratio while we have been in government has decreased from the high of 24.2 per cent when those opposite were in government to 21.2 per cent now that we are in government. 


So I thank the member for Chifley for bringing this important matter of public importance before the House, because it is in stark contrast to what we have seen from them all week and all year.

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,23,1,speech
"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:14):  The MPI that I speak on today is the urgent need for responsible fiscal management in the upcoming budget to deliver real reforms for working people. We should change the title of this segment from MPI to 'The Comedy Hour', because what we heard from the member for Throsby was absolutely comical. Before coming to this place I was a successful transport operator in Queensland. Prior to that, I was a banker. Being part of the Liberal family on this side of the House, every day I welcome the opportunity to debate the fiscal management of this country and I welcome the opportunity to let Australians hear not the spin that Labor would have you believe but the real facts about how this economy could be run better.


Before I speak about a couple of things I want to pick up one of the points that was made by the member for Chifley about Australia's AAA credit rating. This is interesting for people to get their heads around. Why do we have a AAA credit rating at the moment when we have record debt and enormous deficits? When we were in government, we had money in the bank and no debt. Wouldn't we have been in a stronger position compared to today, when we have a heap of debt and no capacity to repay it? Why do have a better credit rating today than we had then? I will tell you why: Standard and Poor's and Moody's have what are called comparative credit ratings. Australia is compared to the rest of the world. As the major economies around the globe have softened—they have basically gone to hell in a hand basket—that has increased Australia's comparative position. That is why we have a AAA credit rating. I can assure you that the false hypnotic phrases that come from this government in reference to their fiscal management are a joke.


I would also like to bring your attention to the comment made earlier this week by the member for Chifley. He said that Labor will have the fastest fiscal consolidation in four decades. That is all this government can do: talk about what is going to happen; the old 'gunna', 'what we will do'. They cannot talk about their track record, because their track record is pretty ordinary. And I will get to the amount of debt and deficits, because I know that the member for Throsby is interested to know about some of the records that his government has been in charge of: record debt and record deficit.


When it comes to the fastest fiscal consolidation in four decades, I want to break down for you what fiscal consolidation is: it is the capacity for a government to pay back debt. With reference to Labor and its out-of-control spending, one can draw an analogy that their fastest fiscal consolidation—which may happen sometime in the future—is similar to a contestant going on TheBiggest Loser after jamming 50 kilos on in order to rip it off quicker. A fast fiscal consolidation by this Labor government will only be a result of the enormous blow-out in their spending.


Let us talk about the suggestion that they will have the capacity to make these changes or have a surplus down the track. In order to understand whether they have the capacity to forecast such things and whether they have integrity—in order for us to be able to take what they say at face value—we need to go back and have a look at their track record of forecasting. Let us go back just over 12 months to the MYEFO books—and for those people who are here in the gallery, MYEFO stands for Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. These guys should get a copy of it from time to time.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Wright should address his comments through the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wright should address his comments through the chair, because I do not think that I have been doing the things that he is talking about and the use of the word 'you' is not accepted. By now, all new members should be aware of that. The member for Wright has the call.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I can understand wholeheartedly why the member for Throsby would feel a little ruffled by the comments that he is hearing at the moment. The Labor Party, 12 to 18 months ago, forecast that their budget deficit—the one that is coming up real soon; in a couple of weeks—was going to be $12 billion. These people want us to believe that they have the capacity to forecast. They said that it was going to be $12 billion. Six months later, in the budget figures it was $12.6 billion. That is just a lazy $600 million—they got it wrong by that much.


But that is not all; there are steak knives with this deal as well. In the recent MYEFO documents, that $12.6 billion went to $22 billion. And now it is at $37 billion. That is the capacity of this government, which wants to stand on a stage and talk about fiscal responsibility, to forecast over a period of just over 12 months. They cannot hit the side of a barn when it comes to forecasting deficits.


We have seen in the last parliamentary sitting period three common traits in the bills that have come before the House. Firstly, the majority of the bills that have come before the House somehow end up giving more power to their union mates; secondly, they take money out of the pockets of mums and dads and small businesses, and I will explain to you how they do that; and, thirdly, somewhere woven into the bill is more bureaucracy and more compliance measures—you can bet on that. The Australian Labor Party do not get it. They do not understand the business pressures out there at the moment.


I want to bring your attention to the mining tax and some of the benefits that the Labor Party are boasting about, such as the changes to the company tax rate. I am glad that you are here, Billy. What is your seat?




Mr Shorten:
  Minister!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Minister Bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Member for Wright.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I am glad that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation is in the House to hear these comments. The company tax rate is going to go from 30 per cent to 29 per cent, a one per cent decrease. We have taken a bit of heat over opposing that. I want to share with you why we oppose that. I asked the guys in my office to ring some of the businesses within a couple of kilometres of my office. These are actual figures and I want you to get your head around them. A bloke who has a building supply business has a payroll of $570,000. Last year his taxable income with $40,000. What that means is that he will get a company tax cut of $400 but will potentially be facing a $17,100 increase in his superannuation liability. This government would have you think that they are paying for that superannuation increase. I can assure you that it will be coming out of the pockets of the small businesses and the hardworking mums, dads and families of my electorate of Wright. Then we went around the other corner and found the motor mechanic. He has a payroll of $500,000 and a taxable income of $75,000. What is his benefit? The hand goes into the pocket and he gets his $750, but the potential super liability out of the other pocket is $15,000. Do the maths: over the six-year period that comes to $15,000. You cannot have a three per cent increase and not have it cost anything. It has got to cost something.



Government members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wright will return to the MPI and stop encouraging misbehaviour in the chamber.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I am the junior here! I am getting bashed up! I thought you would be my saviour!


Do not just take my word for it when it comes to the management of the fiscal policy of this nation. You do not have to look any further than this morning's Australian Financial Review. We have the government saying how wonderful their fiscal responsibility is, how diligent their economic management is and what a wonderful state our nation is in. Well, one of the jewels in the crown of Australian retail, David Jones, is mentioned in headlines this morning on the front page of the Australian Financial Review. The headline reads 'DJs in fight for survival'. It says a lot when you get comments like that coming from David Jones, which is a true indicator of the real retail sector in this nation. Mr Paul Zahra, CEO, said:


These are the toughest retail conditions that I've even seen in my career and I've been in retailing for 30 years.


How is it that we have a Labor government insisting that things are just a bed of roses, but some of the biggest retailers are struggling to keep their heads above water. David Jones has forecast a downgrading of profits to the tune of 40 per cent.


This government's capacity to forecast is nothing short of outstanding when you have a look at their capacity back through MYEFO and the budget! Now the government will get up and continue to 'spin, spin, spin', but they have continually failed to forecast the stats— (Time expired)

Today I move amendments to the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 to ensure that the key Future of Financial Advice reform measures work as intended. The amendments respond to recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the bills released on 29 February 2012. 


Amendments (1) to (15) respond to a range of concerns by industry about the technical operation of the ongoing fee arrangement disclosure and renewal provisions. Amendments (1) to (5), (8), (10), (13) and (14) make technical changes to time frames around fee disclosure statements to ensure that the provisions can operate more in line with the current reporting periods of financial advice businesses and to make the various disclosure obligations more practical to discharge. Amendment (6) responds to concerns from industry about the practical difficulties of disclosing certain information about fees that have yet to be incurred. As a result, the amendment removes the requirement for a financial adviser to anticipate the amount their client will pay in the forthcoming year. Fee information for the year immediately passed will still be required. 


Amendments (7) and (9) respond to concerns from industry that fee disclosure requirements might require more information than is practically necessary when disclosing details of services the client received or was entitled to receive in the previous 12 months. To make it clear that such disclosure need only be sufficient, rather than comprehensive, the amendments replace the words 'details of' with 'information about'. This will not diminish the client's practical understanding of the services they received or are entitled to receive from their adviser. Amendments (11) and (12) respond to the concerns from industry about the practical difficulties of disclosing certain information about services that have yet to be provided to the client. As a result, the amendments remove the requirement of a financial adviser to anticipate the services the client is entitled to receive or will receive in the forthcoming year. Information for the year immediately passed will still be required.


Amendment (15) is a technical change to ensure consistency of terminology in the opt-in provisions by replacing the word 'send' with the word 'give'. This also clarifies that an adviser does not have to send, for example, via mail the opt-in renewal notice to the client but can provide the notice in a number of alternative ways. Amendments (16) and (17) respond to concerns that the anti-avoidance provisions of the bill operate so broadly that they might acquire property on other than just terms. The amendment clarifies that the anti-avoidance provisions do not apply to the extent the operation of the subsection would result in an unjust acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. 


Returning to the other amendment about opt-in, the government is making some additional changes to the opt-in aspects of the FoFA bill to provide greater flexibility to industry while ensuring consumer protection is maintained. I am indebted in particular to the work of the member for Lyne in terms of the formulation of this amendment. The opt-in obligation requires financial advisers to renew their client's agreement to ongoing fees every two years. While this is an important protection to ensure clients do not pay open-ended ongoing fees while receiving little or no service, some parts of industry have argued this requirement is unnecessary where advisers are members of professional bodies or professional codes which obviate the need for opt-in; for example, if a code requires advisers to provide an ongoing service to clients if they charge an ongoing fee. 



The SPEAKER:  I ask the minister to pause. The honourable member for Flinders should remove himself from the chamber as he is inappropriately attired. He can come back when he is appropriately attired.




The member for Flinders then left the chamber
.





Mr SHORTEN:
  The amendment gives ASIC the ability to exempt advisers from the opt-in obligation if they are satisfied that the adviser has signed up to a professional code which obviates the need for opt-in. This is a sensible change—which has also been recommended to me by a range of industry participants, along with the member for Lyne—which makes advisers who deliberately put in place set-and-forget arrangements accountable to the opt-in obligations in the law but provides some commonsense relief for those advisers that act in a professional manner and are obligated under a code to adequately service clients. This is not a loophole to opt-in, and let me be clear on this. If ASIC is not satisfied that a professional code obviates the need for opt-in, those advisers signed up to that code will need to comply with opt-in requirements. This also provides an incentive for advisers to attain a greater level of professionalism, something that can only be good for the sector and ultimately the consumers. This ensures consumers are adequately protected either by a professional body or, failing that, the opt-in provisions in the law.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:56):  To expedite the debate, I want to be perfectly clear about the coalition's position. In relation to amendments (1) and (2), we will not oppose those amendments, where it is specifically about a period of 12 months or more. In relation to amendment (3), which is a slight change in the wording of 30-day period for the annual fee disclosure statement, we will support that. Amendments (4), (5), (8) and (10) in relation to the period to which a fee disclosure statement relates we will support. Amendments (6), (7) and (9), an argument about easier compliance by industry with the information required to be provided in fee disclosure statements, we will support. 


Amendment (11), which removes paragraph 962H(2)(e), we will support. We will also support amendment (12), which removes paragraphs 962H(2)(f) and (g) the same way as our amendment (13) does to the extent that it is a catch-all regulation making the clause slightly wider than the existing clause. We will support improved wording on disclosure day in amendment (13). 


We are opposing amendment (14), which changes the wording in section 962K, the opt-in clause, because we do not agree with opt in. The minister has clearly stated today that opt-in still exists—red tape. Amendment (15) changes the wording in section 962K opt-in clause to make it consistent. Similarly we oppose that. On amendments (16) and (17), our amendments are clearly better. This changes the anti-avoidance provision in the bill to potentially exempt arrangements in existence before the commencement of the bill from the anti-avoidance provisions but the way the amendment is drafted unquestionably creates uncertainty and leaves it to the courts to decide what is permitted and what is not permitted.


We are, without qualification, strongly opposed to the government's amendment to opt-in because we get rid of it. This is the key amendment, as identified by the minister, on ZA284: ASIC may exempt a person or class of persons from section 962K. This is going to kill small businesses. Have no doubt about it: this is going to have a very significant impact on small businesses. We have had the Independents talk about transparency, we had the government talk about letting the light in. How was this negotiated? Maybe the member for Lyne, who is given credit for this, can explain to the Australian people and the parliament how this was negotiated. It does not remove opt-in from the bill. It does not sort out the problems with the best interest duty. It does not provide certainty around the provision of scaled advice. It does not legislate the one-year extension for the implementation of FoFA that the government has promised. It does not fix a whole lot of outstanding issues with FoFA. But, specifically, this is going to increase unnecessary red tape.


Red tape is the bane of the life of small business. Red tape is what makes it so hard to undertake small business. Yet, here we have the minister negotiating exclusively with the member for New England and the member for Lyne a deal to keep opt-in in place, which is going to pile the red tape on. They could say, 'It is a class of people that will be subject to a code of conduct.' What code of conduct? A code of conduct has to go to the ACCC. A code of conduct has to engage all the businesses. Businesses all of a sudden have to have these new codes of conduct that they have to comply with. If it is a mandatory code, of course the ACCC needs to approve it. Then, 'If we haven't worked with one regulator, let's go to another regulator.' ASIC needs to approve it. This is small business. This could be a single financial planner in a country town who needs to comply with a new code of conduct for his industry, and that has to go to the ACCC, and that will take months and months to negotiate. It will take months and months to negotiate a new code of conduct for a particular class of advisers. (Time expired)

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2012-03-22,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (17:01):  I will be brief as well. I am very aware of all members' time. I am really only speaking on government amendment (1), the insertion of proposed clause 962CA, 'Exemption from application of opt-in requirement'. The key word is 'exemption'. This has been a long and protracted negotiation. What we have now done, through negotiation, is achieve a path of choice for those in small business and those in both the financial planning and the financial advice market.


By 2015 there will be a very simple choice for anyone who is providing financial advice or financial planning services to clients who are mostly looking for security with their retirement savings. But this covers the full range of financial products. That choice for financial planners and financial advisers is either to participate in the opt-in process or to participate in accreditation under an industry code of practice. That will be developed over the next three years under ASIC rules, with full consultation with the industry. Clearly, as the amendment suggests, there is an exemption from the opt-in requirement.


The previous speaker, the member for North Sydney, was correct: there was and is a great deal of concern around the opt-in provisions. For over a year I personally have—and I know other members of this chamber have—been raising those concerns about the dead hand of government regulation in requiring a financial planner or a financial adviser to round up their clients every couple of years and re-sign them to their books.


Regarding other changes coming through in this FoFA legislation, importantly for me the keys are the fiduciary duty of the best interest test and really making the focus client-first. There are still some minor issues in that regard that we will all watch closely. But fundamentally that best interest rule is long overdue for making sure that financial advisers and planners do put their clients interests' first.


The second aspect of importance is the annual full fee disclosure. Again, while there are some issues there, where I personally would have liked to have seen stronger disclosure requirements, such as prospective disclosure—basically a quote for work for the coming year—I am happy to accept some negotiations around that to make sure there is an alternative pathway to the dead hand of government in and around opt-in. An industry code of practice in most professions is a bit of a no-brainer. If this is about cultural change and making sure we professionalise financial planning and financial advice and ensure clients' money gets the best service possible, then it may surprise many in this chamber that an industry code of practice is not already in place.


As an alternative to the opt-in path I think a code of practice is a sensible cultural move. It will encourage greater professional standards. It does so in a way that engages various planners, providers and their organisations and it does allow for a choice, in a voluntary way, to participate in the market under the code of practice. If that is all too hard and for some reason that does not work for you, then quite rightly there are opt-in provisions to make sure you participate in the cultural change and the professionalisation, making sure that we have financial products and financial advice delivered to the standard that I hope this House expects.


I appreciate the negotiations. They have been long and protracted, with all the various groups. I appreciate the minister and his office accepting and working on this amendment. It does now provide choice within financial markets and I think it is a sensible choice. (Time expired)

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (17:07):  I suspect that the member for Lyne did not negotiate in good faith. I expect that he simply, as he does on so many things, negotiated as effectively a Labor Independent, because we do not know what the purpose is of this ASIC exemption from the application of the opt-in requirement. The minister has insisted throughout the FoFA process that opt-in is a critical requirement. What has occurred to make the minister change his mind to provide an exemption? What is the information? What is the evidence? Where is the convincing argument? The financial planners already have a code of practice. What about the others? Are they going to satisfy an ASIC test? How is ASIC going to—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for North Sydney should address his remarks through the chair.




Mr HOCKEY:
  How is ASIC, Mr Speaker, going to determine whether a code of practice is acceptable or not? Is it going to be a code of conduct? Is it going to be a voluntary code of conduct that needs to be signed off by the ACCC, or is it going to be a mandatory code of conduct that again needs to go through the ACCC? What are going to be the requirements for people who have to comply with the code of conduct?


Effectively what you will have is two sets of laws. You will have the code of practice or the code of conduct that now the member for Lyne takes great pride in imposing on the entire financial services industry, and then you are going to have the laws themselves. If the code of conduct is accepted by ASIC then all those industries that are out there are going to have to change their software, change their application forms, change their processes and go through the education and training. What do they do all of a sudden? Do they stop? Because opt-in is meant to start.


When does opt-in start—1 July 2013; is that right? Or 1 July 2012? When does opt-in actually start? And, if it starts on 1 July 2014, how are people meant to go about getting their codes approved by ASIC and potentially the ACCC in the process and set up compliance mechanisms for the codes prior to getting that approved by ASIC? And, when it is approved by ASIC, does that mean they do not have to go with opt-in at all? Under this sham arrangement, it may well be the case, but it means that they have the red tape of compliance all the way. For a single financial planner in a country town, they have just been knifed by the Labor Independent member for Lyne and the Labor Independent member for New England.


Is it not correct to say that vast numbers of groups in the financial services sector were not even consulted about this amendment? The minister can tell us which major groups were involved in negotiation on this. When is it anticipated that ASIC will actually make the class order exemption? Will the exemption be made before or after the commencement date of FoFA? Is it likely that the industry will need to implement, as I said, significant and costly changes to be opt-in and then to be opt-out afterwards? Has there been any cost-benefit analysis of this additional red tape for the industry?


We do know that ASIC is going to approve, or not approve, the code of conduct, but what form will the code of conduct take? There are no explanations there either. What we have got out of all this is that the government is just loading more red tape on individuals and more red tape on financial planners and financial advisers. How will consumers be able to determine whether their financial adviser is subject to opt-in or not subject to opt-in? How will that be disclosed to a customer? How will the exemption operate in practice? If someone agrees to contract to the financial adviser at a time when the financial adviser is subject to opt-in, will the opt-in arrangements continue to apply if at a later date the financial adviser becomes exempt from the requirements?


Is the code of conduct likely to be determined by some other non-government body? If so, which non-government body? Will ASIC be able to approve more than one code of conduct in relation to the exemption for individual players? Will the code of conduct mandate or impose any continuing professional education requirements?


These are questions that are not answered. All we have had is a shonky deal between two Labor Independents and the Labor Party to get opt-in through. And the member for Lyne is going to go back to his electorate and he is going to say to them, 'Don't worry, guys; I defended your interests,' and not tell them the fact that they are going to be burdened with a vast amount of new red tape thanks to the government and the Labor Independents.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:12):  The question of opt-in has been one of the most contentious in the approach to the Future of Financial Advice for the whole period that this package of reforms has been under consideration by the government and by the parliament. Financial advisers all around Australia have been anxiously approaching their members of parliament, saying that this is a fundamental challenge to the way they conduct their business and it is also a fundamental restriction on the freedom of both financial planners and their clients to contract, because an extraordinary proposition is being put into the law here.


The extraordinary proposition is that, if you as a client want to go to an adviser and say, 'I wish to retain your services indefinitely; I wish to retain your services until such time as I no longer wish to retain your services,' you are now prevented from doing that by law because of the opt-in requirement. It is now a requirement in the law, subject only to the amendment the sketchy details of which have just been provided to the House, that you may not contract without limit even if you, as a citizen seeking advice, believe that you are perfectly within your rights and capability to do so. So there are very good reasons why both the financial advisory industry and people seeking financial advice have been very concerned about opt-in.


We are now told at very late notice that a deal has been done between the government and the member for Lyne which sorts it out. It sorts it out, no problem—no problem at all!


It may still be the case that as a matter of black letter law the statutes of this country will say: 'You are not free to contract with your financial adviser for more than two years. But don't worry, there'll be a code of conduct which will sort it out.' What details do we have about this code of conduct? They have not been provided to the House. In fact, as a matter of law we are simply being asked to take it on trust from the government that the government will cause ASIC to approve a code of conduct which will allow these arrangements to proceed and that it will grant relief. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that that is a deeply unsatisfactory way in which to proceed. We are not being given the detailed information that this House has a right to expect if it is to give consideration to the substance of this deal, which we are told addresses this problem. And I think the minister ought to give a much more comprehensive explanation of what is proposed than he has done so far.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:15):  I thank the member for Bradfield for his invitation. First things first: I have just listened to an unsubstantiated attack on the member for Lyne. I make it very clear that in relation to amendment ZA284—that is, opt-in or a code of conduct—the only reason this government has diverged from just demanding opt-in compulsorily, full stop, is because of the member for Lyne, because of the Financial Planning Association of Australia and because of the application. He has stood up for financial planners and he has made a cogent case. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I actually wish that those opposite would sometimes sit down and engage in constructive discussion with us and stop leaving the heavy lifting of compromise, negotiation and conciliation to the cross-benchers. It is interesting—and I do reflect that I listened very carefully to what the shadow Treasurer had to say—that, of the other set of government amendments numbered (1) to (17), we are in agreement on the first 13, which is good. This does show that sometimes we can reach the same conclusion, which is positive. 


In terms of some of the questions that were raised, I want to go to some of the bigger picture points and then perhaps address some of the more specific issues which were raised in order to be of assistance, because I thought there were some legitimate questions. Firstly, the FoFA opt-in arrangement does provide certainty. The system which triggers opt-in will commence on 1 July 2013. But advisers have a choice: opt-in or an industry code. The consumer will have the certainty that they will be protected by opt-in or an ASIC approved industry code. Indeed, I wish that perhaps earlier governments had stamped out some of the problems with commissions when they were in power, instead of leaving it to the current government to do it. 


There was also a reference to best interest duty, exposing advisers and having no legal certainty. It is true that in the financial services industry some stakeholders want a tick-a-box approach to the provision of advice. I do not believe this is what the consumers want. I do not believe that this is what many financial planners want. Nor do I believe that it is consistent with government policy. A tick-a-box approach is not what will change the culture of financial planning. I have said time and time again that I believe the vast majority of financial planners do an excellent job, but anyone who says that there have not been problems in terms of financial services in this country in recent years must have their head in the sand and certainly have not met some of the victims of Storm, Opes Prime or indeed, more recently, Trio. Our amendments provide more certainty with the provision of scaled advice, including protection around the full fact find. This is not enough for some in the industry but, at some point, I believe that one has to stop quibbling about the words and just simply embrace change. 


There is an argument being run that somehow improving confidence in the financial planning system will undermine the job security of thousands of people in the financial planning industry. Well, welcome to nine to 12 per cent superannuation. It is this government who has increased compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent this week, and it will be implemented over the next seven years. We are enlarging the opportunity for the wealth management industry in this country. We are not shrinking it; we are enlarging it. 


There were some specific questions raised by those opposite, which I might just go to in order to provide some persuasive clarity, which might indeed engage them in a road to Damascus conversion on some of the amendments. In terms of the ASIC exemption from the application of opt-in, we believe that consumers are provided with certainty, that a code obviates the need for opt-in. Some say that we should have just stuck with opt-in solely. We believe that the ASIC code will allow a choice for consumers and for planners. 


In terms of why we believe that opt-in is important—and we could accept the propositions put by many in the financial planning industry and consumer groups—is that we believe that we should provide flexibility—



Mr Briggs interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Mayo will not interject from outside his seat. 




Mr SHORTEN:
  We did listen to people in the industry. That is why we have tried to provide this alternative to opt-in. In terms of our consultation—and the issue of who had been consulted was raised—in the last year and a bit, we have met with all of the groups on a consistent basis, with individual companies and planners. I have also met with some of the victims of unfortunate financial planning operations. We believe that ASIC is the right organisation to work the code. (Extension of time granted) We believe that ASIC is capable of working through with the industry stakeholders and consumers to develop this code. We have committed to providing the resolution about the code before 1 July 2015. So we do believe that there is plenty of time for ASIC to do the work that is required. We believe that it is the industry who has to be consulted in developing that code. We believe that this will provide an enhancement to the provision of financial advice in this country.

(21) Schedule 1, item 12, page 14 (line 34), omit ""or (ii)"".


Amendment (1) ensures that the commencement date of FoFA will be delayed until 1 July 2013, consistent with the proposed start date of the MySuper changes. The current implementation date of 1 July 2012 is plainly ridiculous. It is plainly ridiculous to start it in four months. It has not even gone through the Senate yet. Given FoFA and MySuper involve major changes for the same financial services providers, it would make sense to implement them simultaneously. It is symptomatic of the government's chaotic approach to this area and its lack of understanding of practical business realities that it seeks to impose two different implementation dates involving significant and costly system changes in very quick succession. The minister has informally flagged for some time now that he will agree to a delay of the implementation. Well, he can take this amendment. It is time that he formalises it and gives certainty to the industry. The government should be supporting this amendment.


In relation to amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (15), these amendments remove the opt-in provisions from the legislation. Opt-in provisions impose a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers every two years. It was not part of the original Ripoll inquiry recommendations. Where is he? Where is the member for Oxley? There he is. Sorry, I overlooked him—just like the Prime Minister has on a couple of occasions. Out of 407 submissions to the original Ripoll inquiry, only one—the submission from the government's friends in the Industry Super Network—called for the introduction of opt-in provisions. Opt-in provisions impose a significant and unnecessary increase in red tape and costs on both small business financial advisers and consumers. Of course, the member for Lyne does not care about that and nor does the 'member for Tamworth'. They love that red tape for small business and they are going to be party to it.


The government has been unable to point to another example anywhere in the world where a government has sought to impose a mandatory requirement for consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. As such, by pressing ahead with opt-in provisions at the behest of his friends in the union dominated industry super fund movement, it would appear that the minister is intent on making Australia a world leader in red tape. With the best interests duty in place, appropriate transparency for fees charged and the ongoing capacity for clients of financial advisers to opt out of any advice relationship at any stage, there is adequate consumer protection without the need to impose additional costs and red tape on both businesses and consumers.


My amendments (16), (19), (20) and (21), consistent with the government's approach in its exposure draft released in August last year, ensure that the annual fee disclosure requirements will apply prospectively only and will not apply retrospectively. The Ripoll inquiry made no recommendation to introduce an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided by the financial service product providers to their clients. To impose these additional annual fee disclosure requirements retrospectively to all existing as well as new clients increases costs for no or only little additional consumer protection. Those additional costs will ultimately have to do be borne by the consumer and are obviously not proportionate to any questionable additional protection benefit.


In the FoFA consultation sessions, it was the industry's clear understanding that the government's proposal to impose an additional annual fee disclosure statement be prospective only. That is, it would apply to only new clients and not existing clients. That was also the position advanced by the government in its exposure draft of this legislation released only two or so months earlier. The Financial Services Council estimates that implementation of the fee disclosure requirement will cost approximately $54 per client prospectively—that is for new clients—and $98 per client retrospectively for existing clients. So this is yet another example of the very poor and deeply flawed consultation process engaged in by the government in relation to this. Finally, my proposed amendments (17) and (18) ensure that the antiavoidance provision in the legislation applies prospectively only and does not unintentionally apply the antiavoidance provision retrospectively. The existing provision was introduced with little or no consultation. The coalition amendments correct the issues relating to grandfathering and will ensure that the provisions apply prospectively to avoid any unintended consequences to retrospective— (Time expired)

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (09:30):  I want to talk this morning about the new wealth that has been generated in regional Queensland, particularly in my own electorate of Maranoa as well as the electorate of Flynn. I have referred to the Galilee Basin coal and coal seam gas developments. The same situation is occurring in the Surat Basin. Coal seam gas is bringing new wealth to the community, great wealth to the state of Queensland and of course great wealth for all Australians. But the development of coal seam methane gas has been controversial in my constituency and in New South Wales as well. Part of the problem has been the failure of the Queensland Labor government to put the regulations in place to ensure that people have confidence in this industry and to make sure that it is sustainable, that it will not harm the environment and that the coexistence issues between the landholder and the mining company are open and transparent.


Only through the voice of protest of my colleagues the LNP members Howard Hobbs, Ray Hopper and Lawrence Springborg as well as the member for Flynn, the member for Gregory—Vaughan Johnson—and myself as the member for Maranoa have we seen some changes to the Queensland regulations covering coal seam methane gas, access to land and the issue of water. In the beginning they were scandalous regulations, and it has only been through the voice of protest that we brought about changes that are going to see, I think, more sustainable industry.


This weekend we will see a change of government in Queensland to an LNP government that understands the issue. They will have to make sure there is more transparency in relation to the issue of compensation to landholders. Access to landholders' properties has got to be more transparent and open. There has to be better compensation for landholders as well, because when they get the compensation they will spend that money in their community. And of course they have to address the issue of housing affordability in the towns where these industries are developing, because it is  becoming quite apparent that the two-speed economy in my electorate and in the seat of Flynn is almost out of control for the older industries.


They also have to address the issue of infrastructure. The Warrego Highway is like a city highway now, with congestion that was never imagined in the past. We have to make sure that this new wealth brings wealth to all, not just to some. The growth must be managed. To give you some idea of the sort of growth we have seen, in my own home town of Roma we have 1,000 new houses coming. Unemployment is under one per cent. We used to have one flight a day of a Dash 8 from Brisbane to Roma; we now have six. In the last 12 months we had 60,000 passengers through the air terminal in Roma and have just opened the new $15 million air terminal. It is going to rise to 100,000 passengers in the next 12 months. That gives you some idea of the extraordinary growth. It has to be better managed, and the LNP government— (Time expired)

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:00):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I welcome in particular the opportunity to represent the financial advisers in my electorate of Swan, many of whom have serious concerns about this bill and the process that the government has undertaken to this point. There are a lot of people employed as financial advisers across the electorate of Swan, and I quite often get approached by people from this sector at events I attend. I have held a meeting with a representative group in my office, and it is important that the House realises how concerned these organisations are with the direction the government is taking with this legislation. It is unbelievable how many groups this government has managed to put offside simply through its management and processes.


In this chamber on 23 June 2011 I raised concerns with the way the government was proceeding with this legislation and spoke about some of the concerns that have been raised by financial advisers in my electorate of Swan. They were extremely unhappy with the way the government was proceeding with legislation. Unfortunately, nine months later the government has failed to take on-board points raised by the industry and coalition, and that has led to the situation where we cannot support these bills in their current form.


This behaviour of ignoring advice is typical of this government, which has taken to ignoring good advice from the coalition and from industry on not only this legislation but also multiple pieces of legislation that have gone through this place since 2007.


After a consultation with industry, and careful consideration, the coalition will be moving a series of amendments to these bills, and we ask that Minister Shorten and crossbench members consider them seriously and support them. The amendments can be summarised as follows: the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA assessed as compliant by the government Office of Best Practice Regulation; opt-in be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement also be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty be improved; the ban on commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and implementation of FoFA be delayed to 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper.


I will talk in more detail on these amendments later, but it is first worth considering the background to this legislation and the background to the industry. The financial sector industry is a vital industry not only to the wellbeing of the Australian economy but also to many small- to medium-sized investors in Australia. The role the industry plays is to give the best possible advice to investors and of course up-to-date advice that will enable the investor to improve their financial positions. Areas that advisers might assist with include life insurance, superannuation, mortgages, pension planning and so on. These are important areas and in the Liberal Party we see it as a real positive when people choose to organise their financial affairs—their pensions, the superannuation and their mortgages—because this takes pressure off the government and the public service. This is why this legislation is so important today. The last thing we want to be doing as a parliament is making it more difficult for people to access local financial advisers in the community. However, this is what this bill is going to do.


It is worth going back to understand the history of the legislation and the implementation of it. As the shadow minister said, in the wake of the global financial crisis, there were a number of high-profile collapses of financial service providers across Australia in particular the collapses of Storm Financial, Trio and Westpoint. The federal government felt that it had to do something and commissioned an inquiry into financial services, which became known as the Ripoll inquiry named after the chair of that committee, the member for Oxley. As I have said before, I have some sympathy for the member for Oxley because he put some effort into his inquiry only for the government to completely ignore his recommendations. It is a shame because the Ripoll inquiry provided a blueprint that the government could have adopted with bipartisan support.


One of the key observations of the Ripoll inquiry was that:


… the committee is of the general view that the situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations.


The reforms referred to were the 2001 legislative changes which provided a strong regulatory foundation for the financial services industry. It would have been ideal to move in a bipartisan manner based on the Ripoll inquiry not just between the parties in the parliament but also between those in the financial services industry. The inquiry reported back in November 2009. Think of the progress that could have been made since that time. However, instead the government embarked on a different path that has led to this legislation today, 22 March 2012, in which it managed to put offside just about every financial adviser in the country. Even at this point though there was an opportunity for the government to see sense, start listening, and produce some good legislation through an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the bills. However, they did not listen, which was disappointing for many who have made submissions to the inquiry. I received an email from one of my constituents, who is an authorised representative of a financial group, who wanted to bring the response from the industry to my attention as soon as possible. The press statement he sent to us said:


Industry bodies have expressed their disappointment at the findings of the Parliamentary Joint Committee's (PJC) review into the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) Bills.


A report outlining findings of the review was tabled in Parliament today. However, the PJC was unable to reach a consensus in relation to the proposed legislation, with the Coalition Committee members issuing a dissenting report.


…   …   …


The Financial Planning Association (FPA) said the PJC had missed an opportunity to deliver the benefits that FoFA was originally intended to bring.


I will also read out some comments that my constituent brought to my attention. These are comments that were posted on a financial blog after the news of the committee report came through. One comment said:


It has been quite clear from the beginning that this government pretends to consult and then does what it wants to do pandering to vested interests. Labor MPs have no say in the matter. Nothing will happen unless the government is changed.


In another comment from that particular website Alistair said:


The PJC fails in delivery is not really a surprise given this governments approach in ALL it has so called achieved to date. This government whose ministers are nothing short of self interest incompetants who cannot run a canteen let alone a country have once again demonstrated that they are only willing to support the cause of self interest for themselves and their union mates. Enough is enough. As members of this industry, we should rally to a call not only to save this industry but also the nations by asking clients to petition the coalition to block supply and call an election. Its time for this bunch of arrogant morons to go. They do not deserve to be in office.


That is an indication of how much passion there is around this particular bill, particularly from the industry. Another comment posted by Steve said:


One of the most glaring examples of the government pandering to the unions is the acknowledgement by Swan and Shorten that while they will stop volume rebates payments from platforms to independant advisers, they will not stop union super funds’ secretly subsidising their advisers because it’s too hard!


I want to use the time that I have left to make a couple of specific points on the legislation as it stands and in particular the amendments that the coalition are putting up.


Over the past two years there have been constant and completely unexpected changes to the proposed regulatory arrangements under FoFA right up until the introduction of the current legislation. Invariably, this was done without proper appreciation or assessment of the costs involved of any unintended consequences or other implications flowing from the proposed changes. Important financial advice reforms have been delayed by more than two years so that the government can press ahead with a number of contentious issues.


In my speech of 23 June 2011 I raised, on behalf of my constituent, an issue related to the opt-in proposal, which is now a component of this legislation. Opt-in imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to keep re-signing contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. This imposes an additional level of red tape on the industry. Last week I spoke about red tape in business and the 12,835 new regulations the government has introduced in comparison to the 58 it has repealed, despite the Kevin 07 one-in one-out promise. This legislation would surely add to this tally. As the shadow minister said, it would make Australia world champions in financial services red tape.


During the Senate estimates process it was revealed that the average small business financial advisory firm would face additional costs of $50,000 per annum. It is interesting—this week particularly—to see how the government has portrayed itself as a friend of small business. I, for one, who have run a small business for 25 years and employed 16 people, understand what it means to run a small business. I have experienced the cost of compliance and red tape implemented by government. Unfortunately, yesterday on the doors we saw a poor effort by a so-called small business woman who is now in parliament. The member for Canberra was trying to explain the new superannuation situation and who would pay. We all know—all business knows—that businesses will pay. It will not be as a result of the MRRT; small business will pay the new three per cent levy. This cost will easily wipe out the so-called benefit to small business of the one per cent tax cut.


It is surprising that the government is pursuing the opt-in proposal, not least because there was only one submission to the Ripoll inquiry arguing in favour of opt-in. The measures in place—which already include best interest duty, appropriate transparency of fees charged  and an ongoing capacity for financial advisers to opt out of any advice relationship at any stage—provide for consumer protection without the need to impose additional costs and red tape on both businesses and consumers. The coalition has a clear position on this—that is, opt-in should be removed altogether.


On a logistical and operational point, I make a few comments on the time frame for implementation of this legislation. The current implementation date of 1 July 2012 is completely unrealistic given that it is only four months away. Considering the red tape concerns I have just spoken about, four months is not sufficient time to prepare for these changes. The fact that the government thinks that this is possible shows, again, the government's lack of understanding of business realities. I repeat: it is disappointing that there is virtually no-one on the Labor side with any real experience of running small business. As such, the coalition will move an amendment for the opt-in to be removed from FoFA. I hope that this attracts the support of the Independents.


In my speech of 23 June last year I mentioned that the proposed ban on commissions on risk insurance was perhaps the most controversial aspect of the legislation among industry. The government's position on this matter has been confusing and ever-changing. Banning commissions on risk insurance will increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off, particularly the small business people who self-manage their future. There is already a problem of underinsurance in Australia. A ban would exacerbate this. What is more, recent experience in the UK showed that a ban does not work, which is why the UK reversed its decision.


The coalition's position is clear: we agree that Australians who receive automatic risk insurance within their super fund without accessing any advice should not be required to pay commissions. However, those Australians who require and seek advice to ensure adequate risk cover, whether inside or outside their super fund, should have the same opportunity to choose the most appropriate remuneration arrangement for them.


In conclusion, as the member for Swan and someone who has had some experience dealing with small business, I cannot support this legislation in its current form. It is a result of a messy process, it has no support in the community and it puts the financial services industry at risk. The Ripoll review could have taken us forward in a bipartisan way in 2009. But now, three years on, we have been presented with this poor piece of legislation. I support the coalition amendments, which will be moved at the conclusion of this debate.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:14):  I rise to address these two bills. Retirement investment has become very, very important in Australia, and I think it is something to do with our age grouping. Many of us are classified as baby boomers and, as the baby boomer generation has come through, they have benefitted from a great growth in Australia's economic fortunes in that time. Over that period they have been able to designate, in many cases, shorter working lives and be able to make decisions for their future, where slowly the emphasis on providing for our retirement has shifted from government to the individual.


In many cases some of these individuals will be retired for a very long time—possibly 30 years and in some cases 35 years. That means great care has to be taken in one's working life to make sure we have those nest eggs available to us to sustain us in the manner to which we have become accustomed.


In that light, successive governments have made a number of legislative changes which have encouraged people to put money into superannuation type products. Even at the moment we have the ability not only to take the superannuation paid by employers but to top up, even though I was disappointed in the last parliament when the government actually reduced the amount that people could put voluntarily into super.


This general reorganisation of our lives has led to a great escalation in the financial services sector. There is of course general investing, where people buy shares and invest in bank type products, long-term bonds and property. But then there has been a great growth in superannuation type products, both fully managed and self-managed. In the light of some occurrences in the last three years, which actually brought about the Ripoll inquiry, it is this great growth in self-managed superannuation funds that I think will give people pause to have a bit of a think about the way they do business because they have proven to be the most at-risk product and the one with no fall back.


Investors generally place their trust in financial advisers, and this is a good thing. Even though they generally are thorough, honest and professional in the advice they give, there are always those who are not and there are those who make genuine mistakes—in fact, we all make genuine mistakes in life. Financial advisers place a great deal of trust in the organisations that regulate them, including ASIC.


One of ASIC's jobs is to register companies, and register and manage investment schemes. I think there are a number of financial advisers out there, and many people out there, who place a great deal of trust in this registration process and believe that those companies offering services that are registered under ASIC's approval will be robust and be able to meet their commitments as they go forward. Unfortunately, the events of the last few years when we saw the collapse of Storm, Trio and Westpoint provide that this is not sufficient protection and people cannot be fully confident in ASIC's ability to register those companies that have true integrity.


While we are right to focus on the role of local advisers, we should also be having an objective look at the way ASIC license companies into this arena and allow them to operate and offer products. The government commissioned the Ripoll inquiry as a reaction to the collapse of those three companies, and quite rightly. They have done the right thing. I have had private meetings with Bernie Ripoll and I believe that that committee attacked their chore with great vigour and a clear focus on what they needed to achieve. That is why it is important that the government and all of us be careful with the recommendations—the results—that came out of the Ripoll inquiry. The first rule of government, in my humble opinion, let me say, should be to cause as little harm as possible. These bills vary in a number of ways from the unanimous recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry and that is why the opposition will be moving amendments, and that is why we are somewhat wary of what is being proposed here. It is why I am somewhat wary.


I have had an enormous amount of contact on this issue. My friends who are accountants and financial advisers are not normally the most demonstrative of people within our community. But in this particular case they have been properly fired up, and I have had an enormous amount of contact. I have met with a number of financial advisers. I must place on the record that the electorate of Grey was one of the two most affected electorates by the collapse of the Trio Group. There was over $100 million invested in the Trio Group from within my electorate. That came from one medium to large financial advisers group that had recommended their clients invest in this area. Over that period I have had many contacts with constituents who are extremely concerned about their life savings. Not only were they worried about their security but they were worried about the fact that their funds were locked up for a period of almost three years. The ability to run their lives without a secure form of income coming in became very stressful for them. In the end, they were enormously grateful and relieved that the insurance, that is, the levy on the industry, underwrote the risk that they had, and they received their money back. But some still lost significantly, and they were those who were in the self-managed super funds I first mentioned. I believe the loss from Trio Group capital is around $60 million in self-managed super investment funds Australia wide.


To return to the contact that I have had from financial advisers in the industry, the biggest concern without a doubt is the opt-in package that has been brought forward in these bills. That means that once every 12 months the financial adviser has to sit down with their client and reassess the suitability of the package for them and in many cases just collect a signature. That is going to be quite an impost for anybody within the industry to achieve—to have to bring their clients in once every 12 months. You have to make time in your working day. That will require weekend work to try to work around people's schedules. But in the country, it is always different. In the country things are done differently. With insurance agents and financial services deliverers, many of their contacts are made on a personal basis. If you live in a rural setting that means a visit to the farm. In any given day you might get to four or six clients. If you have a couple of hundred clients on your books, that is going to take around 40 days of your time. There is no way that these financial services deliverers will not have to pass those costs onto the people. It takes a bit of time to visit someone in their house. It is all very well to have someone into your office for 20 minutes. But in the rural and regional way we have of doing business, a visit involves time to sit down and have a cup of tea and talk about how the children are going. A little bit of time evaporates. So that is where a large amount of this extra cost will be. The industry estimates it will be $700 million to implement and then a further $350 million per annum to operate. Opt-in was not one of the Ripoll committee's recommendations. That is why I said at the outset that governments should always cause the least harm possible. I am not sure—in fact I am far from convinced on these bills—that that is the government's underwriting guide at all.


You have to ask yourself why; why is the government so intent on thrusting this extra cost on? I understand the argument that they want more security for the consumers. I understand that. But it is far from clear that many of these changes are going to give extra security. It is interesting to note in the evidence that the one group that asked for opt-in were the industry super funds.


This is a recurring theme in this parliament: this alliance, this close relationship, between the government and the Australian Labor Party and industry super funds, which are controlled by their partners in politics, the Australian union movement.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr RAMSEY:
  The reason is that we only have to look at the payments from the unions to support the ALP in their electoral quest to understand why the relationship is so close. There has been a lot of noise made in the last few days about some prominent individuals in the Australian community who choose to support the Liberal Party. It is this behind-the-scenes manoeuvring which underwrites the future of the ALP. It was not part—




Mr Husic:
  That's rubbish!




Mr RAMSEY:
  I am in the Federation Chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would ask that you would ask the member to remain silent.




Mr Husic:
  He is making an outrageous accusation!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Windsor
):  Order!





Mr RAMSEY:

If it was not part of the recommendations, in that light, it should be eschewed. The time frame is a concern; the industry is very worried about the time frame. It took three months and 10 days to get this enormous change, this enormous new raft of financial regulation, into the Australian financial services sector. It is far too short. In fact, the government has shown in the last few years that they cannot organise a piece of legislation to get through this place in under about two years, and they expect the financial services industry to adapt to these changes which are not yet through parliament in less than three months. That is far too short; it should not be allowed.





As I draw towards the close I would like to focus on some of the words that came from the Ripoll inquiry. This is a quote:





The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy.





That is an amazing statement. The committee that the government set up, dominated by government members, has said that the framework is not too bad, but what is happening here is that it is not properly enforced. But they have come back now and presented a pair of bills which are about laying a whole new layer of regulation over this industry. This is a recurring theme with the government.





Last week we had new regulation in the transport industry. We are having new regulation, obviously, in the carbon area where companies are going to have to actually invent new accounting methods to those they have used traditionally. Red tape is the number one issue that my constituents come to me about. They say, 'We are drowning in it'—and here we have just another raft of red tape which is going to tie the industry up. Even the government Office of Best Practice Regulation says that the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of these bills.





On the balance we cannot possibly support these bills. We will be moving some amendments which will be more in line with what the Ripoll inquiry recommended. That was the point of the inquiry and it was the point of the announced decision, and now we are being asked to support something which is entirely different. I will be opposing these bills unless, of course, the government is to take on our amendments and allow us to achieve good quantitative change.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:29):  I join with my colleagues in speaking on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011, being debated cognately with the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011, and in opposing the bills in their present form. I start by pointing out to the House that what we are witnessing here today from the government, amazingly, is yet another episode in legislative rush, which we have seen has led to grief in so many other portfolio areas over their period in government. This shines a light on this government's incompetent legislative processes. The way they go about trying to legislate in this area is so similar to what we have seen in other areas where there has been policy failure and policy catastrophe.


As speakers on our side of the House have outlined over the past 24 hours, the legislation in its present form cannot be supported. A range of reasons for that have been articulated throughout the course of the debate, but also over many weeks and months. Despite this, the government will stubbornly press ahead. They will do so while many on their back bench know full well that this is flawed legislation and that, as my colleague who spoke before me pointed out, it will cost jobs and choice. If this legislation succeeds it will make Australia the world champions of red tape in the financial services industry.


It is a shame because, despite the incompetence of the ministers bringing this legislation forward, those on Labor's back bench in their party room—or their caucus, as they call it—would know that this is damaging legislation. Yet they are prepared to support it. It is not just a reflection on the failure of senior ministers—and what a failure it has been, as speakers on our side of the House have outlined—but it is also a massive reflection on the failure of those in the caucus. Some have been very involved, for a number of years, in the parliamentary inquiry that I have been on. They have seen this legislation evolve in the past few weeks and they would know full well, as the previous speaker pointed out, that it will cost jobs, that it will cost choice, that it will increase red tape and that it will be bad legislation.


Our side of the House has outlined that we will move a number of amendments. If these amendments were to be supported, this legislation would be what it should be. But, at present, as we have outlined, it is unnecessarily complex. It will, as I have just said, cost jobs. It will enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst providers and favour a government-friendly business model. As just pointed out, it will cost $700 million to implement and $350 million a year to comply with—and those are conservative industry estimates. I point out at the outset that the criticisms the coalition brings forward are echoed right throughout the industry by so many of those within it. That is why the coalition has put forward its views on amendments. Those views have not just been put forward throughout the course of this debate. Importantly, what these amendments embody has been very much part of the public discussion throughout the course of inquiries, including the inquiry by the joint committee of which I am a member. Unfortunately the government has done what it has done on so many occasions when it is seeking to bring in a change: it has refused to listen and it is stubbornly pressing ahead.


I want to briefly take some of the House's time to outline the areas in which we are seeking critical amendment on this legislation. Firstly—and you would think it would be an uncontested fact—the government should be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on these reforms as compiled by the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation. That is contestable. It in itself says so much about the government's approach. According to the government's own office the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of these changes on business and consumers and to assess the cost-benefit of any proposed changes. That is not an assessment that coalition members and senators made; that is an assessment that the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation has made.


Secondly, the government's proposal for an opt-in is an illustration of the chaotic policymaking on that side. Back in 2009, I think it was—and Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, you would recall this, because I know you follow these issues—we had the Ripoll inquiry. It was a significant inquiry into financial services. If this legislation passes, the proposal for opt-in imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis.




Mr Ramsey:
  You can get your drivers licence for 10 years.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  That is right. And they have to go through that process each year—having to sign a form every single year. You would think that after the government had had the Ripoll inquiry they would take notice of that proposal in this legislation. It was never part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations, and here it is in this legislation.


Thirdly, we have here a retrospective application of additional annual fee disclosure requirements. We think that should be removed. We think the drafting of the best-interest test should be improved, and speakers on our side have outlined that in some detail. This legislation's treatment of the issue of risk insurance inside superannuation has been a confused and ever-changing position on the part of the government that again reflects their chaotic decision making in so many ways. We think that needs to be refined. Again, the Ripoll inquiry did not make any recommendations to ban commissions paid for risk insurance products. Coalition committee members support the banning of conflicted remuneration structures—I was one of those—such as product commissions et cetera. But again, the fact that they had the Ripoll inquiry, the fact they have ignored and gone down another route, you have to ask yourself why? I think the previous speaker on our side, the member for Grey, hit the nail on the head and it was a sensitive point with the member opposite, point which is why it needs to be hammered home: the opt-in provision which I spoke of earlier. The opt-in was not part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations, and in this context it is important to note that the industry super network provided the only submission to the original Ripoll inquiry arguing in favour of opt-in.


Each of these areas I have run through is illustrative of the government's change of position in so many respects and it leads to the final area of proposed amendment and that is the simple proposition, you would think for those who are rushing: that the timetable for implementation is clearly unrealistic in the legislation. Members have argued on this side of the House that the government should have at least aligned the implementation of any changes it proposes to make. We would still hope, as faded a hope it is, that just once after so many policy catastrophes in so many areas on that side of the House, just once, common sense might prevail. If this happens, you would think government backbenchers would say, 'Hey, we are rushing into another policy train wreck here and what we should do is'—and hopefully they would accept our amendments. If you are going to implement major change, and our amendments would improve that, have a realistic time frame and align it with the proposed MySuper changes and implement it in July next year, rather than this year.


What I predict is that the government, after stubbornly ignoring every argument that has been put forward, at the last minute will propose some of their own amendments. That seems to be the way. My colleague the member for Cowper next to me has experienced this so many times. Here we are on that last day of sitting before budget day. The House will sit until 5 pm today, and the government is madly rushing to ram through significant changes that it has not thought through properly—and we will assume the minister responsible is ignorant; but I would not make the claim. I would never make the claim that every single member of the Labor caucus is ignorant. Let me just state for the record that the member opposite said he is ignorant. But, even to help him out, I will disagree with him.


I would not say that every single member of the Labor caucus is ignorant, and they are culpable. Today they will vote for something many of them know will be bad legislation. They will vote for it today and rush it through before budget day. They will do so in the full knowledge that they are following in the footsteps of so many other bad decisions by this government. But we have hope, slight hope, that one thing might happen inside the Labor caucus and that is that someone stands up and says, 'Let's get a policy right'.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-03-22,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (10:44):  I commend the contribution of the member for Casey on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I also rise to make a contribution on these bills. This legislation is just another example of this government being out of touch with an industry which is so important to the Australian economy. Instead of proposing legislative changes that will make the industry more transparent and improve the service provided to clients, the government has tabled changes which could have a devastating impact on the financial services and advice sector. As some of my coalition colleagues have already noted, the future of financial advice bills in their current form will, firstly, create huge layers of additional complexity; secondly, cause increased unemployment within the industry; thirdly, create an unlevel playing field among advice providers by favouring those businesses which are more government friendly; and, fourthly, cost somewhere around $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per year to comply with. They are really huge numbers.


A good government would never seek to impose such extreme changes on such an important sector in our economy, but then again this government has a very strong record of wreaking as much damage as possible on Australian businesses and the millions of people that they employ. We all know that manufacturers and small businesses will be hit hard by the carbon tax. We all know our miners will soon be subjected to a mining tax, and here today we are discussing legislation which will hit the financial services sector hard. It is important to note that this legislation has been introduced at a time when there is a low level of personal and investor confidence in the Australian economy. It is the failings of this government that have led to a low level of confidence. This government has made a difficult situation worse through economic mismanagement and punitive legislation. The Australian business community is crying out for certainty from their national government. Australian consumers are seeking stability. They are seeking job security, yet at every turn they have a government which is undermining the confidence of investors, and that is flowing through to all sectors of the economy.


It is with this in mind that I raise my concerns about the proposed changes to the industry that provides financial advice to Australians. The industry exists to assist Australians better manage their financial risks and maximise their financial returns. An appropriately robust regulatory framework must be in place, as financial services providers deal with other people's money on a day-to-day basis. The industry is especially important in my electorate of Cowper, where a number of constituents are either in or approaching retirement and need reliable and transparent financial advice. Decisions made on the recommendations of professionals in this industry will mean large variations in their standard of living, particularly in retirement years.


As we look back on the global financial crisis, I recognise that the financial services industry generally performed well, although I shall discuss some of the exceptions later. Some of this success can be linked to the reforms which were legislated by the Howard government in 2001. That said, like other industries, the financial services industry is constantly changing, and regulations surrounding it need to reflect that change.


It is not hard to support the general principle of having more transparency in this important industry, especially when there is a large information asymmetry between the providers of financial advice and their clients. But, as with most changes this government implements, the devil is in the detail—and what a devil it is. Changes should not be made simply for the sake of change. In seeking to make regulatory change, the government should be focusing on doing things better and not in a more complex and more expensive way. These changes are coming from a government that promised a 'one in, one out' policy—one regulation drawn up and one taken away. Let us look at their record. How has the 'one in, one out' policy gone? I am afraid it is not a very good scorecard, because we have had 16,000 new regulations and less than 100 repealed. With this record, I have very little confidence that these changes will ease the regulatory burden on the financial advice industry.


During the financial crisis there were a number of high-profile collapses in financial service providers across Australia, with the notable examples of Westpoint, Storm Financial and Trio. With the hindsight of these collapses, it is important to assess what went wrong and what could be changed in order to minimise the risk of and hopefully prevent future collapses. Every member in this place will be aware of the devastation that occurred in many families as they suffered and, in some cases, lost their homes when they were advised to use those homes as security for the purchase of investments.


So, in February 2009, the parliament asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services. That inquiry, referred to as the Ripoll inquiry, reported back in November 2009 and made a number of sensible recommendations to reform the industry. The main recommendation was to introduce a fiduciary duty for financial advisers requiring them to place their clients' interests ahead of their own. The recommendations provided a blueprint that the government could have adopted with bipartisan support. It was noted in the Ripoll inquiry in 2009:


… the committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations—


and I stress that: enforcing existing regulations—


rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations.


Unfortunately, this was not considered in this reform package, and it has been hijacked by this government succumbing to vested interests. Reforms that are important to the financial advice industry have been delayed by over two years while this government made various changes without consideration of the costs involved or of other consequences.


I now want to raise specific concerns that the coalition have with these regulations. The bills fail the government's own standards, and certainly they represent another broken election promise. As previously mentioned, this government came to office with a promise to reduce regulation and red tape, which is a good aim for government. In fact, the coalition have a deregulation task force that has been specifically established to reduce the regulatory burden on business. A regulatory impact statement is a tool that government has available to review the proposed legislation so that it can assess it for unintended consequences. This will also give a clear picture of the costs for the increased red tape that might be borne by businesses and consumers. According to the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation, the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of FoFA on businesses and consumers or to assess the costs and benefits of the proposed changes. In an industry as complex as financial services and relied upon by so many, this is not acceptable, especially with the contentious parts of the proposed FoFA reforms.


The drafting and tabling of this legislation epitomises how this government tends to manage major reform. Instead of investing the time and the resources to get the detail right, it leaves everything to the last minute and then produces legislation that fails to address the key issues. Such poor management of the legislation has now led the government to try and rush it through the parliament. It is an absolute disgrace that this legislation will not even be considered by the Senate before May, with only six weeks before the proposed start date. What type of government would seek to manage such a reform when there is simply not enough time for the changes to be implemented by the financial services industry?


Given that the MySuper start date is proposed for 1 July 2013, it simply makes sense to implement FoFA and MySuper at the same time. Not only would this give industry sufficient time to make the significant changes that are required; it would also allow participants to make the required changes to their IT systems for both reforms at the same time. It is also well known that a large number of people approach their advisers for financial advice at the end of the financial year. The advisers that are attempting to implement these huge changes will at the same time be coping with their busiest time of the year. Well considered reforms of the financial services industry would consider the conditions of the industry and not thrust change upon them when they are least able to implement it.


The changes proposed by the government are also draconian because they are retrospective. These changes will add an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided by financial service product providers to their clients. As I have previously said, I welcome changes that increase transparency in the industry; however, this measure was not in the Ripoll inquiry and was only included by the government at the last minute. It has been estimated by the Financial Services Council that the implementation of the fee disclosure requirements will cost approximately $53 per client for new clients and $98 per existing client. The additional costs borne by retrospective fee disclosure will add absolutely no additional consumer protection benefits. Yet the additional cost will either have to come from the financial adviser or by way of reduced returns to the consumer.


The government made a commitment during the consultation period that the additional annual fee disclosure requirements would apply prospectively only. This is another example of the Gillard government promising one thing only to renege on that promise when it comes to the implementation. Not everyone would want to go to a financial adviser to receive a full financial plan. Many want to receive advice on only a specific need that they have, be it a specific type of insurance or savings product. Scalable advice is the concept of focusing advice on areas specifically identified by the client. The provision of scalable advice would allow many people to access advice more frequently for specific matters. The changes would allow the provision of scalable advice where the request for such limited or scaled advice is instigated by the client. This would ensure that clients are able to access affordable and appropriate financial advice as and when it is required and not when the client is able to afford a full financial plan.


I welcome the amendments that the coalition is proposing. They are sensible amendments that include: the government would be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on the FoFA changes; the changes be assessed as compliant by the government Office of Best Practice Regulation; the opt-in be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirements be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty be improved; a ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and the implementation of FoFA to be delayed until 1 July 2013 to align it with the MySuper.


The rushed nature of this legislation certainly is of concern. But the overwhelming concern for most Australians with this new legislation is that they have no faith in this government's ability to deliver change. They have seen the government bungle reform at every turn, they have seen the government bungle programs. The Australian people have lost faith in this government. When you are looking at an area as complex as the FoFA reforms, as detailed as the FoFA reforms, how can the Australian people have faith in a government that could not put pink batt in roofs, and could not build school halls without massive cost overruns? How could the Australian people have faith in a government that is incapable of implementing the simplest program? How could they have faith in this government implementing changes as complex as those that are proposed under FoFA? We see Australians very concerned about the implications of the carbon tax for the same reasons. They have seen the government's failure in program implementation. They can see the complexity of the carbon tax, as massive as it is, and the massive burden that the carbon tax will place on the Australian economy and on Australian business. They do not trust this government to implement matters of such complexity.


So I say this to the government: take note of the amendments prepared by the coalition. The coalition has a track record when in government of implementing sound policy. The coalition has a track record in government of ensuring that government is conducted on a competent basis. The coalition can be trusted with government whereas the current government is certainly under a cloud of distrust with regard to the Australian people. The current government certainly is not considered by the Australian people capable of implementing complex reforms such as those proposed in these bills.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:00):  I would like to thank all the members who have contributed to this important debate. Financial advice is an important step in the wealth management industry in our community. Therefore I value the participation of all members on this legislative package, which represents the most comprehensive set of reforms relating to financial advice in the last decade. This debate has been about the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011.


I shall address some of the specific issues that have been raised by members, but first I would like to make some brief remarks about the measures contained in the bills. These two bills implement the government's future of financial advice reforms, the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. This inquiry was commissioned in the wake of the high-profile collapses of Storm Financial and Opes Prime. In combination, these bills contain a number of vital measures to restore trust and confidence in the financial advice sector.


Firstly, the bill sets in place arrangements requiring financial advisers to obtain their retail clients' agreement in order to charge them ongoing fees for financial advice. That is the opt-in requirement. This measure promotes the active renewal by the client to ongoing fees for advice with the opportunity to consider whether they are receiving value for money. This very basic requirement is that advisers must obtain their clients' agreement to renew at least once every two years as well as giving clients a fee disclosure statement at least once every 12 months. If the client does not respond to the renewal notice, they are assumed to have terminated the advice relationship and no further fees can be charged by the adviser. That said, if advisers charge on a per piece of advice basis rather than on an ongoing basis then the opt-in requirement will not apply to them. Overall, we want financial advice to focus on the client and what is in the client's best interest. Advisers should be in regular contact with their clients if they are charging them regular fees and I know many financial advisers already are.


In addition, today I can announce that the government will be moving an amendment that offers financial advisers an alternative to the opt-in requirement. This amendment will allow ASIC to provide class order relief from the opt-in requirement to licensees and representatives who are signatories to an ASIC approved professional code of conduct by 1 July 2015. Importantly, such an ASIC approved code would need to include practices and conduct requirements that obviate the need for the opt-in requirement. This amendment ensures that the opt-in requirement is linked in legislation to the class order relief for licensees and representatives.


Further, under this proposal, the government will introduce legislation into parliament by 1 July 2013 that will enshrine the term 'financial planner' or 'financial adviser' in law. I am grateful to the members for New England and Lyne in developing these propositions. The government will conduct consultation with organisations, such as the Financial Planners Association and Choice, to ensure that these measures are implemented in the most effective way possible.


Returning to the measures in the bill, the second measure enhances the capacity of ASIC to supervise the financial services industry and boosts its ability to protect investors by restricting or removing unscrupulous operators from the industry. The changes will implement the PJC recommendations in this area and will strengthen ASIC's administrative powers, as they apply to licensees and representatives, to strengthen the gatekeeping function of the licensing regime and extend ASIC's powers to remove unsatisfactory persons from the industry.


Third, the bills impose a statutory best interest duty on financial advisers. This will be a legislative requirement to ensure that financial advisers are focused on what is best for their clients. While this will ultimately lead to better advice in many cases, it is about regulating conflicts. It is not about regulating for the best investment return. As I have said previously in the House, the best interest duty does not require that advisers give the best advice. It does not require perfection in statements of advice by applying the benefit of hindsight. The duty strikes a balance between certainty and flexibility for the financial adviser. The duty requires the provider of the advice to take steps that would be reasonably regarded as being in the best interests of the client given the client's relevant circumstances. For most advisers, this is business as usual. For some advisers, who perhaps have not always put their clients' interests first or are otherwise driven by conflicts, the duty will require them to adapt their practices. The government makes no apology for legislating to change behaviour in any industry to ensure Australian consumers are better off and can retire more comfortably.


Finally, the bill implements a key aspect of the government's response to the Ripoll report—a ban on the receipt of conflicted remuneration by financial advisers including product commissions. It is so important that ordinary mums and dads can engage a financial adviser without having to worry about whether the adviser is a professional or really just a product salesman. These measures ensure that advisers are working for the consumer, not the product provider. In short, advisers will not be able to receive remuneration from product issuers or anyone else which could reasonably be expected to influence financial advice provided to a retail client. On previous occasions I have congratulated many in the industry that have already moved away from product commissions towards a fee-for-service model. These industry leaders will be well-placed to embrace the new opportunities that the reforms present.


The government recognises the significance of these reforms for the financial services industry. I have already announced—to reassure the member for Cowper—smoother application arrangements to assist people to transition into the post-FoFA world.




Honourable members interjecting
—





Mr SHORTEN:
  We remain optimistic. Under these arrangements, application of the reforms will not be mandatory until 1 July 2013. The government will introduce amendments to give effect to this in the winter sittings.


This brings me to some of the specific issues raised by members. There has been a lot of comment about the fact that opt-in was never recommended by the original Ripoll inquiry. That is true, but it was recommended by another inquiry; and that is the Cooper review of superannuation. It was recommendation 1.12 on page 26 of the final report of the Cooper review. It said:


Members of MySuper products should only be provided with advice about superannuation (other than intra-fund advice) under arrangements that require the member to renew the advice service each year on a renewal notice from the adviser.


There has also been a lot of comment that these reforms will cost jobs. These claims about job losses have not been substantiated and have been rebutted and dismissed as 'silly' by senior officials of our national Department of Treasury. I believe the greatest threat to financial services jobs is the coalition, which voted against the increase in superannuation. Our government is lifting superannuation from nine to 12 per cent and adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the pool of funds to be managed by the wealth management industry. With more money to manage, this will create more jobs for people to manage the money. This is good for jobs in financial advice, life insurance, funds management and fund administration. The government is also opening up new markets for financial advice by making it easier to provide limited or scaled advice. This will make it easier for the industry to provide advice to the 60 to 80 per cent of Australians who currently do not take financial advice.


There has certainly been a lot of strong leadership by the government, the industry and consumer movement to get to this point today. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and determination of my ministerial predecessors. I would also like to acknowledge the leadership displayed by the Financial Planning Association of Australia and its CEO, Mr Mark Rantall. Whilst he has never supported opt-in, he recognises that this latest proposition will ultimately improve the professionalism of the industry. I also acknowledge the work of Choice and Jenni Mack. I acknowledge the work of the Industry Super Network, with Ms Robbie Campo and Mr David Whiteley. I indeed appreciate the contributions from the large retail and financial institutions who provided me with constant advice and allowed us, in our latest set of amendments, to update to reflect the pragmatic knowledge of industry.


In conclusion, advice—that is, any advice, whether from an engineer, a solicitor or a doctor—can be good advice only if you have trust and confidence in it. If people do not have trust or confidence that it is quality advice and cannot trust that the advice is in their interests, it will always be difficult to convince them that they need financial advice, which I believe Australians do. It will certainly be very hard to convince people that they should pay for advice if there is a cloud over the merits or the motivations of the advice that you are receiving from a financial planner. I know many financial planners—they are dedicated and hardworking. Many financial planners have already arrived at the point that this legislation is taking us too. I also believe, however, that ordinary Australians should be able to expect that a licensed financial planner will be able to provide them with the advice of a certain quality and, most importantly, that they can trust the adviser is working in their interests.


The need for people to get the help they need to manage their financial affairs and to ensure that they have adequate requirement savings is simply too important, particularly in the context of an ageing population concerned about making sure they have an adequate income in retirement. It is for this reason: if we are going to create a compulsory stream of wealth in Australia and compulsory savings of superannuation, we must ensure that the financial transactions in the back office are provided in the most efficient way and the best interests of consumers. These reforms will enhance the quality of and access to professional and impartial financial planning advice.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:00):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I welcome in particular the opportunity to represent the financial advisers in my electorate of Swan, many of whom have serious concerns about this bill and the process that the government has undertaken to this point. There are a lot of people employed as financial advisers across the electorate of Swan, and I quite often get approached by people from this sector at events I attend. I have held a meeting with a representative group in my office, and it is important that the House realises how concerned these organisations are with the direction the government is taking with this legislation. It is unbelievable how many groups this government has managed to put offside simply through its management and processes.


In this chamber on 23 June 2011 I raised concerns with the way the government was proceeding with this legislation and spoke about some of the concerns that have been raised by financial advisers in my electorate of Swan. They were extremely unhappy with the way the government was proceeding with legislation. Unfortunately, nine months later the government has failed to take on-board points raised by the industry and coalition, and that has led to the situation where we cannot support these bills in their current form.


This behaviour of ignoring advice is typical of this government, which has taken to ignoring good advice from the coalition and from industry on not only this legislation but also multiple pieces of legislation that have gone through this place since 2007.


After a consultation with industry, and careful consideration, the coalition will be moving a series of amendments to these bills, and we ask that Minister Shorten and crossbench members consider them seriously and support them. The amendments can be summarised as follows: the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA assessed as compliant by the government Office of Best Practice Regulation; opt-in be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement also be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty be improved; the ban on commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and implementation of FoFA be delayed to 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper.


I will talk in more detail on these amendments later, but it is first worth considering the background to this legislation and the background to the industry. The financial sector industry is a vital industry not only to the wellbeing of the Australian economy but also to many small- to medium-sized investors in Australia. The role the industry plays is to give the best possible advice to investors and of course up-to-date advice that will enable the investor to improve their financial positions. Areas that advisers might assist with include life insurance, superannuation, mortgages, pension planning and so on. These are important areas and in the Liberal Party we see it as a real positive when people choose to organise their financial affairs—their pensions, the superannuation and their mortgages—because this takes pressure off the government and the public service. This is why this legislation is so important today. The last thing we want to be doing as a parliament is making it more difficult for people to access local financial advisers in the community. However, this is what this bill is going to do.


It is worth going back to understand the history of the legislation and the implementation of it. As the shadow minister said, in the wake of the global financial crisis, there were a number of high-profile collapses of financial service providers across Australia in particular the collapses of Storm Financial, Trio and Westpoint. The federal government felt that it had to do something and commissioned an inquiry into financial services, which became known as the Ripoll inquiry named after the chair of that committee, the member for Oxley. As I have said before, I have some sympathy for the member for Oxley because he put some effort into his inquiry only for the government to completely ignore his recommendations. It is a shame because the Ripoll inquiry provided a blueprint that the government could have adopted with bipartisan support.


One of the key observations of the Ripoll inquiry was that:


… the committee is of the general view that the situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations.


The reforms referred to were the 2001 legislative changes which provided a strong regulatory foundation for the financial services industry. It would have been ideal to move in a bipartisan manner based on the Ripoll inquiry not just between the parties in the parliament but also between those in the financial services industry. The inquiry reported back in November 2009. Think of the progress that could have been made since that time. However, instead the government embarked on a different path that has led to this legislation today, 22 March 2012, in which it managed to put offside just about every financial adviser in the country. Even at this point though there was an opportunity for the government to see sense, start listening, and produce some good legislation through an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the bills. However, they did not listen, which was disappointing for many who have made submissions to the inquiry. I received an email from one of my constituents, who is an authorised representative of a financial group, who wanted to bring the response from the industry to my attention as soon as possible. The press statement he sent to us said:


Industry bodies have expressed their disappointment at the findings of the Parliamentary Joint Committee's (PJC) review into the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) Bills.


A report outlining findings of the review was tabled in Parliament today. However, the PJC was unable to reach a consensus in relation to the proposed legislation, with the Coalition Committee members issuing a dissenting report.


…   …   …


The Financial Planning Association (FPA) said the PJC had missed an opportunity to deliver the benefits that FoFA was originally intended to bring.


I will also read out some comments that my constituent brought to my attention. These are comments that were posted on a financial blog after the news of the committee report came through. One comment said:


It has been quite clear from the beginning that this government pretends to consult and then does what it wants to do pandering to vested interests. Labor MPs have no say in the matter. Nothing will happen unless the government is changed.


In another comment from that particular website Alistair said:


The PJC fails in delivery is not really a surprise given this governments approach in ALL it has so called achieved to date. This government whose ministers are nothing short of self interest incompetants who cannot run a canteen let alone a country have once again demonstrated that they are only willing to support the cause of self interest for themselves and their union mates. Enough is enough. As members of this industry, we should rally to a call not only to save this industry but also the nations by asking clients to petition the coalition to block supply and call an election. Its time for this bunch of arrogant morons to go. They do not deserve to be in office.


That is an indication of how much passion there is around this particular bill, particularly from the industry. Another comment posted by Steve said:


One of the most glaring examples of the government pandering to the unions is the acknowledgement by Swan and Shorten that while they will stop volume rebates payments from platforms to independant advisers, they will not stop union super funds’ secretly subsidising their advisers because it’s too hard!


I want to use the time that I have left to make a couple of specific points on the legislation as it stands and in particular the amendments that the coalition are putting up.


Over the past two years there have been constant and completely unexpected changes to the proposed regulatory arrangements under FoFA right up until the introduction of the current legislation. Invariably, this was done without proper appreciation or assessment of the costs involved of any unintended consequences or other implications flowing from the proposed changes. Important financial advice reforms have been delayed by more than two years so that the government can press ahead with a number of contentious issues.


In my speech of 23 June 2011 I raised, on behalf of my constituent, an issue related to the opt-in proposal, which is now a component of this legislation. Opt-in imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to keep re-signing contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. This imposes an additional level of red tape on the industry. Last week I spoke about red tape in business and the 12,835 new regulations the government has introduced in comparison to the 58 it has repealed, despite the Kevin 07 one-in one-out promise. This legislation would surely add to this tally. As the shadow minister said, it would make Australia world champions in financial services red tape.


During the Senate estimates process it was revealed that the average small business financial advisory firm would face additional costs of $50,000 per annum. It is interesting—this week particularly—to see how the government has portrayed itself as a friend of small business. I, for one, who have run a small business for 25 years and employed 16 people, understand what it means to run a small business. I have experienced the cost of compliance and red tape implemented by government. Unfortunately, yesterday on the doors we saw a poor effort by a so-called small business woman who is now in parliament. The member for Canberra was trying to explain the new superannuation situation and who would pay. We all know—all business knows—that businesses will pay. It will not be as a result of the MRRT; small business will pay the new three per cent levy. This cost will easily wipe out the so-called benefit to small business of the one per cent tax cut.


It is surprising that the government is pursuing the opt-in proposal, not least because there was only one submission to the Ripoll inquiry arguing in favour of opt-in. The measures in place—which already include best interest duty, appropriate transparency of fees charged  and an ongoing capacity for financial advisers to opt out of any advice relationship at any stage—provide for consumer protection without the need to impose additional costs and red tape on both businesses and consumers. The coalition has a clear position on this—that is, opt-in should be removed altogether.


On a logistical and operational point, I make a few comments on the time frame for implementation of this legislation. The current implementation date of 1 July 2012 is completely unrealistic given that it is only four months away. Considering the red tape concerns I have just spoken about, four months is not sufficient time to prepare for these changes. The fact that the government thinks that this is possible shows, again, the government's lack of understanding of business realities. I repeat: it is disappointing that there is virtually no-one on the Labor side with any real experience of running small business. As such, the coalition will move an amendment for the opt-in to be removed from FoFA. I hope that this attracts the support of the Independents.


In my speech of 23 June last year I mentioned that the proposed ban on commissions on risk insurance was perhaps the most controversial aspect of the legislation among industry. The government's position on this matter has been confusing and ever-changing. Banning commissions on risk insurance will increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off, particularly the small business people who self-manage their future. There is already a problem of underinsurance in Australia. A ban would exacerbate this. What is more, recent experience in the UK showed that a ban does not work, which is why the UK reversed its decision.


The coalition's position is clear: we agree that Australians who receive automatic risk insurance within their super fund without accessing any advice should not be required to pay commissions. However, those Australians who require and seek advice to ensure adequate risk cover, whether inside or outside their super fund, should have the same opportunity to choose the most appropriate remuneration arrangement for them.


In conclusion, as the member for Swan and someone who has had some experience dealing with small business, I cannot support this legislation in its current form. It is a result of a messy process, it has no support in the community and it puts the financial services industry at risk. The Ripoll review could have taken us forward in a bipartisan way in 2009. But now, three years on, we have been presented with this poor piece of legislation. I support the coalition amendments, which will be moved at the conclusion of this debate.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:14):  I rise to address these two bills. Retirement investment has become very, very important in Australia, and I think it is something to do with our age grouping. Many of us are classified as baby boomers and, as the baby boomer generation has come through, they have benefitted from a great growth in Australia's economic fortunes in that time. Over that period they have been able to designate, in many cases, shorter working lives and be able to make decisions for their future, where slowly the emphasis on providing for our retirement has shifted from government to the individual.


In many cases some of these individuals will be retired for a very long time—possibly 30 years and in some cases 35 years. That means great care has to be taken in one's working life to make sure we have those nest eggs available to us to sustain us in the manner to which we have become accustomed.


In that light, successive governments have made a number of legislative changes which have encouraged people to put money into superannuation type products. Even at the moment we have the ability not only to take the superannuation paid by employers but to top up, even though I was disappointed in the last parliament when the government actually reduced the amount that people could put voluntarily into super.


This general reorganisation of our lives has led to a great escalation in the financial services sector. There is of course general investing, where people buy shares and invest in bank type products, long-term bonds and property. But then there has been a great growth in superannuation type products, both fully managed and self-managed. In the light of some occurrences in the last three years, which actually brought about the Ripoll inquiry, it is this great growth in self-managed superannuation funds that I think will give people pause to have a bit of a think about the way they do business because they have proven to be the most at-risk product and the one with no fall back.


Investors generally place their trust in financial advisers, and this is a good thing. Even though they generally are thorough, honest and professional in the advice they give, there are always those who are not and there are those who make genuine mistakes—in fact, we all make genuine mistakes in life. Financial advisers place a great deal of trust in the organisations that regulate them, including ASIC.


One of ASIC's jobs is to register companies, and register and manage investment schemes. I think there are a number of financial advisers out there, and many people out there, who place a great deal of trust in this registration process and believe that those companies offering services that are registered under ASIC's approval will be robust and be able to meet their commitments as they go forward. Unfortunately, the events of the last few years when we saw the collapse of Storm, Trio and Westpoint provide that this is not sufficient protection and people cannot be fully confident in ASIC's ability to register those companies that have true integrity.


While we are right to focus on the role of local advisers, we should also be having an objective look at the way ASIC license companies into this arena and allow them to operate and offer products. The government commissioned the Ripoll inquiry as a reaction to the collapse of those three companies, and quite rightly. They have done the right thing. I have had private meetings with Bernie Ripoll and I believe that that committee attacked their chore with great vigour and a clear focus on what they needed to achieve. That is why it is important that the government and all of us be careful with the recommendations—the results—that came out of the Ripoll inquiry. The first rule of government, in my humble opinion, let me say, should be to cause as little harm as possible. These bills vary in a number of ways from the unanimous recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry and that is why the opposition will be moving amendments, and that is why we are somewhat wary of what is being proposed here. It is why I am somewhat wary.


I have had an enormous amount of contact on this issue. My friends who are accountants and financial advisers are not normally the most demonstrative of people within our community. But in this particular case they have been properly fired up, and I have had an enormous amount of contact. I have met with a number of financial advisers. I must place on the record that the electorate of Grey was one of the two most affected electorates by the collapse of the Trio Group. There was over $100 million invested in the Trio Group from within my electorate. That came from one medium to large financial advisers group that had recommended their clients invest in this area. Over that period I have had many contacts with constituents who are extremely concerned about their life savings. Not only were they worried about their security but they were worried about the fact that their funds were locked up for a period of almost three years. The ability to run their lives without a secure form of income coming in became very stressful for them. In the end, they were enormously grateful and relieved that the insurance, that is, the levy on the industry, underwrote the risk that they had, and they received their money back. But some still lost significantly, and they were those who were in the self-managed super funds I first mentioned. I believe the loss from Trio Group capital is around $60 million in self-managed super investment funds Australia wide.


To return to the contact that I have had from financial advisers in the industry, the biggest concern without a doubt is the opt-in package that has been brought forward in these bills. That means that once every 12 months the financial adviser has to sit down with their client and reassess the suitability of the package for them and in many cases just collect a signature. That is going to be quite an impost for anybody within the industry to achieve—to have to bring their clients in once every 12 months. You have to make time in your working day. That will require weekend work to try to work around people's schedules. But in the country, it is always different. In the country things are done differently. With insurance agents and financial services deliverers, many of their contacts are made on a personal basis. If you live in a rural setting that means a visit to the farm. In any given day you might get to four or six clients. If you have a couple of hundred clients on your books, that is going to take around 40 days of your time. There is no way that these financial services deliverers will not have to pass those costs onto the people. It takes a bit of time to visit someone in their house. It is all very well to have someone into your office for 20 minutes. But in the rural and regional way we have of doing business, a visit involves time to sit down and have a cup of tea and talk about how the children are going. A little bit of time evaporates. So that is where a large amount of this extra cost will be. The industry estimates it will be $700 million to implement and then a further $350 million per annum to operate. Opt-in was not one of the Ripoll committee's recommendations. That is why I said at the outset that governments should always cause the least harm possible. I am not sure—in fact I am far from convinced on these bills—that that is the government's underwriting guide at all.


You have to ask yourself why; why is the government so intent on thrusting this extra cost on? I understand the argument that they want more security for the consumers. I understand that. But it is far from clear that many of these changes are going to give extra security. It is interesting to note in the evidence that the one group that asked for opt-in were the industry super funds.


This is a recurring theme in this parliament: this alliance, this close relationship, between the government and the Australian Labor Party and industry super funds, which are controlled by their partners in politics, the Australian union movement.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr RAMSEY:
  The reason is that we only have to look at the payments from the unions to support the ALP in their electoral quest to understand why the relationship is so close. There has been a lot of noise made in the last few days about some prominent individuals in the Australian community who choose to support the Liberal Party. It is this behind-the-scenes manoeuvring which underwrites the future of the ALP. It was not part—




Mr Husic:
  That's rubbish!




Mr RAMSEY:
  I am in the Federation Chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would ask that you would ask the member to remain silent.




Mr Husic:
  He is making an outrageous accusation!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Windsor
):  Order!





Mr RAMSEY:

If it was not part of the recommendations, in that light, it should be eschewed. The time frame is a concern; the industry is very worried about the time frame. It took three months and 10 days to get this enormous change, this enormous new raft of financial regulation, into the Australian financial services sector. It is far too short. In fact, the government has shown in the last few years that they cannot organise a piece of legislation to get through this place in under about two years, and they expect the financial services industry to adapt to these changes which are not yet through parliament in less than three months. That is far too short; it should not be allowed.





As I draw towards the close I would like to focus on some of the words that came from the Ripoll inquiry. This is a quote:





The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy.





That is an amazing statement. The committee that the government set up, dominated by government members, has said that the framework is not too bad, but what is happening here is that it is not properly enforced. But they have come back now and presented a pair of bills which are about laying a whole new layer of regulation over this industry. This is a recurring theme with the government.





Last week we had new regulation in the transport industry. We are having new regulation, obviously, in the carbon area where companies are going to have to actually invent new accounting methods to those they have used traditionally. Red tape is the number one issue that my constituents come to me about. They say, 'We are drowning in it'—and here we have just another raft of red tape which is going to tie the industry up. Even the government Office of Best Practice Regulation says that the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of these bills.





On the balance we cannot possibly support these bills. We will be moving some amendments which will be more in line with what the Ripoll inquiry recommended. That was the point of the inquiry and it was the point of the announced decision, and now we are being asked to support something which is entirely different. I will be opposing these bills unless, of course, the government is to take on our amendments and allow us to achieve good quantitative change.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:29):  I join with my colleagues in speaking on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011, being debated cognately with the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011, and in opposing the bills in their present form. I start by pointing out to the House that what we are witnessing here today from the government, amazingly, is yet another episode in legislative rush, which we have seen has led to grief in so many other portfolio areas over their period in government. This shines a light on this government's incompetent legislative processes. The way they go about trying to legislate in this area is so similar to what we have seen in other areas where there has been policy failure and policy catastrophe.


As speakers on our side of the House have outlined over the past 24 hours, the legislation in its present form cannot be supported. A range of reasons for that have been articulated throughout the course of the debate, but also over many weeks and months. Despite this, the government will stubbornly press ahead. They will do so while many on their back bench know full well that this is flawed legislation and that, as my colleague who spoke before me pointed out, it will cost jobs and choice. If this legislation succeeds it will make Australia the world champions of red tape in the financial services industry.


It is a shame because, despite the incompetence of the ministers bringing this legislation forward, those on Labor's back bench in their party room—or their caucus, as they call it—would know that this is damaging legislation. Yet they are prepared to support it. It is not just a reflection on the failure of senior ministers—and what a failure it has been, as speakers on our side of the House have outlined—but it is also a massive reflection on the failure of those in the caucus. Some have been very involved, for a number of years, in the parliamentary inquiry that I have been on. They have seen this legislation evolve in the past few weeks and they would know full well, as the previous speaker pointed out, that it will cost jobs, that it will cost choice, that it will increase red tape and that it will be bad legislation.


Our side of the House has outlined that we will move a number of amendments. If these amendments were to be supported, this legislation would be what it should be. But, at present, as we have outlined, it is unnecessarily complex. It will, as I have just said, cost jobs. It will enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst providers and favour a government-friendly business model. As just pointed out, it will cost $700 million to implement and $350 million a year to comply with—and those are conservative industry estimates. I point out at the outset that the criticisms the coalition brings forward are echoed right throughout the industry by so many of those within it. That is why the coalition has put forward its views on amendments. Those views have not just been put forward throughout the course of this debate. Importantly, what these amendments embody has been very much part of the public discussion throughout the course of inquiries, including the inquiry by the joint committee of which I am a member. Unfortunately the government has done what it has done on so many occasions when it is seeking to bring in a change: it has refused to listen and it is stubbornly pressing ahead.


I want to briefly take some of the House's time to outline the areas in which we are seeking critical amendment on this legislation. Firstly—and you would think it would be an uncontested fact—the government should be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on these reforms as compiled by the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation. That is contestable. It in itself says so much about the government's approach. According to the government's own office the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of these changes on business and consumers and to assess the cost-benefit of any proposed changes. That is not an assessment that coalition members and senators made; that is an assessment that the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation has made.


Secondly, the government's proposal for an opt-in is an illustration of the chaotic policymaking on that side. Back in 2009, I think it was—and Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor, you would recall this, because I know you follow these issues—we had the Ripoll inquiry. It was a significant inquiry into financial services. If this legislation passes, the proposal for opt-in imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis.




Mr Ramsey:
  You can get your drivers licence for 10 years.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  That is right. And they have to go through that process each year—having to sign a form every single year. You would think that after the government had had the Ripoll inquiry they would take notice of that proposal in this legislation. It was never part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations, and here it is in this legislation.


Thirdly, we have here a retrospective application of additional annual fee disclosure requirements. We think that should be removed. We think the drafting of the best-interest test should be improved, and speakers on our side have outlined that in some detail. This legislation's treatment of the issue of risk insurance inside superannuation has been a confused and ever-changing position on the part of the government that again reflects their chaotic decision making in so many ways. We think that needs to be refined. Again, the Ripoll inquiry did not make any recommendations to ban commissions paid for risk insurance products. Coalition committee members support the banning of conflicted remuneration structures—I was one of those—such as product commissions et cetera. But again, the fact that they had the Ripoll inquiry, the fact they have ignored and gone down another route, you have to ask yourself why? I think the previous speaker on our side, the member for Grey, hit the nail on the head and it was a sensitive point with the member opposite, point which is why it needs to be hammered home: the opt-in provision which I spoke of earlier. The opt-in was not part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations, and in this context it is important to note that the industry super network provided the only submission to the original Ripoll inquiry arguing in favour of opt-in.


Each of these areas I have run through is illustrative of the government's change of position in so many respects and it leads to the final area of proposed amendment and that is the simple proposition, you would think for those who are rushing: that the timetable for implementation is clearly unrealistic in the legislation. Members have argued on this side of the House that the government should have at least aligned the implementation of any changes it proposes to make. We would still hope, as faded a hope it is, that just once after so many policy catastrophes in so many areas on that side of the House, just once, common sense might prevail. If this happens, you would think government backbenchers would say, 'Hey, we are rushing into another policy train wreck here and what we should do is'—and hopefully they would accept our amendments. If you are going to implement major change, and our amendments would improve that, have a realistic time frame and align it with the proposed MySuper changes and implement it in July next year, rather than this year.


What I predict is that the government, after stubbornly ignoring every argument that has been put forward, at the last minute will propose some of their own amendments. That seems to be the way. My colleague the member for Cowper next to me has experienced this so many times. Here we are on that last day of sitting before budget day. The House will sit until 5 pm today, and the government is madly rushing to ram through significant changes that it has not thought through properly—and we will assume the minister responsible is ignorant; but I would not make the claim. I would never make the claim that every single member of the Labor caucus is ignorant. Let me just state for the record that the member opposite said he is ignorant. But, even to help him out, I will disagree with him.


I would not say that every single member of the Labor caucus is ignorant, and they are culpable. Today they will vote for something many of them know will be bad legislation. They will vote for it today and rush it through before budget day. They will do so in the full knowledge that they are following in the footsteps of so many other bad decisions by this government. But we have hope, slight hope, that one thing might happen inside the Labor caucus and that is that someone stands up and says, 'Let's get a policy right'.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-03-22,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (10:44):  I commend the contribution of the member for Casey on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I also rise to make a contribution on these bills. This legislation is just another example of this government being out of touch with an industry which is so important to the Australian economy. Instead of proposing legislative changes that will make the industry more transparent and improve the service provided to clients, the government has tabled changes which could have a devastating impact on the financial services and advice sector. As some of my coalition colleagues have already noted, the future of financial advice bills in their current form will, firstly, create huge layers of additional complexity; secondly, cause increased unemployment within the industry; thirdly, create an unlevel playing field among advice providers by favouring those businesses which are more government friendly; and, fourthly, cost somewhere around $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per year to comply with. They are really huge numbers.


A good government would never seek to impose such extreme changes on such an important sector in our economy, but then again this government has a very strong record of wreaking as much damage as possible on Australian businesses and the millions of people that they employ. We all know that manufacturers and small businesses will be hit hard by the carbon tax. We all know our miners will soon be subjected to a mining tax, and here today we are discussing legislation which will hit the financial services sector hard. It is important to note that this legislation has been introduced at a time when there is a low level of personal and investor confidence in the Australian economy. It is the failings of this government that have led to a low level of confidence. This government has made a difficult situation worse through economic mismanagement and punitive legislation. The Australian business community is crying out for certainty from their national government. Australian consumers are seeking stability. They are seeking job security, yet at every turn they have a government which is undermining the confidence of investors, and that is flowing through to all sectors of the economy.


It is with this in mind that I raise my concerns about the proposed changes to the industry that provides financial advice to Australians. The industry exists to assist Australians better manage their financial risks and maximise their financial returns. An appropriately robust regulatory framework must be in place, as financial services providers deal with other people's money on a day-to-day basis. The industry is especially important in my electorate of Cowper, where a number of constituents are either in or approaching retirement and need reliable and transparent financial advice. Decisions made on the recommendations of professionals in this industry will mean large variations in their standard of living, particularly in retirement years.


As we look back on the global financial crisis, I recognise that the financial services industry generally performed well, although I shall discuss some of the exceptions later. Some of this success can be linked to the reforms which were legislated by the Howard government in 2001. That said, like other industries, the financial services industry is constantly changing, and regulations surrounding it need to reflect that change.


It is not hard to support the general principle of having more transparency in this important industry, especially when there is a large information asymmetry between the providers of financial advice and their clients. But, as with most changes this government implements, the devil is in the detail—and what a devil it is. Changes should not be made simply for the sake of change. In seeking to make regulatory change, the government should be focusing on doing things better and not in a more complex and more expensive way. These changes are coming from a government that promised a 'one in, one out' policy—one regulation drawn up and one taken away. Let us look at their record. How has the 'one in, one out' policy gone? I am afraid it is not a very good scorecard, because we have had 16,000 new regulations and less than 100 repealed. With this record, I have very little confidence that these changes will ease the regulatory burden on the financial advice industry.


During the financial crisis there were a number of high-profile collapses in financial service providers across Australia, with the notable examples of Westpoint, Storm Financial and Trio. With the hindsight of these collapses, it is important to assess what went wrong and what could be changed in order to minimise the risk of and hopefully prevent future collapses. Every member in this place will be aware of the devastation that occurred in many families as they suffered and, in some cases, lost their homes when they were advised to use those homes as security for the purchase of investments.


So, in February 2009, the parliament asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services. That inquiry, referred to as the Ripoll inquiry, reported back in November 2009 and made a number of sensible recommendations to reform the industry. The main recommendation was to introduce a fiduciary duty for financial advisers requiring them to place their clients' interests ahead of their own. The recommendations provided a blueprint that the government could have adopted with bipartisan support. It was noted in the Ripoll inquiry in 2009:


… the committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations—


and I stress that: enforcing existing regulations—


rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations.


Unfortunately, this was not considered in this reform package, and it has been hijacked by this government succumbing to vested interests. Reforms that are important to the financial advice industry have been delayed by over two years while this government made various changes without consideration of the costs involved or of other consequences.


I now want to raise specific concerns that the coalition have with these regulations. The bills fail the government's own standards, and certainly they represent another broken election promise. As previously mentioned, this government came to office with a promise to reduce regulation and red tape, which is a good aim for government. In fact, the coalition have a deregulation task force that has been specifically established to reduce the regulatory burden on business. A regulatory impact statement is a tool that government has available to review the proposed legislation so that it can assess it for unintended consequences. This will also give a clear picture of the costs for the increased red tape that might be borne by businesses and consumers. According to the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation, the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of FoFA on businesses and consumers or to assess the costs and benefits of the proposed changes. In an industry as complex as financial services and relied upon by so many, this is not acceptable, especially with the contentious parts of the proposed FoFA reforms.


The drafting and tabling of this legislation epitomises how this government tends to manage major reform. Instead of investing the time and the resources to get the detail right, it leaves everything to the last minute and then produces legislation that fails to address the key issues. Such poor management of the legislation has now led the government to try and rush it through the parliament. It is an absolute disgrace that this legislation will not even be considered by the Senate before May, with only six weeks before the proposed start date. What type of government would seek to manage such a reform when there is simply not enough time for the changes to be implemented by the financial services industry?


Given that the MySuper start date is proposed for 1 July 2013, it simply makes sense to implement FoFA and MySuper at the same time. Not only would this give industry sufficient time to make the significant changes that are required; it would also allow participants to make the required changes to their IT systems for both reforms at the same time. It is also well known that a large number of people approach their advisers for financial advice at the end of the financial year. The advisers that are attempting to implement these huge changes will at the same time be coping with their busiest time of the year. Well considered reforms of the financial services industry would consider the conditions of the industry and not thrust change upon them when they are least able to implement it.


The changes proposed by the government are also draconian because they are retrospective. These changes will add an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided by financial service product providers to their clients. As I have previously said, I welcome changes that increase transparency in the industry; however, this measure was not in the Ripoll inquiry and was only included by the government at the last minute. It has been estimated by the Financial Services Council that the implementation of the fee disclosure requirements will cost approximately $53 per client for new clients and $98 per existing client. The additional costs borne by retrospective fee disclosure will add absolutely no additional consumer protection benefits. Yet the additional cost will either have to come from the financial adviser or by way of reduced returns to the consumer.


The government made a commitment during the consultation period that the additional annual fee disclosure requirements would apply prospectively only. This is another example of the Gillard government promising one thing only to renege on that promise when it comes to the implementation. Not everyone would want to go to a financial adviser to receive a full financial plan. Many want to receive advice on only a specific need that they have, be it a specific type of insurance or savings product. Scalable advice is the concept of focusing advice on areas specifically identified by the client. The provision of scalable advice would allow many people to access advice more frequently for specific matters. The changes would allow the provision of scalable advice where the request for such limited or scaled advice is instigated by the client. This would ensure that clients are able to access affordable and appropriate financial advice as and when it is required and not when the client is able to afford a full financial plan.


I welcome the amendments that the coalition is proposing. They are sensible amendments that include: the government would be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on the FoFA changes; the changes be assessed as compliant by the government Office of Best Practice Regulation; the opt-in be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirements be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty be improved; a ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and the implementation of FoFA to be delayed until 1 July 2013 to align it with the MySuper.


The rushed nature of this legislation certainly is of concern. But the overwhelming concern for most Australians with this new legislation is that they have no faith in this government's ability to deliver change. They have seen the government bungle reform at every turn, they have seen the government bungle programs. The Australian people have lost faith in this government. When you are looking at an area as complex as the FoFA reforms, as detailed as the FoFA reforms, how can the Australian people have faith in a government that could not put pink batt in roofs, and could not build school halls without massive cost overruns? How could the Australian people have faith in a government that is incapable of implementing the simplest program? How could they have faith in this government implementing changes as complex as those that are proposed under FoFA? We see Australians very concerned about the implications of the carbon tax for the same reasons. They have seen the government's failure in program implementation. They can see the complexity of the carbon tax, as massive as it is, and the massive burden that the carbon tax will place on the Australian economy and on Australian business. They do not trust this government to implement matters of such complexity.


So I say this to the government: take note of the amendments prepared by the coalition. The coalition has a track record when in government of implementing sound policy. The coalition has a track record in government of ensuring that government is conducted on a competent basis. The coalition can be trusted with government whereas the current government is certainly under a cloud of distrust with regard to the Australian people. The current government certainly is not considered by the Australian people capable of implementing complex reforms such as those proposed in these bills.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-03-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:00):  I would like to thank all the members who have contributed to this important debate. Financial advice is an important step in the wealth management industry in our community. Therefore I value the participation of all members on this legislative package, which represents the most comprehensive set of reforms relating to financial advice in the last decade. This debate has been about the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011.


I shall address some of the specific issues that have been raised by members, but first I would like to make some brief remarks about the measures contained in the bills. These two bills implement the government's future of financial advice reforms, the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. This inquiry was commissioned in the wake of the high-profile collapses of Storm Financial and Opes Prime. In combination, these bills contain a number of vital measures to restore trust and confidence in the financial advice sector.


Firstly, the bill sets in place arrangements requiring financial advisers to obtain their retail clients' agreement in order to charge them ongoing fees for financial advice. That is the opt-in requirement. This measure promotes the active renewal by the client to ongoing fees for advice with the opportunity to consider whether they are receiving value for money. This very basic requirement is that advisers must obtain their clients' agreement to renew at least once every two years as well as giving clients a fee disclosure statement at least once every 12 months. If the client does not respond to the renewal notice, they are assumed to have terminated the advice relationship and no further fees can be charged by the adviser. That said, if advisers charge on a per piece of advice basis rather than on an ongoing basis then the opt-in requirement will not apply to them. Overall, we want financial advice to focus on the client and what is in the client's best interest. Advisers should be in regular contact with their clients if they are charging them regular fees and I know many financial advisers already are.


In addition, today I can announce that the government will be moving an amendment that offers financial advisers an alternative to the opt-in requirement. This amendment will allow ASIC to provide class order relief from the opt-in requirement to licensees and representatives who are signatories to an ASIC approved professional code of conduct by 1 July 2015. Importantly, such an ASIC approved code would need to include practices and conduct requirements that obviate the need for the opt-in requirement. This amendment ensures that the opt-in requirement is linked in legislation to the class order relief for licensees and representatives.


Further, under this proposal, the government will introduce legislation into parliament by 1 July 2013 that will enshrine the term 'financial planner' or 'financial adviser' in law. I am grateful to the members for New England and Lyne in developing these propositions. The government will conduct consultation with organisations, such as the Financial Planners Association and Choice, to ensure that these measures are implemented in the most effective way possible.


Returning to the measures in the bill, the second measure enhances the capacity of ASIC to supervise the financial services industry and boosts its ability to protect investors by restricting or removing unscrupulous operators from the industry. The changes will implement the PJC recommendations in this area and will strengthen ASIC's administrative powers, as they apply to licensees and representatives, to strengthen the gatekeeping function of the licensing regime and extend ASIC's powers to remove unsatisfactory persons from the industry.


Third, the bills impose a statutory best interest duty on financial advisers. This will be a legislative requirement to ensure that financial advisers are focused on what is best for their clients. While this will ultimately lead to better advice in many cases, it is about regulating conflicts. It is not about regulating for the best investment return. As I have said previously in the House, the best interest duty does not require that advisers give the best advice. It does not require perfection in statements of advice by applying the benefit of hindsight. The duty strikes a balance between certainty and flexibility for the financial adviser. The duty requires the provider of the advice to take steps that would be reasonably regarded as being in the best interests of the client given the client's relevant circumstances. For most advisers, this is business as usual. For some advisers, who perhaps have not always put their clients' interests first or are otherwise driven by conflicts, the duty will require them to adapt their practices. The government makes no apology for legislating to change behaviour in any industry to ensure Australian consumers are better off and can retire more comfortably.


Finally, the bill implements a key aspect of the government's response to the Ripoll report—a ban on the receipt of conflicted remuneration by financial advisers including product commissions. It is so important that ordinary mums and dads can engage a financial adviser without having to worry about whether the adviser is a professional or really just a product salesman. These measures ensure that advisers are working for the consumer, not the product provider. In short, advisers will not be able to receive remuneration from product issuers or anyone else which could reasonably be expected to influence financial advice provided to a retail client. On previous occasions I have congratulated many in the industry that have already moved away from product commissions towards a fee-for-service model. These industry leaders will be well-placed to embrace the new opportunities that the reforms present.


The government recognises the significance of these reforms for the financial services industry. I have already announced—to reassure the member for Cowper—smoother application arrangements to assist people to transition into the post-FoFA world.




Honourable members interjecting
—





Mr SHORTEN:
  We remain optimistic. Under these arrangements, application of the reforms will not be mandatory until 1 July 2013. The government will introduce amendments to give effect to this in the winter sittings.


This brings me to some of the specific issues raised by members. There has been a lot of comment about the fact that opt-in was never recommended by the original Ripoll inquiry. That is true, but it was recommended by another inquiry; and that is the Cooper review of superannuation. It was recommendation 1.12 on page 26 of the final report of the Cooper review. It said:


Members of MySuper products should only be provided with advice about superannuation (other than intra-fund advice) under arrangements that require the member to renew the advice service each year on a renewal notice from the adviser.


There has also been a lot of comment that these reforms will cost jobs. These claims about job losses have not been substantiated and have been rebutted and dismissed as 'silly' by senior officials of our national Department of Treasury. I believe the greatest threat to financial services jobs is the coalition, which voted against the increase in superannuation. Our government is lifting superannuation from nine to 12 per cent and adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the pool of funds to be managed by the wealth management industry. With more money to manage, this will create more jobs for people to manage the money. This is good for jobs in financial advice, life insurance, funds management and fund administration. The government is also opening up new markets for financial advice by making it easier to provide limited or scaled advice. This will make it easier for the industry to provide advice to the 60 to 80 per cent of Australians who currently do not take financial advice.


There has certainly been a lot of strong leadership by the government, the industry and consumer movement to get to this point today. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and determination of my ministerial predecessors. I would also like to acknowledge the leadership displayed by the Financial Planning Association of Australia and its CEO, Mr Mark Rantall. Whilst he has never supported opt-in, he recognises that this latest proposition will ultimately improve the professionalism of the industry. I also acknowledge the work of Choice and Jenni Mack. I acknowledge the work of the Industry Super Network, with Ms Robbie Campo and Mr David Whiteley. I indeed appreciate the contributions from the large retail and financial institutions who provided me with constant advice and allowed us, in our latest set of amendments, to update to reflect the pragmatic knowledge of industry.


In conclusion, advice—that is, any advice, whether from an engineer, a solicitor or a doctor—can be good advice only if you have trust and confidence in it. If people do not have trust or confidence that it is quality advice and cannot trust that the advice is in their interests, it will always be difficult to convince them that they need financial advice, which I believe Australians do. It will certainly be very hard to convince people that they should pay for advice if there is a cloud over the merits or the motivations of the advice that you are receiving from a financial planner. I know many financial planners—they are dedicated and hardworking. Many financial planners have already arrived at the point that this legislation is taking us too. I also believe, however, that ordinary Australians should be able to expect that a licensed financial planner will be able to provide them with the advice of a certain quality and, most importantly, that they can trust the adviser is working in their interests.


The need for people to get the help they need to manage their financial affairs and to ensure that they have adequate requirement savings is simply too important, particularly in the context of an ageing population concerned about making sure they have an adequate income in retirement. It is for this reason: if we are going to create a compulsory stream of wealth in Australia and compulsory savings of superannuation, we must ensure that the financial transactions in the back office are provided in the most efficient way and the best interests of consumers. These reforms will enhance the quality of and access to professional and impartial financial planning advice.

(

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:58):  As a Victorian and an ardent 'Shinboner' I understand the role football plays in our community. For us as Victorians it is more than just a game, more than just a sport; it is a way of life. And Jim Stynes was a colossus. Jim Stynes was a trailblazer. In 1984 he made what was at that stage an unheralded move from Ireland to Australia to pursue a career in the AFL after an already very successful career in the Gaelic Football League, winning an all Ireland minor football championship with Dublin. Little did he know at that time the precedent that he was setting. Pioneer is a term too readily repeated these days, but Jim Stynes was a pioneer. When he arrived in Australia no-one could have predicted the impact he would have on the game, the community and society as a whole. Jim Stynes holds the AFL record for the most consecutive games—244. This achievement could not sum up Jim Stynes attitude towards life more succinctly—a fighter to the end, and someone who was absolutely relentless in his commitment. Jim was a four-time best and fairest winner, a two-time All Australian, an AFL Hall of Famer, a Melbourne team of the century member and, of course, the 1991 Brownlow medallist, awarded to the best and fairest player in the league. That was the first time someone born outside of Australia won this prestigious award. Jim's affection for his beloved Melbourne Football Club was unrivalled. A one-team player, his connection to the Demons extended beyond his playing career. In 2008, Jim Stynes was named chairman of the board. He arrived with the club burdened with debt and embarked on the debt demolition campaign, delivering on the $5 million pledge in August of 2010. Jim's commitment to his club was nothing short of superhuman given the graveness of his illness, but he never allowed his personal battles to burden those around him. Even during the depths of his own personal struggles, he was reported to be counselling others with their troubles. This was the Jim that we all knew publicly, a man who was always thinking of others.


Jim's duty to his community extended far beyond football. He was the founder of the Reach Foundation, helping disadvantaged youth. He was twice named Victorian of the Year and was awarded an Order of Australia for his contribution to sport and community. Unfortunately, Jim's battle with skin cancer is an all too familiar one in this country, with Australia recording the highest rate of skin cancer per capita anywhere in the world. It is essential that we all follow the SunSmart message and have regular checks.


Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim's wife, Sam, and his two young children, Matisse and Tiernan, who, most importantly, have lost a husband and a father at too young an age. One cannot express the sorrow and pain they must be feeling but, at the same time, the pride they must also feel to have loved such an inspiring and courageous leader of our community. We mourn the passing of Jim Stynes, a great Victorian and a great leader. He will be sadly missed.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-03-22,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (12:02):  I too rise to acknowledge the untimely death of Jim Stynes. I do not make a practice of speaking on these motions unless I have some personal connection in this place, but I am originally from Victoria and, growing up as a young Victorian, one of my earliest memories of football was the 1987 preliminary final, where Hawthorn played Melbourne to take on the mighty Blues a week later in the grand final. Of course, Carlton belted the living suitcase out of Hawthorn in the grand final. But the preliminary final between Hawthorn and Melbourne was a very close game and Jim Stynes, in, I think, his first year of senior footy, famously ran across the mark of Gary Buckenara, who, with a 15-metre penalty, as it was in those days, proceeded to kick the goal taking Hawthorn into a grand final they were sure to lose—but, in any event, they made the grand final. It was one of my earliest football memories.


Jim Stynes played a significant part in the last 20 years of Australian football. It is a passion and religion in the southern states and is also growing, I must say, in the northern states and in the west, and Jim Stynes has been a significant part of that. To lose Jim at such a young age with such a contribution still to make to society is extremely sad. The member for Higgins, appropriately, went through his record in the game and so forth, and I will not repeat that, but I saw a comment by Patrick Smith in the Australian a day or so ago that I thought was extremely appropriate. He said that Jim Stynes arrived in Melbourne not knowing how to play football, but, after he left, Melbourne would not be playing football without him. That is completely true. Without Jim Stynes' commitment and passion for that football club, it is likely they would not be running around again this year.


He was truly a champion—a term that gets thrown around too often—on the sporting field and a champion off the sporting field. I feel terribly sorry for his young children and for his wife, Samantha. I will finish by quoting what Samantha Stynes said in her Facebook message when she announced his death:


Jim's lesson is that life was to be challenged and treasured.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (12:04):  I join in this sad statement of condolence for someone who was well known and well liked not just in Victoria but beyond. Many millions of Victorians felt a connection with Jim Stynes. He died at the age of 45. The member for Mayo began his speech with a memory of the 1987 preliminary final, and I would like to start there too. I remember that day very well—like the member for Mayo, I am a Carlton supporter. Melbourne had been an underperforming team for many years but they surged through the 1987 season and, against great odds, won their way to the preliminary final. I remember that I had come home from work that day and saw the last few minutes on television, which was rare in those days—they did a live cross because the match was so close.


As the member for Mayo outlined, it was a heartbreaking finish for the club and for Jim Stynes personally. Melbourne looked like they had won the match. They had been in front pretty much all day, they had been in front at three-quarter time. Gary Buckenara, from Hawthorn, had taken a mark that was too far from goal and the siren rang. As it was ringing, Jim Stynes—who we had all got to know as the Irish recruit, who had come across and learnt the game at the instigation of Ron Barassi—I think I am correct on that—ran across the mark, which in those days was an automatic 15-metre penalty. That put the Hawthorn sharpshooter Gary Buckenara within distance to kick the goal after the siren. He did kick that goal and Hawthorn went into the grand final. For Melbourne supporters it was heartbreak, and Jim Stynes felt it. I read in the paper this week that he went to Europe to try and get away from it all, but someone walked up to him and said, 'Aren't you the bloke who ran across the mark in the preliminary final?'



That story has been told a lot. But it is a story that needs to be told because Jim Stynes was a determined person but also an affable and optimistic person. He came out from Ireland not knowing the rules of our 'southern code'. Then he had a setback. It took him a while to make the firsts and become a star player. He played in a premiership grand final the following year and, even though Melbourne lost, he was best on ground. He won a Brownlow Medal. He was not just a great footballer but a great person and a great community leader. It is rare to be a superstar AFL footballer but it is rarer still to be one of those players for whom every AFL fan has a soft spot. Throughout his playing career, every AFL fan thought Jim Stynes was a great person. He was a superstar for the Melbourne Football Club, and opposing fans respected that. Of course, he took that affable determination that so many people had underestimated into his full-on dedication in the community, as the member for Higgins outlined. It is too sad that he is now no longer with his family. He is someone who came from Ireland and became a great Australian. His family naturally will be devastated that he has been taken so early, but they will be forever proud for everything he did and for everything he ever was.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (12:10):  It is a great privilege for me to have this opportunity to reflect on what has been an extraordinary life, that of Jim Stynes, and to honour that life in a modest way and to express my deep regret and sympathy to his wife and family, and to his parents, who in fact reside in my electorate and whose citizenship I presided over a few years ago. Jim and his wife were there, together with other family members. That experience, along with many others I have had with Jim Stynes, was one to remember. He was that sort of fellow. He was a leader of men and women, and he had a capacity to connect with people in all sorts of walks of life. He was known in the football world for his sportsmanship and his leadership role in combating racism and encouraging players to lead by example in their off-field endeavours. He brought so much to the game. He extended the proud history of Irish immigration in Australia. The first time I met him I thought of my family, who originally came from Ireland 150 or 160 years ago. It made me think at the time of the way in which it would be difficult to uproot yourself and come to another country and to seek to make your mark.


He was a man who made an extraordinary mark. But he had difficulties when he first got here—over the first two or three years—to establish himself and combat the expectations and cynicism in a lot of quarters over whether this experiment, if you like, would work. Despite the early setbacks he persisted and became an astonishingly successful ruckman. He played 264 games, including 244 consecutively without missing a game. In that context, that is an extraordinary feat in itself. I suspect in many games he did take to the field with injuries and problems that would have certainly meant that other players would not have fronted—would not have been able to contest a full match. Yet he played and he played in the ruck, which is a very significant contact part of the game.


He became the only overseas born player to win the highest individual honour in the AFL, the Brownlow medal. He won the best and fairest award four times for Melbourne, received all sorts of other All Australian honours, representing the state in the State of Origin and was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame. So he is man who obviously achieved such an enormous amount, yet through all of that the humility of Jim was extraordinary. He did not see that what he was doing was anything special. He had gifts—he had wonderful gifts. He made the most of those gifts, and that is all that can be asked of somebody.


My initial contact with Jim was through the Reach Foundation when I attended some of the fundraising functions and then got the opportunity to observe Jim in action. He had this extraordinary capacity to connect with young people. It is something that is hard to describe because it is an intangible, but I did have the great privilege of seeing him work with young people. He had this ability to help them confront the issues that were bedevilling them. It is true of so many problems in life, I think, that if you have the courage to confront it, it can make an enormous difference to the resolution of those problems. I am the last one to speak about that, having spent 43 years denying something. But it takes a lot for people to confront issues and Jim Stynes had this wonderful ability. He gave support and self-belief. You could see the self-esteem of some of those young people growing with his belief in them. Almost before your eyes you could see them gaining strength and courage from not just his words but his manner, his identification. He would ask the hard questions but in a way which was not passing judgment, it was in a way which would help some of these young people confront their issues.


The program he has been responsible for in Reach, I think there are now some 60,000 taking part nationally each year. It is modelled somewhat on his personal experience in Ireland with programs where young people work with other young people in camps to improve self-belief and to develop resilience and emotional awareness amongst young people. At 45, to achieve what Jim has achieved is quite remarkable in many respects. To have 60,000 young people each year taking part in these programs, these camps, is a most extraordinary thing, quite apart from what he has done with the Melbourne Football Club and the inspiration that he has been for so many millions of Australians in the way in which he has tackled issues.


He has left an indelible mark on his adopted country and quite a number of extraordinary legacies. He was a giant of a man in so many ways. Yet through all of that, you would not have found a more humble and self-effacing individual who had all the moods of all the rest of us, but overwhelmingly was a person of great character and with great concern about others. He just oozed interest in what you were doing and what you were saying. When you were talking to Jim Stynes you felt that you were the only person that was important, notwithstanding his responsibilities and notwithstanding the fact that often he might have just been out of hospital for four days, having had several cancerous growths removed. That happened so often; it was quite remarkable.


I would just say about Jim that he showed in so many stages of his life that striving and struggling to reach our own potential is ultimately what gives meaning to our lives. It is what dictates the uniqueness and the dignity of each person, and Jim's life teaches us that life is meaningful. He was a man who found great meaning in his own life. He was a man who realized that life was expecting something from him despite his circumstances. Despite the fact the he was riddled with cancer and was battling in these last three years with such an overwhelming threat to his life and all of the endless operations and chemotherapy and all of these issues, through those three years he grabbed a football club that was inexorably sliding into a dysfunctional state and turned it on its head. He resolved a $5 million debt; breathed commitment, hope and interest into a board; developed a strong and effective administration; and in so many ways very significantly turned around the fortunes of the Melbourne Football Club, which for me is something of great significance seeing that I have been barracking for them since 1957. The last time they got a flag was 1964. I have taken much greater interest had more involvement in the club over the last few years since I came back to Melbourne and assumed the parliamentary role that I have. Again, I have had the privilege in that connection with the Melbourne Football Club in the last few years to see Jim quite often and to just interact and pass the time of day and catch up with what he is doing. At no stage through all of that—and, of course, much of that has been a time when he has been very ill—would he ever reflect on his own state of health. He was always putting a brave and uncomplaining face to the world.


I want to convey my deep condolences to his wife, Sam, to his kids and to his brothers and sisters, and a special mention to his parents, who as I said earlier are in my electorate and are wonderful people. I have met them on a couple of occasions now and I would see them at the club now and again. They share, as you would expect, the same qualities of openness. They are people who are so easy to talk to and relate to and, whilst being extremely distressed and upset and sad, they must be immensely proud of their son, who has been such a wonderful example to all of us and who has already made in his short time in Australia such an extraordinary contribution—someone who has been Victorian of the Year on two occasions and Melburnian of the Year because of the community work he has conducted and his other leadership responsibilities. The Melbourne Football Club, the AFL community and Australia have lost a great son with the passing of Jim Stynes. Thank you.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (12:25):  I rise to speak on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. This inquiry was a very important one because it looked specifically at unexplained wealth derived from serious and organised crime in Australia. Serious and organised crime has a serious impact in this country, threatening the economy, national security and the wellbeing and liberty of all Australians. The financial cost to the community is conservatively estimated at around $15 billion per year. This, along with the safety of our communities, is what made this inquiry so very, very important.


The committee's inquiry considered our country's need for legislative or administrative reform to address unexplained wealth. A number of organisations contributed to the inquiry, including Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, police associations, the Law Council of Australia, the Queensland Law Society and Civil Liberties Australia. I would like to pass on my appreciation to all parties who contributed to this inquiry by either written or oral submission or by attending a public hearing.


Put simply, the unexplained wealth laws represent a relatively new form of criminal asset confiscation where serious and organised criminals who cannot account for the wealth they hold are forced to forfeit these assets to the state. Being a former police officer, I am well aware that the incentive behind organised crime is to make money and accrue wealth. Initiating a reverse onus of proof on those involved in serious and organised crime to show that they have legally obtained their wealth gives us the opportunity to tackle serious and organised crime head-on. I am also a strong believer that confiscating criminal profits will remove funds that are used as capital for further criminal enterprise. Removing these funds significantly disrupts the ability of criminal networks to operate. This can only be a good thing. During the inquiry, the Australian Crime Commission stated that, while serious and organised criminal groups prove resilient and adaptable to legislative amendment and law enforcement, the reduction or removal of their proceeds of crime would likely cause a significant deterrent and disruption to their activities.


I have to say that it has been a great honour to be part of this committee, which has worked hard throughout this inquiry. As a member of the New South Wales Police Force for 25 years, I am very excited about the new form of law enforcement that this unexplained wealth legislation represents. While traditional policing has focused on securing prosecutions, unexplained wealth provisions contribute to a growing body of measures aimed at prevention and disruption. In particular, these provisions will fill an existing gap which has been exploited whereby the heads of criminal networks remain insulated from the commission of offences and enjoy their criminal gains.


I believe this inquiry takes a great step forward from the introduction of unexplained wealth provisions into the Commonwealth proceeds of crime legislation we saw in 2010. While we welcomed the introduction of these provisions, unfortunately in the past two years no unexplained wealth proceedings have been brought before the courts due to a range of limitations. This is why the committee wanted to examine these provisions more closely and has made a number of significant recommendations in this report to enhance the effectiveness of the Commonwealth unexplained wealth provisions. These recommendations will target the provisions of serious and organised crime; provide further support for unexplained wealth investigations; improve the operation of task forces, including enhancing the role of the ATO; streamline the court process; and develop a consistent and effective national approach to unexplained wealth across Australia.


In particular, we have recommended a harmonisation of Commonwealth, state and territory laws. We believe that a national strategic approach to organised crime will eliminate gaps that can be exploited between jurisdictions. The committee has also recommended a series of technical amendments to ensure that unexplained wealth proceedings are fair and efficient. We believe it is vital that Australia has effective unexplained wealth legislation which will take the profit out of criminal enterprise. This will undermine the business model of serious and organised criminal networks and protect our communities from these individuals and criminal organisations. As part of our recommendations, the committee have sought to support future unexplained wealth investigations by ensuring that ACC examination material can be used as evidence; exploring the possibility of enabling the ACC to conduct examinations for the purpose of unexplained wealth proceedings in a manner consistent with Proceeds of Crime Act court proceedings; and amending the search warrant provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act to allow for the collection of evidence for unexplained wealth proceedings. We would also like to see an improvement in the operation of task forces which involve the tax office through the prescription of the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce under taxation regulations to allow greater information sharing; and allowing the tax office to make greater use of information obtained through telecommunications interception, where appropriate.


We believe it is also possible to streamline the court process by eliminating the current and unnecessary duplication of meeting an evidence threshold test; providing for an extension of time limit for serving notice of a preliminary order, where appropriate; removing the potential for abuse of legal expense provisions by harmonising them with other Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings; and granting an ability to create and register a charge over Australian property to secure later payment.


I think this inquiry is a great step forward for policing and law enforcement in Australia. Along with my colleagues on the committee, I am a firm believer that, if we can remove this incentive behind organised crime in this country, then we are in a better position to protect our communities from these criminal organisations and bring about a major disruption to all of their criminal activities.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (12:25):  I rise to speak on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. This inquiry was a very important one because it looked specifically at unexplained wealth derived from serious and organised crime in Australia. Serious and organised crime has a serious impact in this country, threatening the economy, national security and the wellbeing and liberty of all Australians. The financial cost to the community is conservatively estimated at around $15 billion per year. This, along with the safety of our communities, is what made this inquiry so very, very important.


The committee's inquiry considered our country's need for legislative or administrative reform to address unexplained wealth. A number of organisations contributed to the inquiry, including Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, police associations, the Law Council of Australia, the Queensland Law Society and Civil Liberties Australia. I would like to pass on my appreciation to all parties who contributed to this inquiry by either written or oral submission or by attending a public hearing.


Put simply, the unexplained wealth laws represent a relatively new form of criminal asset confiscation where serious and organised criminals who cannot account for the wealth they hold are forced to forfeit these assets to the state. Being a former police officer, I am well aware that the incentive behind organised crime is to make money and accrue wealth. Initiating a reverse onus of proof on those involved in serious and organised crime to show that they have legally obtained their wealth gives us the opportunity to tackle serious and organised crime head-on. I am also a strong believer that confiscating criminal profits will remove funds that are used as capital for further criminal enterprise. Removing these funds significantly disrupts the ability of criminal networks to operate. This can only be a good thing. During the inquiry, the Australian Crime Commission stated that, while serious and organised criminal groups prove resilient and adaptable to legislative amendment and law enforcement, the reduction or removal of their proceeds of crime would likely cause a significant deterrent and disruption to their activities.


I have to say that it has been a great honour to be part of this committee, which has worked hard throughout this inquiry. As a member of the New South Wales Police Force for 25 years, I am very excited about the new form of law enforcement that this unexplained wealth legislation represents. While traditional policing has focused on securing prosecutions, unexplained wealth provisions contribute to a growing body of measures aimed at prevention and disruption. In particular, these provisions will fill an existing gap which has been exploited whereby the heads of criminal networks remain insulated from the commission of offences and enjoy their criminal gains.


I believe this inquiry takes a great step forward from the introduction of unexplained wealth provisions into the Commonwealth proceeds of crime legislation we saw in 2010. While we welcomed the introduction of these provisions, unfortunately in the past two years no unexplained wealth proceedings have been brought before the courts due to a range of limitations. This is why the committee wanted to examine these provisions more closely and has made a number of significant recommendations in this report to enhance the effectiveness of the Commonwealth unexplained wealth provisions. These recommendations will target the provisions of serious and organised crime; provide further support for unexplained wealth investigations; improve the operation of task forces, including enhancing the role of the ATO; streamline the court process; and develop a consistent and effective national approach to unexplained wealth across Australia.


In particular, we have recommended a harmonisation of Commonwealth, state and territory laws. We believe that a national strategic approach to organised crime will eliminate gaps that can be exploited between jurisdictions. The committee has also recommended a series of technical amendments to ensure that unexplained wealth proceedings are fair and efficient. We believe it is vital that Australia has effective unexplained wealth legislation which will take the profit out of criminal enterprise. This will undermine the business model of serious and organised criminal networks and protect our communities from these individuals and criminal organisations. As part of our recommendations, the committee have sought to support future unexplained wealth investigations by ensuring that ACC examination material can be used as evidence; exploring the possibility of enabling the ACC to conduct examinations for the purpose of unexplained wealth proceedings in a manner consistent with Proceeds of Crime Act court proceedings; and amending the search warrant provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act to allow for the collection of evidence for unexplained wealth proceedings. We would also like to see an improvement in the operation of task forces which involve the tax office through the prescription of the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce under taxation regulations to allow greater information sharing; and allowing the tax office to make greater use of information obtained through telecommunications interception, where appropriate.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (12:31):  During my time in this place, I have made no secret of the fact that Longman is home to some breathtaking environmental scenery. From the Pumicestone Passage to our very own sand island, Bribie Island, from the Caboolture River estuaries to the spectacular gum tree corridor in Burpengary and Narangba, our region boasts some of the very special treasures of this nation. They are treasures which deserve to be treated with respect so that future generations will also be able to get as much enjoyment from them as we do now. It is for this reason that last year I established the Longman Environmental Reference Group, with the intention of bringing together the many community groups in my electorate who have some fantastic initiatives to protect, maintain and promote our local environment.


The environmental groups in my local community are made up of passionate and dedicated people who work extremely hard doing everything in their capacity to protect and promote our local environmental assets. Whether their passion is wildlife rescue, regeneration of native vegetation or improving the health of our local waterways, these individuals toil for many hours each week, making significant contributions locally. Without their efforts, many of the environmental achievements in our community would simply not come to fruition. However, despite the previous hard work of these groups, I had observed that many of their projects could be enhanced and their efficiency improved by combining the efforts and resources of all the environmental groups in the region. Rather than two groups working on similar projects using limited resources to chip away at a problem, these same groups could work together and achieve an exponential impact with the same resources.


I believe the strength of the Longman Environmental Reference Group will be in the way we can develop and support a cohesive vision for environmental conservation in the Moreton Bay region, promoting environmental opportunities and initiatives. Collectively, the group will also be able to work with local and state government representatives, as well as federal colleagues, to pursue our local environmental concerns. These concerns will receive the weight of attention they deserve, due to the prominence they hold simply through the united front of the Longman Environmental Reference Group.


Already the Longman Environmental Reference Group has been consulting with industry, individuals and key stakeholders to promote projects and activities in the community, and we have seen some significant steps forward in new and existing projects. For the first time, people from all of our environmental groups are sharing ideas and information and working together to find a better solution to the challenges we face in our region. This is what it is all about: empowering locals to make real achievements on the issues that they are passionate about. Let me share one of the many local examples that we have. Last year, the Longman Environmental Reference Group was pleased to host the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage as a guest speaker. Not only was this an example of my efforts to bring key decision makers into the community to hear firsthand about local challenges and opportunities; this was a chance for members of the group to ask questions and have real discussions about how we ensure that development is sustainable and protects our local environmental assets. Essentially, what should our strategic environmental vision be for the future of our region? The discussion that we had was about how, as one of the fastest growing areas in the nation, with the need for essential infrastructure development, we need to consider environmental impact and sustainability so that we maintain our irreplaceable environmental assets and our unique lifestyle.


Since this meeting, every member of the Longman Environmental Reference Group has been empowered to make changes in their approach to their environmental work. Instead of working introspectively on a small area of focus, I have observed a broader focus and a more inclusive outlook with thought given to long-term outcomes. These views are exactly what we need in our community to make real, tangible differences.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Longman Environmental Reference Group for taking the time out of their duties and making time to come together for quarterly meetings. I commend them for willingly sharing their vast experience and knowledge in these areas. I believe that, working together, we are going to see some great things achieved locally. Together, we can ensure that future generations enjoy our beautiful natural landscape and our local environment.

The definition used for Full Time Equivalent (FTE) is as follows:


FTE is calculated based on the number of hours worked by a staff member in a given reporting period, usually calendar months.  Paid leave (either full or half-pay) taken by staff does not affect the FTE calculations.  Unpaid leave taken by staff reduces the FTE as the total number of hours worked in the period reduces.
