Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (13:30):  Vale, Mary Crean, a Labor legend who passed away on 28 January aged 103 years. Mary had a rich, full life—much of it devoted to our party and to our movement. Mary was the matriarch of a family of Labor warriors. She was fiercely loyal to her husband of 63 years, Frank Crean, who served as the member for Melbourne Ports for 26 years, and to her sons: Simon Crean, my predecessor in Hotham and former Labor leader; David, a former Tasmanian Labor Treasurer; and the late Stephen Crean, who was a public servant.


Mary was a spear carrier for our movement. Her political smarts gained the respect of some of the most senior people in our party, who were known to seek her out to discuss the political issues of the day. She was passionate, compassionate, smart and loyal. She was a great contributor. Had she been born in this century she might have had a shot at being Prime Minister herself.


Mary devoted her life to others from the local kindergarten to the Red Cross, from the Girl Guides to the National Gallery of Victoria. The community I serve in Victoria and the movement and the party I represent in this parliament owe Mary a great deal. She was a stellar human being and deeply respected on both sides of politics, so I know I speak for all of us in the chamber today when I send the chamber's deepest condolences to the Crean family and our great respect and thanks to Mary for all that she contributed and achieved. May she rest in peace.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:15):  Ronald Reagan once famously asked the American people to question whether they were better or worse off than they were four years before that. If that question were put to the Australian people, they would give an answer that was very clear: they are worse off; but, more than that, their government is making their situation worse off. Their government, on whom they rely, is making their situation worse off. 


We have a nation where household debt is 200 per cent of disposable income—one of the highest in the developed world. We have a government which encourages this debt, because it refuses to reform negative gearing. We have had average weekly earnings in the private sector increase by 1.4 per cent over the year to May 2017. The Prime Minister asked us at question time to reflect on where most people work. He told us that most people work in the private sector. Yes, Prime Minister, that's where wages growth is so weak. The Prime Minister, with his own arguments, undermines his case. There's an important point about wages growth being at 1.4 per cent a year: it's less than inflation. It means people are going backwards. Some people are even in a worse situation. They are not just going backwards relatively compared to inflation; they're going backwards in absolute terms. These are the people who work on weekends, and this government thinks the answer to low wages growth is to cut their wages even further. 


Of course, when it comes to health, we see, under the Liberals, costs are up by 20 per cent to visit a doctor and a consultation with a specialist is up by 25 per cent. We know that the government wanted to charge $7 a visit to the doctor. Instead, what they've done is freeze the Medicare system and seen these charges go up. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners noted late last year that 860,000 patients had delayed a visit to their doctor because of the costs. These policies have real-world implications. Of course, while we're on health, private health insurance premiums are up by 27 per cent since the Liberal Party came to office. In the last financial year, Australians paid $4 billion more in premiums than they got back in rebates. The government says that everything is working just fine from their point of view. The Minister for Health pats himself on the back that he has approved these increases. The member for Ballarat and this side of the House say: 'No. That's not good enough. We have an alternative plan.'


When it comes to energy, we see costs going up. The government told us months ago that they had a concrete plan when it came to energy costs. It is called the National Energy Guarantee. Since then, what have we heard? No details. No modelling. It's not a national policy and it's not a guarantee. But, of course, the government have worked this out. To give them credit, they know that they've got a problem on their hands. They know that people are hurting. So what do they come up with? We hear about it a lot. We are told: tax cuts. Whenever the government are in a bit of hot water, which is every day that ends in a 'Y', they trot out: 'It's okay. We've got tax cuts. We're going to give you tax cuts.' The Prime Minister and the Treasurer talk about them a lot. But what we don't have is any detail. We don't know who is going to get the tax cuts. We don't know how big the tax cuts are going to be. We are told they've worked so hard and so long on these tax cuts; it is such a concrete and developed plan; we just don't have details. 


What we do have details on is their tax rise. That's what we have got details on. That's the one concrete policy we have from this government. We have a situation where people on $60,000 a year will be paying $300 more in tax, and people on $55,000 a year will be paying $275 more a year in tax. These are the government's actual policies—not their speeches, not their words, not their rhetoric. They want to increase tax. They want to take $1.7 billion more a year out of Australians' pockets. That's actually higher tax. Whenever Malcolm Turnbull talks about tax cuts—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! 




Mr BOWEN:
  The Prime Minister, I apologise. Whenever the Prime Minister talks about tax cuts, his policy is to increase tax. 


I saw the Prime Minister on Insiders on Sunday. He seemed offended that he could possibly be asked: 'Aren't you putting tax up on the one hand? Won't your taxes need to be so big just to justify what you are taking off?' He seemed surprised to get this question. He was offended to be asked about this. Maybe he needs some help from the minister for revenue. Remember she told us negative gearing was going to send house prices up and down at the same time? Maybe she can help the Prime Minister explain why they are putting taxes up and down at the same time. She could ride to his rescue. She'd do a better job of explaining it than the Prime Minster has done. The fact of the matter is when Australians on an income of $60,000 will be $300 a year worse off that is a tax rise. They can call it a levy, a charge or an imposition—they can call it whatever they like—but they are increasing the personal income tax paid by those Australians.


Again the Prime Minster on the weekend was reminding us that they had actually introduced a tax cut. They had taken the threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. That's true. With our support that was passed through the parliament. That was a tax cut. What that did was give $5.1 billion back to the people who received the tax cut. What does the tax raise that they want to impose, the Medicare levy increase, take off people? They have given back $5.1 billion but want to take from people $8.2 billion over the same period. This just goes to show that whenever the government talk about lowering tax, they are misleading the Australian people because they want to increase tax. That's what they want to do.


The government don't believe in lower taxes; they believe in different taxes. They believe in taxing different people in a different way. They believe in a tax cut for high-income earners. I concede that point. I give them that. They do believe that somebody earning more than $180,000 a year needs a tax cut. That's what they delivered. They were happy to take the deficit levy off people who earn more than $180,000 a year, despite the fact that we are still in deficit. The situation is worse than when the deficit levy was put on and was projected to be, yet they've gotten rid of the one measure in the 2014 budget that actually impacted on high-income earners. They still believe in everything else. They still believe in everything that impacts on low-income earners and pensioners. They have gotten rid of the one measure that applied to people who earn over $180,000.


Of course, they got their $65 billion a year corporate tax cut, which they believe will trickle down. They say: 'Don't worry about penalty rates. Don't worry about the fact that average weekly earnings are going backwards. Don't worry about the fact that energy costs and health costs are going up. Don't worry about the fact that private health insurance premiums are increasing. Don't worry about the cost of living, because we have a plan.' The Prime Minister says: 'It's going to trickle down to you eventually, one day. In 20 years time you'll get some of that benefit from the corporate tax cut.'


The Australian people are awake to that. They know that there's a better idea. Maybe a better idea is not to cut penalty rates. Maybe a better idea is not to increase the tax on people who earn between $21,000 a year and $87,000 a year. These are people doing it tough. Maybe that's a better plan. Maybe a better plan is to actually deal with the private health insurance premium increases in a sensible way, like the Labor Party has suggested. Maybe a better plan, instead of talking about tax cuts, instead of trotting out the rhetoric at every opportunity and instead of treating the Australian people with such contempt and with such disdain, is to actually not increase their tax in the first place. 


The Prime Minister would have more credibility when he talks about a personal income tax cut if he wasn't increasing personal income tax, because that is exactly what his policy is. He would pass it tomorrow if he could. He would pass it through the Senate tomorrow if he could. It's stuck in the Senate. Do you know why? Because this side of the House will not let him do it. This side of the House will stand up for those Australians earning between $21,000 and $87,000 a year and will block that tax rise with the support of other senators. There is one thing standing between the Prime Minister and a tax rise on those Australians who earn $21,000 a year and that is us. That's the only thing stopping the government doing it. You don't need to take my word for it. It is government policy. It's there in the budget. It's all laid out. They believe in increasing personal income tax. So every time they talk about a personal tax cut, they are being fundamentally dishonest. They are treating the Australian people with contempt.


We welcome this debate. We'll debate tax anywhere the Treasurer likes. We'll debate tax anywhere the Prime Minister likes. We'll debate it in this chamber; we'll debate it in the other chamber; we'll debate it at the National Press Club; we'll debate it in town halls in regional Australia, because we have better plans. We actually understand the cost-of-living pressures on ordinary Australians. We don't say, 'Don't worry; it'll trickle down to you some day.' We don't say, 'Look after the top end of town, and the rest will be okay.' We say that those Australians who are working hard on weekends in cafes and in hospitals deserve not to have their wages cut, and they don't deserve a tax rise—both of those things that this Prime Minister wants to give them. The minister at the table is responsible for penalty rates. He should say to his electorate why he supports people in his electorate—and every other Australian who does so as well—being paid less when they work on the weekend, and why he is supporting increasing their tax at the same time.

"Laundy, Craig, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace, and Deregulation) (15:25):  You know what, Deputy Speaker? I have to give it to the shadow Treasurer: his heart was almost in that. We see him in this chamber normally, at his best, yelling and screaming. At times, and I don't know how he does it, he gets very red—although, having seen him on the treadmill this morning, I now know! What I would say to all Australians is that the Fair Work Commission is a body set up by the Labor Party and staffed by the Labor Party. It was charged with independently four-yearly reviewing modern awards at the behest of the now Leader of the Opposition, who, when they changed penalty rates for some awards in 2010, whilst in government, made no reference to the quality of that commission or the need for it to be changed. When, in some restaurant awards in 2014, Sunday penalty rates were reduced from 200 per cent to 150 per cent, Brendan O'Connor, the shadow minister responsible at the time, said:


We've always said that employment conditions should be considered properly and should be considered by the Fair Work Commission. People should submit reasons why you should seek to make changes to the employment conditions of Australia.


The reason that the shadow Treasurer's heart isn't in it is that he is a member of the once-proud New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. Members of that party historically must be rolling their eyes today. I don't know if you like The Rocky Horror Picture Show—I do; I'm a particular fan.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr LAUNDY:
  The member for Chifley is one step ahead of me. We are stuck in a time warp. We've had the jump to the left, and the shadow Treasurer cannot get in a step to the right. He cannot get in a step to the right. This is the biggest hoax of all time in a campaign by the union movement, who are the puppeteers of those opposite. The shadow Treasurer, in his defence, is being dragged there. He's not a willing marionette, but—I tell you what—the opposition leader and the shadow minister are.


It's not hard to see, when you look at time lines. We've heard. What are the issues? Penalty rates and casualisation of the workforce. Penalty rates I've spoken about. They talk about them when it suits them. Why? Because the union movement isn't happy with the committee, independent of government, which they set up, dealing with unions at the time in 2007, and launched in 2009.


Casualisation—where did this thought bubble come from? Twenty-five per cent is the rate of casualisation today in the workforce, the same as it was two decades ago, but the Labor Party will have you believe it's a problem. No.



An opposition member:  What about labour hire?




Mr LAUNDY:
  'Labour hire,' the member from South Australia yells out. It is two per cent, the same as it was 10 years ago. Independent contractors are nine per cent—again, another pet thing of the union movement—the same rate as it was 10 years ago. Where did this come from? You start to see a trend here.


On 28 July last year, Sally McManus urged the ALP to support amendments to the National Employment Standards to provide greater protection for casuals, including the right to request permanent part-time status. Lo and behold, six days later, on 4 August, Brendan O'Connor, the shadow minister, said:


It's about recognizing that the labour market today does not look anything like the labour market of 30 years ago …


Brendan, bad news: it does. It looks identical. But there we go; Labor Party adopting.


Then, on 26 December, we get Sally McManus saying:


The issue of casualisation, the casualisation of jobs, is going to be a key focus of the whole trade union movement next year in 2018.


On 26 December—the same day this time—the member for Gorton said:


We are examining the conversion. We do believe employers get an opportunity to employ people and see if that works in their workplace, we accept that.


Casual work is the backbone for this economy for the people that need it. It gives them the flexibility.




Ms Price:
  Uni students.




Mr LAUNDY:
  Uni students. I've got two almost there. There are people that have caring responsibilities. It has a leave loading lodged into it, which the opposition always manage to conveniently forget.


But then—surprise, surprise!—on 30 January the Leader of the Opposition said in his National Press Club speech:


So why are big companies keeping workers' wages low? … It's the same reason they try to turn every job they can into a casual job.


What a load of rubbish! So something from Sally McManus's mouth on 28 July, which was a falsehood to start with, is echoed as official Labor Party policy on 30 January this year.


Then we get the living wage thought bubble, which, to her credit, Sally McManus front-ran again, on 2 November. Then Brendan O'Connor again, on the same day, welcomed the suggestion. Then—surprise, surprise!—on 30 January 2018, Bill Shorten said in his National Press Club speech:


The minimum wage is no longer a living wage.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! The minister will refer to people by their—




Mr LAUNDY:
  The Leader of the Opposition—sorry, Deputy Speaker. I do note that I have it on good authority from, I hope, a reliable source in the media that, at the National Press Club conference—probably a sign of how far to the left he was being dragged, to his credit—one notable omission was the shadow Treasurer.




Mr Bowen:
  Wrong.




Mr LAUNDY:
  You were there? I apologise if you were there. I was told by a journalist you weren't. Were you at the speech? 



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr LAUNDY:
  Oh, okay. Sorry. I apologise. I do say, as I said yesterday, that there is a clear and frank left-leaning agenda that has permeated its way through the leadership team of the Labor Party. It is so clear that there are those who are responsibly economically minded and don't want to be there.


Then there's the last piece of the puzzle, the piece that for me, as the new minister responsible, makes it make sense: the claim that enterprise bargaining is dead. Again, the Fair Work Commission—the commission put in place by the Labor Party and staffed with Labor people between 2007 and 2009 to consider matters of the workplace, independent of government—is supposedly not coming up with decisions that the Labor Party's union member puppeteers like. We've heard a lot about the EBAs falling away. Last year, the number of EBAs that were contested upon termination in this country was three per cent. Ninety-seven per cent of the EBAs that were terminated last year were not contested. I don't understand, if there is a problem with three per cent being contested, why you would need to completely overhaul something that is quite clearly working. Ninety-seven out of 100 is a pretty good rate. Ninety-seven out of 100 was a pretty good mark when I was going through school. It would have been good if I'd got it too!


The system is not broken. It is the unions that want more power. They want more access. In the party opposite, as I said, historically some genuinely right-wing, reforming and economically minded Labor politicians have managed to come up with sensible, centrist economic policy. I can say this loud and clear: those days are long gone. Those opposite are again being dragged so far to the left, under the guise that things are broken. It is their system. They put it in place between 2007 and 2009. It is working the way that it has worked, independent of government, for the past 10 years. It is making decisions that it considers on the basis of fact, with submissions from across the working portfolio, from employers to employees and from unions to employer organisations—you name it. You have the ability in this country to put your best foot forward in that commission. In the matters that are considered there, the decisions that are made are made in good faith by people, based on fact. However, over the past two to three years the facts haven't suited the union movement in this country. So what have they done? They have moved in and strongarmed a weak and feeble leader who is in need of their support to garner and save his own leadership. Formerly a member of the Right side of the party, he is a leader who has now worked so far Left away from everything that could arguably be named a significant Labor reform and has dragged them—some still with economic sense—kicking and screaming back to a place that this party hasn't seen historically. The time warp has gone back to the 1970s—a time that we have walked so far away from. The shadow Treasurer is today not at his 'zippiest'.  I get that, but I know why. It's because I don't believe his heart is in it.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (15:35):  Australian's living standards are going backwards, and it's no wonder when we are led by a back-to-the-future government. Recent ANU analysis shows that living standards are declining for the first time in a generation. Cost increases have outpaced income growth by 3.8 per cent since 2013 when this government came to power. Under the Turnbull government it now costs you more to see the GP, more for your private health insurance, more for your electricity bills and more for a house. This government is only interested in representing millionaires.


Under this Prime Minister, anyone earning up to $87,000 pays more income tax. There are more than two million Australians that will get a $300 tax hike under this government next year. Under the Turnbull government's plans to increase the Medicare levy, millionaires get a tax cut of $16,400, while someone earning $60,000 gets a $300 tax increase. Under the Abbott-Turnbull governments, costs are up 20 per cent for a visit to the doctor and up 25 per cent for a consultation with a specialist—all because of their unfair Medicare freeze. That is, of course, if you can get in to see a doctor. Right now, there are 12,000 people on waiting lists to see specialists and some are deferring because the costs are so high.


And then there is the absolute rort of private health insurance. Ten years ago only 8.6 per cent of health insurance policies contained exclusions. It's now 40 per cent. Families are paying an average of $1,000 more since the Abbott-Turnbull governments came to power. Whilst workers', families', veterans' and pensioners' health bills continue to rise, so do their electricity bills.


Instead of the Turnbull government delivering relief for the real Australians, they are giving big business a $65 billion tax cut. Big businesses and millionaires don't need relief. In 2014-15 there were 48 millionaires who paid no income tax in this country, not even the Medicare levy. In the same year, 678 corporations paid no tax. The richest one per cent of Australians own more wealth than the bottom 70 per cent of Australians combined. Profits are going up by 40 per cent, and wages are increasing by less than two per cent. Real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent. In 1975, the top 10 per cent of earners earned twice as much as the bottom 10 per cent but by 2014 they earned nearly three times as much. If low-wage earners had enjoyed the same percentage gains as the highest paid, they would be $16,000 better off a year. When the facts are laid out plain and simple, it is pretty easy to see where the inequality is lying, and it is certainly not with the top end of town.


The Turnbull government is doing nothing to stop the inequality or the cost-of-living burden on workers, pensioners, veterans and families. The Turnbull government is so out of touch with workers, pensioners and families that they have no idea what it actually costs real Australians to simply survive. I wonder if anyone in the Turnbull cabinet can tell me the price of electricity bills in Townsville or the cost of a loaf of bread on Palm Island or how much the Townsville City Council is in debt because of our water crisis. I'm pretty sure the answer is no. But I'll tell you. Stuart is from Kirwan. His electricity bill for the last quarter was $960.77. A loaf of bread on Palm Island has been as high as $7. It cost the Townsville City Council $35,000 a day to pump water. So far, that has put our council more than $2.8 million in debt. There would not be one member of the government who would have known the burden of these costs, even though they have Senator 'Gold card' Ian Macdonald's office in Herbert.


While the Turnbull government prefer to be in their ivory towers in Sydney and Canberra, I'm out on the ground fighting for regional    Queenslanders. I know how hard it is for families to pay for their groceries when wages are stagnant, because I'm on the ground standing with workers, fighting for their wage increases and stopping the penalty rate cuts. I know how hard it is for pensioners to pay their electricity bills, and the effects of the Turnbull government's cut to the energy supplement, because I am on the ground meeting with pensioners and fighting for them, so they don't have to penny-pinch to pay their electricity bill. I'm on the ground fighting against the Turnbull government's $66 million outstanding bill to the Townsville Hospital and Health Service. I'm on the ground meeting with families and local organisations like the Upper Ross Community Centre about the detrimental impact of the Turnbull government's $14.8 million cuts to Herbert schools. Labor has always stood up for, fought for and delivered for the underdog. Only Labor has committed $100 million towards long-term water security infrastructure for Townsville, addressing our drought issues and jobs. (Time expired)

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-02-06,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (15:40):  The best thing we can do to help with the cost of living is to keep people in employment and get those who are unemployed into a job. The great news from the Turnbull-Joyce coalition government is we have had a jobs bonanza over the last couple of years: 403,000 new jobs in the Australian economy in the last year, and 75 per cent of them are full-time jobs—not part time; full-time employment. That is the best thing we can do for Australian citizens so that they can afford the cost of living. We have done so many things to improve the lot of the Australian citizen who is working hard, trying to get ahead, paying their mortgage off and wants to know they have a secure job and a future for their kids.


We have major reforms and improvements from July 2018 in child care. That's one of the biggest costs for a family, along with health insurance, electricity bills and their mortgage. We're helping on all fronts. The amount of child care will increase, because the cap is being moved up to $10,000 from $7,600. For example, a family with two people working full time, earning $80,000 in income, like many of the people in my electorate, with two children under six years old in long day care, will be $100 per day, or up to $8,000 per year, better off in their childcare rebate. That means they can work more, they can save, they can get ahead.


In the Lyne electorate we had a North Coast jobs and investment package announcement last week: $2 million in targeted investment for established companies that want to grow but need capital. These targeted investments will lead to, at the estimates of the companies who are the recipients, over 200 long-term jobs during construction and as the businesses grow. We have that on top of all the infrastructure we're rolling out around the country: a $75 billion spend. In the Lyne electorate we've had over a billion dollars in roadworks and major employment growth in civil construction. Jobs are the best thing that will help with the cost of living—but not just that: electricity. The National Energy Guarantee will lead to a reduction in costs of at least $115 per year. It will make more gas available, increase the capacity for base load so that we don't have the disaster they had in South Australia, where they had no base load to kick in when the fuse blew on the extension cord from Victoria, because of the storm.




Mr Champion:
  Because of the storm. I think you just undermined your own argument.




Dr GILLESPIE:
  But they had no black start capability. The National Energy Guarantee will bring more gas into the market and will guarantee that the retailers and the generators get the electricity where it's needed. In South Australia they closed Playford B Power Station and Northern Power Station. Victoria closed Hazelwood, and what did we have in TheHerald Sun the other day? AGL are putting their prices up in Victoria by 15 per cent.



We've given tax cuts to the average worker. We've addressed bracket creep. The Treasurer already announced over a year ago that tax brackets will be lifted about $7,000 to address that very thing for people in the second-lowest tax bracket. We have done many things to make housing more affordable. We've got a register of Commonwealth land that's available. We're making the grants to the states to improve housing affordability and reach KPIs. They don't just get the money: they have to deliver on housing supply targets. We've got a new Housing Finance and Investment Corp to give cheaper interest rates to low-cost housing providers. It goes on. We have made it easier for first home buyers with the Super Saver initiative. That means you can put up to $30,000 into your super account at a preferential rate to develop your first home deposit. We're letting downsizers, at the other end, make non-contributory $300,000 contributions if they downsize from their family home. So we're helping both ends of the spectrum, but the best thing we can do to make costs of living affordable is to keep people in a job, get more people in a job and make the economy stronger, and we're delivering in spades.

 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (15:45):  It's good to see everyone back after their break, but it's very easy to identify those who spent little time in their electorates over that Christmas period, because those people are not in this debate. When you think about it, if they were out there talking to constituents, they would know that average working families are hurting at the moment. They would know that. Hence, that's why they're not participating in the debate today. Constituents also resent the fact that we now have a government whose signature policy is giving a $65 billion tax cut to big business—$65 billion.


This is all based on this concept of trickle-down economics. Those opposite have taken their eyes off working families in the belief that, if we give the rich more, they're going to feel obliged to hand that down to workers and down the line, and eventually everyone is going to be living in utopia. As the saying goes, pigs might fly. You can see the very notion of this being conjured up as people are sipping their gin and tonic in the local yacht club—maybe around Point Piper, but maybe not—and talking about what's good for working families. They would say, 'Yes, a tax cut for the top end of town—and meanwhile can we now talk about investment opportunities, maybe around the Cayman Islands, and a few other areas and how we can best provide for our ongoing superannuation.' Yes, you could just imagine that.


The electorate I represent is very colourful. I'm very proud of this electorate. It's one of the most multicultural electorates in the country. The colour, vibrancy and diversity are on display day in, day out, and it's something we're very proud of. But, sadly, it's not a rich electorate. We have significant pockets of disadvantage. As a matter of fact, the average household income in my electorate is just a tad over $60,000 a year. What do you think these people think when they see company profits going up 20 per cent, yet they are not seeing any wage growth—being flatlined or, at best, two per cent. So much for Tony's tradies, the way they're going about looking after them.


Now we've got the government deciding to freeze the family tax benefit, but at the same time as they're doing that they're giving those wealthy people—millionaires—a $16,400 tax cut. Yet, if you're on a household income of $60,000 and you have two children around primary school age, you're going to be over $400 worse off. What do you think the people in my electorate think about that? Bear in mind, $60,000 is the average household income in my community. If this government can't afford to look after families, how is it that they think they can afford to look after the top end of town—the multinationals, the big businesses, the very profitable health insurance companies? They can do all that but they can't look after working families. We see this is a government that won't stand in the way of stopping the cuts to penalty rates. And, by the way, there are a lot of people in my community that rely on penalty rates, and I'm sure those opposite, if they looked and if they were around over Christmas, would know that as well.


This is a government that has all its eggs in one basket: trickle-down economics. We shouldn't be too surprised about this, somehow. We have the advice coming from the Deputy Prime Minister: if you're in housing stress in Sydney, Brisbane or Melbourne, just sell up and move to Armidale—great advice from the Deputy Prime Minister! But just put this in economic terms. The Prime Minister made it very clear at the outset of his leadership, when talking about housing issues, that you need to have rich parents—at least rich like him. The then member for North Sydney, the then Treasurer, Joe Hockey, made it very clear: you just get a better job. Now we have a Deputy Prime Minister adding to the debate by simply saying, 'Get out of town.' That's great economic advice for people that are doing it tough! What it shows is that they don't care. We see the real value of people's pay packets going down. Things like electricity and private health are skyrocketing. We're in a housing affordability crisis, household debt is at record levels, and we have record underemployment and job insecurity, and they are basking in the glory of trickle-down economics.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (15:51):  It gives me great pleasure to be able to stand and talk about some of the achievements of the coalition and how we are working to make the cost-of-living pressures on Australians more affordable. The best way we can give a break to an Australian is to make sure that they have an honest, reliable, stable job. The coalition has delivered in this space in absolute spades. If you go back and have a look at our record, we are shifting more people from the unemployment queues, from those that are on welfare, into full-time jobs. I will outline what those achievements have been. More than 400,000 jobs were created in 2017. It was the strongest calendar year on record. The Australian economy is creating, on average, around 1,100 jobs every single day.


So how is it that, when a coalition government gets into office, we're able to create an environment of positiveness with the small business sector for those jobs to be created? The vast majority of these jobs have been full-time jobs, and 75 per cent have been in the private sector. In the private sector, I look at projects like the Bromelton Industrial Park just outside Beaudesert in my electorate, with a transport intermodal rail hub—over 1,200 jobs during construction.


During the election, you would have heard the Prime Minister and the coalition team banter on about jobs and growth and jobs and growth, and people were sick of it. They were sick of hearing 'jobs and growth'. But what I want to say in this debate is that we delivered the jobs, and we will continue to deliver the jobs. We were able to deliver the jobs because we got our economic settings right. The number of new jobs created last year represents nearly five times the job growth of the last year in the previous Labor governments—jobs and growth, jobs and growth. We will continue to banter on about that. We're working to build a stronger economy with more and better-paying jobs for Australians. It is those better-paying jobs that are actually helping cost-of-living pressures.


We're doing it through fairer taxes. How we've done it is by creating confidence and creating incentives. We've cut company tax rates for more than 3.2 million small businesses and reduced income tax for 500,000 middle-income Australians. That's how we're doing it. We're putting money back into their pockets. We'll fight Labor's plan for 150 billion new dollars in tax increases on pay packets, homes, electricity and enterprises. Company tax rates will be at the centre of our debate moving forward. Company tax rates, for us, are about creating those jobs, creating that opportunity and leaving the principles of demand and supply to take their place.


Affordable and accessible child care is also critical to parents who are balancing work and family responsibilities. From July 2018, we will remove the $7,613 annual rebate cap for families on incomes up to $185,000 a year. That's 85 per cent of families using child care. Families earning more than around $185,000 will also benefit from the increased cap of $10,000. That's how we're doing it. We're increasing the childcare subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for more than 370,000 families earning around $65,000 or less. Almost one million families will benefit. That's how we're reducing the cost-of-living pressures.


The government has also announced an extra $440 million to extend the existing preschool program into 2019 to ensure that all children have access to 15 hours of quality early learning in their year before school. That means that over 2,000 of the little learners in my electorate of Wright will have the best start to their education, with a $2.85 million boost. That's how we're reducing cost-of-living pressures.


During the six years of Labor government, electricity prices doubled. Federal and state Labor policies have continued to increase pressure on prices. They have shortages in gas supply, unrealistic renewable energy targets and open hostility to reliable base-load power. The coalition government understand that we need reliable, affordable base-load power, and we're fixing this mix. We have stated over and over again that, for us as a coalition, base-load power will be part of our energy mix into the future. Our new Energy Guarantee will cut prices, ending subsidies for energy which are passed on to all customers, creating a level playing field that will ensure that all types of energy are part of the Australian mix into the future.


We're reducing pressures on housing affordability. There are clear differentiations as to which government is creating downward pressure on— (Time expired)

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (15:56):  I think most parents would hope that their child will have at least as good a life as theirs and hopefully a better life than theirs, and that is pretty much what's happened, generation after generation, in Australia. While we are far from an equal nation, the statistics do show that parents have been proud to see their children better educated, better remunerated, better travelled, living longer—having a better standard of living.


But something has changed. I now see people my age expressing real concerns about how their children will fare independently in the world—how this next generation, and the one after it, is going to go. It seems to me now that we would probably settle for our kids having the same standard of living as ours. We have lost that expectation that they should have a better standard of living. That is a real change in psyche for Australia.


When you unpack it, it's because of the cost of going about your daily life, the things like going to a GP, paying your rent or saving for a home, paying for your electricity, keeping your phone connected or your internet on, covering the childcare costs, putting kids through school, keeping your car on the road or paying for your public transport. All those basic costs are eating up so much of your income that, for many people, there really doesn't seem to be very much left over. Young people, working people—we're talking working people here—young families, families with teenagers, older people, self-funded retirees and pensioners all tell me that it is harder to keep your head above water.


Now, anecdotal evidence is one thing. The conversations we have back in our electorates are one thing. But I do like to know that perceptions are backed by fact and data. So I wasn't actually surprised to see the reports this week that new research shows that it is costing more for us to stay where we are and that people's wages are not growing at the same pace, so the gap is widening. In other words, our standard of living is falling.


The Australian National University research points to the fact that we have the weakest wage growth on record. You can't bank on getting an annual pay rise that will keep pace with the increased cost of stuff that you have to pay for. The take-home pay of the average Australian who works for a private business grew by just 1.4 per cent over the year to May 2017. That's less than inflation, which means that you are going backwards when it comes to paying the bills. The slow wage growth isn't because business isn't doing well. Record profits in recent years simply haven't come through to workers in wage rises. What's happened to them? They've gone to share buybacks, higher executive pay and bonuses for executives. They haven't—funnily enough—trickled down.


The cuts to weekend penalty rates come on top of this. For people who work on a Sunday and public holidays to provide for their families, this government is certainly not helping them. If you're on the minimum wage, which 3.2 million people are in their awards, it is actually no longer a wage you can live on.


If you speak to people about the day-to-day grind you have to wonder why anyone would think that taxing people on the middle and lowest incomes more would be a good thing. Why would you tax those people more? Yet that is what this government is doing—call it a tax or call it a levy. If you're a multinational, this government wants to give you a big tax cut. If you're a millionaire—and they don't seem to be doing too badly—this year you get a tax cut of $16,400, while someone earning $60,000 gets an extra tax bill of $300.


When there is this sort of gap between how much you earn and how much you spend just to cover the basics, I think the real damage is done in the area of health. In the Blue Mountains my upper-mountains constituents tell me that it is almost impossible to find a bulk-billing GP, unless you're a pensioner or have a health care card or a child. GPs have been absorbing the Liberals' ongoing Medicare freeze for five years under this government and they can't do it any longer. The rent's gone up and their staff's wages have gone up. So health is where people are being hit. The cost of living is not just costing people their pockets; it is costing them their health.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-02-06,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (16:01):  It gives me pleasure to speak on this matter of public importance, because it is indeed a matter of public importance. I represent an electorate that is not a rich one. I'm a worker. They talk about workers not being on this side of the chamber, but I would like to point out that there are workers on this side of the chamber—and I enjoyed getting on the tools over the weekend. While I've sat quietly here in the chamber and not interjected, I have listened to no answers. There have been lots of criticisms and lots of attempts to try to make the Australian people feel that their lot in life is tough, but there have been no answers. There is no doubt that there are people struggling out there in Australian society, people who are working hard and paying their bills and trying to provide for their families.


But looking at the history of Australia, we enjoy a prosperity that many generations of Australians have not enjoyed, and I think that needs to be stated. It needs to be stated that we are a very prosperous nation. The prosperity is there because of the hard work of Australians. Money does not grow on trees, and the wealth of Australians results from the individual pursuits of people. They get up, they get out of bed early and go to work, they work hard, they pay their taxes and they contribute to the society. That is ultimately what creates wealth. When you create individual wealth, you ultimately create a wealthy Australia. What we've heard from the discussions today is attempts to knock those who have created individual wealth. This appears to be a great strategy of the Labor Party, but it ultimately undermines the pursuits of individuals. Let me say that again: it is the pursuits of individuals that collectively creates the wealth of Australia.


I want to see more people become wealthy. I want to see people who get out of bed and work hard be rewarded for that. I want those who work hard to pay less tax, and that's why we're proposing a tax cut, hopefully, in the future. I want to see the people who take a risk and invest receive the benefits of that. We should not be a society that knocks those people. We should not say: 'Oh, they're earning too much money. We've got to take the money off them and give it to someone else.' We should say, 'Good for you,' and if we do that, it means you pay a little bit more tax into the pot, meaning there is more money to fund the things that we need to fund in our society, such as welfare.


We hear a lot of talk about the cost of living going up. I have got to say that the responsibility for a lot of those cost-of-living bills—the bills that come across households—still sit with other governments. I think of rates, sitting with our local governments. I think of electricity, predominantly the management of electricity in Victoria by the Victorian government. I think of car registration, which is something that people struggle to pay, which is the state governments. I think of health administration, the money that we, the federal government, give to the states, and the states collect tax and administer health. That is a cost on people and it is largely run by state governments, and many of the state governments in Australia are Labor governments.


I also think that the discussion here isn't putting much forward thought into the implications that Labor are proposing for future generations. I heard the previous speaker talk about how people are concerned that their children haven't got as much opportunity. The best thing we can do to ensure the opportunity for the children of Australia is to not leave them with a national debt—to not leave them with the liability to pick up the tab for the current people who are running this country. When the Howard government finished in this place, they finished in this place with a surplus—money in the bank. We then had years of Labor, which left us with a deficit, and it has taken us quite a while to start to curb off the trajectory. Eventually, we will get back to surplus. 


In contrast, there was not one savings measure suggested on the other side of the chamber in this whole matter of public importance debate. So, ultimately, what we're talking about here is an attack on people who want to get out of bed and work harder. It's an attack on the future children of Australia. The only answer they have to restore wage growth, the only answer they have to restore prosperity, is to borrow more money to put more debt on future Australians. I am not the sort of politician who can do that. I am responsible. People on my side are responsible. Do not trust them on the other side. They have no answers. They have talked all this afternoon—not one suggestion on how to make things better.

Mr ROB MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (16:06):  I will say this very clearly for the member for Mallee, who claims to be a Victorian but is in the government that has cut the guts out of funding for Victoria.



Mr Broad interjecting—




Mr ROB MITCHELL:
  I will speak slowly so you can keep up. You have a choice: $65 billion in tax cuts for big businesses, or you can use that money to fund pensioners, to fund people on low incomes, and you wouldn't be putting an extra $300 tax on every worker earning less than $87,000. It's about choices. You made it quite clear that in your view of the world the people who get rich are the ones you worry about. In our view of the world, society depends on how you treat your most vulnerable. While you want to leave them to the scrap heap, we actually want to encourage people and help them grow. Think about the long break over Christmas. On the north shores of Sydney, while flouting the boating laws, the 26 Newspolls-in-a-row losing PM was enjoying his Cristal and stogies. This year he had a little bit extra to celebrate. Do you know what that was? This year he gave himself a $16½ thousand tax cut. This is a bloke who stores millions of dollars overseas so he doesn't pay full taxes in Australia. And now, 'Captain Cayman', as he's commonly known outside, the Prime Minister, comes back to Canberra and continues his hardline assault on Australian families and Australian workers.


Under this government, Australian living standards are on the decline for the first time in a generation. When we look at this fact, since the Liberal government came in in 2013 the cost-of-living increases have outweighed income growth by 3.8 per cent. The incompetency of this government becomes crystal—or Cristal—clear, we might say. What is the government's response? Let's give big businesses a tax cut. Big businesses get a $65 billion tax cut while Australian workers earning under $87,000 get slugged with a $300 a year tax increase. That is before they get slugged with these outrageous health insurance increases. That's before they get slugged with the energy prices. And I did laugh at the member opposite talking about energy; they won't pull the gas trigger, because of the issues they had with the dual citizenship of the now Deputy Prime Minister, which means Australians are paying more for gas than they need to.


More than two million Australians will have their taxes increased while the PM celebrates his $16,000 windfall. Just think of that for a moment. That's nearly the same cost as a pensioner. A pensioner earns about $20,000 a year. That is all they have to live on. Yet the multimillionaire merchant banker gives himself a $16,000-a-year tax cut. When we talk about opportunities and things we can do to address issues, there is one: don't go giving millionaires tax cuts and putting the tax up on ordinary Australian workers. Go the other way around. Support the people who are struggling to make ends meet, and those with plenty of money can support themselves. 


I tell you, for those who weren't here yesterday, you missed an absolute ripper of a day. We often hear those opposite talk about how wonderful they are and they've all been in business—blah, blah, blah. We had the rich daddy's club yesterday. Rich daddy No. 1 talking to rich daddy No. 2, who was talking to rich daddy No. 3 saying, 'I was in business.' 'How were you in business?' 'My rich daddy gave me a job.' That's not how it works for most of us. Most of us have to get out. While they're all celebrating their ability to go and work in the family business—if you look at a lot of Liberal philosophy it always is getting ahead off other people's hard work; that's how they get to here—




Ms Flint:
  As opposed to being a unionist.




Mr ROB MITCHELL:
  Please—that's the banker lady there. What we've consistently seen from this government is that we watch national debt get bigger—that's more. With debt, there's a little minus sign in front of it. You sit there and talk about what great economic managers you are, but what you've done is increase deficit, increase debt, increase cost of living, cut wages, cut support for pensioners, cut support for families, cut education funding and cut health funding, and you congratulate yourselves.



We heard Treasurer Morrison today saying, 'There are greater times ahead.' Five years in government and all we've heard is, 'gonna, gonna, gonna'. The best way that we can help Australian families and Australian workers is to get rid of this mob opposite and put a government in that actually values people, not big businesses. They want to give big businesses like the banks a tax cut. We want to give them a royal commission. There are stark differences. We want to support people on low incomes. They want to crucify them. The choice is very clear. (Time expired)

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:11):  The coalition are doing a range of things to reduce cost-of-living pressures for Australians. Let's start, for example, with our record on bulk-billing—85.9 per cent of doctors' visits are now bulk-billed. That is something that helps everyday Australians with their cost of living. We have record federal hospital funding. We have tax cuts for businesses, which helps businesses earn and generate income, reinvest, purchase goods from other businesses and, most importantly, employ Australians. We have tax cuts for 500,000 Australians who are on middle incomes.


I can tell you what we're not doing. We are not abolishing the private health insurance rebate, which assists something like 13 million Australians who have private health insurance cover. At the Press Club in the past week, the Leader of the Opposition refused to rule out abolishing the private health insurance rebate, which, as I said, does assist some 13 million or so Australians to cover themselves and be responsible for themselves and their health insurance.


We also have record jobs growth. After four years of coalition government, we have over 918,000 more jobs for Australians. In 2017 alone employment increased by 403,000 jobs, and around 75 per cent of these jobs were full-time jobs. These are the sorts of things that we're doing to help with cost-of-living pressures, because when you have a job you can afford to do a range of things. You can afford to make the choices that you want to make for your life that are good for you, good for your family and good for your community.


Coming from South Australia, of course, I have to talk about one of the biggest cost-of-living pressures in my home state, which is the cost of power. We know the result of Premier Jay Weatherill's 'big international experiment'. I want to read the Premier's statement about his power policy in South Australia, because it does bear repeating. We need to remind everybody what the Premier has done to my home state of South Australia. He said:


We are running a big international experiment right now. We have got a long, skinny transmission system and we will soon have 50 per cent renewable energy, including a lot of wind and some solar. We want to get as close as possible to 100 per cent renewable power. We know there are challenges. But with big risks go big opportunities.


I can't see many opportunities that have come for the people of South Australia, apart from paying some of the world's highest electricity bills, and that is not an opportunity that I want for my residents in my seat of Boothby, nor anyone in my home state of South Australia.


We have families, individuals, pensioners and elderly people who are suffering. We have people who won't turn the air-conditioner on because they do not know if they will be able to meet the cost of their power. This is a result of the failed energy policies of not just the state Labor government but also those opposite. During six years of federal Labor, we saw electricity prices double under the failed Rudd-Gillard-Rudd regimes. Both federal and state Labor policies have continued to increase pressure on prices through shortages in gas supplies, for example, unrealistic renewable energy targets, and open hostility to reliable baseload power through gas and coal. In South Australia, after 16 years of the Labor government, we've seen the closure of the Playford station and the Northern Power Station, the disastrous 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, which I have already touched on, the terribly unreliable power in the state and the highest prices in the nation and in the world. 


What is the coalition government doing? We are doing everything we can from the federal level—even though it's not really our responsibility; this is a state government responsibility—to bring down this cost pressure on South Australians and all Australians. We don't want to see these mistakes repeated in other states. Through the National Energy Guarantee, we are looking at gas. We are making sure that there is enough gas available for Australians through the Domestic Gas Security Mechanism. We are working on Snowy Hydro 2.0, which will provide a fabulous new source of renewable energy that is completely and utterly reliable, as the Snowy has been for a couple of generations now. We're looking at what the retailers can do to reduce retail prices and also a range of other mechanisms to help everyday Australians with their cost-of-living pressures.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:18):  I rise to put on the record my serious concerns about the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I do so to join my Labor colleagues. I particularly acknowledge the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, and the shadow minister for human services, the member for Barton, for their contributions to the debate in this place and to the wider issues that this bill seeks to remedy in Australian society. 


On that point, I also wish to make a small contribution to an important, wider debate about our social compact to one another as Australians: how we as a society support vulnerable people and how we treat our fellow citizens who are doing it tough; whether we listen to those who are most affected by the decisions we, in this place, make; and what agency we afford to people and to communities to shape their futures and to see their experiences reflected in the decisions made on their behalf by their government. We need to think about agency, dignity and respect as we debate the provisions of this bill. We should not lightly deprive Australians of these. My concern is that implementing the provisions in this bill would do just that. 


The debate we're having here about the cashless welfare card trial and its extension beyond any reasonable remit is a debate fundamentally, on the one hand, about ideology and, on the other, about evidence. In both of these regards, debate on this bill and on the wider issues has been revealing. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, in her contribution in the second reading debate set out the principles governing the Labor approach to this issue. This is so important. So I join her in stating that I would like to support community driven initiatives to tackle alcohol abuse and all of its consequences, recognising that there are communities which have been reaching out for assistance but also that a cashless debit card or, indeed, any individual public policy initiative is no magic bullet.


As the member for Jagajaga said, Labor have consistently said that we would take a community-by-community approach to the further rollout of the cashless card. We'll listen to each community's leaders and talk with them about the consequences of this card being rolled out in their community. Wraparound support services must also be community designed, agreed upon and resourced to address the challenges facing these communities. Of course, they're different in different places.


We understand—and this is a very important point—that the vast majority of social security recipients are more than capable of managing their own personal finances. That's why Labor does not support the cashless debit card being rolled out nationwide. It's important that I reiterate the words of the member for Jagajaga, because they go to the very nub of this debate. That last point that she made is so fundamental: we should not assume that people who happen to be in receipt of social security benefits are incapable of making decisions over their lives. We should be very slow to do so. In fact, it's not just me or other Labor members saying this. That is at the core of the concerns which have been expressed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which expressed its concern that the provisions in this bill, unlike some other approaches to income management, do not reflect individual circumstances. It's an odd thing for the party of individualism to be so cavalier in its attitude to this right, although its attitude to rights in general has been exposed shamefully today, as it has, indeed, over the life of this parliament.


I turn again to Labor's approach to this issue, which is anchored in our deep sense of respect for individuals and community and our determination to have regard to the evidence in tackling real problems and helping people who are often in very complex circumstances not of their making. There is recognition on this side of the House of the need for a holistic approach to the challenges this bill is intended to address, rather than a superficially attractive quick fix which answers the call of ideology rather more than the calls of lived experience or evidence.


Earlier this week—or it may have been last week—I read with great interest an article in The Guardian by the journalist Calla Wahlquist, which highlighted a very troubling and, I say in fairness to the minister and his predecessor, no doubt unintended consequence of the present arrangements which are proposed to be extended—in my view without due warrant. This article is entitled 'Domestic violence survivor could not have escaped abuse on cashless debit card', and it recounts the experiences of Jocelyn Wighton, a woman from Ceduna who said that, without access to her entire disability pension in cash, she would not have been able to afford to start a new life. This, of course, refers to the circumstances of Ceduna, as well as her individual circumstances. I think the article dramatically and, for me, movingly and effectively highlights again an unintended consequence of what I believe to be a well-intentioned intervention:


""I'm a domestic violence survivor,"" Wighton said. ""If I was on this card when I escaped from my husband, I would not have made it. I bought secondhand furniture down to the plates and knives and forks. You can't do that on the card.""


She talks also—movingly again—about the sense of shame that she has.


I would commend this article to members because it highlights some of the complexities of individual lives that this instrument addresses. I think it requires all of us to ask ourselves if the intervention is appropriate in all cases and if it answers the aspirations that I think we share. This is why we need, as Labor has proposed, to properly consider firstly what is presently going on in Ceduna and in the East Kimberley, to ensure that proper evaluation is conducted and reviewed and also to listen to all of those who are affected and ensure that their experiences can be adequately reflected in the answers we seek to propose going forward. Let's be very clear. The legislation before the House would license, in effect, the expansion of the trials of cashless debit cards beyond those sites presently underway which impact, I think, some thousands of people in additional locations across the whole of the nation without due process or due consideration.


Government members, in supporting this legislation, have spoken of helping young people. It's a laudable goal and it's shared across this chamber, right across this parliament. But we should be careful not to take such claims from government members at face value for two reasons. Firstly, the record of the Turnbull government when it comes to young Australians is simply shocking. The conservatives, since their election, have been prosecuting nothing less than a war on young people. We on this side of the House remember the attempts to leave young jobseekers without any income support for up to six months. We know that today young Australians' futures are being constrained by $17.3 billion of cuts to school education and massive cuts and even greater uncertainty going to post-compulsory education. Young Australians' future is anything but secure under the Turnbull government. Secondly, fundamentally, the evidence is simply not before us to support this claim when it comes to the cashless debit card. We note the claim of the previous minister that it could 'provide additional motivation for a capable young person to take the jobs which are available'. Putting to one side the confidence in jobs being available in particular areas—and let me just say that in some parts of regional Australia, in deference to the areas you represent, Deputy Speaker, I simply do not share the confidence of the Deputy Prime Minister that, wherever young people can move to, jobs will magically appear. That defies the evidence where half of all the jobs in Australia in recent years have been generated in a very small radius around the central business districts of Melbourne and Sydney.


I also note that the bill that we're discussing today was rushed on for debate in the House last year while the Senate inquiry into it was underway, not enabling Labor members—principally, the shadow minister—to properly consult with community about the proposals. This is a fundamental problem with legislation like this. It is also said by government members that the extension of the trial, effectively without limitation, is warranted by reason of the evaluations of the Ceduna and East Kimberley trials. Again, this claim simply does not withstand the most cursory scrutiny. I will return to this point again.


As we return to the debate this year, in this place, we do have the benefit of the Senate committee review. I do hope that government members, if any are going to continue to participate in this debate, will have close regard to this too—and I say not to the tick and flick of the majority but, rather, the good work of Labor senators who looked to the evidence and the submissions before them and found there is an insufficient basis to establish further trials at this stage. If this government were either reasonable or responsible, it would have regard to this and, in doing so, would show at the very least the courage of its stated convictions. If the case for the extension of the trials is so strong, why not let it be shown to be so? What are they afraid of? The Senate has proposed further amendments consistent with the Labor framework laid out by the shadow minister, which I referred to earlier in this contribution, and the evidence before them.


This is the right way to go about this, not to rule the approach out—we're not proposing that through the amendments that we've foreshadowed—but to further interrogate the claims which have been made to consider alternatives and other services, always having regard to those whose lives are directly affected and their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has raised significant concerns which should not be lightly disregarded. It remains unclear whether the wide extension of the trial is a proportionate response to the important rights which are engaged. The committee found there to be serious doubts as to whether the measures proposed in the legislation are suitable in contrast with other income-managing approaches which reflect individual circumstances, not the blanket approach which is contained in this legislation. It's clear also that we need to continue building the evidence base if we are to deliver policies which are effective. So, as Labor proposes, let us continue and refine the present trial and see—as the present legislation in fact requires—what comes of this.


I want to speak briefly about the evaluation, because this is something government members have been hanging their hat on improperly. If we look to the evaluation, there are serious concerns that go to its findings, which seem, on fair examination, to be inconclusive. I note, just as one example, there is reference in the evaluation to some positive self-assessments by participants and community leaders, and I take them seriously. But these are inconsistent with some of the objective data which has also been derived. These are things which require further work before we roll out a program such as this more broadly. 


Perhaps more telling to me than these issues with the findings—which we need to work through further—are the concerns that go to methodology. These, I believe, have been compounded by this rushed approach, racing to meet a preconceived ideological answer before considering the evidence. We do need to consider the evidence. And, in doing so, we need to reflect on the fact that the evaluation that the government's case is founded on rests on no baseline data, no control evidence and—this would be dear to the heart of the member for Fenner—no randomised individuals forming the basis of the trial. This is what we have seen from so many of the stakeholders—indeed, I would say almost all of the stakeholders without a particular interest; I note the AHA is a supporter—such as ACOSS, WACOSS and the Queensland Council of Social Service. The Australian Association of Social Workers' submission importantly highlights the weakness of the evaluation and, in particular, says:


… it contravenes the expectation of fairness and assumption of autonomy that underpins welfare support payments. 


I think this is a really important point and it goes the nub of the issues which are before us here, and that is to give a sense of agency and a sense of decency to the individuals who are affected, as well as to the communities in which they live. 


The Labor approach is not to say no to an extension of proposals such as these but to ask that the government properly interrogates them, having regard to the evidence and fundamentally to the lived experience of those affected. That's why I support the amendments foreshadowed by the member for Jagajaga. (Time expired)

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:33):  I rise to speak in praise of Andrew Forrest, who has the only big mining company left that is still in an Australian hands. To his credit, he could have sold out for his fortune somewhere along the line. He is very patriotic. He went to a school that was predominantly First Australian. I went to a school that was about 40 per cent First Australian. You can't go to school with kids and play football with them and not end up with them being your mates. I have not the slightest doubt about his sincerity on this issue. A very controversial issue, it's brought him a lot of criticism, but he believes in it. He's the only employer in Australia that I know that employs 600 people of First Australian descent. One of my townsmen went to boarding school in Charters Towers, like myself. He was a boss at Fortescue, a CEO, so I know the intimate workings of Fortescue, quite apart from any friendship I might have, big or little, with Andrew Forrest. They're the only organisation in this country that has a cadre of people—I think there were six in the group—who, if people don't turn up for work, go around, nurse them, do everything humanly possible to keep them at work. It's not just a matter of giving them the jobs; they give them the backup to keep the jobs. When I worked at Mount Isa Mines, I think there were three First Australians on my 12-man gang. I was just an unskilled labourer there. The boss of the lead smelter, Charlie Ah Wing, was one of the pallbearer's at my father's funeral. Charlie was the big boss there, and he was First Australian, very proudly Kalkatungu.


Having said all of those things, if I were on the ALP side, I really would not be throwing stones. They were there for six straight years. Up until two years ago, they were the government of Australia.




Mr Dreyfus:
  More like five.




Mr KATTER:
  I don't want my remarks to be construed as being positive about the other side of the parliament, who have been there for most of the last 12 years.


Our diabetes is at epidemic levels. In fact, I would hope that other nations do not find out what the level of diabetes is in Australia. A lot of people say diabetes is just malnutrition, because the people can't get a decent diet. Most of them are on welfare in the community areas in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York, where most First Australians live, not in the Northern Territory. In one community of about 300 people, two people died of diabetes the fortnight before I was visiting, and the matron in charge of the hospital there said another one would die that month—three people from a community of 300. That would not be atypical of the community areas in Queensland, where some 40,000 or 50,000 people live. They can't afford to get fresh fruit and vegetables into these areas.


There are a number of people in this parliament still that went on a fact-finding mission to the Torres Strait. I never wanted to go back to the Torres Strait, because, as minister for six, seven, eight years—I don't know; whatever it was—in Queensland, I'd seen paradise. I never wanted to go back there again, because it would never be as good as when I saw it as minister. I have some emotional difficulties in expressing this to the House, actually. When we went to the island of Joey Mosby, who was no fan of mine when I was minister—he fell into a category of people that were not keen on self-management and other areas—he stood up at the back of a meeting and yelled out, 'Bobby, they're murdering my people.' The chairman of the committee, who is now a frontbencher on the Labor side said, 'What's all that about?' I said, 'You people and the Liberals banned market gardens.'


Every house, every family up in the Torres Strait had a market garden. They had yams, taros, sweet potatoes, bananas, mangoes and numerous other things all growing in the backyard. I cannot remember having a meal in the Torres Strait, in my six, eight years—whatever it was—as minister, where all of the food, not just some of the food, was not Indigenous. Turtle, dugong, fish, crayfish, crab and all of the things I mentioned before, fruit and vegetables, all came from the Torres Strait. This time when I went up there to that same island, Joey Mosby's island, I actually paced out the shelf space. One-seventh of the entire shelf was taken up with rice. This is a really grindingly poor Third World country, and you created that—you people in this parliament. It's on your consciences.


Who do we blame? Who banned the market gardens? That sounds horrific and it sounds unbelievable. Why did you ban the market gardens of the Torres Strait? Because you said disease could come down from New Guinea. AQIS couldn't be bothered putting any AQIS officers at the Torres Strait's Horn Island Airport. The only way of getting into Australia is through the airport. They couldn't even be bothered putting a quarantine officer there, and yet they could go and ban every single market garden in the Torres Strait. They couldn't be bothered putting a single AQIS officer at the Jardine River, which is the only other real way of entering Australia with anything from the Torres Strait. You can either land and come by road transport or cross the Jardine River and go on the Jardine River ferry, so all you've got to do is pay someone there to check out the food coming in from the Torres Strait or New Guinea, and similarly at the airport. But they didn't have officers at either place. Over a long period of time, I've kicked up such a hell of a stink, and I proudly say that I think I was the only voice that did, and we do have officers now inspecting at both those places. But that didn't help the Torres Strait Island people, who are now dying in massive numbers as a result of decisions by this place.


No-one seems to feel ashamed. No-one has any sense of shame. What do they do? The Labor government of Queensland went out and brought in Mr Fitzgerald, who had destroyed our government, to tell us what was wrong in the community areas and what to do about it. This absolutely brilliant person came up with the fact that it was alcohol that was the problem. Oh, what a searching finding! Oh, what a brilliant intellectual insight! It was alcohol that caused it. Alcohol was the cause—not the effect but the cause. Therefore, he said, 'Let's ban alcohol.' So he advocated that we have racial laws in Australia: whitefellas can drink but we blackfellas can't. There's no way that you can say anything else except that that is a racist law. It applies to blackfellas; it does not apply to whitefellas.


If you doubt what I'm saying, have a look at the diabetes figures, because they're the highest in the world. I just picked diabetes. There are a dozen other diseases, but I haven't got time to go through all those. On the unemployment figures, every community area in Queensland has a higher unemployment rate than any whitefella community in Australia, by a long way—the highest unemployment rates, probably, in the world. The crime rate is higher than any whitefella community in the country.


When this brilliant ban on alcohol occurred, what happened was that all the alcoholics moved into Townsville, Mount Isa, Alice Springs, Darwin, Cairns or Mareeba—all the no-hoper crowd. So what happened in Townsville is that Townsville now has the highest crime rate in Australia and the highest unemployment rate in Australia. That was imposed by the brainless B-A-S-T-A-R-Ds who imposed the ban on alcohol. I'll be very specific about Townsville. We have 110 cars being thieved every month in Townsville, which means that, over a 15-year period, every single family in Townsville will have their car thieved. That's the result of this decision. The suicide rates in these communities, once again, are the highest in the world. You measure a nation by the way it treats its poorest people and its most downtrodden people. If we're being judged by that then we are judged abominably and we must stand as a pariah amongst nations.


If I speak with passion, it's because these are persons that I know. I was speaking about this to Barry Waldron, the brother of the famous Clarence Waldron—I put Clarence in my book An Incredible Race of People: A Passionate History of Australia because I thought his comments were important enough to go into the book. When they banned alcohol, they said to me, 'We discussed it. We've appointed representatives from your community and'—surprise, surprise!—'they've all voted to ban alcohol.' Three people yelled out, 'Yeah, the missionary ladies.' I'm a practising Christian and I greatly revere the missionary ladies. They set a very good example in the community. But it was a fair call to say that they appointed the missionary ladies to decide whether they should not have alcohol at Doomadgee. Clarence Waldron said—and I've quoted this a million times: 'You don't come here and say what's what, and that's that. This is my land! This is my land! You don't come here and say what's what, and that's that. This is my land!' And, yes, as a person that identifies as a blackfella in my homeland, I proudly say that we held British occupation at bay for nearly 70 years at Kalkadoon. Not a bad effort. Because of that, Clarence Waldron can proudly stand up and say, 'This is my land.' But it's not his land if we go in there and tell him he's not allowed to drink alcohol. The only group of people on earth banned from drinking alcohol are the First Australians in Australia. And why are you doing it? You're doing it to suppress the symptoms, to hide the horror that is out there. You want to hide it so no-one can see it.


Noely Pearson disagrees with me on this. Noel said, 'I don't argue with you that it is an effect, not a cause.' But he said, 'It has now become a causal effect and we must address it.' He has probably changed his position a bit on this. I said to Noely, and most certainly to his brother Gerhardt, that, if it was going to achieve anything, surely it would have achieved something after 10 years.


Now I'm going to switch subjects completely. When poker machines were introduced, under the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government, they were banned in Queensland and I was his right-hand man in banning them. As soon as we were thrown out the socialists came in and immediately introduced pokies. They are big bankrollers of the Labor Party—we all know that—and the Liberal Party too. But the Labor Party was in power and they introduced them.


At the Buffalo Club in Mount Isa, where I spend a lot of my time, Bobby Jacobson said: 'I should never tell this story, you should be the last person I tell this to, but $3.2 million a year is sailing out of Mount Isa down the throats of the poker machines and into the hands of the government of Queensland.' That is for a town of 20,000 people. That's coming out of the pockets of the poorest people in that community. Bobby Leong, the prominent First Australian leader and long-term president of one of our best rugby league clubs there—I had the dishonour of sitting on the sideline when his brother scored against 11 tries against Cloncurry!—said— (Time expired)

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:48):  There are countless differences between Labor and the Liberals. When it comes to values, we stand on opposite sides of the spectrum. When it comes to policies, we are really, really worlds apart. When it comes to the way we operate, we're nothing alike. There are many points of difference between the Liberal and Labor parties.


The Liberals, our current government, tend to run in, guns blazing, without proper consideration. They base policies on flippant thought bubbles that might make for good sound bites but really do lack in substance and consideration. But we in Labor think things through. We consult with people, we consult with business, we consult with communities and we listen. We use the evidence available to formulate strong, really sensible policy. That's why we in Labor are reserving our position on the cashless debit card for welfare recipients until the completion of the Senate inquiry. For such a drastic overhaul of the current welfare system, it was absolutely crucial that this inquiry was undertaken. I suppose the question is: why would Labor support such a measure if it did more harm than good?


Labor is in this for people. That's how we viewed this piece of legislation. That's how we viewed the Senate inquiry. We view it in terms of how it impacts people, how it helps people and how it assists victims of drug and alcohol abuse and the communities that they live in. Labor will always support community-driven initiatives to tackle abuse. Whilst it's heartbreaking that they are needed in our communities, I have to say my community is fortunate enough to have support from some truly amazing and incredible services. They are services provided by some wonderful organisations in my community like the Caboolture Neighbourhood Centre, our local headspace, the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health and the Primary Health Networks. They're doing wonderful work. These organisations and service providers understand that people who suffer from drug and alcohol abuse are people who need support. They understand that people are all so different. There are different people that may have different needs, different goals and different struggles, so it only makes sense that they may require different approaches.


I don't believe in a blanket approach to income management. I think that's pretty lazy. Neither I nor my party, the Labor Party, believe in a national rollout of a cashless debit card. It's quite clear that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances and that being forced onto income management simply won't help. Labor has said all along that we will consult with individual communities, that we will talk with them and that we will listen—and then, and only then, will we make decisions on a location-by-location basis.


Labor supported the trials of the cashless debit card in the East Kimberley and Ceduna on the basis that the communities wanted to trial the card. After years and years of cyclical issues of abuse and of disadvantage plaguing their areas, they were willing to try something different—a circuit breaker. Labor has been happy to support this test. We've been waiting for the results that have sufficiently indicated whether the trials should be either expanded or concluded, and we're still waiting for these results.


The Senate inquiry has heard that the evaluations of the existing trials have been unreliable and that no judgements can be made on the basis of the information that's been collected to date, so I think it's understandable that Labor won't support expanding this trial until we see credible results. I'd also note that, in addition to the poor quality of the evaluation, the trials haven't really been running long enough to form solid conclusions. I think it would only make sense that the trials on those two sites continue until we can properly formulate accurate results from accurate data. Unfortunately, true to form, we've seen this government announce, in 2017, budget plans to expand the trial to two further locations: the Western Australian Goldfields and, in my home state of Queensland and not very far from my electorate, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. So I would ask those opposite: what if? What if, when we finally get reliable results from these existing trials, we find out that the cashless debit card is ineffective? Or, even worse, what if it had a negative effect on those communities? In particular, we've heard from communities in the Bundaberg and Goldfields regions that there's been insufficient consultation with people who actually live there and know their communities. And yet this government wants to rush ahead without thinking, without talking, without listening and without a clear framework in place. They haven't properly specified how people in trial areas could have a proportion of their income support payments on the cards reduced, and they haven't properly specified how these people can exit that trial either.


There needs to be a plan. We owe it to these communities and we owe it to the people who live there. So until this government can present a plan, we in Labor will oppose expanding this trial. Shaky evidence that's based upon unreliable evaluations and murky consultation processes might be good enough for the other side of the House but it's not good enough for this side of the House, especially when we're talking about people, their lives and their livelihoods, which are all at stake.


The sheer lack of compassion makes me question—it really does—this government's motives behind these measures. Surely, if they truly cared about helping people they'd take the time needed to work out the best possible solution for everyone involved. What they should do is what the Queensland government's done. The Palaszczuk Labor government have been consulting with committees right across the state to formulate an action plan to tackle the epidemic of methamphetamines. One of these consultation events took place in my electorate at Longman, just down the road from my office in Caboolture, down at the Caboolture RSL. I attended alongside our local state member, the Hon. Mark Ryan, who also holds the police and corrective services portfolio. It was a truly valuable experience and a strong reminder of the value of listening. Just to give you an example, when I was attending I came into the Caboolture RSL, signed in and said hello to one of the staff members I regularly see on the desk. She asked me if I was going upstairs to the ice summit. I said, 'Yes, I am.' She said to me, 'I lost two children to ice.' I've been going to the Caboolture RSL for a lot of years and I never knew that story. I never knew that story that she'd lost two children to ice. It just reminds me, re-enforces, how important it is that we consult with people when we're talking about our social issues.


The data and evidence from the round table I attended that day are helping the Palaszczuk government finalise their action plan to really tackle the issue around ice addiction. That draft plan has 65 recommendations. Across different regions and across different demographics, it has 65 actions—not just one, but 65. I think this federal government would need to take a page out of the Queensland government's book. They need to understand the importance of listening, of consultation and how dangerous it is to move with haste and not be patient where it's needed. You can't rush through trials like this.


Labor will not support this trial extending until we have received that evidence of reliable data from the existing trials that suggest they have been successful. We won't support these measures until the government can show us that they have a plan to transition sites following their trials, whether they're successful or not. What's the plan? What's the plan for those people in Bundaberg and the western Goldfields? Of course, we won't support the government forcing such drastic measures on communities that do not want them.


As I said, until the government can agree to Labor's amendments, I won't be supporting this bill, of course. Vulnerable communities like mine deserve the respect of consultation. They deserve to be listened to. Whether it's consultation around matters such as these, such as major overhauls, or changes to systems or services, communities deserve respect in being consulted. Vulnerable communities deserve respect. They need to know that they've got measures that work, not just ones that the government assume do because they've written them on a piece of paper, so of course they must work. They need to be consulted on these.


I've seen the damage that substance abuse can do to a community, and it's heartbreaking. I've heard the stories of lives that have been shattered, of families that have been shattered—of how the life of that woman at the Caboolture RSL and her family have been shattered. More needs to be done, not less. More support needs to be given. But rushing through these measures in their current form won't help with the help that vulnerable Australians need.


Just prior to the member for Kennedy, the member for Scullin spoke, and he was sharing with us a story about a woman re-establishing her life after domestic violence. Part of that re-establishment meant buying second-hand furniture—plates, cups; some second-hand items to get her house re-established. This could be a woman in any part of the country. It could be a woman in my electorate. It could be a woman in Bundaberg. It could be a woman in the western Goldfields. Has this government stopped to think about how important that is for that woman to re-establish herself, to re-establish a home, and what a cashless debit card would mean to her—what it would mean to have income management forced upon her?


I mentioned before that in my electorate, down in Caboolture, we have a great market on a Sunday. It overflows with people buying their fruit and vegies. They're affordable fruit and vegies from local growers. For a lot of people, this is how they feed their family. Could you imagine having a debit card forced upon you if this is where you get your family's food from?


This legislation, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, needs sensible amendments, ones that of course I agree with, the ones that Labor has put forward. They ensure consultation. They will take a good hard look at the evidence and ensure that people who live in those communities that will be impacted by the introduction of a cashless debit card are consulted and that there is actually an appetite and a welcoming of this as a way of dealing with some of their community's issues.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:03):  It's with pleasure that I rise to speak on this bill in the House tonight. It's a pleasure only in the sense that my comments come from a place of concern about the legislation being put before the House this evening, concern that is based upon both evidence that has come before respective committees of this parliament and the experiences of Indigenous men and women who have talked to me about the implications of this proposal in their communities and concerns about the expansion of such proposed trials into new communities.


The bill before us is the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. In essence, this bill is seeking to remove section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act, which is the one that currently provides for the trial sites for the cashless debit cards in three discrete locations, puts a cap on there being no more than 10,000 participants and in fact expires on 30 June this year. The bill seeks to make amendments to allow for both the continuation of the cashless debit card in existing sites and the potential expansion of the cashless debit card into new locations. Regrettably, it does so on, at best, very flimsy evidence, and that is a real problem for us as lawmakers and policymakers. We do not have substantive evidence before us to be able to say that these measures are meeting the deliverable outcomes—that there were clear purposes set down for the cashless debit card and there have been terrific measured outcomes and you can see the genuine social, cultural and economic advantages of the cashless debit card. We don't have any of that before us so, like my Labor colleagues speaking to this bill today, I have grave concerns about a number of aspects in this bill. 


I am deeply concerned about the non-voluntary nature of the measures in this bill. I am also deeply concerned about the clearly disproportionate impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and those who don't have drug, alcohol or gambling concerns, and in these communities there are many. This approach of throwing a big wide net to capture everybody in a community with this very blunt instrument—the cashless debit card—sweeps up everybody and in doing so completely disempowers so many people in those communities.


I could not even begin to imagine what it would be like to have spent my life determining my future and that of my family and being an autonomous human being and a great contributor to my community and perhaps being a leader in that community and to now have to forgo all of that autonomy because the government prefers to cast the wide net and throw a very blunt instrument at what is a very deep, historical, social and economic challenge in many of our communities. To me that is the essence of lazy policymaking. That is an example of a government that has such short-term thinking and has such a narrow focus on the situation before it. It is indicative of a gross lack of vision. It's indicative of the complete lack of ambition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia.


In a few days this House is going to have the Closing the Gap report before it again. Without pre-empting that report, I expect that, like the years beforehand, that report is going to gravely let down Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. Every one of us in this House should be deeply ashamed by the continued lack of progress. I am hopeful that we will see in the Closing the Gap report some progress around some of the education indicators and some movement towards both secondary and higher education achievements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this country, but I think we are all dreading that report in the sense that there will be continued failures of government policy to have the desired impact and outcomes.


You would think that the Australian parliament might learn from these mistakes that we face year after year after year. You might think those of us in this place might think, 'Well, we're not getting it right when we simply seek to impose policy solutions on these communities.' We've got any number of reports and examples to show that this is a pathway to failure. Yet, here we have before us another piece of legislation that I would argue does exactly that. It is exactly what we know doesn't work. Where is the plan for jobs in remote and regional Australia? Where are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people going to be getting their jobs, participating in mainstream economic activity, earning a livelihood to increase their quality of life and having a decent income? There aren't any plans for that on the table. 


Where are the plans that are going to improve Indigenous health and wellbeing in Australia? For goodness sake, this government can't even commit to a housing agreement across the states and territories in Australia! Right now, there are communities everywhere screaming out for safe, affordable housing options in their communities. We know that housing is one of those social determinants for quality health and wellbeing in our communities. But, no, we've got no answer for jobs and employment for these communities that are crying out for some kind of support mechanism. We've got no investment in important infrastructure, like housing, in these communities. We've got no additional adequately funded and long-term wraparound services that would assist people seeking rehabilitation around alcohol, drugs, and gambling addictions. That's not part of the government's thinking. That's not part of the plan here. No! And that is why I call this policy out as lazy policy. We see it far too often in this House, and nowhere is it made more clear than policies directed at first nation peoples. 


Each and every time this government says: 'Frankly, we don't know what to do. We're going to throw this one out there, and see how that goes. But don't worry. It'll just be a temporary measure. It's a bit of time-out for these communities who are facing challenges.' I don't underestimate for one moment the challenges that a number of these communities are facing. People absolutely are crying out for support and help around the drug, alcohol and gambling addictions that are troubling not just to those individuals but to entire families and networks within communities. I don't underestimate that for one moment. But, as I said, what is required in those situations is community-driven solutions—community-driven solutions that are then supported by us in this House. They are supported financially. Indeed, there are other sorts of support in terms of infrastructure and encouragement around being able to assist communities to implement great community-driven solutions. 


We've seen this in places like Fitzroy Crossing, a place that I called home for many years in my life, with some of the most amazing people I have known—predominantly women. Very strong Bunuba women—and not just Bunuba women—have led really brave and courageous changes in their community to deal with the issue around alcohol and the impact that that was having for kids in their community in particular. They have managed to turn around a situation without blaming particular persons and without victimising or socially isolating parts of their communities. They have engendered great community buy-in to the solutions in their town that are going to work to help turn around that alcohol addiction in Fitzroy Crossing. There's much evidence, and that story is now well documented. I say this House should be supporting those kinds of community-driven approaches and pathways that assist communities to empower their own people. They, in fact, know much better than most in this House what will work in those communities.


Regrettably, what we have before us in this House is, as I said, a very narrowly focused piece of legislation that purports to be a temporary measure—but we've seen what temporary measures are like in this House. They have a terrible habit of becoming permanent impositions in communities as decades go by, chipping away slowly at any efforts at self-management and any efforts to restore autonomy to families and community lives. We do people no favours when we disempower them. We do communities no favours when we do not support their own community-driven solutions and approaches.


It is a great disappointment that we appear not to be learning from important lessons shown to us in the past. If there were terrific community support backing in these proposals, or if there were a body of strong evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these proposals, that would be a different conversation for this House. There have been many alternative approaches put before the Senate inquiry. Regrettably, we're not exploring those in this House. We're not looking at different ways that you might look at increasing taxation on alcohol to assist with those. Again, a narrowly focused— (Time expired)

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (17:18):  I'm really pleased to rise today to support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. Many Australians enjoy the freedom to crack open a coldie—crack open a beer with mates—or have a punt on the Melbourne Cup on Melbourne Cup Day, but we in this House are all aware that the flip side of these freedoms is that gambling, drugs and alcohol abuse can have dire consequences in our society. I see it regularly as the member for Petrie, with different families that come into my office for various reasons. It could be family breakdown or domestic violence, and a lot of the time it is associated with these issues.


The latest statistics—before the member for Newcastle leaves the chamber—from the ABS show that in 2016 374 people died from alcohol-induced causes and 1,808 died from drug-induced causes. That, I think, is very conservative too, because it doesn't look at all the other health effects that are related to it. This is not a subject that members in this place should skim over or ignore.


Beyond fatalities, there are many other associated consequences, including abuse in the family home, depression and ongoing health issues. These ongoing health issues involve chronic diseases that can and will seriously impact on the person's quality of life and their ability to participate in their community. These issues also hinder a return to the workforce. If someone presented evidence to a member of parliament in this place—there are 150 members here from different parties—that a program would reduce drinking abuse by 41 per cent and reduce drug abuse and gambling by 48 per cent, it would be irresponsible for that member not to implement this program. The arguments that I've heard in here today are, at best, very weak. The word 'consultation' has been used, but I'll touch on consultation again in a minute, on the trial programs.


These statistics are very real. They're real. They are the real-life changes that have occurred in two trial sites for the cashless debit cards. The member for Grey in the House yesterday outlined some of the benefits he saw in the community of Ceduna in South Australia. He spoke of the reduction in alcohol use, illegal drug use and the amount of money spent on gambling. He said there was a big reduction. He also spoke on the benefit of the look of the cashless debit card. One of the problems with the BasicsCard, it has been reported, is that it comes with a level of shame; the BasicsCard looks different. The cashless debit card just looks like everyone else's debit card, so there is no shame or stigma attached.


Mr Deputy Speaker, here is my phone. On the back of my phone I carry my debit card. I don't carry cash anymore. If I want to buy a $4 coffee, I don't carry the cash; I just payWave it. And payWave is pretty well accepted everywhere. I would imagine that most people in this House would do the same—that they'd carry their debit card. It's a common form of payment. You don't need cash, okay? It's common to be able to payWave things now.


The cashless debit card takes aim at the social harm caused by alcohol, drug abuse and gambling. I must also give credit to the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, who yesterday spoke about the children that this will affect and the importance of implementing this program right across the country. Participants in the program receive 80 per cent of their welfare payment onto the debit card. So onto the card, like this one here, they receive 80 per cent each fortnight. They can use their card in shops, the same way they use existing debit cards, while restricting the purchase of alcohol or gambling services, or withdrawals or cash payments. And that's fine. The participants still receive the remaining 20 per cent of their payments into their nominated bank account. So they can still actually get 20 per cent as cash. I just don't understand how any member or any senator could vote against this proposal when 80 per cent of the participant's welfare income is put onto a card that can be used for everyday items: grabbing a coffee, going to the supermarket, or buying clothes, schoolbooks or new school shoes for their kids—whatever it is, they can use the card. Twenty per cent they can take out in cash and it can be used for whatever they wish. That sounds very reasonable to me, and not one argument put forward today or yesterday has had a lot of merit to it, if you are against this idea.


In my electorate of Petrie I spoke to representatives from local organisations that see the effects from individuals spending their payments on alcohol and gambling and not on the basic necessities like food and clothing for their family.


Mary-Ann from Kairos Community College, a community college in Deception Bay in my area, thinks this program should be rolled out to all people aged 16 years and over. With her work in the community at Kairos Community College and the school, she knows too many individuals who choose to spend their entire welfare payment on illegal drugs and who, as a result, are currently homeless. That's what she told me. The parliament has the opportunity to help fix this problem. It won't fix the problem completely. People will still have 20 per cent cash, but this will go a long way to fixing the problem, and the statistics in the trial sites currently prove it. Lisa from Active 60 And Better thinks that this is a great program. She believes that intergenerational welfare is an issue prevalent in her community. By helping recipients spend their money on essentials, the program would be a big win for the community. She said it really is sad when you see children at the local pub at midday with their parents rather than being at school.


The fourth proposed trial site is in the federal seat of Hinkler. I thank the member for Hinkler for coming in and listening to my speech today. It is proposed that those under the age of 35 living in the Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Childers and Howard regions who receive Newstart, youth allowance and parenting payments will transition over to the cashless debit card. Last night the member for Hinkler outlined his support of the proposed trial in his electorate. That's what we want to vote on here, to make sure that we can get this trial up into the member for Hinkler's area as well. He's right here next to me. He knows his community better than anyone else in this House, and he would like the opportunity. Extensive consultation has been carried out in the member for Hinkler's seat, including 55 local service providers, I believe, and peak bodies on the front line working with disadvantaged families; two community information sessions open to the public; 26 consultations with local church groups; and 25 meetings with local government. The members who are talking about consultation, are you listening? Are you listening to what I'm saying? There have been three meetings with the Queensland state government and direct engagement with over 70 community members, either through direct correspondence or meetings. Some 32,000 emails have been sent out from your office. Is that right?



Mr Pitt interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  5½ thousand—32,000 direct mail, 5,000 emails, and phone polling of around 500 people by the member for Hinkler. He's sitting next to me. I think 75 per cent of the feedback received from speaking with that community supports the cashless debit card. They support it. This region was selected as a potential trial site, and they desperately want it up there.


The same feedback has been received from the government's other trial sites in the Ceduna—I spoke about the member for Grey—and East Kimberley regions. As I noted earlier in this speech, I was interested to read the comments of Kimberley local leader Ian Trust. He said, 'Unlike other reform efforts undertaken by government, it has been the Indigenous leaders of the East Kimberley who have led this reform.' When comparing trends a year on in the East Kimberley region the results are fantastic: a 28 per cent decrease in St John Ambulance call-outs; a 20 per cent decrease in community patrol pick-ups in the first six months of the trial; a 48 per cent decrease in referrals to the Kimberley Mental Health and Drug Service. So I say to the members that come into this place and say there hasn't been consultation: are they looking at the ABS statistics and are they listening to these figures? Because if they were, they would jump at the opportunity to roll this program out right around the country. Mr Trust said the reason he was one of four Indigenous leaders to sign off on this trial is that they have been trying the same programs for 40 years, and nothing is changing. We come into this place every year and we listen to the Closing the Gap report, and then the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and everyone says, 'We're making some improvement, but a lot hasn't been improved. There's a lot more needs to be done.' When a program like this that produces statistics and with extensive consultation shows real results, members come in here and baulk, and I say shame on you. 


I listened to the member for Denison. What a pathetic contribution that was to this debate earlier today. It really was quite offensive listening to the member for Denison. He rolled out the excuse, 'Well, it was expensive.' Every other time he looks at a government program, he says we're trying to save money. He said it was racist, but we hear from Mr Truss how well it is working in Indigenous communities. It is not racist, because we want to roll it out in other trial sites, like the member for Hinkler's electorate, where the majority of people are not Indigenous. He said it was an ideological vendetta, but I say to the member for Denison that the only person with an ideological vendetta is yourself. You vote against government policy even if it's good policy, even if it's backed by ABS statistics and consultation through these communities where we want to roll it out. 


I have heard from other members here today that there's not enough consultation. They're wrong. I say to the people in this House today, the members and those listening in the gallery, if you think of people that gamble and spend their money, and they come back and they've lost all their money for the week on gambling, how do they feel when they come home? I would suggest they feel depressed, angry and desperate. What about someone who's an alcoholic? The member for Denison says 75 per cent don't have a problem. That may be true. Well, they won't be affected, will they? If they don't buy alcohol or don't go gambling, it won't matter if they don't have access to it on their card and they still have 20 per cent cash in their pocket. But what about the 25 per cent that are affected? What about the alcoholic that comes home in the middle of the night and wakes up in the morning and the 11-year-old son says, 'Dad, there's nothing to eat.' How do you think he feels? I think he feels dreadful. I don't think he'll be able to function properly, and I think that they will, in many cases, need mental health support. 


This is a win-win situation. I say to members that if you don't vote for this, you are guilty of maintaining the status quo. Look carefully at what you support. I understand that members opposite don't always want to vote for what the government proposes, but this was supposed to be a bipartisan program that's meant to help Australians, the very people that we're elected to represent. I haven't heard any argument from those opposite. If anyone else gets up and talks about consultation again, give me a break, when I've just read out the statistics and the consultation that the member for Hinkler has taken in his electorate alone. I believe that if this goes through, people will thank us. If you have a gambling problem and you can only lose 20 per cent of your cash, and a couple of days later you've got 80 per cent left, I think they'll thank us. I'd ask members and senators to support this bill.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:33):  I speak in support of the position put by the member for Jagajaga on behalf of the opposition in respect to this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I have listened to most of the speeches given by members on both sides with respect to this legislation. I don't question for a moment the sincerity of their belief in their remarks and in their efforts to respond to what is a very serious social problem, in which alcohol, drug abuse or gambling—indeed at times a combination of all those—are generally the underlying contributing factors. 


The reality is that efforts to manage alcohol abuse, drug abuse or gambling have proven to be very difficult across all communities right throughout Australia and, indeed, throughout the world. It's also the case that alcohol, drug and gambling addictions cause suffering to innocent people, often children, to whom we also have a responsibility to protect. That speakers both for and against this legislation have been so passionate tells me that there is some truth to many of the arguments that have been put forward. More importantly, it tells me that there is not unanimous agreement on the merits of the cashless debit card proposal. For that reason alone, the government should proceed with caution. The fact is that the evidence about the effectiveness of the cashless debit card is inconclusive and opinions are, indeed, divided. That being the case, the extension of the program into more communities—that is, in the Goldfields of Western Australia and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland—should be put on hold.


The fact is that the existing cashless welfare card trials commenced in March 2016 in Ceduna and in April 2016 in the East Kimberly. They were assessed less than a year after that. Unless those trials were an overwhelming success, which is not what the evidence suggests, then the trial period should be extended for a further period and then they should be evaluated. That would enable a much clearer picture of the effects of the trial as well as much more time to consult with local communities about what works best for them. That is what Labor is proposing by extending the trial date of the Ceduna and East Kimberly community programs to end in July 2019. It's one more year. Quite frankly, within that year, there would be a much clearer picture of how effective the trials have been or, indeed, whether they have not been effective.


This is a matter which profoundly affects the lives of people involved in the trials. To tell people that they will not be able to access all of their entitlements other than through a card which limits the way that they spend their money is a fairly profound decision for government to make. Indeed, I ask members of this parliament how many of them would like to have their finances managed the same way. Because it affects people so personally, every member of this parliament should consider very carefully the impact it will have on the lives of the people affected. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquired into this matter and reported to parliament in December last year. Not surprisingly, the report was not unanimous. When a parliamentary committee inquires into a matter and presents a divided report, it is a clear signal to parliament to proceed with caution. That is the very purpose and value of the parliamentary committee process. We should not ignore that. Committees of parliament are used as a tool by the parliament to better inform the parliamentary members before decisions are made. Yet the government wants us to ignore that report, which was not unanimous, and thus make a mockery of the parliamentary process.


 Since the trials commenced, I have personally received many representations from people knowledgeable about the trials, who have expressed their criticism of them and concern to me. Not too long ago, I spoke with Aboriginal health workers whose work takes them into the Ceduna area. They raised with me their grave reservations about the trials and the negative outcomes that they noted with the cashless welfare card. These were the very people who have to deal with the fallout of the use of these cards and the fallout of the problems that these cards are intended to try and address, but, because they work for government, they are reluctant to speak out themselves and would prefer not to. I understand that, but, at the end of the day, it's people like them that we should listen to, because they are right in the firing line of trying to manage the problems of the communities that we are targeting with the cashless welfare card.


I also listened carefully to the speech of the member for Lingiari. He supports Labor's position and spoke passionately in defence of it. I've known the member for Lingiari since I first joined this parliament over a decade ago. His experience and understanding in the very communities on whom the trials are being imposed, or proposed to be, should not be ignored. I know that he has the best welfare of those communities at heart when he comes into this place and says, 'Let's proceed with caution.' Let's extend the trials for another 12 months. Let's evaluate them then and we will be in a better position to know not only which other communities they should be trialled in, if at all, but also what changes should be made if they are to be extended into a new community. Indeed, are the current guidelines with respect to the cashless welfare card exactly as we want them. I doubt very much that we got the guidelines absolutely perfectly right the first time round. Have we learnt nothing from the trials that might enable us to change the guidelines and make the card more effective, if that is the way that parliament wants to go? I said earlier on that this is an issue that goes right to the heart of how we treat people. It's an issue that makes a huge impact on the lives of the people who are caught up in these trials. That's why I keep reiterating that we should proceed with caution.


There are some other matters that I want to raise with respect to the trials. Firstly, the trials are intended, predominantly, to target a particular sector of the Australian community—that is, Indigenous Australians. In Ceduna, my understanding is that 75 per cent of the people who are participating in the trial are Indigenous Australians. In the East Kimberley, the figure is 82 per cent. This is not just coincidence. The reality is that this trial is predominantly targeted towards Indigenous Australians. The fact remains that Indigenous Australians have been racially discriminated against, neglected, abused and disadvantaged for decades. I don't point the finger at anyone at all in that respect; I simply make a statement of fact. Treating them differently to other Australians now not only continues that discrimination but also is demeaning and demoralising, which is the very opposite of what we should do if we are going to ever close the gap.


I understand that there have been some concerns expressed with respect to our human rights obligations to these people and how this measure may, indeed, infringe and impact on the human rights of those who are participating. That may be a side issue for the time being but the reality is that it is a matter that should not be ignored. In my view, the ultimate answer to fixing the problem is to close the gap when it comes to health, education, employment, housing and the like—doing all the things that enable Indigenous people to be able to live a similar life to everyone else in this country. Maybe the gambling, the drug addiction, the alcohol addiction and the domestic violence would also diminish proportionately as that gap is diminished. I would have thought that one of our most important objectives if we're going to close the gap would be to ensure that people are able to take responsibility for their own lives. Yet this very measure does the exact opposite. It takes away the ability of people to take control and responsibility for their lives.


The social problems of remote Aboriginal communities are, indeed, complex, and both state and federal governments of all persuasions have struggled with the problems for decades. Most of the people affected by the trials are not drug addicts, not gamblers and not alcoholics, yet they will be caught up in the trial itself and they will be obliged to abide by the rules that apply to the cashless debit card. Why are they being caught up in a process when they have done absolutely nothing wrong other than to say that they happen to live in the two communities in which the trials are currently underway? Indeed, if a cashless debit card is to be used, perhaps, rather than identifying specific communities, we should be identifying specific criteria for who should be issued with a card. The criteria might be to do with the person's ability to manage their financial affairs or whether the person is, indeed, an alcoholic, a drug addict or so on. It should be person targeted, not community targeted. I would have thought that that would be a much more effective and much better way of dealing with a cashless debit card if that is the direction that parliament wishes to go in.


I turn to a second matter with respect to my concerns: it seems to me that the cashless debit card program is a tough measure. Some people might choose to use the terminology that it's 'tough love'. Serious social problems are rarely ever resolved by imposing harsh measures. Inevitably, all that happens is that a problem is fixed in one area and simultaneously another problem is created, or that the problem that is fixed in one area is simply shifted to another area. I wonder, when parliament flags that we are going to introduce the cashless debit card to the Goldfields area of Western Australia and the Hervey Bay area of Queensland, whether the people in those communities, with advance knowledge of where it's going, will simply move out of those communities to a different location. I wonder how many of them already did that with respect to the card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. Therefore, for those who wish to avoid the card's impacts, there are ways out of it and, therefore, in my view, the assessment that then takes place is not genuinely reflective of whether the problem has been fixed—it has simply shifted to another location. That's why—and it's issues such as that—simple observations and simple measurements about the claimed success of a program can so often be misinterpreted.


If we want the best for these communities—and I suspect we all do, from both sides of this House—it would be wise to extend the trials that are currently underway in Ceduna and the Kimberley for another 12 months, because that would enable us, at the end of the 12 months, to not only more accurately evaluate the effect of those trials but also evaluate any unintended consequences that were not foreseen when the trials started. It's a cautionary approach. It makes sense. I see little advantage in moving onto two new sites when we still have more work to do in the existing sites where the trials are underway.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",NXT,2018-02-06,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:48):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. What was the purpose and what is the purpose of the cashless debit card trials? In principle it sounds encouraging: it was designed to assist people to make positive choices in the spending of Centrelink payments and to limit the amount of discretionary spending on alcohol, cigarettes and gambling. It's critical that we acknowledge in this place that not everybody on Centrelink payments spends money on alcohol, tobacco, pokies or gambling, but it's also important to acknowledge that every person in a trial site, even if they are on Newstart or youth allowance, is affected by this trial.


Isolated sites were chosen so that thorough research could be undertaken to determine whether the implementation of the cashless debit card had an overall positive or negative effect on a community. Isolated communities were chosen so that it would be easier to identify the benefits or unintended consequences of the trial.


The great challenge with this legislation is that, at this point in time, we do not know if the cashless welfare card is, indeed, helping the communities where it is currently on trial. We do not have the conclusive evidence. And now before us we have a bill to extend the cashless welfare card at its current sites, and for new sites in the Western Australian Goldfields and for Queensland. I acknowledge that with the Western Australian Goldfields the government already has some legislative power to do that site but this bill would provide for the extension to places such as Queensland.


I think it's important to point out this is an incredibly expensive trial. It is well purported to be so, but I actually have no idea of the cost as this has not been disclosed. Media reports state that the cost of each Indue card used by Centrelink recipients costs approximately $10,000 each to manage. If that is so, if those figures are correct, this is an incredibly expensive trial, although I do acknowledge that the minister has advised me that when it's in large numbers, obviously, the cost goes down.


We do not yet have a clear determination on whether the card actually benefits participants and communities and it is an incredibly expensive experiment to continue, let alone to expand.


On behalf of NXT, I have a number of recommendations that I would like the government to consider. Firstly, that the government should only ever operate the cashless debit credit card trials in communities where there is support—genuine social licence—to instigate those trials as gauged by broad community consultation and not just the support of a few prominent community leaders. This support must also be forthcoming from the people in the community, some of whom would be recipients of the card.


Secondly, all trials must always be properly supported with wraparound services—namely, all of the support programs and services that can augment and leverage any positive outcomes that the trial may possibly produce. The cashless debit card will not change behaviours of participants itself. There must be a network of social services to support the participant to change their behaviour, whether it relates to alcohol addiction, gambling addiction or another damaging behaviour.


Thirdly, and most importantly, before you roll out the card to any new communities beyond those that are currently legislatively available to the government, you must have conclusive evidence that the card is working effectively and these conclusions must come from independent evaluations.


However, I and the Nick Xenophon Team cannot support the cashless debit card that seeks to expand to trial sites beyond the legislative power the government has until we have the conclusive determination that the card is helping people rather than hurting the communities in which it operates. I do not believe we will truly know how successful the trials have been until much more data is collected, especially as the research findings and community response from the trials to date have been so mixed.


In my following comments, I'm thankful to the published work of Dr Janet Hunt of the Australian National University, who I occasionally quote, and the trial evaluation reports from Orima Research. Whilst I note that the evaluation reports indicate the trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling at both trial sites, these findings have been based predominantly on self-reported data for which we can reasonably expect survey respondents would seek to present themselves in the best possible light. In any case, I note that 77 per cent of participants reported no positive impact of the trial, with 43 per cent reporting that they'd had no change in their behaviour since the trial began and 34 per cent reporting that they did not engage in alcohol consumption, illegal drug use or gambling prior to the trial in any case.


The data we have is also plagued with problems of correlation versus causation. In September 2015 Ceduna introduced alcohol restrictions independently of the trial and the East Kimberley region introduced additional takeaway alcohol management from December 2015. Therefore, unless some complex and rigorous regression analysis is undertaken, it is hard to know whether it was the trial or something else entirely that was responsible for any of the purported positive outcomes.


However, there are a few pieces of more conclusive data. For example, in the 12 months after the Ceduna trial started, there was a 12 per cent reduction in poker machine revenue in Ceduna and the surrounding local government areas. Yet, even here, I note that there was no such equivalent data reported, assuming it was even collected, in the East Kimberley region trial site. So, again, it's hard to know whether the trials are responsible for any reduction in poker machine revenue or there was some other factor entirely at play.


Further, I note that there has been no conclusive finding that there has been a reduction in violence or crime at the trial sites. There has been no clear connection established between participants' reports that they have reduced their gambling and alcohol consumption and any purported reduction in violence and crime. I recognise that community perceptions have indicated a decrease in violence and crime, yet again there's no hard data to confirm these perceptions.


I was also concerned to see that the use of methamphetamines, also known as ice, had significantly heightened among stakeholders from the initial condition stage of the research compared to wave 1 of the research, published six months later. I'm beginning to feel like a broken record here, but, yet again, without comprehensive data collection, it's hard to know whether the cashless debit card trial has increased, decreased or had no effect upon methamphetamine use.


Yet the most concerning finding, I believe, was that only 27 per cent of family members said that the trial had made their family lives better, and 37 per cent said it made them worse. Across participants interviewed, 22 per cent said it had made their lives better, but almost half said that it had made their lives worse. These are really disturbing results. It's one thing to have participants dislike the effects of the card upon their life and their financial freedom but another thing entirely for their families to say the card has made the lives of their loved ones and themselves worse.


In summary, the data seeking to track the outcomes of the trial are less than robust, and the data surrounding the secondary social and economic impacts are even less robust. The clear lesson here is that real longitudinal data need to be collected, and more effectively collected, before we can make any final conclusions about the efficacy of the cashless debit card. I strongly urge the government to address these issues if it seeks to continue the existing trials. We also need to look at homelessness. We need to look at education and connection to education. All of this impacts upon a community, and all of this would be impacted upon by the cashless debit card.


I do recognise that 12 months is too short a period for conclusive outcomes and impacts to be fully apparent. It is for that reason that NXT would support the bill to continue, with a limited extension for a 12-month period in its existing trial sites. This is supposed to be a trial, and I want to make it very clear to government that this is not ongoing, indefinite support of the existing sites. We need to get the data, and we need to get this right. However, I reiterate that the Nick Xenophon Team cannot support this bill in its current form until it can be conclusively determined with solid evidence that the cashless debit card is actually effective.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (17:54):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The bill that is currently before the House provides the underpinning legislative authority to enable the expansion of the cashless debit card into new regions. The government is committed to addressing the serious harm that's caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse paid for by welfare payments. The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card, but the primary difference is that it doesn't work at liquor stores; it doesn't work at gambling houses; and cash cannot be withdrawn from it. Welfare payments are placed into an individual's account, which is only accessible with the card.


The card has been in operation since March 2016, when the first of two 12-month trials began. The first of those trials was in Ceduna, in South Australia, and the second trial took place in two locations, at Kununurra and Wyndham, in Western Australia. It began soon after that. In each of those trials, 80 per cent of an individual's welfare payments is placed into their cashless debit card account, and the remaining 20 per cent is placed into their ordinary savings account.


The results of the trials are encouraging. It's reported that there is less public drunkenness, less poker machine gambling, fewer alcohol related hospital admissions, and people are engaging with the support services and working to improve their lives. Many communities have expressed interest in having the card introduced into their region. The cashless debit card is a world-first in how it operates. The trials have been completed and they have been shown to work. There is now an opportunity to expand the card's operation. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be read a second time.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:18):  I rise to put on the record my serious concerns about the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I do so to join my Labor colleagues. I particularly acknowledge the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, and the shadow minister for human services, the member for Barton, for their contributions to the debate in this place and to the wider issues that this bill seeks to remedy in Australian society. 


On that point, I also wish to make a small contribution to an important, wider debate about our social compact to one another as Australians: how we as a society support vulnerable people and how we treat our fellow citizens who are doing it tough; whether we listen to those who are most affected by the decisions we, in this place, make; and what agency we afford to people and to communities to shape their futures and to see their experiences reflected in the decisions made on their behalf by their government. We need to think about agency, dignity and respect as we debate the provisions of this bill. We should not lightly deprive Australians of these. My concern is that implementing the provisions in this bill would do just that. 


The debate we're having here about the cashless welfare card trial and its extension beyond any reasonable remit is a debate fundamentally, on the one hand, about ideology and, on the other, about evidence. In both of these regards, debate on this bill and on the wider issues has been revealing. The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, in her contribution in the second reading debate set out the principles governing the Labor approach to this issue. This is so important. So I join her in stating that I would like to support community driven initiatives to tackle alcohol abuse and all of its consequences, recognising that there are communities which have been reaching out for assistance but also that a cashless debit card or, indeed, any individual public policy initiative is no magic bullet.


As the member for Jagajaga said, Labor have consistently said that we would take a community-by-community approach to the further rollout of the cashless card. We'll listen to each community's leaders and talk with them about the consequences of this card being rolled out in their community. Wraparound support services must also be community designed, agreed upon and resourced to address the challenges facing these communities. Of course, they're different in different places.


We understand—and this is a very important point—that the vast majority of social security recipients are more than capable of managing their own personal finances. That's why Labor does not support the cashless debit card being rolled out nationwide. It's important that I reiterate the words of the member for Jagajaga, because they go to the very nub of this debate. That last point that she made is so fundamental: we should not assume that people who happen to be in receipt of social security benefits are incapable of making decisions over their lives. We should be very slow to do so. In fact, it's not just me or other Labor members saying this. That is at the core of the concerns which have been expressed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which expressed its concern that the provisions in this bill, unlike some other approaches to income management, do not reflect individual circumstances. It's an odd thing for the party of individualism to be so cavalier in its attitude to this right, although its attitude to rights in general has been exposed shamefully today, as it has, indeed, over the life of this parliament.


I turn again to Labor's approach to this issue, which is anchored in our deep sense of respect for individuals and community and our determination to have regard to the evidence in tackling real problems and helping people who are often in very complex circumstances not of their making. There is recognition on this side of the House of the need for a holistic approach to the challenges this bill is intended to address, rather than a superficially attractive quick fix which answers the call of ideology rather more than the calls of lived experience or evidence.


Earlier this week—or it may have been last week—I read with great interest an article in The Guardian by the journalist Calla Wahlquist, which highlighted a very troubling and, I say in fairness to the minister and his predecessor, no doubt unintended consequence of the present arrangements which are proposed to be extended—in my view without due warrant. This article is entitled 'Domestic violence survivor could not have escaped abuse on cashless debit card', and it recounts the experiences of Jocelyn Wighton, a woman from Ceduna who said that, without access to her entire disability pension in cash, she would not have been able to afford to start a new life. This, of course, refers to the circumstances of Ceduna, as well as her individual circumstances. I think the article dramatically and, for me, movingly and effectively highlights again an unintended consequence of what I believe to be a well-intentioned intervention:


""I'm a domestic violence survivor,"" Wighton said. ""If I was on this card when I escaped from my husband, I would not have made it. I bought secondhand furniture down to the plates and knives and forks. You can't do that on the card.""


She talks also—movingly again—about the sense of shame that she has.


I would commend this article to members because it highlights some of the complexities of individual lives that this instrument addresses. I think it requires all of us to ask ourselves if the intervention is appropriate in all cases and if it answers the aspirations that I think we share. This is why we need, as Labor has proposed, to properly consider firstly what is presently going on in Ceduna and in the East Kimberley, to ensure that proper evaluation is conducted and reviewed and also to listen to all of those who are affected and ensure that their experiences can be adequately reflected in the answers we seek to propose going forward. Let's be very clear. The legislation before the House would license, in effect, the expansion of the trials of cashless debit cards beyond those sites presently underway which impact, I think, some thousands of people in additional locations across the whole of the nation without due process or due consideration.


Government members, in supporting this legislation, have spoken of helping young people. It's a laudable goal and it's shared across this chamber, right across this parliament. But we should be careful not to take such claims from government members at face value for two reasons. Firstly, the record of the Turnbull government when it comes to young Australians is simply shocking. The conservatives, since their election, have been prosecuting nothing less than a war on young people. We on this side of the House remember the attempts to leave young jobseekers without any income support for up to six months. We know that today young Australians' futures are being constrained by $17.3 billion of cuts to school education and massive cuts and even greater uncertainty going to post-compulsory education. Young Australians' future is anything but secure under the Turnbull government. Secondly, fundamentally, the evidence is simply not before us to support this claim when it comes to the cashless debit card. We note the claim of the previous minister that it could 'provide additional motivation for a capable young person to take the jobs which are available'. Putting to one side the confidence in jobs being available in particular areas—and let me just say that in some parts of regional Australia, in deference to the areas you represent, Deputy Speaker, I simply do not share the confidence of the Deputy Prime Minister that, wherever young people can move to, jobs will magically appear. That defies the evidence where half of all the jobs in Australia in recent years have been generated in a very small radius around the central business districts of Melbourne and Sydney.


I also note that the bill that we're discussing today was rushed on for debate in the House last year while the Senate inquiry into it was underway, not enabling Labor members—principally, the shadow minister—to properly consult with community about the proposals. This is a fundamental problem with legislation like this. It is also said by government members that the extension of the trial, effectively without limitation, is warranted by reason of the evaluations of the Ceduna and East Kimberley trials. Again, this claim simply does not withstand the most cursory scrutiny. I will return to this point again.


As we return to the debate this year, in this place, we do have the benefit of the Senate committee review. I do hope that government members, if any are going to continue to participate in this debate, will have close regard to this too—and I say not to the tick and flick of the majority but, rather, the good work of Labor senators who looked to the evidence and the submissions before them and found there is an insufficient basis to establish further trials at this stage. If this government were either reasonable or responsible, it would have regard to this and, in doing so, would show at the very least the courage of its stated convictions. If the case for the extension of the trials is so strong, why not let it be shown to be so? What are they afraid of? The Senate has proposed further amendments consistent with the Labor framework laid out by the shadow minister, which I referred to earlier in this contribution, and the evidence before them.


This is the right way to go about this, not to rule the approach out—we're not proposing that through the amendments that we've foreshadowed—but to further interrogate the claims which have been made to consider alternatives and other services, always having regard to those whose lives are directly affected and their human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has raised significant concerns which should not be lightly disregarded. It remains unclear whether the wide extension of the trial is a proportionate response to the important rights which are engaged. The committee found there to be serious doubts as to whether the measures proposed in the legislation are suitable in contrast with other income-managing approaches which reflect individual circumstances, not the blanket approach which is contained in this legislation. It's clear also that we need to continue building the evidence base if we are to deliver policies which are effective. So, as Labor proposes, let us continue and refine the present trial and see—as the present legislation in fact requires—what comes of this.


I want to speak briefly about the evaluation, because this is something government members have been hanging their hat on improperly. If we look to the evaluation, there are serious concerns that go to its findings, which seem, on fair examination, to be inconclusive. I note, just as one example, there is reference in the evaluation to some positive self-assessments by participants and community leaders, and I take them seriously. But these are inconsistent with some of the objective data which has also been derived. These are things which require further work before we roll out a program such as this more broadly. 


Perhaps more telling to me than these issues with the findings—which we need to work through further—are the concerns that go to methodology. These, I believe, have been compounded by this rushed approach, racing to meet a preconceived ideological answer before considering the evidence. We do need to consider the evidence. And, in doing so, we need to reflect on the fact that the evaluation that the government's case is founded on rests on no baseline data, no control evidence and—this would be dear to the heart of the member for Fenner—no randomised individuals forming the basis of the trial. This is what we have seen from so many of the stakeholders—indeed, I would say almost all of the stakeholders without a particular interest; I note the AHA is a supporter—such as ACOSS, WACOSS and the Queensland Council of Social Service. The Australian Association of Social Workers' submission importantly highlights the weakness of the evaluation and, in particular, says:


… it contravenes the expectation of fairness and assumption of autonomy that underpins welfare support payments. 


I think this is a really important point and it goes the nub of the issues which are before us here, and that is to give a sense of agency and a sense of decency to the individuals who are affected, as well as to the communities in which they live. 


The Labor approach is not to say no to an extension of proposals such as these but to ask that the government properly interrogates them, having regard to the evidence and fundamentally to the lived experience of those affected. That's why I support the amendments foreshadowed by the member for Jagajaga. (Time expired)

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:33):  I rise to speak in praise of Andrew Forrest, who has the only big mining company left that is still in an Australian hands. To his credit, he could have sold out for his fortune somewhere along the line. He is very patriotic. He went to a school that was predominantly First Australian. I went to a school that was about 40 per cent First Australian. You can't go to school with kids and play football with them and not end up with them being your mates. I have not the slightest doubt about his sincerity on this issue. A very controversial issue, it's brought him a lot of criticism, but he believes in it. He's the only employer in Australia that I know that employs 600 people of First Australian descent. One of my townsmen went to boarding school in Charters Towers, like myself. He was a boss at Fortescue, a CEO, so I know the intimate workings of Fortescue, quite apart from any friendship I might have, big or little, with Andrew Forrest. They're the only organisation in this country that has a cadre of people—I think there were six in the group—who, if people don't turn up for work, go around, nurse them, do everything humanly possible to keep them at work. It's not just a matter of giving them the jobs; they give them the backup to keep the jobs. When I worked at Mount Isa Mines, I think there were three First Australians on my 12-man gang. I was just an unskilled labourer there. The boss of the lead smelter, Charlie Ah Wing, was one of the pallbearer's at my father's funeral. Charlie was the big boss there, and he was First Australian, very proudly Kalkatungu.


Having said all of those things, if I were on the ALP side, I really would not be throwing stones. They were there for six straight years. Up until two years ago, they were the government of Australia.




Mr Dreyfus:
  More like five.




Mr KATTER:
  I don't want my remarks to be construed as being positive about the other side of the parliament, who have been there for most of the last 12 years.


Our diabetes is at epidemic levels. In fact, I would hope that other nations do not find out what the level of diabetes is in Australia. A lot of people say diabetes is just malnutrition, because the people can't get a decent diet. Most of them are on welfare in the community areas in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York, where most First Australians live, not in the Northern Territory. In one community of about 300 people, two people died of diabetes the fortnight before I was visiting, and the matron in charge of the hospital there said another one would die that month—three people from a community of 300. That would not be atypical of the community areas in Queensland, where some 40,000 or 50,000 people live. They can't afford to get fresh fruit and vegetables into these areas.


There are a number of people in this parliament still that went on a fact-finding mission to the Torres Strait. I never wanted to go back to the Torres Strait, because, as minister for six, seven, eight years—I don't know; whatever it was—in Queensland, I'd seen paradise. I never wanted to go back there again, because it would never be as good as when I saw it as minister. I have some emotional difficulties in expressing this to the House, actually. When we went to the island of Joey Mosby, who was no fan of mine when I was minister—he fell into a category of people that were not keen on self-management and other areas—he stood up at the back of a meeting and yelled out, 'Bobby, they're murdering my people.' The chairman of the committee, who is now a frontbencher on the Labor side said, 'What's all that about?' I said, 'You people and the Liberals banned market gardens.'


Every house, every family up in the Torres Strait had a market garden. They had yams, taros, sweet potatoes, bananas, mangoes and numerous other things all growing in the backyard. I cannot remember having a meal in the Torres Strait, in my six, eight years—whatever it was—as minister, where all of the food, not just some of the food, was not Indigenous. Turtle, dugong, fish, crayfish, crab and all of the things I mentioned before, fruit and vegetables, all came from the Torres Strait. This time when I went up there to that same island, Joey Mosby's island, I actually paced out the shelf space. One-seventh of the entire shelf was taken up with rice. This is a really grindingly poor Third World country, and you created that—you people in this parliament. It's on your consciences.


Who do we blame? Who banned the market gardens? That sounds horrific and it sounds unbelievable. Why did you ban the market gardens of the Torres Strait? Because you said disease could come down from New Guinea. AQIS couldn't be bothered putting any AQIS officers at the Torres Strait's Horn Island Airport. The only way of getting into Australia is through the airport. They couldn't even be bothered putting a quarantine officer there, and yet they could go and ban every single market garden in the Torres Strait. They couldn't be bothered putting a single AQIS officer at the Jardine River, which is the only other real way of entering Australia with anything from the Torres Strait. You can either land and come by road transport or cross the Jardine River and go on the Jardine River ferry, so all you've got to do is pay someone there to check out the food coming in from the Torres Strait or New Guinea, and similarly at the airport. But they didn't have officers at either place. Over a long period of time, I've kicked up such a hell of a stink, and I proudly say that I think I was the only voice that did, and we do have officers now inspecting at both those places. But that didn't help the Torres Strait Island people, who are now dying in massive numbers as a result of decisions by this place.


No-one seems to feel ashamed. No-one has any sense of shame. What do they do? The Labor government of Queensland went out and brought in Mr Fitzgerald, who had destroyed our government, to tell us what was wrong in the community areas and what to do about it. This absolutely brilliant person came up with the fact that it was alcohol that was the problem. Oh, what a searching finding! Oh, what a brilliant intellectual insight! It was alcohol that caused it. Alcohol was the cause—not the effect but the cause. Therefore, he said, 'Let's ban alcohol.' So he advocated that we have racial laws in Australia: whitefellas can drink but we blackfellas can't. There's no way that you can say anything else except that that is a racist law. It applies to blackfellas; it does not apply to whitefellas.


If you doubt what I'm saying, have a look at the diabetes figures, because they're the highest in the world. I just picked diabetes. There are a dozen other diseases, but I haven't got time to go through all those. On the unemployment figures, every community area in Queensland has a higher unemployment rate than any whitefella community in Australia, by a long way—the highest unemployment rates, probably, in the world. The crime rate is higher than any whitefella community in the country.


When this brilliant ban on alcohol occurred, what happened was that all the alcoholics moved into Townsville, Mount Isa, Alice Springs, Darwin, Cairns or Mareeba—all the no-hoper crowd. So what happened in Townsville is that Townsville now has the highest crime rate in Australia and the highest unemployment rate in Australia. That was imposed by the brainless B-A-S-T-A-R-Ds who imposed the ban on alcohol. I'll be very specific about Townsville. We have 110 cars being thieved every month in Townsville, which means that, over a 15-year period, every single family in Townsville will have their car thieved. That's the result of this decision. The suicide rates in these communities, once again, are the highest in the world. You measure a nation by the way it treats its poorest people and its most downtrodden people. If we're being judged by that then we are judged abominably and we must stand as a pariah amongst nations.


If I speak with passion, it's because these are persons that I know. I was speaking about this to Barry Waldron, the brother of the famous Clarence Waldron—I put Clarence in my book An Incredible Race of People: A Passionate History of Australia because I thought his comments were important enough to go into the book. When they banned alcohol, they said to me, 'We discussed it. We've appointed representatives from your community and'—surprise, surprise!—'they've all voted to ban alcohol.' Three people yelled out, 'Yeah, the missionary ladies.' I'm a practising Christian and I greatly revere the missionary ladies. They set a very good example in the community. But it was a fair call to say that they appointed the missionary ladies to decide whether they should not have alcohol at Doomadgee. Clarence Waldron said—and I've quoted this a million times: 'You don't come here and say what's what, and that's that. This is my land! This is my land! You don't come here and say what's what, and that's that. This is my land!' And, yes, as a person that identifies as a blackfella in my homeland, I proudly say that we held British occupation at bay for nearly 70 years at Kalkadoon. Not a bad effort. Because of that, Clarence Waldron can proudly stand up and say, 'This is my land.' But it's not his land if we go in there and tell him he's not allowed to drink alcohol. The only group of people on earth banned from drinking alcohol are the First Australians in Australia. And why are you doing it? You're doing it to suppress the symptoms, to hide the horror that is out there. You want to hide it so no-one can see it.


Noely Pearson disagrees with me on this. Noel said, 'I don't argue with you that it is an effect, not a cause.' But he said, 'It has now become a causal effect and we must address it.' He has probably changed his position a bit on this. I said to Noely, and most certainly to his brother Gerhardt, that, if it was going to achieve anything, surely it would have achieved something after 10 years.


Now I'm going to switch subjects completely. When poker machines were introduced, under the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government, they were banned in Queensland and I was his right-hand man in banning them. As soon as we were thrown out the socialists came in and immediately introduced pokies. They are big bankrollers of the Labor Party—we all know that—and the Liberal Party too. But the Labor Party was in power and they introduced them.


At the Buffalo Club in Mount Isa, where I spend a lot of my time, Bobby Jacobson said: 'I should never tell this story, you should be the last person I tell this to, but $3.2 million a year is sailing out of Mount Isa down the throats of the poker machines and into the hands of the government of Queensland.' That is for a town of 20,000 people. That's coming out of the pockets of the poorest people in that community. Bobby Leong, the prominent First Australian leader and long-term president of one of our best rugby league clubs there—I had the dishonour of sitting on the sideline when his brother scored against 11 tries against Cloncurry!—said— (Time expired)

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:48):  There are countless differences between Labor and the Liberals. When it comes to values, we stand on opposite sides of the spectrum. When it comes to policies, we are really, really worlds apart. When it comes to the way we operate, we're nothing alike. There are many points of difference between the Liberal and Labor parties.


The Liberals, our current government, tend to run in, guns blazing, without proper consideration. They base policies on flippant thought bubbles that might make for good sound bites but really do lack in substance and consideration. But we in Labor think things through. We consult with people, we consult with business, we consult with communities and we listen. We use the evidence available to formulate strong, really sensible policy. That's why we in Labor are reserving our position on the cashless debit card for welfare recipients until the completion of the Senate inquiry. For such a drastic overhaul of the current welfare system, it was absolutely crucial that this inquiry was undertaken. I suppose the question is: why would Labor support such a measure if it did more harm than good?


Labor is in this for people. That's how we viewed this piece of legislation. That's how we viewed the Senate inquiry. We view it in terms of how it impacts people, how it helps people and how it assists victims of drug and alcohol abuse and the communities that they live in. Labor will always support community-driven initiatives to tackle abuse. Whilst it's heartbreaking that they are needed in our communities, I have to say my community is fortunate enough to have support from some truly amazing and incredible services. They are services provided by some wonderful organisations in my community like the Caboolture Neighbourhood Centre, our local headspace, the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health and the Primary Health Networks. They're doing wonderful work. These organisations and service providers understand that people who suffer from drug and alcohol abuse are people who need support. They understand that people are all so different. There are different people that may have different needs, different goals and different struggles, so it only makes sense that they may require different approaches.


I don't believe in a blanket approach to income management. I think that's pretty lazy. Neither I nor my party, the Labor Party, believe in a national rollout of a cashless debit card. It's quite clear that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances and that being forced onto income management simply won't help. Labor has said all along that we will consult with individual communities, that we will talk with them and that we will listen—and then, and only then, will we make decisions on a location-by-location basis.


Labor supported the trials of the cashless debit card in the East Kimberley and Ceduna on the basis that the communities wanted to trial the card. After years and years of cyclical issues of abuse and of disadvantage plaguing their areas, they were willing to try something different—a circuit breaker. Labor has been happy to support this test. We've been waiting for the results that have sufficiently indicated whether the trials should be either expanded or concluded, and we're still waiting for these results.


The Senate inquiry has heard that the evaluations of the existing trials have been unreliable and that no judgements can be made on the basis of the information that's been collected to date, so I think it's understandable that Labor won't support expanding this trial until we see credible results. I'd also note that, in addition to the poor quality of the evaluation, the trials haven't really been running long enough to form solid conclusions. I think it would only make sense that the trials on those two sites continue until we can properly formulate accurate results from accurate data. Unfortunately, true to form, we've seen this government announce, in 2017, budget plans to expand the trial to two further locations: the Western Australian Goldfields and, in my home state of Queensland and not very far from my electorate, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. So I would ask those opposite: what if? What if, when we finally get reliable results from these existing trials, we find out that the cashless debit card is ineffective? Or, even worse, what if it had a negative effect on those communities? In particular, we've heard from communities in the Bundaberg and Goldfields regions that there's been insufficient consultation with people who actually live there and know their communities. And yet this government wants to rush ahead without thinking, without talking, without listening and without a clear framework in place. They haven't properly specified how people in trial areas could have a proportion of their income support payments on the cards reduced, and they haven't properly specified how these people can exit that trial either.


There needs to be a plan. We owe it to these communities and we owe it to the people who live there. So until this government can present a plan, we in Labor will oppose expanding this trial. Shaky evidence that's based upon unreliable evaluations and murky consultation processes might be good enough for the other side of the House but it's not good enough for this side of the House, especially when we're talking about people, their lives and their livelihoods, which are all at stake.


The sheer lack of compassion makes me question—it really does—this government's motives behind these measures. Surely, if they truly cared about helping people they'd take the time needed to work out the best possible solution for everyone involved. What they should do is what the Queensland government's done. The Palaszczuk Labor government have been consulting with committees right across the state to formulate an action plan to tackle the epidemic of methamphetamines. One of these consultation events took place in my electorate at Longman, just down the road from my office in Caboolture, down at the Caboolture RSL. I attended alongside our local state member, the Hon. Mark Ryan, who also holds the police and corrective services portfolio. It was a truly valuable experience and a strong reminder of the value of listening. Just to give you an example, when I was attending I came into the Caboolture RSL, signed in and said hello to one of the staff members I regularly see on the desk. She asked me if I was going upstairs to the ice summit. I said, 'Yes, I am.' She said to me, 'I lost two children to ice.' I've been going to the Caboolture RSL for a lot of years and I never knew that story. I never knew that story that she'd lost two children to ice. It just reminds me, re-enforces, how important it is that we consult with people when we're talking about our social issues.


The data and evidence from the round table I attended that day are helping the Palaszczuk government finalise their action plan to really tackle the issue around ice addiction. That draft plan has 65 recommendations. Across different regions and across different demographics, it has 65 actions—not just one, but 65. I think this federal government would need to take a page out of the Queensland government's book. They need to understand the importance of listening, of consultation and how dangerous it is to move with haste and not be patient where it's needed. You can't rush through trials like this.


Labor will not support this trial extending until we have received that evidence of reliable data from the existing trials that suggest they have been successful. We won't support these measures until the government can show us that they have a plan to transition sites following their trials, whether they're successful or not. What's the plan? What's the plan for those people in Bundaberg and the western Goldfields? Of course, we won't support the government forcing such drastic measures on communities that do not want them.


As I said, until the government can agree to Labor's amendments, I won't be supporting this bill, of course. Vulnerable communities like mine deserve the respect of consultation. They deserve to be listened to. Whether it's consultation around matters such as these, such as major overhauls, or changes to systems or services, communities deserve respect in being consulted. Vulnerable communities deserve respect. They need to know that they've got measures that work, not just ones that the government assume do because they've written them on a piece of paper, so of course they must work. They need to be consulted on these.


I've seen the damage that substance abuse can do to a community, and it's heartbreaking. I've heard the stories of lives that have been shattered, of families that have been shattered—of how the life of that woman at the Caboolture RSL and her family have been shattered. More needs to be done, not less. More support needs to be given. But rushing through these measures in their current form won't help with the help that vulnerable Australians need.


Just prior to the member for Kennedy, the member for Scullin spoke, and he was sharing with us a story about a woman re-establishing her life after domestic violence. Part of that re-establishment meant buying second-hand furniture—plates, cups; some second-hand items to get her house re-established. This could be a woman in any part of the country. It could be a woman in my electorate. It could be a woman in Bundaberg. It could be a woman in the western Goldfields. Has this government stopped to think about how important that is for that woman to re-establish herself, to re-establish a home, and what a cashless debit card would mean to her—what it would mean to have income management forced upon her?


I mentioned before that in my electorate, down in Caboolture, we have a great market on a Sunday. It overflows with people buying their fruit and vegies. They're affordable fruit and vegies from local growers. For a lot of people, this is how they feed their family. Could you imagine having a debit card forced upon you if this is where you get your family's food from?


This legislation, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, needs sensible amendments, ones that of course I agree with, the ones that Labor has put forward. They ensure consultation. They will take a good hard look at the evidence and ensure that people who live in those communities that will be impacted by the introduction of a cashless debit card are consulted and that there is actually an appetite and a welcoming of this as a way of dealing with some of their community's issues.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:03):  It's with pleasure that I rise to speak on this bill in the House tonight. It's a pleasure only in the sense that my comments come from a place of concern about the legislation being put before the House this evening, concern that is based upon both evidence that has come before respective committees of this parliament and the experiences of Indigenous men and women who have talked to me about the implications of this proposal in their communities and concerns about the expansion of such proposed trials into new communities.


The bill before us is the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. In essence, this bill is seeking to remove section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act, which is the one that currently provides for the trial sites for the cashless debit cards in three discrete locations, puts a cap on there being no more than 10,000 participants and in fact expires on 30 June this year. The bill seeks to make amendments to allow for both the continuation of the cashless debit card in existing sites and the potential expansion of the cashless debit card into new locations. Regrettably, it does so on, at best, very flimsy evidence, and that is a real problem for us as lawmakers and policymakers. We do not have substantive evidence before us to be able to say that these measures are meeting the deliverable outcomes—that there were clear purposes set down for the cashless debit card and there have been terrific measured outcomes and you can see the genuine social, cultural and economic advantages of the cashless debit card. We don't have any of that before us so, like my Labor colleagues speaking to this bill today, I have grave concerns about a number of aspects in this bill. 


I am deeply concerned about the non-voluntary nature of the measures in this bill. I am also deeply concerned about the clearly disproportionate impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and those who don't have drug, alcohol or gambling concerns, and in these communities there are many. This approach of throwing a big wide net to capture everybody in a community with this very blunt instrument—the cashless debit card—sweeps up everybody and in doing so completely disempowers so many people in those communities.


I could not even begin to imagine what it would be like to have spent my life determining my future and that of my family and being an autonomous human being and a great contributor to my community and perhaps being a leader in that community and to now have to forgo all of that autonomy because the government prefers to cast the wide net and throw a very blunt instrument at what is a very deep, historical, social and economic challenge in many of our communities. To me that is the essence of lazy policymaking. That is an example of a government that has such short-term thinking and has such a narrow focus on the situation before it. It is indicative of a gross lack of vision. It's indicative of the complete lack of ambition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia.


In a few days this House is going to have the Closing the Gap report before it again. Without pre-empting that report, I expect that, like the years beforehand, that report is going to gravely let down Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. Every one of us in this House should be deeply ashamed by the continued lack of progress. I am hopeful that we will see in the Closing the Gap report some progress around some of the education indicators and some movement towards both secondary and higher education achievements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this country, but I think we are all dreading that report in the sense that there will be continued failures of government policy to have the desired impact and outcomes.


You would think that the Australian parliament might learn from these mistakes that we face year after year after year. You might think those of us in this place might think, 'Well, we're not getting it right when we simply seek to impose policy solutions on these communities.' We've got any number of reports and examples to show that this is a pathway to failure. Yet, here we have before us another piece of legislation that I would argue does exactly that. It is exactly what we know doesn't work. Where is the plan for jobs in remote and regional Australia? Where are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people going to be getting their jobs, participating in mainstream economic activity, earning a livelihood to increase their quality of life and having a decent income? There aren't any plans for that on the table. 


Where are the plans that are going to improve Indigenous health and wellbeing in Australia? For goodness sake, this government can't even commit to a housing agreement across the states and territories in Australia! Right now, there are communities everywhere screaming out for safe, affordable housing options in their communities. We know that housing is one of those social determinants for quality health and wellbeing in our communities. But, no, we've got no answer for jobs and employment for these communities that are crying out for some kind of support mechanism. We've got no investment in important infrastructure, like housing, in these communities. We've got no additional adequately funded and long-term wraparound services that would assist people seeking rehabilitation around alcohol, drugs, and gambling addictions. That's not part of the government's thinking. That's not part of the plan here. No! And that is why I call this policy out as lazy policy. We see it far too often in this House, and nowhere is it made more clear than policies directed at first nation peoples. 


Each and every time this government says: 'Frankly, we don't know what to do. We're going to throw this one out there, and see how that goes. But don't worry. It'll just be a temporary measure. It's a bit of time-out for these communities who are facing challenges.' I don't underestimate for one moment the challenges that a number of these communities are facing. People absolutely are crying out for support and help around the drug, alcohol and gambling addictions that are troubling not just to those individuals but to entire families and networks within communities. I don't underestimate that for one moment. But, as I said, what is required in those situations is community-driven solutions—community-driven solutions that are then supported by us in this House. They are supported financially. Indeed, there are other sorts of support in terms of infrastructure and encouragement around being able to assist communities to implement great community-driven solutions. 


We've seen this in places like Fitzroy Crossing, a place that I called home for many years in my life, with some of the most amazing people I have known—predominantly women. Very strong Bunuba women—and not just Bunuba women—have led really brave and courageous changes in their community to deal with the issue around alcohol and the impact that that was having for kids in their community in particular. They have managed to turn around a situation without blaming particular persons and without victimising or socially isolating parts of their communities. They have engendered great community buy-in to the solutions in their town that are going to work to help turn around that alcohol addiction in Fitzroy Crossing. There's much evidence, and that story is now well documented. I say this House should be supporting those kinds of community-driven approaches and pathways that assist communities to empower their own people. They, in fact, know much better than most in this House what will work in those communities.


Regrettably, what we have before us in this House is, as I said, a very narrowly focused piece of legislation that purports to be a temporary measure—but we've seen what temporary measures are like in this House. They have a terrible habit of becoming permanent impositions in communities as decades go by, chipping away slowly at any efforts at self-management and any efforts to restore autonomy to families and community lives. We do people no favours when we disempower them. We do communities no favours when we do not support their own community-driven solutions and approaches.


It is a great disappointment that we appear not to be learning from important lessons shown to us in the past. If there were terrific community support backing in these proposals, or if there were a body of strong evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these proposals, that would be a different conversation for this House. There have been many alternative approaches put before the Senate inquiry. Regrettably, we're not exploring those in this House. We're not looking at different ways that you might look at increasing taxation on alcohol to assist with those. Again, a narrowly focused— (Time expired)

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (17:18):  I'm really pleased to rise today to support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. Many Australians enjoy the freedom to crack open a coldie—crack open a beer with mates—or have a punt on the Melbourne Cup on Melbourne Cup Day, but we in this House are all aware that the flip side of these freedoms is that gambling, drugs and alcohol abuse can have dire consequences in our society. I see it regularly as the member for Petrie, with different families that come into my office for various reasons. It could be family breakdown or domestic violence, and a lot of the time it is associated with these issues.


The latest statistics—before the member for Newcastle leaves the chamber—from the ABS show that in 2016 374 people died from alcohol-induced causes and 1,808 died from drug-induced causes. That, I think, is very conservative too, because it doesn't look at all the other health effects that are related to it. This is not a subject that members in this place should skim over or ignore.


Beyond fatalities, there are many other associated consequences, including abuse in the family home, depression and ongoing health issues. These ongoing health issues involve chronic diseases that can and will seriously impact on the person's quality of life and their ability to participate in their community. These issues also hinder a return to the workforce. If someone presented evidence to a member of parliament in this place—there are 150 members here from different parties—that a program would reduce drinking abuse by 41 per cent and reduce drug abuse and gambling by 48 per cent, it would be irresponsible for that member not to implement this program. The arguments that I've heard in here today are, at best, very weak. The word 'consultation' has been used, but I'll touch on consultation again in a minute, on the trial programs.


These statistics are very real. They're real. They are the real-life changes that have occurred in two trial sites for the cashless debit cards. The member for Grey in the House yesterday outlined some of the benefits he saw in the community of Ceduna in South Australia. He spoke of the reduction in alcohol use, illegal drug use and the amount of money spent on gambling. He said there was a big reduction. He also spoke on the benefit of the look of the cashless debit card. One of the problems with the BasicsCard, it has been reported, is that it comes with a level of shame; the BasicsCard looks different. The cashless debit card just looks like everyone else's debit card, so there is no shame or stigma attached.


Mr Deputy Speaker, here is my phone. On the back of my phone I carry my debit card. I don't carry cash anymore. If I want to buy a $4 coffee, I don't carry the cash; I just payWave it. And payWave is pretty well accepted everywhere. I would imagine that most people in this House would do the same—that they'd carry their debit card. It's a common form of payment. You don't need cash, okay? It's common to be able to payWave things now.


The cashless debit card takes aim at the social harm caused by alcohol, drug abuse and gambling. I must also give credit to the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, who yesterday spoke about the children that this will affect and the importance of implementing this program right across the country. Participants in the program receive 80 per cent of their welfare payment onto the debit card. So onto the card, like this one here, they receive 80 per cent each fortnight. They can use their card in shops, the same way they use existing debit cards, while restricting the purchase of alcohol or gambling services, or withdrawals or cash payments. And that's fine. The participants still receive the remaining 20 per cent of their payments into their nominated bank account. So they can still actually get 20 per cent as cash. I just don't understand how any member or any senator could vote against this proposal when 80 per cent of the participant's welfare income is put onto a card that can be used for everyday items: grabbing a coffee, going to the supermarket, or buying clothes, schoolbooks or new school shoes for their kids—whatever it is, they can use the card. Twenty per cent they can take out in cash and it can be used for whatever they wish. That sounds very reasonable to me, and not one argument put forward today or yesterday has had a lot of merit to it, if you are against this idea.


In my electorate of Petrie I spoke to representatives from local organisations that see the effects from individuals spending their payments on alcohol and gambling and not on the basic necessities like food and clothing for their family.


Mary-Ann from Kairos Community College, a community college in Deception Bay in my area, thinks this program should be rolled out to all people aged 16 years and over. With her work in the community at Kairos Community College and the school, she knows too many individuals who choose to spend their entire welfare payment on illegal drugs and who, as a result, are currently homeless. That's what she told me. The parliament has the opportunity to help fix this problem. It won't fix the problem completely. People will still have 20 per cent cash, but this will go a long way to fixing the problem, and the statistics in the trial sites currently prove it. Lisa from Active 60 And Better thinks that this is a great program. She believes that intergenerational welfare is an issue prevalent in her community. By helping recipients spend their money on essentials, the program would be a big win for the community. She said it really is sad when you see children at the local pub at midday with their parents rather than being at school.


The fourth proposed trial site is in the federal seat of Hinkler. I thank the member for Hinkler for coming in and listening to my speech today. It is proposed that those under the age of 35 living in the Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Childers and Howard regions who receive Newstart, youth allowance and parenting payments will transition over to the cashless debit card. Last night the member for Hinkler outlined his support of the proposed trial in his electorate. That's what we want to vote on here, to make sure that we can get this trial up into the member for Hinkler's area as well. He's right here next to me. He knows his community better than anyone else in this House, and he would like the opportunity. Extensive consultation has been carried out in the member for Hinkler's seat, including 55 local service providers, I believe, and peak bodies on the front line working with disadvantaged families; two community information sessions open to the public; 26 consultations with local church groups; and 25 meetings with local government. The members who are talking about consultation, are you listening? Are you listening to what I'm saying? There have been three meetings with the Queensland state government and direct engagement with over 70 community members, either through direct correspondence or meetings. Some 32,000 emails have been sent out from your office. Is that right?



Mr Pitt interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  5½ thousand—32,000 direct mail, 5,000 emails, and phone polling of around 500 people by the member for Hinkler. He's sitting next to me. I think 75 per cent of the feedback received from speaking with that community supports the cashless debit card. They support it. This region was selected as a potential trial site, and they desperately want it up there.


The same feedback has been received from the government's other trial sites in the Ceduna—I spoke about the member for Grey—and East Kimberley regions. As I noted earlier in this speech, I was interested to read the comments of Kimberley local leader Ian Trust. He said, 'Unlike other reform efforts undertaken by government, it has been the Indigenous leaders of the East Kimberley who have led this reform.' When comparing trends a year on in the East Kimberley region the results are fantastic: a 28 per cent decrease in St John Ambulance call-outs; a 20 per cent decrease in community patrol pick-ups in the first six months of the trial; a 48 per cent decrease in referrals to the Kimberley Mental Health and Drug Service. So I say to the members that come into this place and say there hasn't been consultation: are they looking at the ABS statistics and are they listening to these figures? Because if they were, they would jump at the opportunity to roll this program out right around the country. Mr Trust said the reason he was one of four Indigenous leaders to sign off on this trial is that they have been trying the same programs for 40 years, and nothing is changing. We come into this place every year and we listen to the Closing the Gap report, and then the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and everyone says, 'We're making some improvement, but a lot hasn't been improved. There's a lot more needs to be done.' When a program like this that produces statistics and with extensive consultation shows real results, members come in here and baulk, and I say shame on you. 


I listened to the member for Denison. What a pathetic contribution that was to this debate earlier today. It really was quite offensive listening to the member for Denison. He rolled out the excuse, 'Well, it was expensive.' Every other time he looks at a government program, he says we're trying to save money. He said it was racist, but we hear from Mr Truss how well it is working in Indigenous communities. It is not racist, because we want to roll it out in other trial sites, like the member for Hinkler's electorate, where the majority of people are not Indigenous. He said it was an ideological vendetta, but I say to the member for Denison that the only person with an ideological vendetta is yourself. You vote against government policy even if it's good policy, even if it's backed by ABS statistics and consultation through these communities where we want to roll it out. 


I have heard from other members here today that there's not enough consultation. They're wrong. I say to the people in this House today, the members and those listening in the gallery, if you think of people that gamble and spend their money, and they come back and they've lost all their money for the week on gambling, how do they feel when they come home? I would suggest they feel depressed, angry and desperate. What about someone who's an alcoholic? The member for Denison says 75 per cent don't have a problem. That may be true. Well, they won't be affected, will they? If they don't buy alcohol or don't go gambling, it won't matter if they don't have access to it on their card and they still have 20 per cent cash in their pocket. But what about the 25 per cent that are affected? What about the alcoholic that comes home in the middle of the night and wakes up in the morning and the 11-year-old son says, 'Dad, there's nothing to eat.' How do you think he feels? I think he feels dreadful. I don't think he'll be able to function properly, and I think that they will, in many cases, need mental health support. 


This is a win-win situation. I say to members that if you don't vote for this, you are guilty of maintaining the status quo. Look carefully at what you support. I understand that members opposite don't always want to vote for what the government proposes, but this was supposed to be a bipartisan program that's meant to help Australians, the very people that we're elected to represent. I haven't heard any argument from those opposite. If anyone else gets up and talks about consultation again, give me a break, when I've just read out the statistics and the consultation that the member for Hinkler has taken in his electorate alone. I believe that if this goes through, people will thank us. If you have a gambling problem and you can only lose 20 per cent of your cash, and a couple of days later you've got 80 per cent left, I think they'll thank us. I'd ask members and senators to support this bill.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:33):  I speak in support of the position put by the member for Jagajaga on behalf of the opposition in respect to this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I have listened to most of the speeches given by members on both sides with respect to this legislation. I don't question for a moment the sincerity of their belief in their remarks and in their efforts to respond to what is a very serious social problem, in which alcohol, drug abuse or gambling—indeed at times a combination of all those—are generally the underlying contributing factors. 


The reality is that efforts to manage alcohol abuse, drug abuse or gambling have proven to be very difficult across all communities right throughout Australia and, indeed, throughout the world. It's also the case that alcohol, drug and gambling addictions cause suffering to innocent people, often children, to whom we also have a responsibility to protect. That speakers both for and against this legislation have been so passionate tells me that there is some truth to many of the arguments that have been put forward. More importantly, it tells me that there is not unanimous agreement on the merits of the cashless debit card proposal. For that reason alone, the government should proceed with caution. The fact is that the evidence about the effectiveness of the cashless debit card is inconclusive and opinions are, indeed, divided. That being the case, the extension of the program into more communities—that is, in the Goldfields of Western Australia and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland—should be put on hold.


The fact is that the existing cashless welfare card trials commenced in March 2016 in Ceduna and in April 2016 in the East Kimberly. They were assessed less than a year after that. Unless those trials were an overwhelming success, which is not what the evidence suggests, then the trial period should be extended for a further period and then they should be evaluated. That would enable a much clearer picture of the effects of the trial as well as much more time to consult with local communities about what works best for them. That is what Labor is proposing by extending the trial date of the Ceduna and East Kimberly community programs to end in July 2019. It's one more year. Quite frankly, within that year, there would be a much clearer picture of how effective the trials have been or, indeed, whether they have not been effective.


This is a matter which profoundly affects the lives of people involved in the trials. To tell people that they will not be able to access all of their entitlements other than through a card which limits the way that they spend their money is a fairly profound decision for government to make. Indeed, I ask members of this parliament how many of them would like to have their finances managed the same way. Because it affects people so personally, every member of this parliament should consider very carefully the impact it will have on the lives of the people affected. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquired into this matter and reported to parliament in December last year. Not surprisingly, the report was not unanimous. When a parliamentary committee inquires into a matter and presents a divided report, it is a clear signal to parliament to proceed with caution. That is the very purpose and value of the parliamentary committee process. We should not ignore that. Committees of parliament are used as a tool by the parliament to better inform the parliamentary members before decisions are made. Yet the government wants us to ignore that report, which was not unanimous, and thus make a mockery of the parliamentary process.


 Since the trials commenced, I have personally received many representations from people knowledgeable about the trials, who have expressed their criticism of them and concern to me. Not too long ago, I spoke with Aboriginal health workers whose work takes them into the Ceduna area. They raised with me their grave reservations about the trials and the negative outcomes that they noted with the cashless welfare card. These were the very people who have to deal with the fallout of the use of these cards and the fallout of the problems that these cards are intended to try and address, but, because they work for government, they are reluctant to speak out themselves and would prefer not to. I understand that, but, at the end of the day, it's people like them that we should listen to, because they are right in the firing line of trying to manage the problems of the communities that we are targeting with the cashless welfare card.


I also listened carefully to the speech of the member for Lingiari. He supports Labor's position and spoke passionately in defence of it. I've known the member for Lingiari since I first joined this parliament over a decade ago. His experience and understanding in the very communities on whom the trials are being imposed, or proposed to be, should not be ignored. I know that he has the best welfare of those communities at heart when he comes into this place and says, 'Let's proceed with caution.' Let's extend the trials for another 12 months. Let's evaluate them then and we will be in a better position to know not only which other communities they should be trialled in, if at all, but also what changes should be made if they are to be extended into a new community. Indeed, are the current guidelines with respect to the cashless welfare card exactly as we want them. I doubt very much that we got the guidelines absolutely perfectly right the first time round. Have we learnt nothing from the trials that might enable us to change the guidelines and make the card more effective, if that is the way that parliament wants to go? I said earlier on that this is an issue that goes right to the heart of how we treat people. It's an issue that makes a huge impact on the lives of the people who are caught up in these trials. That's why I keep reiterating that we should proceed with caution.


There are some other matters that I want to raise with respect to the trials. Firstly, the trials are intended, predominantly, to target a particular sector of the Australian community—that is, Indigenous Australians. In Ceduna, my understanding is that 75 per cent of the people who are participating in the trial are Indigenous Australians. In the East Kimberley, the figure is 82 per cent. This is not just coincidence. The reality is that this trial is predominantly targeted towards Indigenous Australians. The fact remains that Indigenous Australians have been racially discriminated against, neglected, abused and disadvantaged for decades. I don't point the finger at anyone at all in that respect; I simply make a statement of fact. Treating them differently to other Australians now not only continues that discrimination but also is demeaning and demoralising, which is the very opposite of what we should do if we are going to ever close the gap.


I understand that there have been some concerns expressed with respect to our human rights obligations to these people and how this measure may, indeed, infringe and impact on the human rights of those who are participating. That may be a side issue for the time being but the reality is that it is a matter that should not be ignored. In my view, the ultimate answer to fixing the problem is to close the gap when it comes to health, education, employment, housing and the like—doing all the things that enable Indigenous people to be able to live a similar life to everyone else in this country. Maybe the gambling, the drug addiction, the alcohol addiction and the domestic violence would also diminish proportionately as that gap is diminished. I would have thought that one of our most important objectives if we're going to close the gap would be to ensure that people are able to take responsibility for their own lives. Yet this very measure does the exact opposite. It takes away the ability of people to take control and responsibility for their lives.


The social problems of remote Aboriginal communities are, indeed, complex, and both state and federal governments of all persuasions have struggled with the problems for decades. Most of the people affected by the trials are not drug addicts, not gamblers and not alcoholics, yet they will be caught up in the trial itself and they will be obliged to abide by the rules that apply to the cashless debit card. Why are they being caught up in a process when they have done absolutely nothing wrong other than to say that they happen to live in the two communities in which the trials are currently underway? Indeed, if a cashless debit card is to be used, perhaps, rather than identifying specific communities, we should be identifying specific criteria for who should be issued with a card. The criteria might be to do with the person's ability to manage their financial affairs or whether the person is, indeed, an alcoholic, a drug addict or so on. It should be person targeted, not community targeted. I would have thought that that would be a much more effective and much better way of dealing with a cashless debit card if that is the direction that parliament wishes to go in.


I turn to a second matter with respect to my concerns: it seems to me that the cashless debit card program is a tough measure. Some people might choose to use the terminology that it's 'tough love'. Serious social problems are rarely ever resolved by imposing harsh measures. Inevitably, all that happens is that a problem is fixed in one area and simultaneously another problem is created, or that the problem that is fixed in one area is simply shifted to another area. I wonder, when parliament flags that we are going to introduce the cashless debit card to the Goldfields area of Western Australia and the Hervey Bay area of Queensland, whether the people in those communities, with advance knowledge of where it's going, will simply move out of those communities to a different location. I wonder how many of them already did that with respect to the card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. Therefore, for those who wish to avoid the card's impacts, there are ways out of it and, therefore, in my view, the assessment that then takes place is not genuinely reflective of whether the problem has been fixed—it has simply shifted to another location. That's why—and it's issues such as that—simple observations and simple measurements about the claimed success of a program can so often be misinterpreted.


If we want the best for these communities—and I suspect we all do, from both sides of this House—it would be wise to extend the trials that are currently underway in Ceduna and the Kimberley for another 12 months, because that would enable us, at the end of the 12 months, to not only more accurately evaluate the effect of those trials but also evaluate any unintended consequences that were not foreseen when the trials started. It's a cautionary approach. It makes sense. I see little advantage in moving onto two new sites when we still have more work to do in the existing sites where the trials are underway.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",NXT,2018-02-06,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:48):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. What was the purpose and what is the purpose of the cashless debit card trials? In principle it sounds encouraging: it was designed to assist people to make positive choices in the spending of Centrelink payments and to limit the amount of discretionary spending on alcohol, cigarettes and gambling. It's critical that we acknowledge in this place that not everybody on Centrelink payments spends money on alcohol, tobacco, pokies or gambling, but it's also important to acknowledge that every person in a trial site, even if they are on Newstart or youth allowance, is affected by this trial.


Isolated sites were chosen so that thorough research could be undertaken to determine whether the implementation of the cashless debit card had an overall positive or negative effect on a community. Isolated communities were chosen so that it would be easier to identify the benefits or unintended consequences of the trial.


The great challenge with this legislation is that, at this point in time, we do not know if the cashless welfare card is, indeed, helping the communities where it is currently on trial. We do not have the conclusive evidence. And now before us we have a bill to extend the cashless welfare card at its current sites, and for new sites in the Western Australian Goldfields and for Queensland. I acknowledge that with the Western Australian Goldfields the government already has some legislative power to do that site but this bill would provide for the extension to places such as Queensland.


I think it's important to point out this is an incredibly expensive trial. It is well purported to be so, but I actually have no idea of the cost as this has not been disclosed. Media reports state that the cost of each Indue card used by Centrelink recipients costs approximately $10,000 each to manage. If that is so, if those figures are correct, this is an incredibly expensive trial, although I do acknowledge that the minister has advised me that when it's in large numbers, obviously, the cost goes down.


We do not yet have a clear determination on whether the card actually benefits participants and communities and it is an incredibly expensive experiment to continue, let alone to expand.


On behalf of NXT, I have a number of recommendations that I would like the government to consider. Firstly, that the government should only ever operate the cashless debit credit card trials in communities where there is support—genuine social licence—to instigate those trials as gauged by broad community consultation and not just the support of a few prominent community leaders. This support must also be forthcoming from the people in the community, some of whom would be recipients of the card.


Secondly, all trials must always be properly supported with wraparound services—namely, all of the support programs and services that can augment and leverage any positive outcomes that the trial may possibly produce. The cashless debit card will not change behaviours of participants itself. There must be a network of social services to support the participant to change their behaviour, whether it relates to alcohol addiction, gambling addiction or another damaging behaviour.


Thirdly, and most importantly, before you roll out the card to any new communities beyond those that are currently legislatively available to the government, you must have conclusive evidence that the card is working effectively and these conclusions must come from independent evaluations.


However, I and the Nick Xenophon Team cannot support the cashless debit card that seeks to expand to trial sites beyond the legislative power the government has until we have the conclusive determination that the card is helping people rather than hurting the communities in which it operates. I do not believe we will truly know how successful the trials have been until much more data is collected, especially as the research findings and community response from the trials to date have been so mixed.


In my following comments, I'm thankful to the published work of Dr Janet Hunt of the Australian National University, who I occasionally quote, and the trial evaluation reports from Orima Research. Whilst I note that the evaluation reports indicate the trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling at both trial sites, these findings have been based predominantly on self-reported data for which we can reasonably expect survey respondents would seek to present themselves in the best possible light. In any case, I note that 77 per cent of participants reported no positive impact of the trial, with 43 per cent reporting that they'd had no change in their behaviour since the trial began and 34 per cent reporting that they did not engage in alcohol consumption, illegal drug use or gambling prior to the trial in any case.


The data we have is also plagued with problems of correlation versus causation. In September 2015 Ceduna introduced alcohol restrictions independently of the trial and the East Kimberley region introduced additional takeaway alcohol management from December 2015. Therefore, unless some complex and rigorous regression analysis is undertaken, it is hard to know whether it was the trial or something else entirely that was responsible for any of the purported positive outcomes.


However, there are a few pieces of more conclusive data. For example, in the 12 months after the Ceduna trial started, there was a 12 per cent reduction in poker machine revenue in Ceduna and the surrounding local government areas. Yet, even here, I note that there was no such equivalent data reported, assuming it was even collected, in the East Kimberley region trial site. So, again, it's hard to know whether the trials are responsible for any reduction in poker machine revenue or there was some other factor entirely at play.


Further, I note that there has been no conclusive finding that there has been a reduction in violence or crime at the trial sites. There has been no clear connection established between participants' reports that they have reduced their gambling and alcohol consumption and any purported reduction in violence and crime. I recognise that community perceptions have indicated a decrease in violence and crime, yet again there's no hard data to confirm these perceptions.


I was also concerned to see that the use of methamphetamines, also known as ice, had significantly heightened among stakeholders from the initial condition stage of the research compared to wave 1 of the research, published six months later. I'm beginning to feel like a broken record here, but, yet again, without comprehensive data collection, it's hard to know whether the cashless debit card trial has increased, decreased or had no effect upon methamphetamine use.


Yet the most concerning finding, I believe, was that only 27 per cent of family members said that the trial had made their family lives better, and 37 per cent said it made them worse. Across participants interviewed, 22 per cent said it had made their lives better, but almost half said that it had made their lives worse. These are really disturbing results. It's one thing to have participants dislike the effects of the card upon their life and their financial freedom but another thing entirely for their families to say the card has made the lives of their loved ones and themselves worse.


In summary, the data seeking to track the outcomes of the trial are less than robust, and the data surrounding the secondary social and economic impacts are even less robust. The clear lesson here is that real longitudinal data need to be collected, and more effectively collected, before we can make any final conclusions about the efficacy of the cashless debit card. I strongly urge the government to address these issues if it seeks to continue the existing trials. We also need to look at homelessness. We need to look at education and connection to education. All of this impacts upon a community, and all of this would be impacted upon by the cashless debit card.


I do recognise that 12 months is too short a period for conclusive outcomes and impacts to be fully apparent. It is for that reason that NXT would support the bill to continue, with a limited extension for a 12-month period in its existing trial sites. This is supposed to be a trial, and I want to make it very clear to government that this is not ongoing, indefinite support of the existing sites. We need to get the data, and we need to get this right. However, I reiterate that the Nick Xenophon Team cannot support this bill in its current form until it can be conclusively determined with solid evidence that the cashless debit card is actually effective.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (17:54):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The bill that is currently before the House provides the underpinning legislative authority to enable the expansion of the cashless debit card into new regions. The government is committed to addressing the serious harm that's caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse paid for by welfare payments. The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card, but the primary difference is that it doesn't work at liquor stores; it doesn't work at gambling houses; and cash cannot be withdrawn from it. Welfare payments are placed into an individual's account, which is only accessible with the card.


The card has been in operation since March 2016, when the first of two 12-month trials began. The first of those trials was in Ceduna, in South Australia, and the second trial took place in two locations, at Kununurra and Wyndham, in Western Australia. It began soon after that. In each of those trials, 80 per cent of an individual's welfare payments is placed into their cashless debit card account, and the remaining 20 per cent is placed into their ordinary savings account.


The results of the trials are encouraging. It's reported that there is less public drunkenness, less poker machine gambling, fewer alcohol related hospital admissions, and people are engaging with the support services and working to improve their lives. Many communities have expressed interest in having the card introduced into their region. The cashless debit card is a world-first in how it operates. The trials have been completed and they have been shown to work. There is now an opportunity to expand the card's operation. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be read a second time.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (18:34):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 1 of 2018. I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report—and I guarantee it will be shorter than the member for Hunter's comments!


Leave granted.




Mr PERRETT:
  I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' Human Rights Scrutiny Report 1 of 2018.


The role of the committee is to examine bills and legislative instruments for compatibility with Australia's obligations under international human rights laws, as expressed by treaties and the like.


The committee's report provides parliament with a credible technical examination of the human rights implications of legislation rather than an assessment of the broader policy involved. Committee members performing a scrutiny function are not bound by the contents or conclusions of scrutiny committee reports and may have different views in relation to the policy merits of legislation.


I note that several bills examined in the current report are scheduled for debate this week, including in relation to:


Non-consensual sharing of intimate images;


Broadcasting (digital radio);


Governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the National Capital Authority, respectively; and


Financial sector amendments—including in relation to banking accountability and the powers of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.


Several bills scheduled for debate this week did not raise any human rights concerns, and others have been examined in more detail to assess compatibility. Of the new bills in the current report, 13 were assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging human rights. The committee is also seeking further information in relation to 10 bills and legislative instruments.


The report also contains the committee's concluded examination of eight bills and instruments. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee has concluded that six of these bills and instruments are likely to be compatible with international human rights law. This illustrates the constructive process of liaising with legislation proponents to identify relevant information in order to assist the committee in its assessment of legislation.


Finally, I note that Dr Jacqueline Mowbray, of the University of Sydney, recently commenced as the committee's new external legal adviser. The legal adviser provides the committee with independent advice on the compatibility of legislation with international human rights law. On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Dr Mowbray to the position and I look forward to her contribution. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to thank the committee's former legal adviser, Dr Aruna Sathanapally, for her services to the committee and I particularly wish her well for the future.


I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation, because chipping away at human rights makes for a very dull and very dangerous world.


With these comments, I commend the committee's report No. 1 of 2018 to the House.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (18:38):  The Labor Party will be supporting this legislation. This is a substantial piece of legislation, and I won't take the House through every element of it, but I will comment on significant elements. Firstly, these measures in relation to credit cards are long overdue. We support them on this side of the House. In fact, we have been calling for these measures for a long time. These measures will improve consumer protections, and it's disappointing, if anything, that consumers will need to wait until 2019 for most of these protections to come into force. That is particularly disappointing when you consider that it was in 2015 that a Labor-led Senate inquiry first urged changes to credit card regulation, which was in response to recommendations to this inquiry that the Treasurer promised to progress these changes to credit card regulation. It's been a long time coming.


That was May 2016 when the government promised to bring forward draft legislation 'in the near term'—and now, in the 2018 sitting year, we finally have the legislation. We have been pushing for these reforms consistently since then and are glad that they are now being introduced to the House. Despite the May 2016 promise of draft legislation in the near term, it wasn't until August 2017 that we saw draft legislation. That means we won't now see most of these protections come into place until 2019 . For a Treasurer who often boasts that he is taking an action-now approach to the banks, it is actually action-later, in 2019. He will get back to us shortly when it comes to credit card reform; nevertheless we welcome the fact that they are finally coming into play.


One of the changes to credit cards is the tightening of the responsible lending requirements for credit cards to require that the suitability of a credit card contract is assessed on the consumer's ability to repay the credit limit within a certain period. That period is to be set in a legislative instrument made by ASIC. We'll be watching closely to see what this period is. It's very important that Australians are properly protected from predatory or unsuitable lending.


Another of the changes is the standardisation of the way credit card interest is calculated. CHOICE has said that the way the banks calculate credit card interest is 'mind bending'. When respected governance adviser Phil Khoury did a review of the code of conduct of banking practice he looked at the ways that banks were applying credit card interest. He looked at some practices and found that few customers would be aware that they were happening at all. Khoury described some interest calculation practices as unacceptable and substantially unfair and that, if understood, would be seen as just plain tricky. This is a very respected reviewer. 


Under this bill, credit card providers are prohibited from imposing interest charges retrospectively to a credit card balance or part of that balance that has the benefit of an interest-free period. Again, we welcome these changes to the way credit card interest is calculated. Again, they are long overdue and we've long been calling for them.


We are also pleased that banks will now be required to allow online cancellation of credit cards. This makes eminent sense. You can get a credit card online quite easily—and I'm sure all honourable members have done it—but if you try to cancel a credit card online, it's very difficult. It shouldn't be that way. This means that, if a customer sees a card that is a better deal, they should be able to move over to that better deal with greater ease. Additionally, customers end up hanging onto old cards that they do not intend to keep, with access to more credit than they otherwise need and obviously often with annual fees and other ongoing costs, which add up over the years to a substantial amount of money. So it does make sense to require banks and card issuers to have simple online cancellation of credit cards.


We note that, under this bill, a bank may not be required to cancel a credit card where there is still an outstanding balance. Again we need to ensure that this bill is monitored to make sure that the impact of encouraging customers to switch credit cards is real and to ensure that it enables customers to better ditch unsuitable cards. 


We note that this bill will also require banks to allow a reduction of credit card limits online. Again, this is very sensible. Again, the same principle applies: you can increase your credit limit very easily, so you should be able to reduce your credit limit. If a consumer has the insight, the awareness, that they have too much credit available to them and it might not be easy for them to manage, actually in doing the right thing and taking control they should find it easy, not hard, to reduce their credit card limit. So that is very welcome. The Consumer Action Law Centre has drawn attention to the fact that, as the bill is currently drafted, banks are not required to reduce credit limits below the minimum credit of the card. I met with them today. We'll continue to monitor that closely. If further improvements are needed, we'll make those suggestions in due course.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill will give APRA powers in relation to non-ADI lenders. These powers, which have been described as reserve powers, are designed to be used should the activities of these lenders pose a risk to financial stability in the future. The bill also gives APRA power to collect certain data from these lenders. ADI lenders, such as banks and credit unions, are subject to APRA's prudential requirements and ongoing supervision. These new powers for APRA are proposed in recognition of the fact that APRA has responsibilities in relation to stability of the Australian financial system which are consistent with its core mandate of protecting depositors.


We note that some non-bank lenders have raised concern about the scope of these powers. We recognise that non-ADI lenders can play an important role in terms of ensuring competition against banks. Indeed, this is an increasing element of our financial system—there is disruption with these new providers, peer-to-peer lenders and others. This includes in relation to business lending. As an example, innovative non-banking lenders can play an important role in providing finance needed to small business owners to expand. This industry is growing. I have seen some of these enterprises myself and watched the quite efficient way in which this occurs.


We note that, in response to the concerns raised about the scope of the powers in the exposure draft legislation, the application of these powers has been narrowed since the exposure draft, and we would regard that as being appropriate. The explanatory memorandum states that these powers are intended to be reserve powers only to be used where there is material risk to the stability of the financial sector. According to the explanatory memorandum, it is not anticipated that these powers will need to be used in the immediate future and will be there to respond to future developments.


Schedule 3 will allow smaller ADIs to use the word 'bank' in their business name, should they choose to. As the EM points out:


… the changes will align community expectations in respect of the use of the term 'bank' with the fact that ADIs are prudentially supervised by APRA and deposits are covered by the FCS—


the Financial Claims Scheme. Under this change, all ADIs can use the word 'bank' in their business name unless APRA, for whatever reason, has issued a determination to the contrary. Currently, APRA permits only ADIs with tier 1 capital exceeding $50 million to use the terms 'bank', 'banker' and 'banking'. There are a number of smaller ADIs who would benefit from the use of these terms, and I note that the Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents credit unions and building societies as well as mutual banks, has been particularly supportive of this change. Again, I do welcome this change. This is sensible. I well remember building societies transferring to big banks when I was a boy, and I had an interest in this matter and learnt why it was the case that you might transfer from a building society to a bank. Building societies are much rarer these days. But this is a sensible change. The member for Port Adelaide, here at the table with me, shares my deep interest in these matters; I'm sure he had a similar experience.


On bills like this, the government always seems to have talking points—and perhaps the next honourable member to speak might go there—which say that the previous Labor government did nothing. That's often what's in the talking points. 




Mrs Prentice:
  That's standard.




Mr BOWEN:
  That's a standard in the talking points—the same talking points which told us the cabinet was working exceptionally well just before those talking points were leaked by somebody in the cabinet! But, just in case any honourable member is tempted to run that fallacious argument in this chamber, we had the landmark National Consumer Credit Protection Act in 2009, which was the first single-standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in this country; and we had the very substantial Future of Financial Advice reforms, which I was responsible for and then the current Leader of the Opposition was responsible for after me, when he took over as Assistant Treasurer—all very substantial reform in this space.


But I do recommend this bill to the House. It is a good one. Of course, we could talk about the royal commission and other matters, but there are other opportunities to traverse those matters. I commend the bill to the House.

 (McMahon) (19:30):  I've been in politics in this House for 14 years and in that time I've seen some very stupid ideas, but perhaps the most stupid idea I have ever seen is the proposal to build an energy-from-waste incinerator in Western Sydney. This would be the largest incinerator of its type in the world. It would operate continuously—24 hours a day, seven days a week. Local residents in this area already put up with a lot of waste disposal facilities nearby. Over the years, residents in St Clair and Erskine Park in my electorate have often complained to me of odours from those facilities. What's the proposal for the people of Western Sydney who are already suffering from many of these facilities? To build the world's biggest energy-from-waste incinerator and for it to operate 24 hours a day. The proposed site of this facility is 800 metres from the nearest homes and less than two kilometres from three different schools. It would create thousands of tonnes of toxic ash each year, and it would release dangerous pollutants into the air from the top of its two 100-metre-high stacks.


The people of Western Sydney are not second-class citizens. We should not have to put up with this proposal. We are not a dumping ground for New South Wales's problems. There are significant problems with the screening process of the waste materials, with all the waste that comes from third parties undergoing no inspection, which is roughly 500,000 tonnes per year. It is likely that recyclable materials and green waste will be included in the substances that are incinerated. This is to say nothing of the fact that hazardous materials, such as asbestos and highly flammable waste, will not be screened and prevented from reaching the incinerator—asbestos being incinerated 800 metre away from someone's home!


I've met with many residents of Minchinbury, Erskine Park, St Clair, Horsley Park, Kemps Creek and Cecil Park. They all think this idea is nuts; they are correct. There has been much commentary on the first environmental impact study, and there is much more work that needs to be done. In fact, this should not proceed any further. It should be rejected immediately. There are, it appears, two groups of people who think this is a good idea: the developer and the New South Wales state government. This could be stopped tomorrow if the New South Wales government showed some gumption. I want to pay tribute to my state Labor colleagues Edmond Atalla and Prue Car, who have been leading the fight against this proposal. My federal colleagues the member for Chifley, the member for Lindsay and the member for Greenway and I have been of one mind that this is a silly proposal. The mayor of Blacktown, now the state member for Blacktown, has also been very vocal on this. 


The people who could actually stop this proposal are the Premier and the planning minister in New South Wales. I must say—I don't say this lightly and I very rarely make a speech critical of state colleagues—that the member for Mulgoa, Tanya Davies, has been missing in action when it comes to this issue. I attended a public meeting in St Clair or Erskine Park with about 300 people, and it was very clear that she was not willing to go in to bat to stop this proposal. She should go to Premier Berejiklian and say, 'This is not on.' She's a minister in the Berejiklian government. Yet what we're seeing is this waffle and process that the state government is entertaining, which has caused great concern for the people of Western Sydney. It's estimated that 168 trucks will deliver waste to the facility every day. That's 168 extra trucks on roads that are already struggling with the current workload.


What's the value in building this incinerator? We're told it will create jobs. But, just like the EI estimates, that falls well short of community standards. The Broader Western Sydney employment area draft structure plan states that development should have an employment target of 21 jobs per hectare. Did the original proposal for the incinerator create 21 jobs per hectare? No, six jobs per hectare! So, we have to cop this pollution and this, to be frank, insult from a developer who, I must say, does not have a great track record, and we are meant to put up with it.


Blacktown Council is having a community forum at 12 pm on 17 February at Minchinbury Neighbourhood Centre, and I urge all the residents of Minchinbury, St Clair, Erskine Park and nearby areas to attend and let the state government know this isn't on.

Ms CATHERINE KING

 (Ballarat) (16:00):  Ballarat has a wonderfully rich history built on the gold rush of the 19th century and all of the events associated with that period. Arguably, the most significant of those events is the Eureka Stockade. The site which is widely regarded as the location of the stockade battle is currently the home of the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka, MADE. MADE, which is owned by the city of Ballarat, not only commemorates the events of Eureka but also celebrates the significance of democracy in our world. In 2013, the site was redeveloped from what was the Ballarat Eureka Centre. This centre has focused more specifically on the events of Eureka and its links with democracy nationally and internationally. With funding of $5 million from the Victorian state government and the then Labor federal government, the place was expanded and redeveloped to become the more comprehensive centre we see today. It is now home to the original Eureka flag.


Sadly, the future of MADE is under a cloud, with the City of Ballarat having undertaken a feasibility study—a study that has not been made public. I understand that options raised for the centre's future range from closing it completely to significant funding cuts. I want to make it very clear that if the Ballarat City Council votes to cut MADE's funding or, worse, slowly withdraw its council funding altogether I will be campaigning against it. There will be many others across our community and beyond who will do likewise.


Council knows that there were many other projects back in 2013 that were competing for funding; the Ballarat Regional Soccer Facility was one. Ballarat City Council made the decision that receiving Commonwealth and state money for MADE was the priority for Ballarat city. In speaking to them at the time, I made it very clear I would support the bid but that I did not want to be back there years later with the council saying that they no longer wanted to commit funding to the centre. This was a council decision. It would be very disappointing to see the conservative-dominated council, one that has unfortunately operated, at times, in a very partisan manner—something that does our city a great disservice—not honour that decision.


The city of Ballarat and we as its residents are the custodians of an extraordinary history. The city of Ballarat has been trying to divest itself of various versions of the Eureka Centre for many years. After having lobbied me, the council secured funding under a Labor government of $5 million and a further $5 million from the state. If they vote tomorrow night to abandon their commitment to MADE, it makes it very hard to treat future funding requests seriously. It will be a breach of faith with me and something I strongly caution counsellors against. We have to save the Eureka Centre.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (16:32):  My constituents in Forrest—and every Australian—need to have confidence that when a Commonwealth department contacts them it is actually that department doing the contacting. If an individual or a group pretends to be Medicare, Centrelink, the ATO, the department of immigration or any other Commonwealth department body or organisation, that person or group will be charged. It is illegal. That is what this law is about. So the next time someone decides to send out text messages during an election campaign—or at any other time—and impersonates a Commonwealth department, deliberately scaring the most vulnerable people, that individual will be charged for doing so. To those with malicious intent or scammers pretending to be from a Commonwealth department: it will be against the law, once this law passes, to impersonate Centrelink, the Department of Defence and the Australian Taxation Office.


There are over 2.1 million aged pensioners in Australia. Those people would be particularly worried to get the types of email or texts they received during the campaign. It was a dreadful time and very worrying for many people. This Labor's famous 'Mediscare' campaign impersonated a Commonwealth department, deliberately scaring the most vulnerable people. It will be against the law, once this law is passed, whether it be a scammer or someone with malicious intent, to impersonate Centrelink—or veterans affairs or immigration. It is really important. We saw—graphically—this infamous 'Mediscare' campaign during the 2016 election. Thousands of text messages were sent, supposedly, from Medicare. Of course, they weren't; they were from the Labor Party.


Why is this so important?


One of the great protections in our system of government is that, when people come into contact with a government institution, they need to be able to have the faith and confidence and trust that the people they're talking to or dealing with are in fact government officials. It is a really key part of confidence in our democratic process. That's why this bill is so important. We already have laws relating to impersonating a Commonwealth official. This is an extension of that to impersonating a Commonwealth body. It covers the situation where it's not just a Commonwealth official being impersonated but an entire Commonwealth organisation as well. We did see this, as I said, during 'Mediscare'. It was very clear from those text messages with 'Medicare' at the top that it was deliberately misleading. It was certainly Labor who did it.


This bill will amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to safeguard the Australian public from misrepresentations and false statements purportedly made on behalf of Commonwealth bodies. The Turnbull government condemns the impersonation of Commonwealth bodies, as I do personally. I see it as well with scammers. We saw this was a giant scam and a giant con. We're committed to strengthening public confidence in communications from all government departments and bodies.


This bill introduces new criminal offences, as it should, and an injunction power to prevent people from impersonating a Commonwealth body. The measures will ensure that the Australian public, pensioners, people on lower incomes and anybody who is likely to receive this type of message, sent deliberately with an intent to convince them that it's a Commonwealth body when it is not, will have confidence that those people are acting against the law. People need to have confidence in the legitimacy of communications from government agencies. It helps to safeguard the proper functioning of government.


People shouldn't take what happened lightly. We haven't. That's why this legislation is here. It is essential to a well-functioning democracy that people in Australia have absolute trust in the legitimacy of statements made by government agencies. Trust is inevitably eroded if people are able, with impunity, as we saw, to misrepresent themselves and communicate on behalf of a government or a government organisation or body without any authorisation.


Accordingly, this bill introduces new offences to criminalise conduct where a person falsely misrepresents themselves to be acting on behalf of or with the authority of a Commonwealth agency, as happened in the 'Mediscare' campaign. For the purposes of the new offences, a Commonwealth body would be a Commonwealth entity, a Commonwealth company or any service, benefit, program or facility—it covers the broad spectrum—provided by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. The offences will capture false representations in relation to a broad range of government bodies and services, from the Attorney-General's Department through to Centrelink and Medicare. Just think of where else we could see this type of campaign running. A scammer could claim to be from Regional Development Australia. Perhaps the Child Support Agency or the Department of Social Services or Human Services will be the next one. The list is significant.


We saw the disgraceful use of messages that really confused with the legitimate messages from the Commonwealth during the 2016 election campaign. Those messages were sent out to people in the community encouraging them to vote a certain way, based on a falsehood. That's what it was. It took advantage of a loophole in the current law on impersonating the Commonwealth or its officials. There were pensioners receiving text messages about the government's policy on Medicare. It was blatantly false. They were spread maliciously in order to achieve an electoral advantage. That gap is being covered by this law. It is already a criminal offence to impersonate a Commonwealth official. This takes that even further.


I am particularly pleased, given the work I've done in the online space, that this will cover scammers as well because we frequently see scams where people send a false invoice pretending to be from the ATO. This law will cover those people as well. Today, on Safer Internet Day, the people who are prone to this sort of behaviour had better be aware: this law will cover you, too, if that's what you're doing. The bill introduces offences to ensure that the punishment reflects the person's state of mind in making the false representation where a person intends that, or is reckless as to whether, their conduct will result in or is reasonably capable of resulting in a false representation. It will be punishable by up to two years imprisonment. The amendments also create a new aggravated offence where a person falsely impersonates a Commonwealth body or service with the intent to gain, cause a loss, or influence the exercise of a public duty. The more serious and deliberate nature of this conduct warrants an increased maximum penalty of five years imprisonment—as it should. These penalties are commensurate with offences for impersonating a Commonwealth official. The bill contains safeguards to ensure that neither of these offences unduly limits the freedom of expression—equally as important.


The bill also enlivens the injunction provisions in the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, providing persons whose interests have been or would be affected by the false representation the opportunity to prevent such conduct through a court-issued injunction. This is particularly important online. The issues around the online space are immediate, global—




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Important on election day, too.




Ms MARINO:
  Very important on election day. The bill will enable affected persons to apply to a relevant court for an injunction to prevent conduct in contravention of the new offences in the Criminal Code. As I'm reminded, it's important to note that the purpose of this power is to enable affected persons to act swiftly—as you need to, particularly online, and you saw that with the 'Mediscare' campaign; there needed to be an immediate and effective response—to prevent conduct amounting to false representation of a Commonwealth agency, which is what we saw. It was very cleverly targeted, unfortunately, at the most vulnerable. These amendments are critical to protecting Commonwealth bodies from what is and will be criminal misrepresentation—and it should be. It should be against the law to misrepresent a Commonwealth agency or body. The amendments will ensure that the public—those people out there who elect us to this place—can have confidence in all forms of communication that come from the Commonwealth government.


The people who live in our electorates take it very seriously when they get any form of communication claiming to be from a government agency. They take it seriously and they need to have confidence that that's who it's actually coming from. That's why this law is so important. We're committed to safeguarding the proper functioning of Australia's democracy—that's what this is about; it's not about anything other than safeguarding our democracy. Trust is so critical. Australian people need to have trust in the validity of communications from our Commonwealth bodies. After all, if you can't trust a Commonwealth body, who can you trust? That's what people say to me. They need to have that level of confidence, and we here are the guardians of that trust. That's why we take it so seriously, and we do, and why I'm very pleased to be speaking on this bill. This bill will strengthen public confidence in all such communications. Just as importantly, it will ensure that those who deliberately deceive the Australian public are ultimately captured by the law. What a great result that will be. I commend the minister for bringing the legislation to the House. It is important legislation. I commend the bill to the House. I'm pleased that my colleagues are here to support that endeavour.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:44):  When I spoke on the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill last July I said, 'I'll be back,' and now I'm pleased to finally be able to fulfil that promise. I'm proud to be part of a government that passed that bill, and now I'm determined to be part of a government that sees through the second crucial plank of this reform.


After hours of debate, we know what this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017, will achieve. In short, it will make it clear that it is a criminal offence in Australia to impersonate a Commonwealth entity and will give affected parties the right to secure an injunction to prevent such an impersonation—crucial on election day. It will also introduce a maximum penalty for this offence of two years imprisonment or five years in circumstances of aggravation. But before this debate got underway we all knew that this legislation was necessary, because we all knew that impersonation of Commonwealth bodies does occur. We know that it occurs when it can have the most corrosive effects on our democracy, especially during our national election campaigns. Members opposite, in particular, know that that occurs. They know that their party and their friends in the union movement are among the nation's leading perpetrators of this kind of impersonation.


During the 2016 federal election, an older lady came up to me at a polling booth and she asked me: 'Andrew, what are you going to do? Are you going to take Medicare away from us?' She wanted to vote for this government, for the coalition government, and its vision for Australia, but not if we were going to take away Medicare. When I told her the truth, that we would not be selling or privatising Medicare, she was willing to vote for the coalition government. But why did she think the Turnbull government was going to privatise Medicare, despite the Prime Minister's repeated assurances to the contrary? She believed that Medicare would be sold, because that's what she was told. She thought Medicare would be privatised by the coalition government. In Queensland, text messages from a phone number that identified itself on recipient's phones as 'Medicare' read:


Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to save Medicare.


But it was not Medicare that sent that text; it was in fact the Labor Party. It's hard to think of a clearer case of an organisation impersonating a Commonwealth entity.


This impersonation was assisted by the friends of members opposite in the ACTU. The ACTU distributed one million replica Medicare cards which suggested that voters should preference the Liberal Party last and lied about the Turnbull government's proposed policies. How do I know it was a million? Because the ACTU crowed about it in a media release. These cards didn't just bear a passing resemblance to a Medicare card, didn't just look a bit like a Medicare card; they were identical do a Medicare card—the same green colour, the same Medicare watermark, the 10-digit code, the font and the validity date. Most damning of all, the Medicare logo was used without any permission, obviously, from the federal government. Is it any wonder that little old lady constituent of mine thought that Medicare was going to be privatised by the government? This is a clear case of impersonation and it can't be allowed to happen again.


Let's face it, the Leader of the Opposition, members opposite and their union mates don't need any more help to spread lies about the government and its healthcare policies. They were doing a pretty comprehensive job of that before they started impersonating Commonwealth entities. During the last election the ACTU sent voters in marginal electorates robocalls suggesting that a Turnbull government would reduce access to Medicare, while women over the age of 65 were targeted with late-night phone calls repeating the same lies. Meanwhile Labor ran TV campaigns with the completely baseless claim that the Prime Minister wanted to privatise Medicare.


In case there is anyone in the country who is left in doubt, who has not yet seen through this rank dishonesty, let's take a second to review the Turnbull government's actions on Medicare since the election. This government is spending more on Medicare than ever before: $23 billion in 2017. Under Labor it was $19½ billion. This government restored the indexation of the Medicare rebate after the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition froze it in 2013. That restoration began in July last year and included the retention of bulk-billing for pathology and diagnostic imaging. In 2013 we saw the highest-ever GP bulk-billing rate for a March quarter: 85.6 per cent.


So, we know that Labor and the unions will happily impersonate Medicare during an election in the pursuit of their dishonest political agenda. What we don't know is what's next. Impersonating a Commonwealth entity was the last stage in a 'Mediscare' campaign that began with simple, old-fashioned misrepresentations. What other impersonations might we see in the future, without this law? Will Labor and the unions perhaps impersonate the Department of Education and Training? In that regard, too, their lies and misrepresentations have in fact already started. At the end of April 2017 the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the government was making $500 million in cuts to TAFE. In fact, there were no cuts to the TAFE budget. Rather, there was an additional $360 million a year in the budget to fund 300,000 more apprenticeships. Apprentice numbers, in contrast, collapsed under the Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister. In May 2017 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, standing next to her leader, claimed that the government was going to cut $22 billion out of the education budget over the decade—a disgraceful line that she continues to push to the media, right up to this week. As we know, the Turnbull government is actually committing $23½ billion in extra funding during that period.


Will Labor or the unions perhaps impersonate the Fair Work Commission? Once again, the misrepresentations have already begun. The ACTU said in March 2017 that nurses, teachers and disability workers were all at risk of having their penalty rates cut following the Fair Work Commission decision. They weren't, as the commission themselves said and as has proved to be the case. Not long after that, ACTU President, Ged Kearney, said that the independent umpire had never before reduced people's pay, in 100 years. In fact, they had done so twice in the past decade alone. And of course we all remember 'Trent the Battler', supposedly a worker, presented by Labor, who was supposedly gutted by the Fair Work Commission's decision. In fact, he was a union delegate who was completely unaffected—a Labor member. It could be others. Their track record in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the ABCC and many other agencies is consistently dishonest.


It is ironic that this Leader of the Opposition started the year suggesting that he wants to introduce a federal ICAC—a national integrity commission. Purportedly, it would be set up by a man who, without doubt, was present when the dishonest 'Mediscare' campaign was created. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has never apologised for the Labor Party's impersonation of Medicare. The Leader of the Opposition is the same man who fought tooth and nail to stop the Heydon royal commission. He called it politically biased and claimed it was a witch-hunt. He's the same Leader of the Opposition whose evidence to that commission was described as evasive and whose credibility as a witness was called into question by the commissioner himself. Is this the man we want setting the terms of reference for a national integrity watchdog? I don't think so.


We all know that that sort of conduct Labor and the unions indulged in at the last election is wrong. I suspect that members opposite would even agree with that themselves. After all, when the Minister for Human Services' office discovered that ACT Labor had been distributing replica Medicare cards and asked that they cease, it took nine minutes for ACT Labor to apologise and promise to stop. If even ACT Labor can tell that this is wrong, why can't the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party? As parents, we all tell our kids that honesty is the best policy. How, then, can Labor get away with these fabrications?


If we do not pass this legislation, there is every reason to believe that Labor and the unions actually intend to continue this kind of conduct. ACTU's secretary, Sally McManus, was, after all, in a previous role, the architect of the 'Mediscare' campaign. She was rewarded for her base achievement by being promoted to secretary. She believes, as is well known, that obeying the law is optional for unions, and she appears to believe the same about telling the truth. In May 2017, she said, in a column in TheSydney Morning Herald and The Age, that 2.3 million Australians earn minimum age. At the time, it was actually 196,300. That's a fabrication by more than a factor of 10. In March 2017, she said, of CFMEU law breaking, that it was done quite often when a worker was killed on a building site, when, of the 47 matters that were then before the courts relating to illegal action by the CFMEU, not one was in direct response to a workplace fatality.


Labor has never apologised for the 'Mediscare' campaign. In fact, exactly the same lies about 'Mediscare' continued in the recent Bennelong by-election and will, no doubt, be repeated in the Batman by-election. The Leader of the Opposition in the House has already suggested that they intend to take a number of their current scare campaigns all the way to the next federal election.


We know that this legislation is necessary now and so does the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which wrote:


The committee considers that impersonating or purporting to act on behalf of a Commonwealth officer, or an entity, is unacceptable and that steps should be taken to ensure that neither occurs in future.


Everyone, with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition, would agree that we need this legislation, just as we need the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Act. We cannot allow a repeat of the outrageous dishonesty and deception that we saw in the 2016 election. We must act now. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (16:58):  I thank all the honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017. Criminal misrepresentation of Commonwealth bodies requires, clearly, an immediate response to protect the integrity of Australia's democratic system of government. By amending the Criminal Code Act 1995, people will be prohibited from falsely representing themselves to be or to be acting on behalf of a Commonwealth body. This bill promotes public confidence in representations that come from Commonwealth bodies and, by doing so, safeguards the proper functioning of government. The bill introduces new criminal offences to criminalise the impersonation of a Commonwealth body. The amendments will cover false representations in relation to a wide range of government bodies, including Commonwealth departments such as the Attorney-General's Department, Commonwealth corporations such as the NBN Co Limited and Commonwealth services such as Centrelink and Medicare.


The bill contains relevant safeguards to ensure that the offences do not unduly limit freedom of expression, and exemptions are available for conduct that is engaged in for genuine satirical, academic or artistic purposes. With respect to injunction powers, there is recognition that there is often a need to be expedient in addressing issues of false representations, and the bill also introduces for this purpose a new injunction power. The power would enable affected persons to apply to a relevant court for an injunction to prevent conduct in contravention of the new offences in the Criminal Code. An injunction power provides an option to swiftly prevent the conduct in contravention of the new offences.


By way of conclusion, the Australian government condemns the impersonation of Commonwealth bodies. It is essential to a well-functioning democracy that the public can trust in the legitimacy and accuracy of statements made by the Australian government. It is clearly appropriate that we, as parliamentarians, give the Australian public the confidence to trust in communications emanating from Commonwealth bodies, and the new offences contained in this bill are a necessary and proportionate measure for ensuring this confidence. The bill ensures the protection of the Australian public from criminal misrepresentation of Commonwealth bodies and further safeguards the integrity of the Australian system of government.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has considered the bill and has recommended the bill be passed without amendment, and the government accepts this recommendation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights have also considered the bill, and the committees reported no scrutiny or human rights reservations. I would like to thank these committees for their consideration of the bill. I would also like to assure the House that, consistent with these reports, the bill contains appropriate measures balanced by appropriate safeguards.


I don't intend to reiterate some of the submissions that have been made with respect to the behaviour that this bill is meant to outlaw and which has occurred previously, save to note this fact before committing the bill to the House: I understand that Labor do not oppose—in fact, they support—the passage of this bill. The passage of this bill would criminalise the conduct which the Labor Party engaged in, which has become known as the 'Mediscare' campaign. The Labor Party are, in fact, now acknowledging that that campaign should have been and should in the future be criminal. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House.

It took advantage of a loophole in the current law on impersonating the Commonwealth or its officials. There were pensioners receiving text messages about the government's policy on Medicare. It was blatantly false. They were spread maliciously in order to achieve an electoral advantage. That gap is being covered by this law. It is already a criminal offence to impersonate a Commonwealth official. This takes that even further.


I am particularly pleased, given the work I've done in the online space, that this will cover scammers as well because we frequently see scams where people send a false invoice pretending to be from the ATO. This law will cover those people as well. Today, on Safer Internet Day, the people who are prone to this sort of behaviour had better be aware: this law will cover you, too, if that's what you're doing. The bill introduces offences to ensure that the punishment reflects the person's state of mind in making the false representation where a person intends that, or is reckless as to whether, their conduct will result in or is reasonably capable of resulting in a false representation. It will be punishable by up to two years imprisonment. The amendments also create a new aggravated offence where a person falsely impersonates a Commonwealth body or service with the intent to gain, cause a loss, or influence the exercise of a public duty. The more serious and deliberate nature of this conduct warrants an increased maximum penalty of five years imprisonment—as it should. These penalties are commensurate with offences for impersonating a Commonwealth official. The bill contains safeguards to ensure that neither of these offences unduly limits the freedom of expression—equally as important.


The bill also enlivens the injunction provisions in the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, providing persons whose interests have been or would be affected by the false representation the opportunity to prevent such conduct through a court-issued injunction. This is particularly important online. The issues around the online space are immediate, global—




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Important on election day, too.




Ms MARINO:
  Very important on election day. The bill will enable affected persons to apply to a relevant court for an injunction to prevent conduct in contravention of the new offences in the Criminal Code. As I'm reminded, it's important to note that the purpose of this power is to enable affected persons to act swiftly—as you need to, particularly online, and you saw that with the 'Mediscare' campaign; there needed to be an immediate and effective response—to prevent conduct amounting to false representation of a Commonwealth agency, which is what we saw. It was very cleverly targeted, unfortunately, at the most vulnerable. These amendments are critical to protecting Commonwealth bodies from what is and will be criminal misrepresentation—and it should be. It should be against the law to misrepresent a Commonwealth agency or body. The amendments will ensure that the public—those people out there who elect us to this place—can have confidence in all forms of communication that come from the Commonwealth government.


The people who live in our electorates take it very seriously when they get any form of communication claiming to be from a government agency. They take it seriously and they need to have confidence that that's who it's actually coming from. That's why this law is so important. We're committed to safeguarding the proper functioning of Australia's democracy—that's what this is about; it's not about anything other than safeguarding our democracy. Trust is so critical. Australian people need to have trust in the validity of communications from our Commonwealth bodies. After all, if you can't trust a Commonwealth body, who can you trust? That's what people say to me. They need to have that level of confidence, and we here are the guardians of that trust. That's why we take it so seriously, and we do, and why I'm very pleased to be speaking on this bill. This bill will strengthen public confidence in all such communications. Just as importantly, it will ensure that those who deliberately deceive the Australian public are ultimately captured by the law. What a great result that will be. I commend the minister for bringing the legislation to the House. It is important legislation. I commend the bill to the House. I'm pleased that my colleagues are here to support that endeavour.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:44):  When I spoke on the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill last July I said, 'I'll be back,' and now I'm pleased to finally be able to fulfil that promise. I'm proud to be part of a government that passed that bill, and now I'm determined to be part of a government that sees through the second crucial plank of this reform.


After hours of debate, we know what this legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017, will achieve. In short, it will make it clear that it is a criminal offence in Australia to impersonate a Commonwealth entity and will give affected parties the right to secure an injunction to prevent such an impersonation—crucial on election day. It will also introduce a maximum penalty for this offence of two years imprisonment or five years in circumstances of aggravation. But before this debate got underway we all knew that this legislation was necessary, because we all knew that impersonation of Commonwealth bodies does occur. We know that it occurs when it can have the most corrosive effects on our democracy, especially during our national election campaigns. Members opposite, in particular, know that that occurs. They know that their party and their friends in the union movement are among the nation's leading perpetrators of this kind of impersonation.


During the 2016 federal election, an older lady came up to me at a polling booth and she asked me: 'Andrew, what are you going to do? Are you going to take Medicare away from us?' She wanted to vote for this government, for the coalition government, and its vision for Australia, but not if we were going to take away Medicare. When I told her the truth, that we would not be selling or privatising Medicare, she was willing to vote for the coalition government. But why did she think the Turnbull government was going to privatise Medicare, despite the Prime Minister's repeated assurances to the contrary? She believed that Medicare would be sold, because that's what she was told. She thought Medicare would be privatised by the coalition government. In Queensland, text messages from a phone number that identified itself on recipient's phones as 'Medicare' read:


Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to save Medicare.


But it was not Medicare that sent that text; it was in fact the Labor Party. It's hard to think of a clearer case of an organisation impersonating a Commonwealth entity.


This impersonation was assisted by the friends of members opposite in the ACTU. The ACTU distributed one million replica Medicare cards which suggested that voters should preference the Liberal Party last and lied about the Turnbull government's proposed policies. How do I know it was a million? Because the ACTU crowed about it in a media release. These cards didn't just bear a passing resemblance to a Medicare card, didn't just look a bit like a Medicare card; they were identical do a Medicare card—the same green colour, the same Medicare watermark, the 10-digit code, the font and the validity date. Most damning of all, the Medicare logo was used without any permission, obviously, from the federal government. Is it any wonder that little old lady constituent of mine thought that Medicare was going to be privatised by the government? This is a clear case of impersonation and it can't be allowed to happen again.


Let's face it, the Leader of the Opposition, members opposite and their union mates don't need any more help to spread lies about the government and its healthcare policies. They were doing a pretty comprehensive job of that before they started impersonating Commonwealth entities. During the last election the ACTU sent voters in marginal electorates robocalls suggesting that a Turnbull government would reduce access to Medicare, while women over the age of 65 were targeted with late-night phone calls repeating the same lies. Meanwhile Labor ran TV campaigns with the completely baseless claim that the Prime Minister wanted to privatise Medicare.


In case there is anyone in the country who is left in doubt, who has not yet seen through this rank dishonesty, let's take a second to review the Turnbull government's actions on Medicare since the election. This government is spending more on Medicare than ever before: $23 billion in 2017. Under Labor it was $19½ billion. This government restored the indexation of the Medicare rebate after the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition froze it in 2013. That restoration began in July last year and included the retention of bulk-billing for pathology and diagnostic imaging. In 2013 we saw the highest-ever GP bulk-billing rate for a March quarter: 85.6 per cent.


So, we know that Labor and the unions will happily impersonate Medicare during an election in the pursuit of their dishonest political agenda. What we don't know is what's next. Impersonating a Commonwealth entity was the last stage in a 'Mediscare' campaign that began with simple, old-fashioned misrepresentations. What other impersonations might we see in the future, without this law? Will Labor and the unions perhaps impersonate the Department of Education and Training? In that regard, too, their lies and misrepresentations have in fact already started. At the end of April 2017 the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the government was making $500 million in cuts to TAFE. In fact, there were no cuts to the TAFE budget. Rather, there was an additional $360 million a year in the budget to fund 300,000 more apprenticeships. Apprentice numbers, in contrast, collapsed under the Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister. In May 2017 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, standing next to her leader, claimed that the government was going to cut $22 billion out of the education budget over the decade—a disgraceful line that she continues to push to the media, right up to this week. As we know, the Turnbull government is actually committing $23½ billion in extra funding during that period.


Will Labor or the unions perhaps impersonate the Fair Work Commission? Once again, the misrepresentations have already begun. The ACTU said in March 2017 that nurses, teachers and disability workers were all at risk of having their penalty rates cut following the Fair Work Commission decision. They weren't, as the commission themselves said and as has proved to be the case. Not long after that, ACTU President, Ged Kearney, said that the independent umpire had never before reduced people's pay, in 100 years. In fact, they had done so twice in the past decade alone. And of course we all remember 'Trent the Battler', supposedly a worker, presented by Labor, who was supposedly gutted by the Fair Work Commission's decision. In fact, he was a union delegate who was completely unaffected—a Labor member. It could be others. Their track record in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the ABCC and many other agencies is consistently dishonest.


It is ironic that this Leader of the Opposition started the year suggesting that he wants to introduce a federal ICAC—a national integrity commission. Purportedly, it would be set up by a man who, without doubt, was present when the dishonest 'Mediscare' campaign was created. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has never apologised for the Labor Party's impersonation of Medicare. The Leader of the Opposition is the same man who fought tooth and nail to stop the Heydon royal commission. He called it politically biased and claimed it was a witch-hunt. He's the same Leader of the Opposition whose evidence to that commission was described as evasive and whose credibility as a witness was called into question by the commissioner himself. Is this the man we want setting the terms of reference for a national integrity watchdog? I don't think so.


We all know that that sort of conduct Labor and the unions indulged in at the last election is wrong. I suspect that members opposite would even agree with that themselves. After all, when the Minister for Human Services' office discovered that ACT Labor had been distributing replica Medicare cards and asked that they cease, it took nine minutes for ACT Labor to apologise and promise to stop. If even ACT Labor can tell that this is wrong, why can't the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party? As parents, we all tell our kids that honesty is the best policy. How, then, can Labor get away with these fabrications?


If we do not pass this legislation, there is every reason to believe that Labor and the unions actually intend to continue this kind of conduct. ACTU's secretary, Sally McManus, was, after all, in a previous role, the architect of the 'Mediscare' campaign. She was rewarded for her base achievement by being promoted to secretary. She believes, as is well known, that obeying the law is optional for unions, and she appears to believe the same about telling the truth. In May 2017, she said, in a column in TheSydney Morning Herald and The Age, that 2.3 million Australians earn minimum age. At the time, it was actually 196,300. That's a fabrication by more than a factor of 10. In March 2017, she said, of CFMEU law breaking, that it was done quite often when a worker was killed on a building site, when, of the 47 matters that were then before the courts relating to illegal action by the CFMEU, not one was in direct response to a workplace fatality.


Labor has never apologised for the 'Mediscare' campaign. In fact, exactly the same lies about 'Mediscare' continued in the recent Bennelong by-election and will, no doubt, be repeated in the Batman by-election. The Leader of the Opposition in the House has already suggested that they intend to take a number of their current scare campaigns all the way to the next federal election.


We know that this legislation is necessary now and so does the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which wrote:


The committee considers that impersonating or purporting to act on behalf of a Commonwealth officer, or an entity, is unacceptable and that steps should be taken to ensure that neither occurs in future.


Everyone, with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition, would agree that we need this legislation, just as we need the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Act. We cannot allow a repeat of the outrageous dishonesty and deception that we saw in the 2016 election. We must act now. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (16:58):  I thank all the honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017. Criminal misrepresentation of Commonwealth bodies requires, clearly, an immediate response to protect the integrity of Australia's democratic system of government. By amending the Criminal Code Act 1995, people will be prohibited from falsely representing themselves to be or to be acting on behalf of a Commonwealth body. This bill promotes public confidence in representations that come from Commonwealth bodies and, by doing so, safeguards the proper functioning of government. The bill introduces new criminal offences to criminalise the impersonation of a Commonwealth body. The amendments will cover false representations in relation to a wide range of government bodies, including Commonwealth departments such as the Attorney-General's Department, Commonwealth corporations such as the NBN Co Limited and Commonwealth services such as Centrelink and Medicare.


The bill contains relevant safeguards to ensure that the offences do not unduly limit freedom of expression, and exemptions are available for conduct that is engaged in for genuine satirical, academic or artistic purposes. With respect to injunction powers, there is recognition that there is often a need to be expedient in addressing issues of false representations, and the bill also introduces for this purpose a new injunction power. The power would enable affected persons to apply to a relevant court for an injunction to prevent conduct in contravention of the new offences in the Criminal Code. An injunction power provides an option to swiftly prevent the conduct in contravention of the new offences.


By way of conclusion, the Australian government condemns the impersonation of Commonwealth bodies. It is essential to a well-functioning democracy that the public can trust in the legitimacy and accuracy of statements made by the Australian government. It is clearly appropriate that we, as parliamentarians, give the Australian public the confidence to trust in communications emanating from Commonwealth bodies, and the new offences contained in this bill are a necessary and proportionate measure for ensuring this confidence. The bill ensures the protection of the Australian public from criminal misrepresentation of Commonwealth bodies and further safeguards the integrity of the Australian system of government.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has considered the bill and has recommended the bill be passed without amendment, and the government accepts this recommendation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights have also considered the bill, and the committees reported no scrutiny or human rights reservations. I would like to thank these committees for their consideration of the bill. I would also like to assure the House that, consistent with these reports, the bill contains appropriate measures balanced by appropriate safeguards.


I don't intend to reiterate some of the submissions that have been made with respect to the behaviour that this bill is meant to outlaw and which has occurred previously, save to note this fact before committing the bill to the House: I understand that Labor do not oppose—in fact, they support—the passage of this bill. The passage of this bill would criminalise the conduct which the Labor Party engaged in, which has become known as the 'Mediscare' campaign. The Labor Party are, in fact, now acknowledging that that campaign should have been and should in the future be criminal. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (17:03):  Yesterday, there was a very moving state memorial at Old Parliament House for its former deputy chairman the Hon. Barry Cohen AM, 1935 to 2017. I've attended many state memorials, but the speeches, the warmth, the emotion—I've never been at a ceremony like it. I want to congratulate the organisers and say it was an honour to be part of it, along with the Prime Minister, former Prime Minister Hawke, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, Rabbi Shmueli Feldman who was the MC, and Stewart Cohen who spoke on behalf of the family. There was a very moving Welcome to Country that I want to pay tribute to in particular.


The memorial took place after Rabbi Feldman conducted a funeral—as is the Jewish custom—at the north Canberra cemetery a couple of days before Christmas, soon after Barry passed. The state memorial and the funeral were two distinct events. I want to repeat and elaborate on some of the things I said at the memorial yesterday. I particularly want to praise Rachel Baxendale, who, in the online version of The Australian, had a very good report of what the various major speakers said about the passing of such a notable former minister. The ABC ran a report too, but it's a shame that the Fairfax press in its self-indulgence didn't carry a word of it today or yesterday.


I said yesterday that all of us worked for Barry Cohen even when we were not employed by him. Even when I was elected to parliament it made no difference to Barry: he still thought I worked for him and just needed to implement his million bright ideas. Barry was, in the Australian vernacular meaning of the word, a character. He was a sports commentator for Sydney's TCN 9. That's probably because he was nearly a professional golfer. The wonderful booklet that accompanied his memorial shows a picture of him in the swing in the back. Apparently he accompanied Prime Minister Hawke many times on the golf course. He was the first small businessman I know of in North Sydney to join a union, the SDA. The legendary 'Johno' Johnson was really taken aback by Barry's interest in Labor when Barry was running his beloved fashion store at St Ives, Fashion Plate, where he insisted I attend to get my first suit when I came up to work for him as a staffer in the Hawke government. 


Many years later he turned the marginal Central Coast seat of Robertson into a bastion for Labor, holding it from 1969 to 1990. I notice there are probably many good members of the opposition who've held it since. Some of the people working for prime ministers and leaders of the opposition have no understanding of what it takes to be a marginal member and what a difference individuals can make. Woe betide them for their political faith and their lack of knowledge of that. 


Barry was the last opposition male to hold the position of spokesman on women's affairs, as in 1978 there were no women in the House of Reps. Barry was elected nine times between 1969 and 1990. Few will replicate that record. Phillip Ruddock, who is in the audience, is one who did. As Martin Luther King said, 'Longevity has its place.' Barry's passion for the arts, heritage and environment was fulfilled when he became minister in these portfolios. His passion for Kakadu, as I said yesterday, established it in the public imagination alongside Indigenous natural icons like Uluru and the Kimberley. 


He was absolutely a visionary with road safety. In his early years in parliament he demanded that vehicles have airbags, in the 1970s. Now it's par for the course, but it was absolutely visionary then. I was sitting in the Labor Party caucus today and Senator Gallacher came up to me and said, 'Even a few years ago Barry was driving us mad about road safety.' I think it's encapsulated in a quote from one of his articles:


When I became obsessed with the subject, I was treated as an eccentric. I don't regret a minute of it, and in my twilight years I'm determined to do what I can to revive the road safety campaign. I'd like to live long enough to see the headline: No one killed on the roads this year.


That was a conversation just today with Alex Gallacher, one of the senators who remembers his campaign on this.


Barry was environment minister when they forbade mineral sands mining on Fraser Island. He was one of the Hawke government's spearheads in preserving the natural wonders of the Franklin in Tasmania. I know that other people in other political parties claim credit for that, but Barry was absolutely crucial in that. When we wander around the Franklin these days, I think about him and his role in preserving it. He had a successful life in business and, as I said, a great career in politics. He was the author of nine books between 1987 and 2011 and an immense collection of newspaper and magazine columns, which I've been re-reading in the last two weeks. Some of his columns were excoriating about topics as varied as the wit and wisdom of the New South Wales right, the perils of nouvelle cuisine and the superannuation industry, where he argued that governments should 'save seniors from racetrack touts posing as fund managers'. I think we've all had experiences with constituents who feel that. In his immense newspaper output, Cohen made unpopular forays, arguing that ministerial travel should be judged on its outcome, not on its cost—I could tell some of the people at Fairfax and the ABC about that—and that the backbenchers should resume their independence and resume their rights in question time. We could tell some of the whips, prime ministers and leaders of the opposition about that.


He was a devoted ally and advocate of Senator John Faulkner and his plans to clean up Labor. Barry's whiplash pen critiqued people on his own side as well as on the conservative side of politics. They included Peter Garrett, Graham Richardson and, most memorably, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In the early 1980s, years before Rudd became a national figure, Cohen gave him a searing character evaluation. When you read it 20 years later, through all that happened with Rudd in opposition and Rudd as Prime Minister and Rudd as insurgent, it makes Barry Cohen sound like the oracle of Bungendore, 20 years before Rudd became a national character.


But big, brave Barry didn't simply snipe from the safety of newspaper columns. He was a fierce critic of the maladministration of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and when he attended his last gathering of that august organisation he was the subject of a two-hour harangue by Fidel Castro. With incredible courage, the next day he gave it back with both barrels to the Cuban dictator. I didn't include some of the things that he said in my memorial speech, but I'll just read a couple of them. Cohen said: 'President Castro’s harangue was one of the most nauseating, disgraceful exhibitions I have ever witnessed. What was so extraordinary was his complete omission of any of the crimes committed by his friends in the communist bloc, the Third World and the non-aligned countries. Where in his speech was there any mention of the Soviet Union's invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, of Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea, of Syria's slaughter of Palestinians and Lebanese, and the hundreds of thousands of political prisoners and denial of human rights in dozens of countries here today?' He did that in Cuba, while he was in their maw.


Barry's gentler side was shown in his passion for the Indigenous people of this country. This began with his extreme involvement, as a non-Indigenous assistant, in the Aboriginal campaign for the successful 1967 referendum. Years later, you could see that passion and involvement, with a tribute to his mentor and Indigenous friend, Faith Bandler, on her death. It is one of the most memorable columns I've ever read, and I urge people to go back and read it. It's in The Australian and it's called 'Thanks to Faith, change won out'.


He also said incredible and valuable things about housing affordability, which I won't go into. He and I didn't always agree on the issue of 18C. Barry was in favour of the legislation, but he said, 'I've come to the conclusion that you cannot change people's minds by legislation.' Arguing people around on these important issues was something he considered to be very important. If all of that wasn't enough, Barry Cohen was the deputy chairman of Old Parliament House from 1990 to 2001. In 1999 he made an ill-advised foray back into state politics at the request of the then Labor Premier. I must admit, I took 20 Mexicans north of the border to help him with how-to-vote cards.


Throughout his parliamentary and newspaper life, Cohen shared with me an immense pride in his Jewish origins and was a subtle, well-informed advocate of Israel. He was a very strong supporter of the two-state solution. The weight of the Nazi genocide of millions, including large segments of his family, weighed very heavily on the shoulders of his memory. He and his wife, Rae, did great justice to his murdered relatives, visiting Poland and writing a searing account of the fate of the Koziwodas, that branch of the family that was utterly wiped out, in an article which was published in the now defunct Bulletinand which you can get from my office.


Lastly, let me deal with the difficult topic of Barry's last years. His courage in dealing with his dementia publicly was matched only by the devotion of his son, Adam, and his wife, Rae, to his increasing physical fragility. He even turned his suffering into a good story. It would have been in one of his books if he had been writing books in the last years. This is from a newspaper:


… When word got out that I had joined the list of dementia sufferers one of the first calls I had was from an old ""friend"".


""A Mr Howard calling,"" was the message from the nurse. 'I don't know a Mr Howard, unless it's the former prime minister.'


""That's the one,"" said the nurse.


I'm very proud that a group of us—his Praetorian Guard and former ministerial staff, led by Dr Sergio Sergi, Peter Conway, his son Adam and I—travelled to Goulburn to farewell Barry at his nursing home. He was compos mentis. It was a tearful farewell. He recognised all of us. He cried. We all cried. It was a great thing to do, just a few months before he passed. Barry Cohen, a big character and a big Australian. His memory is a blessing.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (17:15):  I too rise to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my deepest condolences of behalf of my community at the passing of the Hon. Barry Cohen AM, aged 82. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending my thoughts to Barry Cohen's family and friends at this time, including many of those who travelled to Canberra this week for yesterday's state memorial service at Old Parliament House. I do wish to thank the member for Melbourne Ports for the incredible insight in the speech he just gave, which, I must say, filled out a whole life that perhaps I was not privy to. Barry Cohen was the member for Robertson when I first came to the Central Coast in 1984, aged 12. I suspect that, had I ever met him and known him, the old adage that I like to live by—that more things unite us than ever divide us in politics—would stand true for somebody who has been described as the member for Melbourne Ports so aptly and beautifully described him in his speech just now.


As the Prime Minister said yesterday in the House, Barry was a man known for his wit, his humour, his memorable anecdotes and his dapper dress sense. He was recognised with an Order of Australia in 2007 for service to the Australian parliament and to the community through a range of cultural and environmental roles, along with contributions to public discussion and debate through his work for The Australian, in books and in publications. Much can be spoken about Barry's legacy. I note how proudly, as a member of the Hawke government, he championed Indigenous issues, as has been raised before. One of the most enduring legacies was that the government handed back Uluru to its traditional owners, doubled the size of Kakadu National Park and extended the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. He was, indeed, a powerful advocate for the rights and the advancement of our First Australians. Mr Cohen would carve a strong parliamentary career as the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment and then as Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment.


But, as the serving member for Robertson in this place today, I wish to pay tribute to a man who served our community with incredible passion and distinction for more than 20 years. As the member for Robertson from 1969 to 1990, Mr Cohen was a fierce advocate for our community on the Central Coast. He was the member for Robertson when one of the greatest and most essential transport links in our region was built, the Mooney Mooney Bridge, which thousands of commuters travelling to Sydney and Newcastle now take for granted when we drive across it every single day, along the F3—or, of course, as it's now known, the M1. That was part of Barry's legacy to the Central Coast. Across the Central Coast, he will probably be best remembered in our community for his passion and commitment to the environment. The environment is something that I think people on the Central Coast have a great love for. They have an instinctive great love for and a deep regard for the environment and the protection and preservation of the environment, and that's something that, in his time as the minister, he certainly reflected well.


There were several lasting policy achievements during his time as the minister, but in Barry Cohen's life after politics he continued to serve and search for ways to care for people and our world around us. In 2001, he dedicated himself to protecting wildlife, building the beautiful Calga Springs Wildlife Sanctuary on the Central Coast. When he eventually sold the sanctuary four years later to Tassin and Gerald Barnard he had, in the words of Tassin, suddenly put Calga on the national map. As Tassin told the ABC Central Coast's Scott Levi just this week: 'Calga suddenly became more than an interchange.' This passion came from hearing about the impact of feral animals on the local wildlife. Along with his son Adam, Barry then began to build the sanctuary that could be enjoyed by visitors. Now known as the Australia Walkabout Wildlife Park, it is a fantastic tourist attraction for our region.


Even when, later in life, Barry began his battle with Alzheimer's, he continued to be a tireless campaigner for the issues that mattered to him. Alzheimer's is an issue that transcends politics and that affects families on both sides of this place, and I think we can all admire the way that Barry Cohen fought for better awareness and support for Australians suffering with this insidious disease. Although a cure has not been found in his lifetime as he hoped, I know that his efforts will continue to inspire those who have followed him on both sides of politics, and I note the member for Dobell and her tireless advocacy in this particular area of dementia. As we heard in the tributes in the House yesterday, Barry Cohen's writings opened the door to what had previously been the very private pain of those who lived with Alzheimer's and dementia, and, as the current member for Robertson, I want to put on record my thanks for Barry Cohen's service to the Central Coast and to our nation and also for his incredible advocacy during that time.


May I end with a reflection from Barry's son Stuart. He described his father as a fiercely passionate individual who did nothing by half measure: 'Nothing left undone. He never took a step back.' It's a beautiful tribute to a man who cared so much and gave so much. To his wife, Rae, and to his sons, I extend my deepest sympathy and thank him for his service to our community and our nation.

Now, as the federal member for Dobell, my electorate neighbours the electorate of Robertson, which was represented solidly by Barry Cohen in the House of Representatives from 1969 to 1990. For 21 years, Mr Cohen represented the people of our community, the Central Coast, with passion, dedication, good humour and great success.


Yesterday, I was reminiscing with a former Labor member for Dobell, Michael Lee, who attended the memorial service, and he wanted me to share some of his recollections of his time working with Barry. He said to me that he remembers Barry as a strong advocate for his electorate, which originally stretched from Asquith to Swansea. He said that, in the Whitlam years, the Regional Employment Development Scheme, known as the RED Scheme, was a jobs creation program, and that Barry was famous for getting so many local projects approved. Surf clubs, senior citizens' centres, scout halls—there were many local projects that benefited from his dedicated lobbying. Another win for the Central Coast, Michael said to me, was when, in 1975, Barry organised the ALP national conference to be held at the Hotel Florida in Terrigal. The member for Melbourne Ports may have some good memories of that conference! I'm told every hotel and motel across the coast was booked out for the conference. Michael also said that, as has been mentioned by the member for Melbourne Ports, Barry was a strong advocate for road and car safety, and he invited the American political activist and author Ralph Nader, who had just written Unsafe at Any Speed, to visit Australia to pressure car companies into improving car safety.


As has been mentioned, Barry held three ministerial posts in the Hawke government between 1984 and 1987. For these three years he was the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentennial—such a momentous occasion in our nation's history—and Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment. In 1983 and '84, he was also the Minister for Home Affairs.


As the member for Robertson has noted, his greatest legacy must surely be that he safeguarded some of our most precious natural treasures for our future generations, from Uluru to Kakadu to the Great Barrier Reef, and more locally in our community on the Central Coast. For this work we will remain in his debt.


Barry was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2007 for his service to the Australian parliament and to the community through a range of cultural and environmental roles and contributions to public discussion and debate.


After leaving the federal realm, as the member for Melbourne Ports said, Barry had a tilt at the New South Wales state election in 1999. I fact-checked this with Michael Lee yesterday, and apparently my own dad was the one who talked him into running for the seat of Gosford against the incumbent, Chris Hartcher. Unfortunately, Barry didn't win the seat, but Bob Carr did win a second term. 


Even after his time in public life had ended, Barry Cohen continued to make a contribution. When he became one of the 400,000 Australians living with dementia, he became a champion for a better deal for older Australians. Just as his written works resonated with me as a younger woman, that passionate advocacy for people living with dementia resonates with me now as I share caring duties for my own father, who lives with dementia. As the member for Robertson and the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, have said, we do not yet have a cure for dementia. As a daughter, a mental health worker and a local MP, I am doing all I can to continue Barry's work towards a cure and to improve the lives of people living with dementia and those who care for them.


When we do find this cure, and we will, some small measure of credit must go to the late Barry Cohen for speaking out about the way it affected him and the way it affects so many others living with this condition. I extend my condolences and those of my family, particularly my mum, Barbara, and my father, Grant, to Barry's wife, Ray, and to his family and honour his contribution to the Australian parliament, the Australian people and the people of the Central Coast. May he rest in peace.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (17:26):  It's an honour to follow my colleagues, the members for Dobell, Robertson and Melbourne Ports, in paying tribute to Barry Cohen. Unfortunately, other commitments prevented me from attending the memorial service that was presided over by Rabbi Feldman on Monday, but I want to take the opportunity in this debate to make some reflections on the life of the Hon. Barry Cohen AM. I had the privilege of meeting Barry on only one occasion, and therefore I didn't know him as well as did my friend the member for Melbourne Ports, who worked for him in 1983 and 1984 and became a lifelong friend. But I have got to know Barry's son Adam, who's here in the chamber, a little over my time in the parliament, as we've worked together on issues of mutual interest for the Jewish community.


Barry Cohen came to this parliament as the member for Robertson in the 1969 election. A redistribution took place in 1968 that took 14,000 electors from the electorate of Robertson, comprising electors from suburbs around Hornsby, and put them in a new electorate called Berowra. The sitting member for Robertson, Bill Bridges-Maxwell, a vet, was not very happy with this—he was the Liberal member—and sought to stand for the newly created seat. Bridges-Maxwell, like my illustrious predecessor Tom Hughes QC, was a member of a group called the Mushroom Club that centred themselves around John Gorton. They were great Gorton supporters. Gorton wanted Hughes to move to Berowra, as his own seat of Parkes had been abolished, while he thought Bridges-Maxwell had the best chance of retaining Robertson, but it wasn't to be. At the Don's Party election in 1969, when there was a swing of 7.1 per cent against the Gorton government, Barry achieved a bigger swing against the Liberal Party, of 9.7 per cent, winning the seat on first preferences. He went on to hold the seat and improve his margin until retirement at the 1990 election with, as I saw, his best results in the years when the member for Melbourne Ports worked for him. 


Relatives who knew I was interested in politics would invariably buy me Barry Cohen's books for birthday presents. My shelves contained books like From Whitlam to Winston, Life with Gough and Bringing the House Down. Barry had his own anecdotes, and one of the best of those was told by the Prime Minister in the House yesterday, but he was a great chronicler of Gough. One of my favourite stories of Barry's appears in Bringing Down the House. With the indulgence of the chamber, I might read it to you now:


The late Senator Ron McAuliffe, a lovable Runyonesque character, represented Labor in the Senate from 1971 to 1981 but he was better known as President of the Queensland Rugby League. He was often referred to as the 'Senator for Rugby League.' 


In September 1974, at the peak of Labor's popularity—


and I think Barry probably used the word 'peak' ironically there—


he invited the Prime Minister to 'kick off' the Grand Final of the Brisbane Rugby League competition. Although not an ardent sports enthusiast he accepted.


Gough arrived at Lang Park, where a crowd of 23,000 less-than-enthusiastic football fans greeted him with boos, jeers, beer cans, meat pies and anything they could lay their hands on. It took nearly ten minutes for them to exhaust their viciousness and spleen. Finally they quietened down to the point where Gough could launch the 1974 Rugby League Grand Final. The mission accomplished, Gough walked off the ground with his senatorial host. 'McAuliffe,' Gough sniffed, 'Don't you ever invite me to a place where you are so unpopular.'


Like me, Barry Cohen was Jewish. Over the summer I read Simon Schama's second volume of The Story of the Jews 1492 to 1900. While there are moments of sunlight, in the main it doesn't tell a happy story of long-term acceptance and welcoming of the Jewish people into full citizenship. Schama, in that book, doesn't deal with Australia, but had he done so he would have observed that Australia has been one of the great exceptions to that story, even in the 19th century. From the earliest days of colonial administration, Jews have been fully accepted and taken their place in leadership positions in the nation. Behind me is the portrait of Sir Isaac Isaacs, who was one of three Jewish MPs to serve in the first Commonwealth parliament. And in this parliament there are a record six members of the House and Senate who are Jewish.


Barry Cohen was one of a significant number of Jewish MPs who've served here since Federation. As he wrote, he never suffered any anti-Semitism in politics and his religion was never an issue during his service in this place. But, as it has on all of us, the experience of being Jewish had a profound effect on him. Although some of his family had been here since the 1890s, he also had family who perished in the Holocaust. He wrote:


Australia is probably the least anti-Semitic country in the world, but what happened to my family made a deep impression on me. I became obsessive about discrimination; be it fighting for civil rights in the US, or against apartheid or the appalling treatment of our indigenous people.


Having experienced no racism growing up in Griffith until he had his bar mitzvah, when he was suddenly regarded as different, and having experienced further anti-Semitic attacks as a schoolboy and as a golfer, Cohen was determined to fight against racism and to improve the conditions of Indigenous people when he came here. Like other Jewish MPs, he had a deep and abiding interest in Aboriginal affairs. Like Jews, Aborigines have a culture which is hundreds of thousands of years old, handed down from generation to generation, with a deep and abiding sense of connection to traditional lands. The crowning glory of Barry's involvement in this particular space was handing back Uluru to its traditional owners when he was Minister for the Environment.


In his retirement, the culture of his party had shifted left and Barry Cohen found himself sometimes at odds with his own people. Barry became concerned about the direction that the Labor Party had taken on anti-Semitism in Israel, and in the wake of the 2004 election he courageously went to print to criticise what he saw as anti-Semitism creeping into his party. He wrote:


I'm sick of the calumny heaped on Israel - most of which is a pack of lies. I'm sick of Labor leaders making all the right noises to Jewish audiences while an increasing number of backbenchers launch diatribes at Israel.


How long is it since any Labor leader gave the sort of passionate and accurate defence of Israel we used to hear from Hawke or Kim Beazley?


I don't want even-handedness when it ought to be obvious to all but the blind that there is no moral equivalence between a country that seeks to defend its citizens from thousands of terrorist attacks, and the terrorists themselves. I want to hear Labor MPs stand up and be counted. I want to see an end to well-known Labor identities marching behind banners equating Israel with Nazism.


Before the Iraq war one of the most senior NSW right-wing MPs told me: ""I understand and support Israel's position, but in my group, I'm the only one.""


Soon after I told a Labor legend: ""Anti-Semitism is now rampant in the Labor Party."" I expected a vigorous denial. His response confirmed my worst fear: ""I know,"" he said.


This was a courageous thing for Barry to have pointed out in relation to the Labor Party at the time and it became an abiding issue for him, as it was in his time in this place the defence of the state of Israel.


The second example concerns the one occasion I had the privilege of meeting Barry, which was when he launched perhaps an unlikely collection of essays, edited by two figures of the right, Gregory Melleuish and Imre Salusinszky, called Blaming Ourselves: September 11 and the Agony of the Left. The launch took place in the now defunct American Club and was followed by a good dinner and plenty of Cohen anecdotes. Some extracts from the foreword bear repeating. Barry wrote:


I imagine my emotions were no different to most people's. Disbelief preceded shock before seething rage. The nausea commenced when I started reading the anti-American diatribe in the columns and letters to the editor section of the Sydney Morning Herald. How much the world changed on 11 September is yet to be determined but for me it ended some friendships. There are many quoted in this book whom I have no wish to speak to again.


Have only one problem with this book and that is in the title, Blaming Ourselves: September 11 and the Agony of the Left. Having always regarded myself as being 'of the Left', I resent being lumped in with those who write such vile rubbish.


As he concludes:


It was long overdue for conservatives and genuine liberals to take on the intellectual thugs of the 'progressive' Left and to stop feeling guilty about supporting the United States. Never has the line between good and evil been so clearly drawn. 


For too long the Left have been able to enjoy the affluence created by American capitalism and take shelter behind the American defense umbrella while at the same time reserving the right to pour out their hatred of all things American. They take the best the Americans have to offer and spit in their face. 


Unlike Australians, Americans aren't perfect. They've made mistakes, but they are a decent people who believe passionately in the things the majority of Australians hold dear—freedom and democracy. Thank God that when the Cold War ended it was America who was left standing. Imagine for one minute the awful alternative.


In those extracts you get a sense of Barry's passion and his enormous gift with words and language. 


Barry Cohen made an enormous contribution to his party, his community and his country, as a parliamentarian, a writer and an activist. We 're all poorer for his loss. I wish long life to his wife, Rae, and his sons, Stuart, Adam and Martin, and his broader family and to the member for Melbourne Ports, who is practically mishpocha. May his memory be a blessing.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:36):  It is with a great sense of pride and honour that I rise to honour Barry Cohen AM. Having attended his memorial service yesterday, which was also a great honour, I came away from that event wishing I had actually met him. He seemed like an extraordinary individual. Adam and your brothers and your beloved mum are so lucky to have had him in your life. He was a larger-than-life character. The tributes were flowing from former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and also the Leader of the Opposition, who all had the most extraordinary anecdotes about a man with passion, with commitment, with a true sense of altruism, with a great love of Australia and a great commitment to advancing Australia for all Australians—not just a handful of the lucky few, but all Australians. He had a huge commitment to advancing our nation, and he did so with such bonhomie and such humour. 


He was a larger-than-life character. I really wish I had met him after hearing all those fabulous stories yesterday, not just the tributes, but also the eulogy, Adam, from your brother—a beautiful eulogy—and also from David. That eulogy was very powerful; and also the acknowledgement to country from Aunty Jannette. I've seen Aunty Jannette acknowledge country and welcome to country at many events across Canberra, but the beauty about yesterday's welcome to country and acknowledgement of country was the fact that Aunty Jannette was great mates with Barry. So in the welcome to country she gave an extraordinarily unique perspective on their relationship and the work he did in advancing the Indigenous cause from when Stuart, Adam and Martin were just small children. The fact that Barry Cohen was deeply committed to ensuring the betterment of Indigenous Australians, not just in his part of the world but right throughout Australia, and the connection he had with Aunty Jannette and others from the Indigenous community was palpable. You could sense that the relationship was deep and mutually respectful, and Aunty Jannette's and also David's comments on the relationship with Barry reflected that. 


Barry had a great sense of humour, a great sense of honesty, a great sense of candour, a great sense of banter but, ultimately, a great sense of love—not just in terms of commitment to better public policy, but mostly a real, genuine, deep, abiding love for the Indigenous community and a really deep commitment to advancing their lot in Australia, particularly in the 1967 referendum. He was very actively involved in that. I think that's where Aunty Jannette first had the connection with him, going right back to 1967. He was an extraordinary man. After going to the memorial service yesterday, I know I would love to have met him. I feel far lesser as a result of not meeting him.


It's lovely that Adam's here today, to hear these speeches that honour his father, and Rabbi Feldman who beautifully presided over yesterday's service. We had these beautiful tributes and eulogies, and this beautiful acknowledgement and welcome to country by Aunty Jannette. It was punctuated by a drinking song—a joyous drinking song, was it not, Rabbi Feldman? It is not in keeping with the usually sombre nature of memorial services but we were all up singing that song. Everyone knows the tune, not necessarily the words, and we were singing and clapping away at the memorial service. This highlighted the nature of Barry Cohen and his joie de vivre, his passion for life, his wanting to suck the pips out of life. Every day, every hour you're living, you're working towards improving the lives of Australians, of making a difference. That was the very strong message I got from yesterday. You and your mum and brothers are so lucky to have had him in your lives, Adam. 


I was keen not just to talk about that extraordinary memorial service yesterday but also to acknowledge as the member for Canberra the contribution Barry Cohen made to Canberra, our nation's capital, and its national institutions. His legacy is quite extraordinary—and it was made in an environment that often wasn't in keeping with Barry's views on particular issues. That's particularly the case with the National Museum. There's always been a bit of ambivalence about the National Museum—whether we need it, what it should house and where it should be located. It's not just a Canberra pastime or Saturday night dinner conversation about a national museum; it's a national conversation about the fact that there has been this ambivalence and that he took the first steps towards making the museum happen. It underscores his commitment. He confronted and overcame adversity. If he believed in something, from what I can gather, he just pursued it, knowing he was on the force of right. He was fighting the good fight. He was the former minister for home affairs, the arts and the environment. His legacy here in our nation's capital, in terms of national institutions, is significant. I thank him for that. 


In April 1984 Barry announced the establishment of the National Film and Sound Archive. It's back in the news, that fabulous old deco building, at the anatomy building, at the ANU. Unfortunately, the new CEO is looking for alternative digs. It's been controversial since it went to that building and it's been controversial in that there's been talk of moving it out of Canberra. Canberrans have fought back to keep that fabulous national institution here, and it all began with Barry Cohen. 


The archive took over the former anatomy building and was built in the deco period of the 1930s. It was opened in 1984 and is now heritage listed. It began with 20 freshly minted staff led by Ray Edmondson, who Barry described as the persistent force behind the archive. Barry's belief in the work of the archive and Ray Edmondson was apparent as the archive built up its identity and there was a broader understanding of its role, within the national-collections institutions area, over the next 10 or 15 years. It was an extraordinary vision. Thanks to Barry's vision, the national archive was realised. It is Australia's living archive and already has more than 2.8 million items being preserved for future generations, and the collections continue to grow. 


I also want to thank Barry for the legacy he left with the National Museum. As I said, it was highly controversial, over many years. There's been a lot of debate about its purpose and location. 


The history of the original concept of having a National Museum of Australia is that it was first raised in the seventies, but it was Barry who initially picked it up. He kicked the tyres and got the museum moving from concept to reality in the 1980s. It took successive governments another 20 years to consult and design the museum that we're familiar with today, down on the point on Lake Burley Griffin. It was Barry who oversaw the building of the temporary visitors centre and the headquarters at Yarramundi Reach, which were the first steps towards making the National Museum of Australia a reality.


In closing, I just want to offer my condolences and the condolences of all Canberrans to Rae, Stuart, Adam, Martin and Barry's many, many friends right across Australia and throughout the world. As was said yesterday, he was a big character. He was a big presence. He created big memories. He had a big life. He was an extraordinary individual who I would have loved to have met. I look forward now to going over his writings and reading them, particularly his comments on the New South Wales Right—which I will very much look forward to—as a member of that esteemed establishment. We honour and thank Barry Cohen AM for his contribution to our nation, to our national capital and to our national institutions. Vale.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2018-02-06,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (17:46):  I first associate myself with the outstanding speeches by my parliamentary colleagues. We just heard from the member for Canberra and, before her, the member for Berowra, the member for Dobell, the member for Robertson and the member for Melbourne Ports. In anticipation, we will hear from the member for Fenner.


Yesterday's memorial service at Old Parliament House, which I had the privilege to attend, was a celebration of Barry Cohen's big life—his good life. We heard speeches from former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Melbourne Ports, his son Stuart and others. What came through these speeches was a picture of a man, whom I was fortunate to have met, who was first and foremost a proud Australian. He was a proud Jew and he was a proud Labor man. In his many achievements in public life—21 years in the parliament—he was responsible for a number of significant achievements which leave a lasting legacy. As the environment minister, I can only look back in awe at what he achieved with regard to Uluru, Kakadu, the Barrier Reef and the Tasmanian wilderness. As the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, we have heard about his significant contributions. Indeed, our presence in Old Parliament House in some way could be traced to his commitment to restoring that building and ensuring that it stayed for future generations.


As the member for Robertson, he turned a marginal seat—in fact, a Liberal seat, as we heard yesterday—into a safe Labor seat by door-knocking thousands of homes with his wife, Rae, and a band of loyal supporters and winning respect for his passionate defence of local interests and the local community. He also was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentennial.


Barry Cohen came to the parliament in a non-traditional way in the sense that he had been a postman and a clerk and had broader business experience. When he came to the parliament, as was said yesterday, he was not a union rep or a party hack. He was somebody who came with a determination to make a difference. In reading his maiden speech to the parliament on 5 March 1970, he talked about how the motivating factor in deciding to become a political activist was: 'I have always been concerned with the question of prejudice, whether that prejudice be based on class, religion or race.' In his maiden speech, he spent the vast majority of the time talking about Aboriginal disadvantage, health, particularly infant mortality, and housing and the need to do better on behalf of our First Australians. We heard yesterday how genuine and long-lasting his commitment was.


My colleagues the member for Berowra and the member for Melbourne Ports have referred to the fact that he cared deeply about his Jewishness. He was always prepared to wear that on his sleeve and he would speak openly about anti-Semitism where he encountered it as well as issues involving Israel. He was born and raised in Griffith, New South Wales, and he wrote about his local school that, 'There were seven Jewish children in a school of nearly a thousand, and that made us a bit of a curiosity.' He did say that he got his first taste of anti-Semitism when he was at Sydney Grammar School and that 'shocked, hurt and bewildered him'.


In the parliament, he had a fellow traveller in his support for Israel in Bob Hawke. But it is apt and timely in the presence of our fellow members of the Labor Party to remind them of what he, Barry Cohen, said about the concerns he saw with a lurch to the Left and a growing antagonism towards Israel. He said, 'I'm sick of Labor leaders and foreign affairs spokesmen making all the right noises to Jewish audiences while an increasing number of Labor backbenchers launch diatribes at Israel.' That is a very powerful statement. I only mention it because I know that my fellow Labor members in the chamber care as deeply about Israel and anti-Semitism as I do and as the member for Berowra does. I know, in the Leader of the Opposition, Israel has a staunch and loyal friend. Bob Hawke, who fought for the refuseniks in the Soviet Union, has a very proud record on that. In fact, 'Doc' Evatt, again from the Labor Party, has a very, very proud record on that. We always need to stand firm on these issues. When we stand on the shoulders of giants like Barry Cohen in this place, it pays to listen to a warning such as that. If we, in this place, can take that warning and act upon it, I will feel better for not just the Jewish community of today but the Jewish community of tomorrow.


Barry Cohen was an outstanding individual. He was decent. He was brave. He was humble. He was passionate. His causes stretched from Indigenous affairs to the environment, from the arts and culture to acting on behalf of our senior Australians and his own battle with Alzheimer's.


He is somebody who shared his views through his columns and his eight books and who has provided wisdom and insight for us here today. To his son Adam, in the chamber; to his mother, Rae; to Stuart; to Martin; to the extended family: you have so much to be proud of in Barry Cohen. I have so much to be proud of as a Jewish member of this parliament. Because we follow in his footsteps, we can learn from his example. And if we do him justice in this place, Australia will be the better for it.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:55):  Armando Iannucci, creator of The Thick of It and Veep, gave an interview recently where he said, 'Humourless politicians are the most dangerous ones, I think.' He was referring to oppressive regimes, but I think it applies to this place, too. In the tradition of Fred Daly and Jim Killen, Barry Cohen was a fabulous raconteur. I first knew him through his books; I grabbed three from the shelf on the way here—After the Party, The Life of the Party and From Whitlam to Winston—but, of course, that 's merely a small component of the Cohen oeuvre. In meeting him and chatting with him, one got the sense of a man who lived a full life. 


In his eulogy yesterday, the member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that Barry Cohen had a range of records—the first sports commentator for Sydney's TCN 9, the first boss to join a union in the SDA and the last opposition male to hold the position of spokesperson for women's affairs, given there were no women in the House of Reps in 1978. His achievements as environment minister were legendary: forbidding the mining of sands on Fraser Island, protecting the Franklin, and helping to safeguard Uluru, Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. It's a legacy which will outlive us all. His interest in the environment continued post politics, and I remember terrifically enjoyable conversations with him as he sought to persuade me to get up the great garden festival. Barry, I am sorry, we have so far failed you, but the international garden festival may yet become a reality. 


There are so many fabulous stories, but, with Adam with us, I'm minded to turn to one known as 'Generation Gap', in which Barry relates the moment he heard Adam answering the phone, 'Oh, Jesus, mate, I'm sorry, I didn't realise it was you' and then saying to Barry, 'It's Gough.' Barry said he was staggered: 'You called our glorious leader ""mate"".' He apologises to Gough Whitlam and gets the response: 'What are you running there, a sheltered workshop? I don't mind him calling me ""mate"" but he doesn't even recognise the voice.'


He went on to recount his early experiences in the Labor Party, which many of us will have shared. He walked into the room, 'knowing' who the enemy were—the dreaded Liberals headed by Sir Robert Menzies—and:


I was soon disabused of that idea. The enemy were either the groupers or the coms and they were in the same room as I was, the Asquith Progress Association Hall. I found the screaming and shouting strangely at odds with the party's moto, 'Unity of Labor is the hope of the world'. 


He also related a tale of a day of campaigning with Chris Hurford and Eric Fitzgibbon, the father of Joel Fitzgibbon. They spent a day visiting kindergartens and early childhood centres in the morning and an aged-care centre in the afternoon. At the event at the aged-care centre, Eric Fitzgibbon gave a speech in which he said: 'It has been a journey from the cradle to the grave.' Barry does not record whether the members of the aged-care home appreciated this description.


Then, finally, there was a wonderful anecdote, in which he related his early experiences in Mann Street, Gosford, when a constituent came in and said to Barry, 'I've got a pain here in my shoulder. I've had it for some months. I can't get to sleep at night,' and the constituent got increasingly perturbed when Barry Cohen failed to respond and then began to take his shirt off: 'My embarrassment started to turn to panic. I stood up to stop him before he was naked. ""Look, I understand you've got a bad back, but what the hell do you expect me to do about it?"" ""What do you mean, what the hell do I expect you to do about it! You're the bloody chiropractor, aren't you?"" He went out to his secretary and said, ""I think this gentleman has the wrong Cohen. He may want to see John Cohen, the chiropractor, just down the hall.""'


I want to close with an observation about an incident in 2011. As somebody who was a long-time fan of Barry's, my office was helping Deb O'Neill, then the member for Robertson, organise a fundraiser in which Barry would tell tales to the Labor faithful from the ACT Labor Party, and, just prior to the event, Barry Cohen wrote a piece in The Australian in which he said same-sex marriage was 'absurd'.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
18:01 
to 
18:19





Dr LEIGH:
  So we were organising a fundraiser to raise money for Deb O'Neill in the Labor caucus room as the candidate for Robertson, and the star of the show was to be the former member for Robertson, Barry Cohen. But, as we prepared the event and set about publicising it among ACT Labor Party members, Barry Cohen wrote an article in The Australian in which he said that same-sex marriage was 'absurd' and compared it to his right to marry his dog. This caused some outrage among some of the activists within the party who urged me to cancel the event with Barry Cohen. I had to say to them, yes, he's wrong on marriage equality—at least in my view and theirs—but this was a man so profoundly right on so many of the social justice questions of our age. His opposition to apartheid came decades earlier than mainstream Australian opinion. His attitude to Indigenous Australians on the environment came earlier. I thought of that great John Donne line, 'Thine age asks ease' and the importance, at the end of a great life, of allowing a little sensitivity, a little forgiveness and a little understanding, and encompassing the mark of an entire career.


Barry Cohen's career was an extraordinary one. He brought wit, humour and happiness to the parliament, a cleaner environment to the nation and a sense of commitment to public life that we honour today as we honoured it yesterday at that most moving funeral service at Old Parliament House. May he rest in peace.

 (Macquarie) (18:29):  Deputy Speaker Goodenough, I'm going to pose a question: within what time frame should you expect a response from someone after sending them a letter? How long is too long: 24 hours? A week? A month? Four months? Hypothetically speaking, what do we think is a reasonable time, and what would you do if you weren't getting a response? Would you write again and again and again? Well, it turns out that that doesn't work.


I have unashamedly not been playing it cool, so to speak, when it comes to the issue of Thompson Square in Windsor, in my electorate of Macquarie. You see, I've written to the Minister for the Environment and Energy a few times over the last four months asking him to consider the application for emergency heritage listing for Thompson Square. I'm yet to receive any response. I get the feeling he hasn't read my letters, so I thought I'd take the opportunity today to run through them quickly—to summarise them a bit and save him some time. Just to clarify: I didn't send the minister the same information each time; each letter was an update on the colonial and Indigenous artefacts that have been uncovered and are still being uncovered during the archaeological dig that's being carried out in Thompson Square.


I'm going to go through the most recent letters. On 29 September last year I wrote to the minister regarding the tender documents that were released for the Windsor Bridge replacement project, because they said, 'Construction will result in a number of adverse impacts, particularly on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal heritage.' The documents went even further, detailing that there are substantial Aboriginal archaeological deposits, including evidence of Aboriginal occupation and use of the area dating back to between 17,000 and 27,000 years ago. I also mentioned the fact that the minister did manage to grant an emergency heritage listing for St Kilda road, which, according to the minister's own media release, he took the time to write to the Premier of Victoria about to ask whether he would reconsider the project design to lessen its impact upon the surrounding landscape, including the trees that give important character to the precinct.


What happens in Melbourne, it seems, matters more to him than what happens in the outer suburbs of Sydney. Never mind that machinery is hacking into rare Aboriginal relics and the first pieces of government infrastructure in this country; St Kilda Road apparently has untouchable trees that, thanks to the minister, will continue to give important character to that precinct. Perhaps I should ask which form of communication was used to bring St Kilda Road to the attention of the minister. It is safe to assume that it wasn't the written word—or do I just need to mention that Thompson Square also has trees? Thompson Square does have trees, although it already has fewer than it did a few months ago.


On 24 October 2017 I wrote to the minister to urgently bring his attention to the discovery of handmade and hand-laid Telford blocks near Thompson Square. Telford paving is a type of early 19th century road construction that was a leap forward in road building not only in Australia but also around the world. The only other known example of Telford paving in Australia is located in Willoughby, where the road is considered so significant that it's registered with the National Trust of Australia. Unfortunately, I had no response from the minister.


On 7 December last year I wrote to the minister because many constituents came to me concerned about the level of destruction that was occurring during the archaeological dig in Thompson Square. You would think that, given the amazing Indigenous and colonial relics, archaeologists would be on their hands and knees chipping and dusting the ground to be sure not to damage anything of significance. Unfortunately, that's not what's happening. What's happening on the ground is that the caterpillar treads of a giant mechanical excavator are crushing the remains of goodness knows what artefacts. I got no response from the minister.


On 14 December I called for backup, thinking that maybe the minister would acknowledge a letter from me if I wrote a joint one with the member for Watson, the shadow minister for the environment and heritage. We spoke about the recent discovery of two sections of brick barrel drain dating back to as early as 1814, asking him to intervene in the New South Wales government's plan to destroy the heart of Windsor, its heritage and its Indigenous response. Still no response.


On 30 January this year I wrote again to the minister with the news that more of the brick barrel drain had been uncovered and was possibly the earliest piece of government infrastructure built in this country and that it paints a picture of what Governor Lachlan Macquarie had envisioned, not just for the Hawkesbury region but for this entire nation. I also spoke of the local history that says these tunnels played a role in illicit rum-running, which was rampant along the Hawkesbury in our early days. According to the community group CAWB, older residents of the area can recount that kegs of spirits were brought up from the riverbank through a tunnel in Thompson Square in more recent times. Access to these tunnels is thought to be in the basements of the pizza parlour and the Macquarie Arms Hotel, which of course happens to be the oldest pub in Australia. This is what locals are referring to when they talk about the legendary 'smugglers' tunnels'. I told the minister this and—you guessed it—still no response.


That letter also detailed my fear that these discoveries were just the tip of the iceberg—items being discovered only during this archaeological salvage. They are salvaging these items, removing them from the site, putting them on trucks and storing them somewhere. The construction of the bridge hasn't even started, and this is what we're finding.


Just last week, after I had sent my most recent letter to the minister, a sandstone pillar was ripped from the ground by a mechanical excavator. There was damage to the pillar on the way out. Photos taken of the stone by the people who are monitoring the square from as close as they can get to it show that it looks similar to a marker post that archaeologist Edward Higginbotham identified in his historical and archaeological investigation of Thompson Square in 1986, in the lead-up to the bicentenary celebrations that the Howard government auspiced. He noted that it was a rare survival.


Local activist group Heritage Act summed up perfectly on their Facebook page why we should care about this block of sandstone, and they said: 'This sandstone block would have had a purpose in the square and would have contributed to the functioning of the civic space. In turn, the square played a vital role in feeding and saving a starving nation. It's not just one stone post or one drain or one building that is significant; it's each of these puzzle pieces that, when joined together, build the picture of an important place in the European history of this nation.'


I would say to the minister: Thompson Square, much like St Kilda Road, has trees, but where they differ is that St Kilda Road has heritage listing based on its 19th century boulevard, and Thompson Square is being demolished—despite being the sole surviving foundation site for the late 18th and early 19th century settlement on the entire continent that still retains its original form and its sightlines from the top of the square to the Hawkesbury River and beyond to the farming grants across the river. In other words, it is the only surviving Georgian public square in this country.


I would say to the minister: you have the power to immediately grant emergency heritage listing so that a full investigation into the many reasons Thompson Square deserves to be given national heritage listing can take place. I invite him to visit the area, to speak to the people who've been occupying this square for 4½ years, 24 hours a day, on shifts, to guard as best they can against the destruction that is taking place. I urge him to visit the area before making a decision so he can see for himself why it is worthy of listing alongside Port Arthur, Fremantle Prison, the Glenrowan Heritage Precinct, and, yes, St Kilda Road. I ask the minister that he no longer ignore the destruction that happens day in, day out at Thompson Square but puts politics aside and saves this piece of history.


Let's be clear: the Hawkesbury was crying out for a new bridge. That's the reason this destruction is taking place. The Hawkesbury needs a new bridge, but it needs a bridge to bypass this Georgian gem and provide two things: a genuine traffic solution and the opportunity to revive and rejuvenate the unique history of Australia's colonial past.
