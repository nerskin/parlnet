Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:32):  I rise to comment briefly on the government amendment relating to quarterly payments. This came up in the roundtable and the Greens were able to negotiate with the government on finding a way to overcome a lot of the difficulties with this legislation. As I indicated in my speech on the second reading, I think the roundtable was extremely effective and successful because it enabled a number of stakeholders who had been arguing over this for many years to come together around the table with represen­tatives from the minister's office and repre­sen­­tatives from a number of different gov­ernment departments. They could sit down and try and work through the outstanding issues and how we could move them forward.


In the course of that, one of the representatives at the roundtable, Anna Lavelle from AusBiotech, mentioned that the main impediment or difficulty for small business and one thing which they would really appreciate being addressed is cash flow. If they could get quarterly payments, that would make an enormous difference to the operation of those particular companies. Of course, AusBiotech has something like 3,000 small- to medium-sized enterprises as members. After many follow-on discussions with the government we were able to reach a point where this could be implemented. I am very pleased to see this government amendment, which we are supporting. I am sure it will be extremely welcome to small businesses throughout the country. As I have indicated in this debate, if we are to be a country in which imagination is the resource of the century—where productivity and innovation drive the productivity gains we must have—it is going to be the result of some of those incredibly innovative small businesses that at this point are quite strapped for cash. In a lot of cases they just manage to get by. We need those enterprises to be able to access R&D funding.


So I thank the government for the cooperation it has shown in working through this particular measure. I am sure it is going to be a critical component of the legislation for small business. I look forward to the review in a couple of years time to see whether it has delivered in the way we hope it will over that time frame. Again, I think this amendment will be critical to the success of the bill in making sure we get the R&D funding going where it is needed—to those small enterprises—in a way that assists them in doing business. I think they will really welcome the quarterly cash payments.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (12:36):  It is interesting to hear Senator Milne talking about how cash strapped some of these small enterprises might be and how important this amendment is, but it is also interesting to note that the amendment does not take effect until 2014. If these small enterprises are so cash strapped and if it is so important to make funding available to them, why is this measure not taking effect until after the next election?


The opposition is quite sceptical about how this will work in practice. In particular, given the complexity of tax law, it is probably more likely to increase the adminis­trative burden and the administrative risks and problems for small business and will more than likely increase compliance costs. So while Senator Milne extols the virtue of this measure, I think there are some traps on the other side. The fact that it does not come into effect until 2014 is quite pertinent. If these businesses are so cash strapped then this measure should be introduced immediately rather than in 2014, after the next election. Effectively, this is a process of the Greens and the government trying to make themselves look good, particularly to certain sectors of industry. The reality is that there is nothing immediate about this. It does not happen straightaway; it does not happen until after the next election.


Senator Milne talks about these small enterprises and the importance of their innovation. During the winter break she made a comment that 100 of the largest companies take 60 per cent of the total funding of the current R&D tax concession scheme. This portrays a complete lack of understanding. I made the comment during the second reading debate that this is not about a capped fund or a capped scheme that people can or cannot access. This is a tax rebate scheme, so it is uncapped. If people qualify, they qualify; if they don't, they don't. Making assertions around who gets what and why just shows a complete lack of under­standing of the mechanisms at play here and portrays in the public arena a perspective that does not actually exist.


We have seen a lot of discussion in the R&D community about this, particularly in the manufacturing sector in relation to what the impact might be for manufacturing. Deloitte said, on 1 February last year, that average claims would fall by between 50 and 80 per cent. As we have maintained all along, this is about constraining access to this R&D tax process with the introduction of the new definitions and the purpose test. So we continue to have concerns about the way that this mechanism has been designed, the way that the government has gone about this process and, as I said at the outset, the completely disjointed way that the government has managed this piece of legislation right from the day that it delivered its first and second exposure drafts. Nixon Apple from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, a long-time trade unionist, said back in February 2010 when this process was partway through that, 'These laws will decimate support for R&D in manufacturing.'


When we are in circumstances such as these, where we have seen the devastating announcements over the last week from the manufacturing sector and concerns about what might be happening, and the govern­ment is going through with these measures, including the introduction of a carbon tax which is just going to make the burden on the manufacturing sector even worse, we really wonder about the govern­ment's overall policy perspectives. As I said yesterday, the government says it wants to do one thing but its actions belie that and seem to take it in another direction. We do not support these amendments as they are structured basically because, if the government and the Greens genuinely think that small enterprises are as cash strapped as Senator Milne said they are, these measures should not be introduced after the next election in 2014; they should be introduced much sooner.

Senator CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research) (12:41):  I thank senators for their contri­butions. As Senator Milne has indicated, this has arisen as a result of discussions. The government are not frightened of acknow­ledging that we are in the business of actually discussing issues of this complexity and importance when we want to develop new initiatives. This is a scheme that in the 1990s was attracting less than $300 million per annum in terms of support. It has now gone to a position where we estimate in the next financial year it will require support from the budget effectively of $1.8 billion per annum. This is a scheme that has attracted some 8½ thousand registrations for the overall operations of the R&D system in this country. Some might say that is a high number. I take the view that, given the number of firms we have in this country, which is well in excess of two million, 8½ thousand firms is a very small number.


The aim of this project is to get more firms to invest in themselves. We have seen that it is all too often the case that small firms, who are understandably preoccupied with the day to day, do not necessarily think about the implications of not investing in themselves. What we have tried to do with this program is double the level of support for small- and medium-sized enterprises to actually give financial incentives for businesses to invest in themselves. We have also increased support for large firms by an additional one-third.


This is not about reducing the level of investment in R&D. On the contrary, it is about expanding it. Senator Colbeck is quite right: this is an uncapped scheme. It is actually about building support and changing the culture of business in this country so as to ensure that there are higher levels of investment in R&D. The difference is that we cannot allow to go unchallenged the pattern of development that has occurred in recent years. The reason is that inappropriate claims and rorting of the taxation system have a serious detrimental effect on our capacity to administer sound government programs. We have occasions where large financial institutions have claimed their entire computer system as R&D. It is just not appropriate that that type of activity continue, because it will bring into question the authority and credibility of the whole scheme. In parts of the resources sector people are claiming the entire project—billion dollar claims—for R&D through the system, including roads and the walls of mines and projects that involve R&D on mining shafts. They claim materials removed from mine shafts and sold as R&D. That is just not on.


Senator, you made reference to 100 firms securing 60 per cent of what is the equivalent of $1.8 billion per annum. It is not the fact that there are only 100 firms; it is the fact that the 100 firms get 60 per cent of the benefit. They understand that. By the way, the claims of those 100 firms are controlled by four accountancy companies; hence, there has been this concern raised in some accountancy firms that they will now have to change their business model. They are anxious about that. 


We say, 'Go out and change the way you do business; get new clients because we want to see more and more people invest in their own future and invest in R&D.' The accountancy companies will have to actually do their job properly. They might have to change their approach. This is one measure that came about as a result of the conversa­tions in three rounds of the consultation process involving over 700 companies. We were very concerned that there was proper discussion and proper consultation with real-world practitioners with a change of this importance and this was one scheme that came forward.


You raised a legitimate question: why have we waited till 1 January to introduce the quarterly payment aspect? That is on the advice of Treasury. That is how long it will take them to get their administrative systems in place. That is not to say that firms will not get the additional benefits; they will. It is just that they will not get the cash quarterly payments arrangements, but they will get the additional benefits provided by this legislation. Businesses will be able to choose whether from 1 January 2014 they continue to claim the research and development tax incentive at the end of the income year in which the research and development is undertaken or they apply for the quarterly payments that would deliver the benefits in the income year that the company undertakes the activities.


The quarterly credits will allow small and medium sized enterprises to choose an option which is best suited to their business conditions. This effectively means that providing quarterly credits will be deter­mined in the light of the experience with the operation of the new R&D tax incentive. Consequently, these amendments provide for the regime to be implemented through regulations. The amendments demonstrate that the government has in fact a clear commitment that a quarterly credits regime is to be part of the new incentive arrange­ments based on the real-life experience of firms participating in it.


I also put to you once again the assurance that we have built into this legislative framework of the review process through the R&D tax board. I have genuinely put that forward because I am concerned that, if people have issues about the way in which the administrative practices are undertaken, there is a process already built in to allow voices to be heard, ensuring that the policy intent is reflected in the administrative practice. With that, I trust the chamber is able to agree to these amendments.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (12:48):  I was not going to speak again, but I just have to make reference to the examples that Senator Carr gave in respect of claims made under the existing mechanisms for R&D. He talked about the mine and he talked about computer systems. We went through all this at estimates. At estimates we discovered that something like 24 or 28 significant claims had been made. They were all being investigated. It was acknowledged by everybody involved that they should not have been. It is the difference between a claim and a successful claim. We understand how this process works. There have been shots at industry about rorting the system. These claims were not eligible. It has been recognised and acknowledged across the board that these things should not have been claimed. The government is actually dealing with that through its processes. They are being investigated. There is this slinging off at industry. We accept that those claims should not have been made. If you are out there genuinely trying to help people and work on things, that is fine. But let us not have this slagging off at industry. Okay, they have done the wrong thing in this particular case, but it is being dealt with. It should not have qualified under the existing rules, but it was being investigated and managed.


Rather than slinging off at people, let us get on with the process. I would not have been provoked to make a further contribution but we did sit down—and people can go back and review the Hansard—during the estimates process and have a pretty good go at this. We spent a fair bit of time talking about these issues. We had a few moments of agreement even, which was amusing at times. We have looked at this in a pretty genuine way and I do not think it is helpful to go back over things that were well and truly addressed. I am not prepared, given that you have decided that you want to raise it again now, to go over that again. I think we fairly and fully dealt with it at that time. We both understand the circumstances around that, so let us put that aside rather than having a slanging match against industry. We all know how difficult it is out there for them. We do not need to be applying broad-brush imputations to their motives. We know that things that should not have been claimed under the existing regulations and they are being dealt with through a process within the existing scheme.

Senator CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research) (12:51):  The problem with that approach is that it did not recognise that they were being claimed and they were viable under the existing arrangements. Because of the changes in administrative interpretation, they were quite clearly outside the policy intent of all players in this game at the political level. The problem is that under the old regime they were able to be made and there was an incredibly complex process of appeal. Nonetheless, those claims could be made. That is why this legislation is so important.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:07):  Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question Senator Ludlam asked me yesterday in my responsibility as representing the Minister for Defence.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



Stephen Smith MP


Minister for Defence


Senator Scott Ludlam


Parliament House


CANBERRA ACT 2600


Dear Scott Ludlam


I refer to your questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Chris Evans, on 22 August 2011 in relation to Australian Defence Force casualties in Afghanistan.


Senator Evans took two questions on notice. This letter provides a response to these questions.


You asked whether the Government would provide a detailed breakdown of the types of wounds and the types of injuries sustained by soldiers in Afghanistan who have received compensation through the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the types of treatment and support offered to wounded and injured soldiers returning from Afghanistan.


I can advise that, as at 30 June 2011, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has accepted approximately 2,200 compensation claims from 920 individuals which are partially or wholly attributable to service in the Middle East Area of Operations which includes Afghanistan.


The list of conditions for which claims have been accepted includes conditions affecting hearing and sight, musculo-skeletal conditions (including amputations and fractures), mental health conditions, skin conditions and a number of non-specified health conditions.


Information about military compensation claims that have been lodged and accepted are published in the Department of Veterans' Affairs Annual Report and updated each year. This data relates to all types of service including peacetime and training.


The Annual Report includes figures of the top 15 most frequently claimed conditions.


During 2009-2010 the top three of these conditions in relation to service since 2004 (claimed under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004) were acute sprains and strains, fracture and hearing loss.


The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is currently considering how to make more detailed information in relation to claims more publicly available, noting that there are a number of issues to work through including the protection of the privacy of individuals.


You also noted that it was recently revealed that two of the 184 wounded Australian Defence Force personnel in Afghanistan were women. You asked whether the Government would alter the current Department of Defence practice of concealing the gender of wounded and injured soldiers and provide gender disaggregated data.


I can advise that two female soldiers serving in Afghanistan suffered superficial wounds during an insurgent rocket attack on Kandahar Airfield on 16 March 2007. The Department of Defence disclosed the fact of this incident via media release on 17 March 2007 (copy attached).


Defence publicly announces all battle casualties but for privacy reasons does not disclose personal or identifying details of personnel. The media release on 17 March was consistent with that practice.


It is not appropriate or relevant to release such details, including the gender of personnel who are wounded in the course of their duty.


There is currently no intent to change this policy.


Defence's first priority is the health and privacy of personnel who have been wounded in action.


Personnel deployed on operations remain concerned about media and public intrusion on them and their families.


The current policy manages the need to inform the Australian public of casualties but also retain a high degree of privacy for those involved.


Individuals who have sustained wounds in an incident may choose to make their personal details public if they wish to do so.


Neither of the two soldiers that were involved in the 16 March 2007 incident have chosen to make a public statement about their experience.


I hope this information is useful to you.


Yours sincerely


Stephen Smith

THREE AUSTRALIANS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED IN KANDAHAR ROCKET ATTACK


Three Australian soldiers were slightly wounded during an overnight rocket attack at Kandahar Airfield in Southern Afghanistan.


The soldiers suffered minor blast-effect injuries when the single rocket struck their accommodation area.


The three soldiers were provided with immediate first-aid and medical monitoring by Australian medics working at the base.


Some accommodation buildings suffered minor damage from the impact but most fragmentation and blast damage was absorbed by a purpose-built barrier system designed to limit the effectiveness of such an attack.


All three soldiers have contacted their next of kin and will return to duty.


The names of the soldiers wounded in the rocket strike will not be released for privacy reasons.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2011-08-23,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Adams today relating to comments concerning the 'Convoy of No Confidence'.


I am disgusted about the comments from Minister Albanese, who said that yesterday's and today's convoy was a 'convoy of no consequence'. It is an absolute disgrace. People are out here because they are concerned about the direction of our nation. These are the ordinary Aussie battlers—the truckies, the small business people, the people out there who are doing it tough to make a living. That is why they are here. It gets worse. We had the Greens leader, Senator Bob Brown, saying they are a 'smorgasbord of whingers'. I will make a comparison: at least they behaved themselves in a civil fashion. We cannot say that about Senator Bob Brown. Back in the Franklin River dispute he actually went to jail for 19 days. Some 1,500 people were charged for their misbehaviour. We did not see any of that out here. That is the truth of the matter. Senator Brown was sent to Risdon Prison, I think. I am not familiar with the facility. You might be, Mr Deputy President, as you hail from down that way.


The point is this: the people came here to genuinely express their concern about the direction of our nation. The truckies are concerned and I am sure Senator Sterle would be concerned about the death tax, as it was called by Tony Sheldon, National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union. The evidence he gave to our committee was that this extra almost 7c a litre due on 1 July 2014 is a death tax on the trucking industry. Harder work, longer hours, more stress on the drivers, more stress on the trucks: that is the last thing we want. We want our truckies to get home safely to their families and loved ones. They were out there expressing their concerns over the direction of our country and the proposed diesel tax, come 2014, on the truckies—almost 7c taken off the rebate, that very rebate of 18½c that the coalition got the truckies when it was in government, following the introduction of the GST. We have already lost 3½c under this government and it is now proposing 7c. Our concern is more costs with respect to their livelihood, harder work, longer hours and more stress on the truckies—that is what Mr Sheldon said to our committee.


As I said, I find it a disgrace when you have the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese, calling it a 'convoy of no consequence'. It was the Prime Minister who said, 'We'll be transparent; we'll wear out boot leather to tell people about the carbon tax.' Who was out there from the government yesterday? No-one. They were in hiding, under the shelter of these walls and roofs around us. Why did they not go out and talk to the people? Where is the transparency, which the Prime Minister assured us of? She said she would wear out the shoe leather and explain this tax. After a week or so that was the end of the wearing out of shoe leather—and no resoling of the shoes were required.


People are coming to Canberra because they are annoyed, they are frustrated, they are in business and they can see the direction in which our nation is going, and they know that the debt is going up and up and up, to $197 billion as of last Friday. They know who will have to pay for it in future generations. They know about the waste of money. We have been through it all in this place—the pink batts, the school buildings, the Green Loans and so on. People are concerned about the cost of living and the cost of running a business. 


Before the 2007 election, Mr Rudd said, 'We in government will put downward pressure on grocery prices and fuel prices.' Everyone knows that it was just political waffle. That is why the people are out here protesting. It is so demeaning, destructive, disgusting and absolutely disgraceful to refer to those genuine, hardworking Aussies in that sort of manner.


This government take the Aussie battlers and treats them with complete contempt. They do not understand. Most government senators in this place have just dropped in by parachuting out of the trade union movement. Now we have the actual Transport Workers Union agreeing with us that this is a death tax. That is why the truckies are down here. They have come from far and wide—from Darwin, Western Australia and Rockhampton. That is a big effort in tough times. A lot more would have been here if they could have afforded the time and the money. Unfortunately, they could not. I condemn what the government and government leaders have said on this matter.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  Do not leave yet, Senator Williams! I was really enjoying that contribution. May I take it that, on behalf of the Transport Workers Union, all Australian truck drivers and the government, when safe rates are implemented in this country, through the other House and this chamber, that you, Senator Williams, and your colleagues in the Nationals and the Liberals will be on this side of the chamber voting through that legislation to deliver safe rates? Is that how I take that, Senator Williams? You are on Hansard, and there will be no place for you to hide should you, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, not come to this side of the chamber to pass that legislation to ensure that every Australian truck driver is paid and remunerated a very safe and sustainable rate. Do not leave, Senator Williams; there is more!



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Unfortunately, I only have four minutes left, but I am rubbing my hands at the great news that the coalition will be supporting the government's safe rates legislation for Australian truckies.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I just heard Senator Williams, as he was scurrying out, say he did not say that. Maybe we will print the Hansard, Senator Williams, as we distribute it to all Australian truck drivers, because you were supporting the legislation no less than one minute 30 seconds ago.


I am a firm believer that every Australian has the right to protest and I have been involved in numerous protests. And do you know what? 


I will still be protesting when I believe the cause is right. I will be protesting alongside Qantas workers who will find themselves on the scrapheap. I would support any person who would travel around this country to come to Canberra to support safe rates, but this is very misleading. I have read numerous stories. It is not for me to say how many demonstrators were out there—whether there were 200, 300 or 500, whatever the number; whether there were 50 trucks, 300 trucks. The number was not massive because the protestors had talked it up. 


The misleading statements from Senator Williams must be clarified. Not at one stage did I read a piece of material or did I hear on any electronic media a report that those drivers—the truck drivers, not the caravaners—were here protesting on a safe rate. I heard that there were protests about a whole new world order. I heard that there were protests against the ban of the export of live cattle. I heard there were protests against the mining tax. I heard there were protests against the carbon tax. Not once did I read, hear or see one reference to a safe rate for Australia's truck drivers.


I could not take that protest seriously because I do believe that there were probably some very decent hardworking Australians who had it right, and that is fine. But when you have people saying, 'Roll along, come and join us, there are going to be thousands and thousands of people protesting in Canberra,' then they get here and it is a fizz-off, it is a little bit embarrassing for them.


The shameful bit here was the carry on from the resident big mouth, and I do not back down from those words. I am sure that half of the senators on the other side of this chamber would be embarrassed by Alan Jones's behaviour. With the greatest of respect, he attacked journalists because they were not reporting it the way he wanted it reported. Would it not be wonderful if we had the ability to denigrate Alan Jones on his show in the way he denigrates people who do not agree—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Here comes the cacophony of lunatics on the other side running to Alan Jones's defence. The man is not worth defending. Some of you senators on that side of the chamber really are above the way Alan Jones carries on. Going back to my opening statement. I did not support the convoy because I saw it as a group of people who had some manure on their liver who just wanted to vent their spleen. That is fine, not a drama. I will have to put a phone call into Tony Sheldon and say that I sat in this chamber and had the extreme pleasure—I am so excited, I can hardly contain it—to hear that the Nationals, and I take it the coalition partners, the Liberals, cannot wait for a safe sustainable rate being paid to Australia's truck drivers.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-08-23,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:18):  The most notable contribution made by Senator Sterle was the fact that he did not repeat the words of the Leader of the House. When Senator Evans was asked this question earlier this afternoon, he went to a great deal of trouble not to repeat the words of the Leader of the House yesterday. With that contribution, I am sure Senator Sterle has guaranteed his preselection again, assuming there are lots of TWU delegates and that that they will be very happy with that vaguely relevant contribution to the discussion we are having.


I challenge those from the government side who come after me: repeat the words of the Leader of the House. Repeat the accusations and the slurs made towards those who were protesting yesterday, because only an arrogant, conceited government would dismiss citizens who come to Canberra to protest against them as inconsequential.


On this side, we are used to protests, particularly when they are organised by some of the more thuggish elements of the union movement. There was an example back here in 1996 where vandalism was committed on Parliament House. This side does not seek to dismiss those who protest; it seeks to engage them. This government runs around shouting out the words 'Hawke' and 'Keating' as though they represent the Holy Spirit, hoping for some sort of political Pentecost, to give them some inspiration in politics. The only tongues that come out of this government are the tongues of mistruth, arrogance and conceit. This government does not actually want to engage with people who disagree with it; it seeks to ride roughshod over them. It seeks to say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards, and then simply hope that the people will forget by the next poll. 


This government will be held to account for its words. These words uttered by the Leader of the House yesterday when he referred to the inconsequential protesters, the convoy of the inconsequential, are going to hang around this government's neck like an albatross—just like former Prime Minister Paul Keating's little quip to those university students in 1995 when there was 10 per cent unemployment and he told them to go get a job—how dare they challenge the great and wise then Prime Minister Paul Keating; he could just flick them off and tell them to go get a job. That hung around that Prime Minister's neck right through to the 1996 election, and it is one of the things he is remembered for by those who were trying to get a job at the time. Sadly, unlike during the government that came after that of Paul Keating, there were many more people desperately looking for work.


From the Greens we expect terms like whingers and moaners; from the Greens we expect the vilification of those who disagree with them. The New South Wales branch supports occupations, it supports efforts to vilify particular businesses by virtue of who owns them—



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator RYAN:
  I said the New South Wales Greens support occupations, as we have seen recently in Melbourne. What I find truly amazing is that we can have illegal picket lines, we can have picket lines where people have to be bused to work behind blackened windows to keep them safe, we can have the sort of appalling behaviour that took place on the waterfront at East Swanson Dock in Melbourne just over a decade ago—



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator RYAN:
  Yes, and the death threats to their workers, and the blackened windows on the buses, and ignoring Supreme Court orders in Victoria—we can have all that, but how dare 400 people turn up on the lawns of this parliament to actually complain. All they are asking the govern­ment to do it is to live up to the words of the Prime Minister days before the last election. How dare they come here. Illegal picket lines, thuggery on picket lines and bus windows being blackened so workers cannot be identified because of threats to them and their family are okay, but how dare 400 people come here and ask the government to only do what its Prime Minister said she would days before the last election.


This government has absolutely no credibility on this issue because of what it supports in the industrial relations framework. More importantly, the words uttered by the Leader of the House yesterday that these people were inconsequential will reverberate through the Australian community and they will reverberate because every Australian knows that if a government can say that about the 400 people who came to Canberra yesterday it actually thinks that about them as well. How dare they disagree! This government will be held accountable for those words.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:23):  I think Senator Ryan is reliving his university student days with such a contribution. He should have tried to put some substance into his speech.



Senator Ryan interjecting—




Senator MARSHALL:
  I did not go to university, Senator Ryan, so I missed that joyous time that many on your side must have revelled in and miss deeply. I ask Senator Ryan not to leave the chamber because I am indebted to him for clarifying on the public record that there were 400 people at the rally. I thought Senator Macdonald had claimed that there were 8,000. Either you or Senator Macdonald is clearly misleading the chamber, and I thought you might stay and clarify whether it was him or you. I see that you are leaving the chamber, because that would be an embarrassing clarification for you to make. I did not go out there so I am not going to take a guess. The Australian is certainly no friend of the Labor Party and it claimed there were 300—but who is counting.


We as a party and as a government have always respected people's rights to protest. But we have nothing to apologise for and certainly the Leader of the House has nothing to apologise for. We were not criticising the people's right to protest—we are very happy with that and we are happy to listen to them. But the organisers of this protest said tens of thousands of people would be descending on Canberra and that a demonstration by those numbers would be a message to the Gillard government to resign. Overwhelming numbers of Australians were going to descend on Canberra and we were going to be forced to resign from govern­ment. Instead of tens of thousands coming, 400 came. Given the claims that the protesters made, instead of having tens of thousands, we got 400. Quite frankly, it was inconsequential in terms of their objectives of overwhelming Canberra and sending us a message to resign. It was never inconse­quential for people to actually come and protest. People have that right and I encourage people to do so. But when you look at the aims, and it was an ideologically motivated protest when you look at the nature of the organiser in the first place, their claim was that they were going to flood Canberra with trucks and tens of thousands of people. Well, that did not eventuate. What did The Australian, no friend of the Labor Party, say? I quote:


It was meant to draw thousands of disenfranchised Australians demanding a fresh election, but yesterday's 'convoy of no confidence' was more fizzle than fury.


I think they have got it right, too. The newspaper article goes on to talk about rally organiser Mick Pattel standing by his views that climate action could be considered a global conspiracy. There we have it. No wonder they could not get tens of thousands of people. I do not think tens of thousands of people actually believe that climate change is some sort of global conspiracy. 


But who is this Mr Pattel? I have not done my own research. I do not normally like relying on newspapers, so I put that precondition on it. But, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the organiser, Mr Mick Pattel, is a former Liberal-National party candidate in Queensland. What a surprise that is. This international conspiracy theorist was a candidate for the National-Liberal party in Queensland and he organised apparently this overwhelming group of tens of thousands of people that turned into 400 to descend on Canberra. Quite frankly, that was a flop and a failure; that did not send us any messages at all. All that said was that we can trust that Australians do not believe that climate change is some part of an international conspiracy. They are a wake-up to being used and manipulated by Liberal-National party candidates. They are smarter than that. We give them a lot more credit than that. It is a pity that you on that side do not.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:28):  What a sad day yesterday was for Australian democracy. 




Senator Marshall:
  What?




Senator NASH:
  I can tell you why I am saying that, Senator Marshall. This government has dropped to new lows. How dare you say to the people of Australia out there on that lawn that their views do not count because, gosh, there were not a few more of them. Mr Albanese called the event a 'convoy of no consequence'. If it is no consequence, he is saying their views are of no consequence, and that is a very sad day for this government. By your own admission, Senator Marshall, you would not even go out there; you did not have the guts to go out there and stand in front of those people and listen to them.




Senator Marshall:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: the senator is clearly misleading the Senate.



Senator Nash interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Do you have a point of order, Senator Marshall?




Senator Marshall:
  No.




Senator NASH:
  I thank Senator Marshall for conceding there was no point of order. But what a sad day it was. How dare this government say to the people of Australia, 'You can't come to this place, come to the lawns in front of Parliament House, and be taken seriously.'




Senator Marshall:
  No-one said that.




Senator NASH:
  Listen to what I am saying, Senator Marshall. 'You cannot come out there and be taken seriously,' because you are not taking it seriously. Yesterday, the moral fibre of this government dropped lower than its polling. It is appalling that they are not taken seriously. How dare Minister Albanese say that it was a convoy of no consequence. Those people had come from all around Australia because they are worried about the future of this country.




Senator Marshall:
  How many? How many?




Senator NASH:
  Senator Marshall keeps interjecting saying, 'How many? How many?' Obviously size does matter to Senator Marshall because it is of no consequence whatsoever to what happened yesterday. Every single—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  I will take the interjection. Senator Fifield says, 'He's not the only one!' Yesterday, it did not matter if there was one person who turned up. It did not matter if there were 10, 15 or 5,000. Every single one of those Australians had every right to be taken seriously and to have their voice heard. They were not. Not one single member of this government bothered to go and listen. They did not have to stand up there and say anything. They could have simply gone out and listened to the Australian people, but they chose not to.


Isn't it interesting, colleagues. Senator Marshall and others say how dreadful it is that there were not more people. Gosh, how many people were standing on the lawns yesterday supporting a carbon tax? How many people were standing on the lawn in front of Parliament House last week supporting a carbon tax, Senator Cash? How many people have been standing anywhere in this country supporting a carbon tax? Guess what, Senator Marshall? If you have a look—miniscule; hardly any. So don't you dare tell these people, who took time away from their jobs and families at great expense to themselves simply because they wanted to have their voice heard, that you are not going to take any notice of them because there were not more of them, when hardly anybody is supporting the carbon tax.



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  You are absolutely obsessed with numbers and size aren't you, Senator Marshall? It is extraordinary, and this from the government—



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  You still cannot listen, Senator Marshall. If you are quiet you might learn something. This government still says it supports families. If it truly supported working families, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her government would have listened to those families yesterday. Senator Marshall, if you had taken the time to go out there and meet those people and talk to them like I and lot of my colleagues on the coalition side did, you would find out that they are not a moaners brigade, as Senator Bob Brown was calling them, and they are not a smorgasbord of whingers. They are down to earth, genuine Australians who care about the future of this country. But you would not know that, Senator Marshall, and neither would your Prime Minister, because you could not be bothered—you are too arrogant. You do not want to listen. If it is something you do not want to listen to, forget it; just ridicule it.


I think it is absolutely appalling that, if this is what the government thinks, that if somebody has a different view and they come to the lawns of Parliament House, the government says, 'Gee, if there is not enough of you we will ridicule that.' What a very, very sad day for this country it was, and it just shows the depth to which this government has fallen. You are inept and you cannot run the country. (Time expired)

I do note, however, that all of the technical information surrounding these issues is actually on the public record. It has been extensively FOI'd by the Greens. So in regard to the issues about who got the money and where it went that is all well and truly known to the Greens because they have undergone an extensive FOI process. I understand it has also been studied by the Australian National Audit Office. We would be more than happy to debate this issue, so if Senator Brown and his coalition partners, the Labor Party, were to provide Senator Macdonald, Senator Abetz and me some time in the chamber we would be more than willing to put on the public record the issues that Senator Brown seeks as part of this motion.

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:39):  by leave—I thank Senator Colbeck for coming halfway on the motion which, for the Senate's information, calls on senators from the Liberal Party and the Nationals to account for the $240 million of public money given to the Tasmanian logging industry by the Howard government in 2004 and to explain to the parliament why this money did not halt the loss of markets, the closure of woodchip mills and the loss of hundreds of jobs in 2011. What is required here is much better than a debate; it is simply a response to this motion, if it passes the chamber, from the Liberals, including Senator Colbeck. He has the advantage here not of a debate, in which he will be responded to, but of simply providing the information to the chamber and therefore to the people of Australia.


We have to remember that in 2004, $240 million was effectively transferred from the taxpayers of Australia, through the Howard government's election promise, to the logging industry in Tasmania. This is the same logging industry that is now being supplied with a further $276 million of taxpayers' money but is, yet, shedding thousands of jobs and has done so in the meantime. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Liberals are interjecting here. I remind the chamber that in that same period 3,000 people have been shed from the retail industry in Tasmania and not one of them is getting compensation. What the Liberals have not done is explain what happened to that money. Lots of questions remain over that, and if the motion is successful the Senate is now requesting them to provide that information so that the public can see what happened to their $240 million.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-08-23,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:51):  In introducing this matter of public importance, I want to begin by addressing the role of the Prime Minister in the many scandals that have beset her government. Of all the obligations of ministerial accountability, the most funda­mental is this: the obligation to conduct the affairs of the government in an honest and decent fashion. We have spoken in the last three or four years in this chamber on many occasions about the remarkable incompet­ence of the Rudd and Gillard governments. It is now almost impossible to find anyone other than a dedicated member of the Australian Labor Party who will disagree with you that the Gillard government is the worst government that Australia has ever suffered. It is not just the worst government since the Whitlam government or the most incompetent government since that famously incompetent government but the worst government that anyone can remember. That has become the brand of the modern Labor Party.


The Labor Party is a political organisation that delivers incompetent governments. It has delivered incompetent governments at the state level which have seen state Labor government after state Labor government hurled from office with enthusiasm by the electors at state elections in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, and almost certainly in the year to come in Queensland. There has also been incompetence at the federal level. That is brand Labor. I see Senator Faulkner over there. It is well known that I have a high regard for Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner is a former federal president of the Australian Labor Party and a cabinet minister in successive Labor governments. I cannot help but feel sadness for someone like Senator Faulkner seeing the political movement to which he has given his life degenerate into farce and scandal in the way the Gillard government has degenerated into farce and scandal.


I have talked about incompetence, but incompetence is not the worst sin. It is a very, very serious sin, but it is not the worst sin. The worst sin any government can commit is its failure to be honest with the people, its failure to respect the people, its failure—in the words of this MPI—to be accountable to the people. We saw that exhibited chillingly yesterday when that unattractive popinjay Mr Anthony Albanese, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, described—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! That was a reflection on the character of Mr Albanese, which you may consider withdrawing.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy President. I did not know the word 'popinjay' was unparliamentary, but if you so rule then let me withdraw it. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport described with utter contempt a gathering of thousands of Australians who had exercised the most fundamental right you can exercise in a democracy—the right to come to their nation's parliament to express their grievance to government, to petition the government with their grievances. Our democratic system was born from the cauldron of people petitioning on grievances against their government. That is what those people did, only to be dismissed by Mr Anthony Albanese as a convoy of inconsequence. Those words, I am sorry to say, will come back to haunt the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese and all the ministers of this government. The fact that the view of Australian citizens who want to express a grievance against their government, because they think the government has gone wrong, is that they are people of no consequence. That is what Mr Albanese said to them yesterday.


We know this government was constructed on a lie, the most infamous lie in the history of Australian politics: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' But now this government's continued tenure in office depends upon another credibility—not just the Prime Minister's credibility, but the credibility of a man called Craig Thomson, the member for Dobell. Mr Craig Thomson stands accused of a number of serious allegations: allegations of fraud; allegations of stealing members' funds from the trade union of which he was once the national secretary.


I am pleased to say that the New South Wales police today decided to examine whether or not Mr Thomson has in fact committed these crimes. We do not prejudge that. I am bound to say that Mr Thomson's explanations are very implausible. Nevertheless, that is a matter for the proper authorities to pursue. I might also say that Mr Thomson himself has alleged that a crime has been committed, of which he was the victim. He said somebody forged his signature on credit card vouchers. If Mr Thomson is telling the truth, a crime has been committed of which he was the victim. If he is not telling the truth, a crime has been committed of which he was the perpetrator. On either view, there is a taint of criminality about these events. Last week, on each consecutive day, the Prime Minister told the House of Representatives she had full confidence in Mr Craig Thomson. I understand she repeated it again in question time today. So the Prime Minister has staked her entire government's credibility upon the credibility of Mr Craig Thomson. The Prime Minister has made the integrity of Mr Craig Thomson the test of the integrity of her own government. Because the Prime Minister was elected on a lie a little over a year ago when she said there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads, you would think that perhaps that was a heroic thing for Ms Gillard to do—a person whose own integrity is under such a cloud in the eyes of the Australian people joining herself, fusing the integrity of her own government, with the integrity of a person under a cloud such as Mr Craig Thomson. But that is what she has done.


Go through it. Whether it be the famously incompetent manner in which the Gillard government and before it the Rudd government conducted the public affairs of this country, whether it be the undisguised contempt with which ministers in the Gillard government regard the Australian people and people who might disagree with them, as exhibited by Mr Albanese's remark yesterday that people who come to petition with their grievances against the government are inconsequential, or whether it is the fact that a government elected on a lie now depends for its very political survival on the integrity of Mr Craig Thomson, for all of those reasons the opposition says, and in saying so mirrors the overwhelming sentiment of the Australian people: 'Give us an election. Resolve the political situation of this country and face the people, because the people are your masters, a fact which you have forgotten.'

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:02):  This is quite a remarkable proposed matter of public importance. I will read the matter of public importance, which stands in Senator Fifield's name: 'The Government's failure to observe the standards of ministerial accountability,' an issue not canvassed at all in all the time available to Senator Brandis to address it. He did not utter a word about standards of ministerial accountability. It was interesting in itself that Senator Brandis spoke to this matter of public importance, because it stood in the name Senator Fifield, was proposed by Senator Fifield, was submitted by Senator Fifield, who could not himself address the issue and immediately called a quorum at the beginning of this debate to have another colleague come in to the chamber and face the music. That colleague, of course, was Senator Brandis.


You will have to excuse me, Mr Acting Deputy President, but there is something I have to admit to. I have always liked Senator Brandis. Not everyone does, but I do. I see smiles on the other side of the chamber.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator FAULKNER:
  I am that sort of guy. I am a very nice guy and I quite like Senator Brandis. I noticed that he said he felt sorry for me. I noticed that he said that and talked about my political career. That made me reflect on Senator Brandis's career and why he might not have spoken about standards of ministerial accountability. One's mind really goes back to the time of the Howard government. I remember the major debate, the hour upon hour spent in this chamber when debating the issue of whether or not Senator Brandis had described then Prime Minister Howard as a lying rodent. At the end of these debates I think Senator Brandis admitted to describing Mr Howard as a plain rodent—not a lying rodent, just a plain rodent. That is perhaps why we have not had a discussion about standards of ministerial accountability.


This appeared to be an excuse to talk about Mr Thomson, the member for Dobell. With 3½ minutes to go in Senator Brandis's speech, having not canvassed standards of ministerial accountability, Senator Brandis finally got to Mr Thomson and said we should not prejudge issues relating to him. I think that is probably quite wise counsel from Senator Brandis. He ought to recall how the Howard government and its ministers responded when members of parliament, members of the government, were subject to police investigations, and it happened quite regularly. The last occasion this occurred that I can recall, but there might have been one since then, was when Queensland Liberal MPs Mr Hardgrave, Dr Laming and Mr Vasta were investigated for what were alleged to be electoral spending irregularities. Mr Howard quite rightly said at the time that a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for. I quote Mr Howard directly about that matter:


It is a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course. And then if it is appropriate I will have something to say.


You know, at the time, and right through that period of the Howard government, the then Labor opposition consistently did not comment on matters that were subject to police investigations. On no occasion did we do that. I was then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and many of these issues were raised in this chamber and in committees of the Senate but never did the then opposition comment on any operational matter—something that I think Senator Brandis and others from the current opposition could reflect on. 


It is remarkable how the Liberal Party could propose a matter of public importance on ministerial standards—and this from a party which lost nine ministers and parliamentary secretaries while in government, who had to resign as a result of either rorts or conflicts of interest. Of course, that number would have been higher if Mr Howard himself did not water down his own code of ministerial conduct. Liberal ministers could not reach the standards that Mr Howard proposed were required of his own ministers and because of that he watered down the code. Don't forget it was when the ministerial guide was first published that Mr Howard promised to raise the standard of parliamentary and political life. He released the document, A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility, and in the introduction to that guide he stressed:


… the necessity of adherence to high standards by people occupying positions of public trust …


And he said:


The Australian people have this as their entitlement …


But of course it was Mr Howard who gave Australian politics the non-core promise, and that commitment to higher standards of ministerial behaviour was precisely that—it was a non-core promise from Mr Howard.


Time after time, Mr Howard's ministers and parliamentary secretaries were found to be in breach of Mr Howard's own code. The code was administered inconsistently and it was deliberately applied ineffectively. And then the code was junked. It was junked. Ministerial standards for the Liberal Party—just too hard. 


How dare they come in here and propose a matter of public importance on ministerial standards given the record of that government? The Howard government was 11½ years of sleaze, ministerial scandal and abuse of power. That is what it was like. Think about the former ministers—Mr Reith, Dr Wooldridge and Mr Anthony—taking lobbying jobs in the same industries they were regulating mere days before their resignations. Think about the bailing out of the Prime Minister's brother, Mr Stan Howard, from his National Textiles business debacle. Think about the rorting of the grants programs to shore up votes in marginal seats. Think about the 'never, ever' GST and the concept that I mentioned before—the non-core promise. Think about the AWB $300 million wheat-for-weapons scandal. Think about the Iraq war and the suggestion that there were weapons of mass destruction. Think about the dogs and the balaclavas on the waterfront. Think about the lies on 'kids overboard'. Think about the cover-up of 'kids overboard'. Think about using Kirribilli House and the Lodge as party central for Liberal Party fundraisers. Think about the shameless use and abuse of taxpayers' money for partisan political advertising. And so it goes on.


How extraordinarily hypocritical—but how courageous—for the Liberal Party to come in here and propose a matter of public importance about ministerial standards. So I thought: in the time available to me, why do we not go to the ministers themselves? We might have a look at some of them. We could start, if you like, with former Senator Herron and his professional practice as a surgeon—which he had to give up because it was in breach of the code. We could talk about Assistant Treasurer Jim Short, who resigned after it was found that he had approved an operating licence for an ANZ Bank subsidiary while holding shares in the ANZ Bank. We could think about the then Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore, being forced to defend his $100,000 shareholding in Bligh Ventures and his controlling interest in Ralston Pty Ltd, a share-trading company, despite the express prohibition in the code. We could talk about Brian Gibson and Geoff Prosser, both forced to resign—they were of course both expendable in those early days of the Howard government. Former Senator Gibson had exempted a Boral subsidiary from certain provisions of the Corporations Law while he held Boral shares, and Mr Prosser owned three shopping centres and took an active interest in running them. We might talk about former Senator Parer, who was the resources minister. He owned, through a family trust—those of you who were in the Senate at the time might recall—an $8 million share in a coalmine plus interest in a range of other resources companies. The pursuit of Senator Parer was described by the then opposition as 'the great white rhino hide', you might recall. I do not have time to explain why that terminology was used, but it certainly caught on. Of course, in relation to Senator Parer, Mr Howard chose to sacrifice his standards rather than the ministry.


I could go on and on. I do not have time to go through all the Howard government ministers who fell foul of Mr Howard's original code of conduct before Mr Howard watered it down because he was not willing to ensure it was properly administered and implemented. How extraordinary is it that the current Liberal opposition would come into the chamber and talk about ministerial standards, with its record? There is an old expression in politics, you know: 'People in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones.' That is exactly where you are when you are talking about ministerial standards, although I acknowledge no-one from the Liberal Party has even mentioned, yet, ministerial standards in this debate. As I said on another matter earlier this week, 'You're standing right in the middle of a very, very large glasshouse throwing very, very small pebbles at this government.' I suggest that the opposition gets its act together before it comes in here proposing a matter of public importance on ministerial standards as a ruse for discussing other matters.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (16:17):  We have seen the demise today of the great Labor warrior. In 15 minutes we have seen the demise of the great Labor warrior, reduced to a speech like that. I cannot believe that Senator Faulkner, the great warrior, has demeaned himself to make a speech like that today. History will show that someone who was a great man for the Labor Party reduced himself to a speech like that today.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator RONALDSON:
  I am actually not going to take the bait, except that I will make a couple of comments. Senator Faulkner was talking about thinking about things. Well, I am thinking about Centenary House, I am thinking about the Labor Party's promise before the election before last about political advertising and I am thinking about the ANAO report. I am also thinking about the great lie before the last election: 'There there will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead.' So I am thinking about lots of things, 'Great failed warrior'. I am thinking how sad it is to see you reduced to this today.


I will now continue with what I was going to talk about, which is ministerial standards. I want to go through an interview today with the Prime Minister of this country, the person who, of course, perpetrated that great enormous untruth before the last election:


SABRA LANE: To Craig Thomson now. Tony Abbott says he's a protected species, the shadow finance minister, Andrew Robb, used parliamentary privilege last night to describe him, Craig Thomson, as a thief and a liar. Why did the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party pay his legal bills?


JULIA GILLARD: Look, this is a question for the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party.


SABRA LANE: We've rung them, we're not getting calls back.


JULIA GILLARD: Well … that is as it may be Sabra, but decisions by the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party are their decisions. But more broadly can I say, in relation to the Opposition here, I don't think people appreciate hypocrisy.


As Prime Minister, what I've said about the Member for Dobell is that there is an investigation in train by Fair Work Australia, and we should await the outcome of that investigation.


…   …   …


SABRA LANE: Well Fairfax has revealed this morning that the mobile phone used to call escort agencies was also used to call Stephen Smith and Mark Arbib. This casts doubt on Mr Thomson's denials—he's previously said that the credit card used to pay for these things was used by someone else, and the implication too was that his phone was used by someone else, have you sought an explanation from him?


JULIA GILLARD: There's an investigation by Fair Work Australia in train…


Our SABRA LANE: But have you sought it?


JULIA GILLARD: I've certainly spoken to Craig Thomson, of course I have, but there is an investigation in train by Fair Work Australia, and I believe that it's appropriate that that investigation work its way through.


The Prime Minister goes on to say:


So, Fair Work Australia will work its way through, we'll await the outcome of that investigation. In the meantime the Member for Dobell is doing his job as the local member in this Parliament.


That was the language used by the Prime Minister up until this morning, and I gather was repeated today under pressure because she had no choice. Let us talk about what she was saying about the member for Dobell. He had her 'complete confidence' and:


I look forward to him continuing to do that job for a very long, long time to come.


What was she reduced to this morning?


... the member for Dobell is doing his job as the local member in this Parliament.


This Prime Minister has been backed into a corner. This Prime Minister does not have the intestinal fortitude to deal with Craig Thomson as she knows he should be dealt with. In all the pathetic debate today from Senator Faulkner there was one truth that came out: a former Prime Minister acted and this Prime Minister refuses to do so—despite being confronted with overwhelming evidence that one of her own members has been involved in fraudulent behaviour. She has not even removed this man as chair of the economics committee. For the first time this morning we have seen invoked the defence of Fair Work Australia.


This afternoon, I asked Minister Evans a question in relation to this matter. The line being run by the Labor Party is that this dragged-out Fair Work Australia investigation has got to take its course and that Minister Evans will not interfere. That sounds daggy at question time but when you look at the evidence it is actually damning in relation to this minister's involvement in Fair Work Australia and an ongoing campaign by the Australian Labor Party to make sure that this never sees the light of day, and if it is to see the light of day it will be delayed and delayed in the faint hope that the overwhelming evidence against the member for Dobell suddenly disappears into the ether.


I want to read into the Hansard today part of the conversation between myself, Mr Nassios and the minister—and I believe you may well have been there, Mr Deputy President. The Hansard states:


Senator RONALDSON:  Clearly, Mr Nassios, your attitude in relation to some of my questions has changed since last May—


This is Wednesday, 23 February—


and I have got to say that I am very pleased about that. There are some things you have advised me today about which you would not have last time, so on the back of that—I assume that they were questions asked along the same vein—would you now advise me whether you have interviewed Craig Thomson, Pauline Fegan, Criselee Evans, Matthew Burke and Jeff Dickson?


Mr Nassios: Certainly if we could go one by one.


Mr Evans: I just ask whether we take advice about whether we should be detailing who you have interviewed in a current investigation. I would have thought that was a bit unusual to be providing publicly who you were interviewing if an investigation is continuing. Has that been done in the past?


Mr Nassios: I cannot recall it being done in the past. When the senator was asking me these questions last time I felt that it would not be helpful to my investigation to divulge that sort of detail. I certainly cannot say it would hinder my investigation at this point.


I will repeat that:


I certainly cannot say it would hinder my investigation at this point.


Mr Evans said, 'I think it would be best if we got some advice as to whether you made those lists of witnesses who have been interviewed available.' The comments today from this minister were, 'I have no intention of interfering.' And, separately, 'It would be totally inappropriate to interfere.'  On 23 February this year, what did this minister do? He interfered with evidence that was about to be given to the Senate in relation to Craig Thomson, the member for Dobell, involving Fair Work Australia. Mr Nassios, from Fair Work Australia, had made it quite clear to me in May last year that he was not prepared to answer my questions as to who was interviewed because it would potentially interfere with his investigation. On 23 February this year, when asked the same questions, Mr Nassios said he was prepared to do so. Mr Nassios said that, because it would no longer interfere with his investigation, he was prepared to answer them: 


Certainly, if we could go one by one.


That was the response he gave, which I read out before, in relation to Mr Thomson, Pauline Fegan, Criselee Evans, Matthew Burke and Jeff Dickson. 


This is a government that is completely and utterly devoid of any ministerial responsibility. This is a government that will stop at nothing in relation to the making of wafer-thin excuses to protect its wafer-thin majority. This is a government that stands utterly condemned. I will just finish on this note. I was talking before about the demise of the great warrior. The one person that the great warrior mentioned only in passing was the member for Dobell, because the now failed great warrior of the Australian Labor Party knows full well that the evidence against Mr Thomson is overwhelming. He did not seek to defend Mr Thomson today because he knows it would be completely and utterly untenable to do so.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:27):  It is certainly a privilege to follow on from the great warrior, Senator Faulkner, and the fine words that he added to this MPI debate this afternoon, which the opposition have brought in here, on the failure to observe the standards of ministerial accountability, a subject which the opposition have very intimate knowledge of. How quick they are to forget the appalling record of ministerial accountability in the Howard years. They have almost goldfish memories, not being able to think about anything beyond the perhaps six or 12 seconds that a goldfish can hold on to information. 


I remind those opposite that, before they come into this place and put forward an MPI on the failure to observe the standards of ministerial accountability, they will have the opportunity, using their memory banks, to think a little bit more, beyond that of a goldfish's memory, to the actual extent of the ministerial accountability in the Howard years. Of course, we all remember that when John Howard came to power he noted:


The most important thing any government can do is build a sense of trust, a sense of integrity, a sense of honesty and a sense of commitment to the Australian people.


I do not think anyone in this place would argue with that. Of course, he followed on from those statements by creating A Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility as a key benchmark against which the conduct of ministers, their conflicts of interest, the use of power of office for personal gain and other things could be measured. Of course, at the very first hurdle, the guide failed in its task. Let us have a little trip down memory lane to highlight exactly the ministers in the coalition who did fail in the Howard years. First, there was Assistant Treasurer Jim Short, who approved a banking licence for a subsidiary of a company in which he owned $50,000 worth of shares—the ANZ Banking Group. But Prime Minister John Howard declared that, because Mr Short had not been deliberately dishonest, he was not culpable under his set code.


Then we had Senator Brian Gibson, who was parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer and failed to ensure he had sold his shareholdings in Boral Energy, approving an application by that company to be included in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market. The Prime Minister made the point then of indicating that Short and Gibson both still had his support. History shows, though, that both Short and Gibson did in fact resign, and with characteristic opportunism John Howard changed his tune, from Short's resignation 'certainly not being as a result of any pressure' to it later being a symbol of his own conviction that 'Gibson and Short had to go'.


Those rules were tested again when the Prime Minister's friend Senator Warwick Parer, then Minister for Resources and Energy, was the subject of serious breaches of the code. In 1998, revelations surfaced that Minister Parer held shares in Queensland coal company QCMM, even while he had portfolio responsibility for that resource industry. Not only had Parer not declared his interest on the Register of Senators' Interests—and, without excusing this, I acknowledge that members on all sides from time to time have been guilty of this offence—but then Minister Parer also failed to declare the kinds of conflicts about which one is reminded as issues arise, such as conflicts of interest related to diesel fuel rebate legislation and to the Native Title Amendment Bill, when a coal deposit in his own family trust was subject to a native title claim. There was at that time a very serious debate about Senator Parer's conduct, and I do not wish to go on too much further about that. 


But what this whole thing shows is that the episode was clearly indicative of the coalition government's willingness to turn a blind eye when issues of accountability, responsibility and propriety were incon­venient to them. They have short memories, but memories have certainly come up to speed today through their bringing this MPI into the Senate chamber, which we welcome very much on this side, as an opportunity to get on the record that complete history of the Howard years.


Because I do not have enough time this afternoon, I would like to refer the members opposite to an article in a very good journal, the Australian Journal of Politics and History—senators opposite might want to write this down—in volume 54, No. 2, 2008, pages 225 to 247. It is a very good article by Luke Raffin from the University of Melbourne, titled 'Individual Ministerial Responsibility during the Howard Years: 1996-2007'. In this article, I refer members to page 228, where there is a very good table that highlights the tests of individual ministerial responsibility during the Howard era. I could list a number of ministers and parliamentary secretaries who failed those tests. Why? Because Prime Minister John Howard was happy to water down his code of conduct, instead preferring that proof of actual wrongdoing and personal profit arising from misconduct was necessary.


If this reinterpretation of the code was redundant—and it was—then there was perhaps one more potent example, when Wilson Tuckey became the 14th minister to be accused of breaching that ministerial code, by using his office and his ministerial letterhead to pressure the South Australian police minister to commute a traffic fine against his son. The coalition have short memories indeed. And it was not just that with former Minister Tuckey; twice Tuckey misled parliament about that matter. But that was not enough for former Prime Minister John Howard to act on his own code of conduct, despite admitting that Mr Tuckey had been foolish and wrong, because Mr Howard's standards had now changed to whether or not the minister had actually broken the law.


I could go on and on with more and more about coalition ministers who broke that code of conduct. What this highlights very much is that it is a bit rich for the coalition senators to come into this place with this when they are from a party willing to make exemptions, obfuscate and bend the facts to the point of breaking their—that is, the Liberal Party's and their minor coalition partner's—own code of conduct. It is a bit rich when Tony Abbott's sense of accountability and responsibility in his own job is to go around fearmongering, being negative and misleading people on grade 10 science about the weight of carbon. It is all a bit rich for the opposition to raise this MPI demanding the resignation of a member on this side, not a minister but a member, on the basis of allegations—not on charges, not on convictions but on allegations—against that member before his election to parliament.


On this side of the chamber we demand and expect standards because we believe it is important that the public have confidence in their public administration and in the decisions that their ministers take, that these decisions are always motivated by the interests of the public not the interests of the individual. That is why when Labor came into power the Prime Minister announced standards of ministerial conduct to replace the Howard government's failed, watered down, wishy-washy code of conduct. Our new code of conduct actually takes into account the legitimate concerns that the Australian public have about the prevalence of lobbyists, for example, in modern politics. When this code has been tested, Labor has responded by upholding the highest standards of ministerial accountability.

  Do you know why, Senator Singh? Because you are trying to defend the indefensible.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
) (16:37):  Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I would like you to address your remarks through the chair.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, those on the other side are trying to defend the indefensible. Senator Faulkner came in here and was perplexed, no less, about today's matter of public importance. Obviously he has not been reading the papers lately. Indeed, Senator Singh—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—might I suggest that you concentrate and read the daily newspapers rather than some obscure journal about whatever, because today's daily newspapers offer the government some very good advice. I take you to the Canberra Times, not necessarily a newspaper that has always been—how should I say it?—right of centre. It is a newspaper that I would equate more with the left wing of politics, but there it is in the commentary in today's Canberra Times, which says:


Voters are not mugs.


Mr Peake said:


Expecting them to believe that an unnamed person used Craig Thomson's credit card and phone and drivers licence for escorts—and escaped without penalty—is reaching too far into fiction.


He goes on to say:


She—


referring to the Prime Minister—


closed down debate in Parliament—


as she did yesterday. What level of prime ministerial standard is that—shutting down parliament, shutting down the debate, as she did yesterday? She undermines the argument that there is nothing to worry about. He continues:


Incredibly, Anthony Albanese says Parliament has no time at all in this week's four-day sitting to allow the Member for Dobell to tell his story.


Let us have a look at the Herald Sun. Its headline reads that the pressure over the Thomson scandal is threatening the PM's credibility. That seems to me to be directly relevant in relation to ministerial responsibility. Mr Hudson makes this comment:


... Labor looks hapless as this issue eats away at its credibility. 


This is about a government that have a major integrity problem. They are so desperate to hang onto power. Of course the master, Graham Richardson, told them to do 'whatever it takes'. It seems to me that they ought to be listening to Graham Richardson at this point in time because I think he has read the political tea leaves a lot better than those opposite have. Mr Hudson writes: 


The NSW ALP took the extraordinary step of helping to pay legal bills for Thomson.


We know that they are absolutely paranoid that he should become bankrupt because that would disqualify him and make him ineligible to sit in parliament. The figures of $40,000, $90,000 and $150,000 have been bandied about. It could be a lot more. It could be $200,000; it could be a quarter of a million dollars. But nobody from the New South Wales Labor Party is prepared to tell us the conditions of that bailout and how much the actual figure was. Hard-earned union money—there it is being used in this matter. Mr Hudson also writes:


Abbott is right when he says an MP who, at best, is so careless with his own credit card statements should not be in charge of quizzing the Reserve Bank governor about the nation's finances.


That is backing up what the Leader of the Opposition is saying in relation to Mr Thomson. This is about integrity. Every day we open the newspapers and there is another allegation; there is another issue about misappropriation of money. Today it is about something else. It is there every day. This is going to keep going because it is very, very clear that the member for Dobell has a lot to answer for. 


Indeed, today's Courier Mail editorial says: 'Hard questions need answers in Thomson affair'. We have asked the member for Dobell to explain himself. Yesterday, in the other place, the Manager of Opposition Business sought leave to move a motion that would require the member for Dobell to attend in the House and give a personal explanation. The manager outlined the various issues so that the member for Dobell could reassure the House about these matters in a personal explanation—a please explain to the Australian public. What happened? It was shut down. There was not enough time to talk about these important issues. One of them said, 'Oh no, the member for Dobell has to explain himself,' so the Prime Minister gets asked a question about whether she has full confidence in the member for Dobell.


While we are on the subject, will any of the retrenched workers at BlueScope Steel receive a $90,000 gift from the New South Wales ALP? I am sure that they have a view on it, which I will hear next time I have a meeting in the mall in Wollongong in relation to that. I am sure they are all very happy about it! They are losing their jobs down in the Illawarra while their MPs and their union bosses are squandering money in brothels and all sorts of other things. What is the Prime Minister's response? Questions of personal explanation are for the individual parliamentarians involved. Well, we gave the opportunity to the member for Dobell to give a personal explanation and what did they do? They shut down the debate. So here is the Prime Minister saying, 'Oh no, he can make his own personal explanation', and when we try to give him the opportunity to give that explanation they shut down the debate. Isn't that smart? Give him the opportunity, but there is no desire to give a personal explanation because he has a hell of a lot to hide. That is what this is all about. This goes to the very core of the integrity of this government.


The member for Goldstein yesterday made a very pertinent comment to which my colleague Senator Ronaldson referred. He said:


The support being given to the member for Dobell is sickening. Look at the evidence  that comes out daily. Look at what we saw today from Fairfax—that he has lied; that he is a thief. Yet the Prime Minister stands up here daily and supports it.


Day in, day out this Prime Minister is going into the chamber and she is standing up for him. Day in, day out we are seeing more allegations.


Senator Ronaldson talked about Fair Work Australia. Here is Minister Evans today in question time telling us it is inappropriate for him to interfere, yet that is precisely what he was doing when Senator Ronaldson was trying to ask very important questions which today still remain unanswered because this minister interrupted and shut down that debate. If he does not have anything to hide, the member for Dobell should go right into that House now and explain to the Australian public. More importantly, he needs to explain to the people of Dobell.


I am patron senator for Dobell. And I can tell you there were hundreds of people at the Mingara Recreation Club a couple of weeks ago to witness the disgraceful behaviour of the member for Dobell, so I can tell you what the people of Dobell think of their local member—that is, he is a disgrace. The sooner the people of Dobell get the opportunity to have a by-election and to elect another person to represent them, the better off they are going to be and the better off the people of Australia are going to be to get rid of this government which is rotten to the core.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:47):  I am delighted to follow in the footsteps of Senator Faulkner and Senator Singh in this motion. I have high expectations of ministerial accountability. There is no script for this debate today, and frankly I cannot rewrite history for the opposition who had minister after minister fall like dominoes when in government, one after the other, after they had campaigned on clean government and their code of ministerial conduct. I do not need to retell the story that Senator Singh and Senator Faulkner have told this afternoon. We know that the former coalition government had minister after minister fall like cards—Jim Short, Brian Gibson, Bob Woods, Geoff Prosser, John Sharp, David Jull, Peter McGauran, John Moore, Warwick Parer—in just a few short years after the Howard government took power. That is not even the end of the list. But the Gillard government has high standards of ministerial ethics. I, the Australian public and the Australian Labor Party expect our ministers to uphold those standards of ministerial ethics. The opposition when in government had many ministers fail their own code of conduct, one after the other. So there was a complete lack of formal accountability demonstrated by those opposite. Why? Because they were not accountable. They have not been account­able, as Senator Faulkner and Senator Singh have clearly demonstrated. Even now they waste this parliament's time as they spend time trying to score base political points. That is not accountability. Cheap political scoring of points is not accountability. There is no accountability from the senators opposite in this place. They do not make a contribution even to substantive policy debates. Why? Because they are devoid of policy.


So let us talk about ministerial accountability and what Australians expect from their ministers. Take things like education and skills. We know that nearly 20,000 fewer apprentices commenced a trade in the 12 months to March 2007. There were only 78,000 apprentices. We have 97,000 apprentices which started a trade in the last 12 months, and that is a record number. Take the national curriculum. They failed to deliver a national curriculum for 11½ years. We are rolling out the first national curriculum here in 2011. The Gillard government is increasing university educa­tion enrolments by half a million places, whereas we know that enrolments were just 400,000 in the year 2008-09, 20 per cent fewer than we have now. So, taking education and skills, critically important issues for our nation, where is the shadow ministerial accountability on policy and where is the shadow ministerial accoun­tability on the cost of living when we know that we have an opposition with policies that will simply drive up the cost of living because they have no accountability? They have no accountability for their direct action on climate change policy. They say they want to implement it through direct action but they want to do it without a department and they have no plan to implement it. Take regional Australia: they will axe the Regional Infrastructure Fund; they will axe that $6 billion fund. Take the age pension: in 11½ years of government they failed to deliver a substantial pension increase. Take the cutting of mental health services—

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present a statement relating to discharging the committee’s requirement to present a report on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011.




The statement read as follows—



On behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I seek leave to make a statement on the Superannuation Legisla­tion Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 in discharge of the committee‘s requirement to provide an advisory report on the Bill and to present a copy of my statement.


On the 7 July 2011, the House of Representatives Selection Committee referred the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services.


The Bill proposes to move the responsibility for the administration of the early release of benefits in a retirement savings account or superannuation benefits in an entity regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority on compassionate grounds from APRA to the Chief Executive of Medicare.


Similarly, the general administration of the early release of superannuation benefits in a self managed superannuation fund on compassionate grounds will be transferred from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive of Medicare.


The amendment formalises an arrangement that has been in place since 3 February 2011 when APRA and Medicare Australia entered into a service delivery agreement for Medicare Australia to carry out the day‐to‐day functions in relation to the administration of early release of superannuation in APRA‐regulated superannua­tion entities under delegation from APRA. At the same time, the day‐to‐day functions in relation to the administration of early release of superannuation in self‐managed superannuation funds, under delegation from the Commissioner of Taxation, was transferred from APRA to Medicare Australia.


There is no extra cost associated with this amendment. Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Bill amends the APRA Act 1998 so that the industry levy associated with the administration of the early release of superannuation benefits currently paid to APRA can be transferred to Medicare Australia to meet administrative costs.


To support this arrangement, APRA officers were transferred to Medicare Australia in February 2011 to undertake the administration of the early release function.


The committee supports and endorses moves to formalise the interim arrangements that have been in place for over 6 months.


After consideration of the evidence, the committee has agreed not to inquire further into this Bill and recommends that the House pass the Bill.


Whilst supporting the referral of bills as an effective mechanism for increasing transparency and public consultation, the committee feels that the referral process would be more effective if an explanation was also provided as to why the Bill was referred in the first place so that the committee can target its efforts more effectively.


This Bill is simply a formalisation of arrangements that are already in place and that are supported by stakeholders. 


The committee is agreed that no further action is required by them in relation to this Bill.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:52):  I have been advised by the Deputy Clerk that this is the area in which I can seek leave to move a motion, because it relates to the tabling of documents, including those pursuant to orders. I seek leave to move a motion relating to a statement tabled by the government.


Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document tabled earlier today.


Yesterday the coalition proposed a motion to the Senate that there be laid on the table by noon today the number of act of grace payments approved by the minister since 24 November 2007 where the department recommended against approval and also provide the reasons for approval, the dates of approval and the value of each of the above act of grace payments.


This follows on from a discussion during Senate estimates and a question that was put on notice after Senate estimates in May. And of course no answer was provided for more than 70 days. When an answer was eventually tabled, it was that the government was not going to provide us with that information.


I will quickly explain why it is particularly important for the Senate to get access to this information. In relation to act of grace payments if they are requested and denied there is an appropriate process where people can appeal against that decision and there is proper scrutiny and checks and balances. However, there is a real question mark around the capacity to scrutinise decisions where act of grace payment requests are approved by the there is a question whether the approval by the minister is actually contrary to departmental advice. The party that has received the payment is hardly going to complain and there is no obvious way at present in the system where there can be proper scrutiny and some proper checks and balances applied to ensure that, where ministers make decisions to grant act of grace payments against the advice of the department, these decisions are actually proper decisions that have been made for proper reasons that can be justified in the public domain. I understand that, when you make decisions in relation to individual circumstances, there are privacy considerations, which is why the question on notice and the order were very carefully crafted. We know that the government has this information, because there has been some communication around, as I have mentioned, particularly in the context of Senate estimates. 


Yesterday, without any notice and without any prior communication, Senator Bob Brown, the leader of the Greens, who tries to present himself as a champion of openness and transparency and of scrutiny of government activities, moved amendments to this motion. They were ultimately passed by the Senate with the support of the govern­ment. The government, which had supported the proposed amendments, then proceeded to vote against the amended motion. Senator Brown moved amendments to include in the order all of the period of the Howard government, back to 1996, in terms of decisions that were made on act of grace payments. I flagged yesterday in the Senate that the government would use that expansion as an excuse not to provide information, given the workload that would be involved. What Senator Brown did yesterday was to play a trick to help the government get off the hook of facing up to scrutiny from the Senate. Of course, our job in the Senate right now is to scrutinise the activities of this government.


As I said yesterday, I am totally relaxed about expanding the order, but I am not relaxed about the fact that the government is now predictably using the Brown amendments as an excuse not to provide any information at all. If you look at the statement that was tabled in the Senate this afternoon by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, you will see that it says that they have:


… commenced work to determine the nature of the work involved in answering the order. 


Senators will note that the Senate's decision to expand the scope of the request to cover claims since 1996 substantially increases the workload required to meet the request.


Producing the response will require a substantial diversion of departmental resources. This being the case, the Special Minister of State advises that a further response will be provided to the Senate in due course.


What that really means is that, as I mentioned yesterday, it would have been much more sensible for Senator Brown, if he was really focused on having an appropriate comparison between a sample of decisions in the period under the former government and decisions under the current government, to have moved a motion to cover a similar period to that covered by the motion we put forward. But that is not what this is about. Senator Brown was trying to protect the government from the effects of this order, insofar as it applied to decisions made since 24 November 2007. He successfully manoeuvred to minimise scrutiny of government activities and government decision making around the act of grace payments, which is no doubt a great relief to the government.


I am intrigued about how this all happened. The government supported the amendment to expand the scope of the order from 24 November 2007 all the way back to 24 November 1996, then voted against the amended motion and is now using the fact that the scope has been expanded—an expansion that it voted for—as an excuse not to provide any information at all. This is a government that is secretive, that is not open and transparent, that does not want its activities scrutinised and that quite obviously has something to hide.


I put this into the context of instances, internationally, which were reported in the media quite recently, of a particular minister for finance in another jurisdiction who was accused of making inappropriate decisions around act of grace payments favouring somebody, and the allegation was that it was inappropriate. This is an entirely proper area of scrutiny for the Senate to ask questions about and to get answers from the government about the circumstances in which act of grace payments are approved when the particular approval is actually against the recommendation of the department that has assessed all of the circumstances of the case. There currently is absolutely no capacity to scrutinise whether these decisions have been made for proper reasons. I am concerned about it. That is why I asked the question in estimates. That is why I asked the question on notice when the government did not provide the information in the course of estimates. That is why I proposed the order. If Senator Bob Brown was truly interested in all of this information rather than just trying to protect the government, this is an issue that the Senate should revisit in the next little while.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (18:00):  It is important to point out to Senator Cormann, as he seeks to impose theories upon the chamber about what motivated the government or Senator Brown in relation to the amendment yesterday, what this statement means is what it says. It is worth placing on the record that this government is not only taking a very open approach but we are doing that very comprehensively. Hence I shall take the opportunity to read this statement on behalf of the government so there is no ambiguity and people are not misled by the presentation by Senator Cormann here today.


The statement relates to an order for the production of documents on act of grace payments, agreed to on 22 August 2011:


The Special Minister of State advises that the Department of Finance and Deregulation has commenced work to determine the nature of the work involved in answering the order.


Senators will note that the Senate's decision yesterday to expand the scope of the request to cover claims since 1996 substantially increases the workload required to meet the request.


Producing the response will require a substantial diversion of departmental resources. This being the case, the Special Minister of State advises that a further response will be provided to the Senate in due course.


It is self-explanatory. There is no supposition or tricky theory as espoused by Senator Cormann and I commend that motion to the Senate.

Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011


During the height of concerns confronting the international education sector in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as Minister for Education, asked the Hon Bruce Baird AM to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and its associated legislation that had originally been planned for 2012.  A number of amendments to the ESOS Act were introduced to strengthen registration requirements and require re-registration of all providers by the end of 2010.  This interim step was necessary to reinforce the integrity and quality of Australia’s international education sector.  When those amendments were passed in February 2010 an undertaking was given to come back with further amendments following finalisation of the Baird Review.


The Government released the final report of the Baird Review on 9 March 2010 and indicated a staged approach in responding to its recommendations.  The first phase of legislative changes, passed in March of this year, had a dual focus of risk management and more effective enforcement.  Those amendments also introduced changes to the Ombudsman Act 1976 to extend the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to include students of private registered providers.  Consistent with this staged approach, the Government’s response to the remaining recommendations will be considered in a second phase of legislation to be introduced in the coming months.


The ESOS Act protects Australia’s reputation for delivering quality education services.  It does this by establishing a regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services and through this protects the interests of overseas students through the establishment of minimum standards and providing tuition and financial assurance.  The ESOS Act also complements Australia’s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas.


Unprecedented growth in recent years has led to education becoming one of Australia’s largest export industries, generating in the order of $19 billion annually and supporting around 125,000 jobs across Australia.  In 2000 the number of international student enrolments in Australia was 188,000 which grew to 619,000 in 2010.  Consequently, the growth in the student population has led to significant growth in the number of education providers offering services to international students with over 1,100 providers ranging from large universities and TAFEs, public and private schools, to small private VET and English language providers.


Since its commencement in 2000, the ESOS Act has been amended several times to keep pace with a changing industry and is widely recognised as one of the best legislative frameworks for international education in the world.


The Commonwealth recovers the costs of administering the ESOS Act through compulsory registration fees.  These are charged to all providers wishing to be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS, which allows them to offer courses to overseas students.


The purpose of the Bills I am introducing today is to make amendments to the ESOS Registration Charges Act in response to recommendations from the Baird Review that regulators adopt a risk assessment and management approach to the registration and ongoing monitoring of education providers delivering courses to international students, including the costs to apply at registration and through the period of registration.


The Bills creates a new fee structure focussed on risk to replace the current charging structure for the compulsory annual registration charge payable by CRICOS registered providers.  The new annual registration charge is comprised of a $1,300 base fee, a charge of $10 per student enrolment per year together with a $100 charge for each course registered on CRICOS.  It also includes provision for a flat fee of $1000 in circumstances where a provider has in the past 12 months had action taken against them for non-compliance under section 83 of the ESOS Act.  


Flexibility is afforded for providers that routinely offer courses of less than 13 weeks duration with the introduction of a new provision for each student enrolled in such a course at any time during the year to count as a quarter of an enrolment.  This represents a reduction from the current half an enrolment charge for a course of less than 26 weeks, and addresses issues raised in relation to the existing length of enrolment calculation by providers offering courses of a shorter duration to large numbers of students.  


The rebased annual registration charge is designed to cover the administrative costs of the registration process and reflect the number of courses offered by each provider, as well as the overseas student cohort, in order to more accurately recoup the costs relative to the size of any supervision, compliance or enforcement activity necessary to ensure that only reputable providers are permitted to operate.


The Bills also introduces an entry to market charge payable for the first three years of registration which will replace the current initial registration charge.  A charge of $7,500 will be payable at the time the provider first becomes registered on CRICOS, followed by $5,000 payable at the end of the first anniversary of registration and a further $2,500 at the end of the second anniversary period.


The entry to market charge is designed to recoup the additional costs associated with new applications for registration and the additional supervision required by providers with a shorter history of registration.  Evidence suggests that these providers present a greater risk to the sector, so the new entry to market charge will enable better targeting of compliance efforts and shift the regulatory burden to those providers with the greatest risk to quality, the student experience and the reputation of the sector as a whole.  


Importantly, these Bills provide a regulation-making power to allow the registration charges to be varied for different classes of providers on the basis of their risk profile. Under this proposal providers deemed to present a significantly lower risk to the market may pay a lesser amount or be exempt from the requirement to pay components of the registration charges. It is expected that any providers qualifying for a variation will be subject to rigorous additional quality control processes.  


Overall, the financial impact on providers of a rebased annual registration charge is expected to significantly reduce from its current level.  The rebasing of the charge will result in registration charges paid by the sector reducing from $15 million in 2011 to less than $7 million in 2012.  As there will be an overall reduction of approximately $8 million in the amount collected from the sector as a whole, the majority of existing CRICOS registered providers will experience considerable relief in relation to this charge. Providers representing a greater risk to the market, such as those with a history of non-compliance and new entrants, may pay more under the new arrangements.


Protection and enhancement of Australia’s reputation for providing reliable and high quality education is crucial for both providers and their international students who rely on the strength of an Australian qualification as they further their careers, both here and overseas.


These Bills continue the Government’s support for the industry and its place in the economy through a strengthened regulatory framework for Australia’s education and training export industry.  This follows directly from the Baird Review recommendation and will ensure the long term integrity and viability of this key export industry.


The Government looks forward to bringing the final phase of our response to the Baird Review recommendations later this year.  


Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011


The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011 contains necessary consequential provisions to manage the transition to the new registration charges framework which will give effect to the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill.


The registration charges contained within this Bill will take effect from 2012.


Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011


The Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011 and its two companion Bills will provide a mechanism for the horse industry to meet its obligations under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, and respond to future emergency disease outbreaks affecting the industry. 


Governments and industry beneficiaries have a shared interest in ensuring that an emergency animal disease is brought under control as quickly as possible.


The Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement is a world-first cost sharing arrange­ment that enables Australia to respond quickly and efficiently to emergency animal disease outbreaks. 


It sets out the roles, responsibilities and cost-sharing arrangements for its signatories. Current signatories to the Agreement are the Com­monwealth, all state and territory governments, Animal Health Australia and eleven livestock industries.


Being able to respond quickly minimises the potential impact of an emergency animal disease outbreak on Australia’s agricultural production, valuable exports, the environment and public health. 


Livestock industries also receive considerable benefits from a response to an emergency disease in terms of trade and market access, and through minimisation of livestock and production cost losses.   


If an emergency animal disease outbreak occurs and it is agreed that a national response is required, the Commonwealth will initially meet a signatory industry’s cost-sharing obligations on the basis that the industry will repay the Commonwealth within a reasonable time period. 


Most livestock industries have statutory levies in place to enable them to fund their share of costs of national emergency responses. An emergency animal disease response levy is usually set to zero and only activated when an emergency animal disease incident occurs. 


Some industries have chosen to set a positive operative levy to provide the industry with a fund to respond quickly on its cost-sharing requirements, or to invest funds to increase their biosecurity.


The Australian Horse Industry Council, Equestrian Australia, Harness Racing Australia and the Australian Racing Board signed the Agreement on behalf of the horse industry in March 2011.


To enable it to meet its obligations under the Agreement, the horse industry submitted a levy proposal to the Commonwealth. The proposal requested that zero-rated levies be imposed on manufactured horse feed and worm treatments for horses on the horse industry. 


In developing the proposal, the horse industry undertook extensive consultation, and a range of levy options were discussed at the national, state and local levels of the horse-owning community. The horse industry decided that the simultaneous application of levies on worm treatments and manufactured horse feed would provide the most equitable coverage of the horse industry.


This Bill and its companion Bills provide the framework for these levies to be imposed, and are an important step in enabling the horse industry to manage future emergency animal disease outbreaks.


Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2011


The Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2011 is a companion Bill to the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011. This Bill will provide authority for the Australian Government to collect and administer the horse disease response levies. 


A separate Bill is necessary as the Australian Constitution requires that provisions dealing with the collection and administration of a levy must be in legislation separate from that which imposes the levy itself.


This Bill also includes provision for periodic review of the levy mechanisms. It requires the Minister to ensure that the mechanisms are reviewed every 5 years, unless the levies are active at the time the review is due. If this occurs, the Minister has the option to postpone the review until the levies are set back to zero. The Minister will seek advice from affected parties before determining whether the review should be postponed. 


Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011


The Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 is a companion Bill to the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2011. This Bill will make amendments to the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Act 1996.


These amendments will allow for the Australian Animal Health Council, also known as Animal Health Australia, to hold and manage funds raised by the levies on behalf of the horse industry. It will also authorise Animal Health Australia to meet its own costs in managing the funds.


This arrangement will be similar to arrangements that other livestock industries have in place to fund their liabilities under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-08-23,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:09):  It is good to that we are onto this bill, and may I remind the committee just where we left off. We were examining some of the claims made by the then minister on duty, Senator Farrell, in his less-than-stoic defence in justifying this bill, which will, may I remind you, Madam Temporary Chairman, make it harder for families to afford child care. In his defence of the bill, Senator Farrell—and I am sure, Senator Collins, you will echo this in the talking points you have been given—said that the government took it to an election and that that somehow justifies its implementation or gives it a mandate, if you will. I heard Senator Birmingham, Senator Macdonald, Senator Nash and others detailing why this statement simply cannot stand with any legitimacy. 


At the last election, the Australian people were reminded multiple times by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, as well as the member for Lilley, the Treasurer, Mr Swan, that there would be no carbon tax introduced under a government that they were part of. The Australian people were promised that time and time again. They were told there would be a citizens assembly to reach a consensus on climate change. They were told again and again that there were would be a cash-for-clunkers scheme. I have said to this Senate already that the biggest clunkers are the government themselves. 


The Australian people were never told front and centre in any significant public forum or in any serious policy announcement that there was going to be a restriction on their ability to access child care. If any platitudes were mouthed in this area, it was about how the government was going to make child care more accessible and more affordable. It was about doing all of those sorts of things. There was no suggestion of such a claim in Prime Minister Gillard's then unscripted statements—I wish Hansard could pick up sarcasm, because that is what I mean by 'unscripted'; it was another downright misleading untruth—at the national launch of the Labor campaign. I do not recall Prime Minister Gillard saying, 'We are going to set a cap for the childcare rebate at $7,500 per annum and suspend the indexation of that rebate until 2014.' I do not recall that. I look to be reminded of the exact words that Ms Gillard said at the national campaign launch, for which we were all glued to our seats because she was speaking as the real Julia rather than the fake Julia, without any notes except the notes there were actually on the podium and only exposed later on. 



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  It could well have been the 'fake real Julia' or the 'real fake Julia' as Senator Birmingham said. What we do know is the real damage this legislation will cause families. There are 20,700 families by the coalition's estimates, and more according to the Greens, who will be affected by this legislation. Do you think they are going to feel uplifted and benefited by this? I do not think so. What is the purpose of it? This government has misspent so much of the taxpayers' money. It has squandered it. It has thrown it around like the proverbial drunken sailor—and that is an insult to sailors, and I apologise to them—and this bill is going to save a paltry $86 million over four years by making it harder for Australian families. 


Now I know it is very easy for members of the Labor Party to be removed from the day-to-day realities of life when they have slush funds and union funds to draw upon through credit cards and a whole range of things like that, but I feel it is my responsibility to remind those on the other side of the chamber, those in the government, that Australian families are doing it tough; they are doing it very tough. Sometimes they are forced to have both parents out at work and so we have this sentiment that child care is an important part of empowering families to be able to make ends meet, yet it is not without flaws, and I have said this repeatedly. Institutionalised child care is something we should be mindful of; it is not always the best option for families. But, nonetheless, it is there and it deserves the support of the taxpayers of Australia. 



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I take that point, Senator Hanson-Young. I absolutely agree with you. Some people do not have much choice, and I am about giving people choices in this area—I really am. I do not want to see us railroaded down one particular route where people are unable to access other forms of child care, including being able to afford to have a parent stay at home. It is a wonderful sacrifice, and I said that in my first speech. But I make the point that this bill also reduces the incentives for family day care centres and things of that nature to start up. It removes the benefits and the incentives, and that deprives people of choice. Senator Hanson-Young and I would not agree on every aspect of choice and every aspect of life—that would be an understatement of great proportions. But for somebody to be right somebody has to be wrong as well, and we can have that debate at some other time.


The point is that, with something as valuable to our future generations as caring for them, we want to make that care as amenable and as successful as possible. I recall that Senator Farrell said the government was going to spend $20 billion in this expanded area, but there is a legitimate concern that if you are going to spend $20 billion—20,000 million dollars, money that the government clearly does not have; it is going to borrow it—why are we trying to save this relatively paltry $86 million over four years? It would hardly pay the booze bill at the Lodge. Some 20,000 families will face a cap on their childcare rebate, with no chance of any increase whatsoever over the next four years. That strikes me as the wrong approach to take. 


I know the Labor Party are desperate to claim some fiscal credibility but I think we are going to have to accept that they should wash their hands of that ambition—any credibility they may have had is just not going to be resurrected. Even with Labor's own personal desire to reclaim power at any cost, why would anyone penalise families? This is just a sense of social justice. I do not think I have used that term before, ever, but it makes me feel deeply uncomfortable that Australian families who are already doing it so very tough can be affected in this way. I think we have to agree on that, and I will look for an acknowledgement in Senator Collins's response that Australian families are doing it very tough. They are doing it very tough, particularly with food prices going up, electricity costs rising enormously and job security decreasing in the current environment, as we saw yesterday with the 1,000 jobs being lost from the BlueSteel plant.


As well, we have these great threats of additional imposts—the first of which is the mineral resource rent tax or whatever its latest incarnation is. It will divert investment in this country and suck money out of the productive economy into perhaps the most unproductive government we have ever seen. I remind the Senate and the good people of Australia that the government swore that the carbon tax would never be introduced until there was community consensus. Of course there is always community consensus for the Labor Party because if you disagree with them you are labelled a crank or an extremist or irrelevant or something like that. We heard about the convoy of no consequence—they are all very good at platitudes and sayings and demeaning others, but the fact is this: the government promised not to introduce a carbon tax and now one has been introduced and is likely to get up. That is going to put increasing pressure on Australian families. I think Senator Collins knows instinctively that this is a tax on electricity. I do not know whether she has tried to spend a day without electricity, but I cannot imagine it would be very pleasant. I deliver meals on wheels and I see people who struggle to pay the bills to heat their homes, particularly in winter. It is dreadfully disappointing to see people forced into circumstances where they have to sit with blankets on them rather than have the heater on. I guess there are some who are a obeying the government's propaganda to cuddle your pet rather than turn the heating on. That strikes me as unusual because many pensioners and families out there who are doing it tough can hardly afford to feed themselves so I do not know how they can afford to feed a pet they can cuddle to keep them warm, as the government propaganda suggests. But that is another topic. What we are establishing here is that families are doing it extraordinarily tough, not only with the price of food and electricity but also with the normal utilities. Labor administrations around the country are ramping up prices and taxes—whatever they see they try to grab and spend. Unfortunately this government is no different. I will be the first to acknowledge that fiscal prudence is a virtue in any government and that there need to be effective measures to cut costs, waste and spending, particularly in a spendthrift government like this. But there also need to be priorities. Priorities, in my view, should revolve around the primacy of the family. You do not disable or disempower families by restricting their options and availability for such paltry sums. To the men and women of Australia, $86 million over four years is a lot of money. In terms of the waste under this government it is not, but to the men and women of Australia it is a lot of money, and they are concerned that this government is wasting billions and yet trying to penalise them for that $86 million. It might not seem much when it rolls off the tongue of Senator Farrell and others that it is only $8 or $9 a week. That is notwithstanding the fact that—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator Collins, maybe you can answer this question. The other analysis done by industry experts suggests that it is somewhere between $12 and $23 a week. Rather than the lines that were just given back to me, I would be interested in the justification for why no serious, competent analysis was done other than the single scenario that was put forward by Access Economics which said Australian families would be $8 a week worse off. As I said, $8 a week does not sound much when you are wasting billions, but $8 a week can mean the difference between having a full belly and not having a full belly. It is the difference between receiving a Meals on Wheels delivery one day and not receiving one another day.


These are the sorts of issues that Australians are worried about and yet they see a government that does not seem to care. This is a real problem. It is a government that sees no real cause for concern about tomorrow with what they are starting. Every time you create a snowball and you push it down a hill, it gets bigger and bigger. And their disasters keep getting bigger and bigger.


There were a number of submissions on this that said that the cost of child care will continue to rise from the national quality agenda measures which will quite simply increase overheads for childcare centres. Even some unions have said that without alternative allocation of funding the proportion of affected families will certainly increase over subsequent years.


Senator Collins, I know you probably were not paying attention to the debate before but I want to remind you of the scenario we were dealing with and the picture that had been painted. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed in the responses I got on the serious concerns of Australian families. I really would like to know why there was no additional modelling undertaken. I would like to know how saving $86 million and penalising families that need and rely on this support is in our national interest given that you are squandering billions of dollars elsewhere. Senator Collins, this is the challenge for you: come clean on the broadcast. Come clean with the Australian people. Let them know exactly why you are adding an $8 a week burden to their childcare costs now and why it is going to rise further in the future. Also, please explain to them how you can justify this given that you are going to be slugging them with a terrible carbon tax that will increase the cost of almost everything else they use. Might I remind you that that was a tax that you went to the last election, as did your entire team, promising never to introduce. While you are at it, you could explain why the Australian people should be able to rely on what you tell them now when it has been so demonstrably apparent that they cannot rely on anything else this government has ever said.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:24):  I would like to formally withdraw the amendment that has been circulated by me on behalf of the Greens. This was an amendment that was circulated some 12 months ago and it was going to amend this legislation to ensure that we could deliver fortnightly payments in order to ensure that parents could access the child care rebate fortnightly as opposed to quarterly. But of course since this amendment has been circulated the government has introduced a separate piece of legislation to do exactly that. Thankfully, this place has been able to pass that legislation so parents can access that. It started as of 1 July this year. So there is no need for the amendment, and I formally withdraw it.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:25):  by leave—Despite discussion during the committee stage, I understand we need to formally move the government amendments. I move government amendments (1) to (4) on sheet BM231 together:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 9 and 10), omit paragraph 84F(1)(e), substitute:


   (e)   for the income year ending on 30 June 2011—$7,941; and


   (ea)   for each of the income years ending on 30 June 2012, 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014—$7,500; and


(2)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 18), omit “1 July 2010,”.


(3)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 20), omit “1 July 2010”, substitute “1 July 2011”.


(4)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 22), omit “1 July 2011,”.


These amendments seek to change the start date of the measure from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2011. As Senator Hanson-Young highlighted, it has been before the Senate for quite some time. This will ensure that the legislation is not retrospectively applied into the 2010-11 financial year and that we do not need to reclaim childcare rebate payments paid to families. 


I take this opportunity to reiterate that the average childcare rebate claim is below $2,100, well under the cap of $7,500, meaning that the overwhelming majority of families will not be affected by this measure. In 2011-12 we expect more than 95 per cent of families will have no change—I stress no change—to their assistance. This measure will not affect the vast majority of families but will provide funding for essential improvements to the quality of care for Australia's children. Following some of the earlier remarks from Senator Bernardi, I can stress that the savings produced by this measure will be directly reinvested into delivering the national quality framework and thus improving the quality of care that families are experiencing.


For a family to reach the cap of $7,500, they would need to be paying for care for at least 10 hours a day for more than four days a week at average fee levels. The average use of child care in Australia is much lower, with most parents using around 2½ days of care a week. The most recent childcare rebate information shows claims of less than $2,100, well below the cap of $7,500. We expect that fewer than one per cent of families using child care, who earn less than $100,000 a year, will be impacted. Most importantly, as I have stressed, the measure produces savings to be directly reinvested in delivering the national quality framework. It will also help fund our $59.4 million investment in improving the quality of around 140 budget based funded early childhood services located in rural and remote Australia that provide care to some of Australia's most vulnerable children.


Perhaps I might also use this opportunity to stress a few further points, following Senator Bernardi's contribution—at least so far as it related to these particular measures. Apart from what seems to be a fairly obvious filibuster, Senator Bernardi is seeking to use this opportunity to attack Labor's record on affordability. The affordability issues in child care are critical and are very important, and Labor's record here is quite strong. Let me highlight that over the next four years, as I think Senator Farrell mentioned earlier, our government will provide a record $20.1 billion in childcare assistance for families. It is important to contrast this figure with what occurred under the Howard government. This is more than double the funding for direct assistance that was provided in the last four years of the Howard government. So for Senator Bernardi to talk about the pressures being faced by families—and we certainly do acknowledge that there are some significant cost-of-living pressures faced by some families—and to seek to use childcare assistance as a means of making that point is almost laughable.


The boost in funding is a direct result of delivering on our commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses and of increasing the maximum limit for each child from $4,354 under the Howard government to $7,500. Remember that distinction: $4,354 under the Howard government and our cap, which will be $7,500 a year. This 72 per cent increase in the rebate has assisted more than 735,000 Australian families to pay for their child care since 1 July 2008. The proportion of family income is perhaps the most critical point when we are talking about cost of living expenses and the cost of child care, as we know from some of the modelling and other data available to us since becoming far more transparent about childcare costs and funding arrangements. We know that the proportion of the family income being spent on childcare out-of-pocket costs has almost halved since 2004, dropping from 13 per cent to just seven per cent in 2010 for families with one child in care and earning less than $75,000 per year. Rather than those measures that seem to be plucked out of the air by Senator Bernardi, such as the $8 per week increase in childcare fees, the most critical figure for Australian families is what the out-of-pocket expense is for them. We know that that has decreased from 13 per cent under the Howard government to seven per cent last year.


The other important issue that Australian families are most sympathetic about is the quality of child care, and that is what this measure targets. We are not reducing overall spending in child care; we are generating a small amount of savings to ensure that the support to deliver the National Quality Framework is there and that it will deliver better quality care. I would ask any senator to contemplate the questions that I often ask families with children in child care: if you had a child under two years of age, would you prefer a five-to-one carer-child ratio or a four-to-one carer-child ratio, and would you be prepared to pay a marginal amount more to increase that level of care? Almost unanimously, those families I discuss this issue with say yes. This issue around the quality of care is extremely important.


There was one final issue in Senator Bernardi's remarks that I would like to clarify because it is relevant to these amendments—that is, the amendments mean that the paused indexation is now only for three years and not four years. To correct the record, Senator Bernardi was reading from an old copy of the bill and his figure of $86 million is now $81 million.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:33):  I thank the parliamentary secretary for her answer. I appreciate that you are now here, Senator Collins. Senator Farrell admirably tried to answer questions in your place and I am sure that the answers he gave us were entirely consistent with those that you would have given us if you had been here.


Senator Collins, you raised the issue of families being prepared to pay a little more. Just to enlighten you, some of the discussion we had a little earlier was about the fact that if the government had not mismanaged the economy so badly it would not have to use child care as a cash cow to fund the National Quality Framework. I noted in your contribution that you were espousing the funding that was going towards the National Quality Framework. Interestingly, according to the government's own budget website, the $59.4 million you referred to for budget based funded early childhood services is not for new services; the funding is to help them meet the national quality standards that you are talking about. I just wanted to clarify this because it certainly seemed that it was like an extra bucket of funding that was going to be raining down from the sky.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  By way of assistance, I note we had a discussion with the minister earlier around what consultation had taken place with the sector and also with families in the community. The minister was asked a couple of times about that. Unfortunately he was unable to provide the Senate with an answer about the consultation that had taken place but he did, from his point of view, try to assure the Senate that indeed this was a policy that had been taken to the election, that before the election people were very clear that this was a government policy and that they were well aware of that before the election. 'Before the election,' I think he said, 'we consulted with the Australian people,' through the information that was available to them before the election, 'on this particular piece of legislation.' Perhaps though it might be useful for the chamber, given the government's election policies, that I quote into the Hansard that it said 'it will reintroduce the indexation of the childcare rebate to help eligible families meet their childcare costs and the childcare rebate covers 50 per cent of out-of-pocket childcare expenses for approved child care' up to the annual cap of $7,500. That is from the government's own election document prior to 2010. My understanding of that would be there was no indication at all to the broader community that that was actually going to be a change to the current policy—going back to Senator Farrell's comments earlier that people were well informed—and also it would seem that at that point in 2010 there was not an annual cap of $7,500, and indeed that is only going to come in if this legislation passes.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:36):  Perhaps I should start by going back to some of the earlier comments by Senator Nash and come to that final question in a moment. Childcare funding is not a cash cow. I am astounded that she would even use an expression such as that when we are dealing with affordability and cost-of-living pressures being faced by families. What this measure seeks to do, as has been covered on many other occasions, is reconfigure existing funding to help ensure that the quality of child care available to families is improved. Certainly this measure does involve saving measures. This measure was government policy at the last election and the minister spoke at several community childcare forums during the election period with parents and childcare workers about the changes. This proposed measure was contained in the 2010-11 budget papers. The minister meets regularly with representatives of the childcare sector including the Childcare Alliance, the Australian Early Childhood Association, Family Day Care Australia and United Voice. All of the sector has been committed to the national quality framework. Indeed, these measures have been discussed and consulted on during countless forums relevant to the national quality framework.


But I need to stress again that what the government is doing here is going to impact on less than one per cent of families with a relatively limited impact to ensure, being fiscally responsible, that we reconfigure existing spending to support and drive the changes in childcare quality that are necessary to deliver good services for Australia's families and children. We have not suggested in any sense that the moneys being accounted for here relate to any new services or the delivery of new services but, rather, to assist existing services make the transition to providing better quality care.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-08-23,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:39):  I note the somewhat tone of umbrage the minister used when referring to my comments on a cash cow. I think that is exactly what it is. If you need to take money from something to pay to something else that thing is providing you cash. In this particular instance it is the changes to the childcare rebate and the costs associated being borne by families that are providing that cash. Senator Farrell indicated earlier that that was indeed the case, that it was indeed a savings measure, as you have just mentioned, Minister. It is interesting to note—as you say, it is important to be financially responsible—that the parents who are going to have to bear the burden of the increase would say that, if the government had been financially responsible, they would not need to make any changes at all to the current childcare rebate to be able to access funding for other measures. That is the point, Minister, and it has been raised very clearly in this place—that the reason you need to find the funding stream, the savings measures, indeed from the childcare rebate itself, is the government's mismanagement of the finances. Again, Senator Collins was not here earlier, so to assist: I drew the analogy that the government had wasted $80.9 million administering an emissions trading scheme which does not even exist. Perhaps if that had not happened the $81 million could have been used for this purpose. It is ironic that the figures are almost identical. That is what concerns people.


You have indicated the importance of the childcare sector and these measures. Perhaps the minister might inform the chamber of the importance the government is placing on this particular area. Labor's own website talks about policies and their comprehensive agenda, and of the 51 items on that comprehensive agenda to take Australia forward not one mentions child care. Not one of 51 policy issues on the Labor govern­ment's own website mentions child care. Yet we have those on the other side trying to say how important this issue is. There are 51 policy areas and child care does not rate a mention.


To give the government the benefit of the doubt, I saw at the bottom of this, 'More information on Labor government initiatives'. So I thought I would go to that and that maybe it is hidden further down. Interestingly, no. It did not even rate a mention under 'Fresh ideas for work and family', which was apparently about financial assistance for small business, I think it was, to balance work and family. The only enlightenment I got from reading that, Senator Williams, was the fact that there was no more money available and that it had actually shut.


In all of this website there is absolutely nothing on policies for child care. Given that prior to the election, as Senator Farrell was saying earlier, this was all very clear in the minds of people out there in the community, perhaps the minister might like to give us more information—and I thank you because it is the first information we have had about the community consultation. How many forums were held and roughly where across the country? I am genuinely interested just to get the spread of where that community consultation took place.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:43):  I do not know the basis for Senator Nash's computer searches or internet searches on the Labor Party's website, nor indeed the processes she undertook to reach that figure of 51 policy areas, but I can say from my former experience—



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I am not sure it would assist because it does not necessarily guide us in the nature of the process you went through or indeed what information you potentially avoided to achieve that figure.




Senator Nash:
  On a point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman: this might help the minister be a little more relevant because it is self-explanatory as to where it came from.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
):  It is not a relevant point of order. We will continue to the end of the contribution and then you may seek to table the document.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I know from my experience that you can trawl through the internet and achieve all sorts of complexions. It is a bit like doing social research; it really depends on what questions you are asking, where you are looking and how you conflate what you have.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The main point here—once Senator Nash quietens down—is that it is fairly obvious, from what Senator Nash is putting before us now and her questions about wanting detailed information on consultation of measures that have been before us for well over 12 months, that she is seeking to extend this discussion for some reason I cannot necessarily comprehend. Perhaps it relates to the coalition's former record on children's policy that I can recall from my days as a shadow minister. If we are going to make comparisons—and I will not allow myself to be provoked into a discussion of this nature for too long—I seem to remember Larry Anthony and a national agenda for children that never surfaced despite five years of discussion about the Howard government having a national agenda for children. 


What we do know, what I have said before and what is very clear is that Labor has a very strong record of childcare affordability. The proportion of family income being spent on childcare out-of-pocket expenses has almost halved from 13 per cent down to seven per cent. Families see this; families know the level of support that they have been receiving from the government in child care. I can see the comparisons between what was available when I had young children and the support that families are receiving today. This is perhaps the most stark issue in trying to understand why the opposition is seeking to delay dealing with this matter. Again and again, we get stories about, 'It is going to cost more; there will be problems,' but why this opposition is steadfast in seeking to delay improvements in the quality agenda—the carer-to-child ratio for young children—astounds me. I really think, Senator Nash, you need to reconsider occupying the chamber's time with questions and information which is deliberately designed to protract this debate.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:47):  I did not realise that Senator Collins had actually managed to morph and pop herself inside my head and see why I am asking these questions. Apparently, she has a very good handle on exactly what I am doing on this side of the chamber. Unfortunately, she is incorrect. I have a genuine interest in this issue and I think it is quite appropriate during a committee stage to ask questions. If you do not want the scrutiny, that is up to you, but it is entirely appropriate in the committee stage to ask questions for as long as it takes to get the answers that satisfy senators. You know that very well, Minister, as everyone else does in this chamber. We often have committee processes in this place that go for a very long time. 


I have a very genuine interest in this. Like you, I have older children who were young once, and I have a very genuine interest in how this is going to impact on families in the community. If Senator Farrell had been able to give us more detailed answers earlier in regard to the consultation process and what had happened, perhaps we might be a little further through the process. Through no fault of his own, I am sure, he was not able to provide the committee with that. I am not going to apologise for standing here for a period of time and asking questions on behalf of Australian families about the rationale and the consultation behind it. There are other questions that are still to be asked. I am sorry, Minister, if you do not particularly want to be here and would prefer to be somewhere else, but this is the nature of the committee stage of legislation. 


The question I ask for clarification relates to amendment (1) on sheet BM231, paragraph 84F(1)(e), to substitute 'for the income year ending on 30 June 2011—$7,941'. That is an amendment to the existing legislation which previously was $7,500. Could you indicate to the chamber the reason for that change and am I correct in assuming that the reason for the change is that, from 1 July this year, the $7½ thousand threshold may already have been increased?

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-08-23,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:09):  It is good to that we are onto this bill, and may I remind the committee just where we left off. We were examining some of the claims made by the then minister on duty, Senator Farrell, in his less-than-stoic defence in justifying this bill, which will, may I remind you, Madam Temporary Chairman, make it harder for families to afford child care. In his defence of the bill, Senator Farrell—and I am sure, Senator Collins, you will echo this in the talking points you have been given—said that the government took it to an election and that that somehow justifies its implementation or gives it a mandate, if you will. I heard Senator Birmingham, Senator Macdonald, Senator Nash and others detailing why this statement simply cannot stand with any legitimacy. 


At the last election, the Australian people were reminded multiple times by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, as well as the member for Lilley, the Treasurer, Mr Swan, that there would be no carbon tax introduced under a government that they were part of. The Australian people were promised that time and time again. They were told there would be a citizens assembly to reach a consensus on climate change. They were told again and again that there were would be a cash-for-clunkers scheme. I have said to this Senate already that the biggest clunkers are the government themselves. 


The Australian people were never told front and centre in any significant public forum or in any serious policy announcement that there was going to be a restriction on their ability to access child care. If any platitudes were mouthed in this area, it was about how the government was going to make child care more accessible and more affordable. It was about doing all of those sorts of things. There was no suggestion of such a claim in Prime Minister Gillard's then unscripted statements—I wish Hansard could pick up sarcasm, because that is what I mean by 'unscripted'; it was another downright misleading untruth—at the national launch of the Labor campaign. I do not recall Prime Minister Gillard saying, 'We are going to set a cap for the childcare rebate at $7,500 per annum and suspend the indexation of that rebate until 2014.' I do not recall that. I look to be reminded of the exact words that Ms Gillard said at the national campaign launch, for which we were all glued to our seats because she was speaking as the real Julia rather than the fake Julia, without any notes except the notes there were actually on the podium and only exposed later on. 



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  It could well have been the 'fake real Julia' or the 'real fake Julia' as Senator Birmingham said. What we do know is the real damage this legislation will cause families. There are 20,700 families by the coalition's estimates, and more according to the Greens, who will be affected by this legislation. Do you think they are going to feel uplifted and benefited by this? I do not think so. What is the purpose of it? This government has misspent so much of the taxpayers' money. It has squandered it. It has thrown it around like the proverbial drunken sailor—and that is an insult to sailors, and I apologise to them—and this bill is going to save a paltry $86 million over four years by making it harder for Australian families. 


Now I know it is very easy for members of the Labor Party to be removed from the day-to-day realities of life when they have slush funds and union funds to draw upon through credit cards and a whole range of things like that, but I feel it is my responsibility to remind those on the other side of the chamber, those in the government, that Australian families are doing it tough; they are doing it very tough. Sometimes they are forced to have both parents out at work and so we have this sentiment that child care is an important part of empowering families to be able to make ends meet, yet it is not without flaws, and I have said this repeatedly. Institutionalised child care is something we should be mindful of; it is not always the best option for families. But, nonetheless, it is there and it deserves the support of the taxpayers of Australia. 



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I take that point, Senator Hanson-Young. I absolutely agree with you. Some people do not have much choice, and I am about giving people choices in this area—I really am. I do not want to see us railroaded down one particular route where people are unable to access other forms of child care, including being able to afford to have a parent stay at home. It is a wonderful sacrifice, and I said that in my first speech. But I make the point that this bill also reduces the incentives for family day care centres and things of that nature to start up. It removes the benefits and the incentives, and that deprives people of choice. Senator Hanson-Young and I would not agree on every aspect of choice and every aspect of life—that would be an understatement of great proportions. But for somebody to be right somebody has to be wrong as well, and we can have that debate at some other time.


The point is that, with something as valuable to our future generations as caring for them, we want to make that care as amenable and as successful as possible. I recall that Senator Farrell said the government was going to spend $20 billion in this expanded area, but there is a legitimate concern that if you are going to spend $20 billion—20,000 million dollars, money that the government clearly does not have; it is going to borrow it—why are we trying to save this relatively paltry $86 million over four years? It would hardly pay the booze bill at the Lodge. Some 20,000 families will face a cap on their childcare rebate, with no chance of any increase whatsoever over the next four years. That strikes me as the wrong approach to take. 


I know the Labor Party are desperate to claim some fiscal credibility but I think we are going to have to accept that they should wash their hands of that ambition—any credibility they may have had is just not going to be resurrected. Even with Labor's own personal desire to reclaim power at any cost, why would anyone penalise families? This is just a sense of social justice. I do not think I have used that term before, ever, but it makes me feel deeply uncomfortable that Australian families who are already doing it so very tough can be affected in this way. I think we have to agree on that, and I will look for an acknowledgement in Senator Collins's response that Australian families are doing it very tough. They are doing it very tough, particularly with food prices going up, electricity costs rising enormously and job security decreasing in the current environment, as we saw yesterday with the 1,000 jobs being lost from the BlueSteel plant.


As well, we have these great threats of additional imposts—the first of which is the mineral resource rent tax or whatever its latest incarnation is. It will divert investment in this country and suck money out of the productive economy into perhaps the most unproductive government we have ever seen. I remind the Senate and the good people of Australia that the government swore that the carbon tax would never be introduced until there was community consensus. Of course there is always community consensus for the Labor Party because if you disagree with them you are labelled a crank or an extremist or irrelevant or something like that. We heard about the convoy of no consequence—they are all very good at platitudes and sayings and demeaning others, but the fact is this: the government promised not to introduce a carbon tax and now one has been introduced and is likely to get up. That is going to put increasing pressure on Australian families. I think Senator Collins knows instinctively that this is a tax on electricity. I do not know whether she has tried to spend a day without electricity, but I cannot imagine it would be very pleasant. I deliver meals on wheels and I see people who struggle to pay the bills to heat their homes, particularly in winter. It is dreadfully disappointing to see people forced into circumstances where they have to sit with blankets on them rather than have the heater on. I guess there are some who are a obeying the government's propaganda to cuddle your pet rather than turn the heating on. That strikes me as unusual because many pensioners and families out there who are doing it tough can hardly afford to feed themselves so I do not know how they can afford to feed a pet they can cuddle to keep them warm, as the government propaganda suggests. But that is another topic. What we are establishing here is that families are doing it extraordinarily tough, not only with the price of food and electricity but also with the normal utilities. Labor administrations around the country are ramping up prices and taxes—whatever they see they try to grab and spend. Unfortunately this government is no different. I will be the first to acknowledge that fiscal prudence is a virtue in any government and that there need to be effective measures to cut costs, waste and spending, particularly in a spendthrift government like this. But there also need to be priorities. Priorities, in my view, should revolve around the primacy of the family. You do not disable or disempower families by restricting their options and availability for such paltry sums. To the men and women of Australia, $86 million over four years is a lot of money. In terms of the waste under this government it is not, but to the men and women of Australia it is a lot of money, and they are concerned that this government is wasting billions and yet trying to penalise them for that $86 million. It might not seem much when it rolls off the tongue of Senator Farrell and others that it is only $8 or $9 a week. That is notwithstanding the fact that—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator Collins, maybe you can answer this question. The other analysis done by industry experts suggests that it is somewhere between $12 and $23 a week. Rather than the lines that were just given back to me, I would be interested in the justification for why no serious, competent analysis was done other than the single scenario that was put forward by Access Economics which said Australian families would be $8 a week worse off. As I said, $8 a week does not sound much when you are wasting billions, but $8 a week can mean the difference between having a full belly and not having a full belly. It is the difference between receiving a Meals on Wheels delivery one day and not receiving one another day.


These are the sorts of issues that Australians are worried about and yet they see a government that does not seem to care. This is a real problem. It is a government that sees no real cause for concern about tomorrow with what they are starting. Every time you create a snowball and you push it down a hill, it gets bigger and bigger. And their disasters keep getting bigger and bigger.


There were a number of submissions on this that said that the cost of child care will continue to rise from the national quality agenda measures which will quite simply increase overheads for childcare centres. Even some unions have said that without alternative allocation of funding the proportion of affected families will certainly increase over subsequent years.


Senator Collins, I know you probably were not paying attention to the debate before but I want to remind you of the scenario we were dealing with and the picture that had been painted. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed in the responses I got on the serious concerns of Australian families. I really would like to know why there was no additional modelling undertaken. I would like to know how saving $86 million and penalising families that need and rely on this support is in our national interest given that you are squandering billions of dollars elsewhere. Senator Collins, this is the challenge for you: come clean on the broadcast. Come clean with the Australian people. Let them know exactly why you are adding an $8 a week burden to their childcare costs now and why it is going to rise further in the future. Also, please explain to them how you can justify this given that you are going to be slugging them with a terrible carbon tax that will increase the cost of almost everything else they use. Might I remind you that that was a tax that you went to the last election, as did your entire team, promising never to introduce. While you are at it, you could explain why the Australian people should be able to rely on what you tell them now when it has been so demonstrably apparent that they cannot rely on anything else this government has ever said.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:24):  I would like to formally withdraw the amendment that has been circulated by me on behalf of the Greens. This was an amendment that was circulated some 12 months ago and it was going to amend this legislation to ensure that we could deliver fortnightly payments in order to ensure that parents could access the child care rebate fortnightly as opposed to quarterly. But of course since this amendment has been circulated the government has introduced a separate piece of legislation to do exactly that. Thankfully, this place has been able to pass that legislation so parents can access that. It started as of 1 July this year. So there is no need for the amendment, and I formally withdraw it.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:25):  by leave—Despite discussion during the committee stage, I understand we need to formally move the government amendments. I move government amendments (1) to (4) on sheet BM231 together:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 9 and 10), omit paragraph 84F(1)(e), substitute:


   (e)   for the income year ending on 30 June 2011—$7,941; and


   (ea)   for each of the income years ending on 30 June 2012, 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014—$7,500; and


(2)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 18), omit “1 July 2010,”.


(3)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 20), omit “1 July 2010”, substitute “1 July 2011”.


(4)   Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 22), omit “1 July 2011,”.


These amendments seek to change the start date of the measure from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2011. As Senator Hanson-Young highlighted, it has been before the Senate for quite some time. This will ensure that the legislation is not retrospectively applied into the 2010-11 financial year and that we do not need to reclaim childcare rebate payments paid to families. 


I take this opportunity to reiterate that the average childcare rebate claim is below $2,100, well under the cap of $7,500, meaning that the overwhelming majority of families will not be affected by this measure. In 2011-12 we expect more than 95 per cent of families will have no change—I stress no change—to their assistance. This measure will not affect the vast majority of families but will provide funding for essential improvements to the quality of care for Australia's children. Following some of the earlier remarks from Senator Bernardi, I can stress that the savings produced by this measure will be directly reinvested into delivering the national quality framework and thus improving the quality of care that families are experiencing.


For a family to reach the cap of $7,500, they would need to be paying for care for at least 10 hours a day for more than four days a week at average fee levels. The average use of child care in Australia is much lower, with most parents using around 2½ days of care a week. The most recent childcare rebate information shows claims of less than $2,100, well below the cap of $7,500. We expect that fewer than one per cent of families using child care, who earn less than $100,000 a year, will be impacted. Most importantly, as I have stressed, the measure produces savings to be directly reinvested in delivering the national quality framework. It will also help fund our $59.4 million investment in improving the quality of around 140 budget based funded early childhood services located in rural and remote Australia that provide care to some of Australia's most vulnerable children.


Perhaps I might also use this opportunity to stress a few further points, following Senator Bernardi's contribution—at least so far as it related to these particular measures. Apart from what seems to be a fairly obvious filibuster, Senator Bernardi is seeking to use this opportunity to attack Labor's record on affordability. The affordability issues in child care are critical and are very important, and Labor's record here is quite strong. Let me highlight that over the next four years, as I think Senator Farrell mentioned earlier, our government will provide a record $20.1 billion in childcare assistance for families. It is important to contrast this figure with what occurred under the Howard government. This is more than double the funding for direct assistance that was provided in the last four years of the Howard government. So for Senator Bernardi to talk about the pressures being faced by families—and we certainly do acknowledge that there are some significant cost-of-living pressures faced by some families—and to seek to use childcare assistance as a means of making that point is almost laughable.


The boost in funding is a direct result of delivering on our commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses and of increasing the maximum limit for each child from $4,354 under the Howard government to $7,500. Remember that distinction: $4,354 under the Howard government and our cap, which will be $7,500 a year. This 72 per cent increase in the rebate has assisted more than 735,000 Australian families to pay for their child care since 1 July 2008. The proportion of family income is perhaps the most critical point when we are talking about cost of living expenses and the cost of child care, as we know from some of the modelling and other data available to us since becoming far more transparent about childcare costs and funding arrangements. We know that the proportion of the family income being spent on childcare out-of-pocket costs has almost halved since 2004, dropping from 13 per cent to just seven per cent in 2010 for families with one child in care and earning less than $75,000 per year. Rather than those measures that seem to be plucked out of the air by Senator Bernardi, such as the $8 per week increase in childcare fees, the most critical figure for Australian families is what the out-of-pocket expense is for them. We know that that has decreased from 13 per cent under the Howard government to seven per cent last year.


The other important issue that Australian families are most sympathetic about is the quality of child care, and that is what this measure targets. We are not reducing overall spending in child care; we are generating a small amount of savings to ensure that the support to deliver the National Quality Framework is there and that it will deliver better quality care. I would ask any senator to contemplate the questions that I often ask families with children in child care: if you had a child under two years of age, would you prefer a five-to-one carer-child ratio or a four-to-one carer-child ratio, and would you be prepared to pay a marginal amount more to increase that level of care? Almost unanimously, those families I discuss this issue with say yes. This issue around the quality of care is extremely important.


There was one final issue in Senator Bernardi's remarks that I would like to clarify because it is relevant to these amendments—that is, the amendments mean that the paused indexation is now only for three years and not four years. To correct the record, Senator Bernardi was reading from an old copy of the bill and his figure of $86 million is now $81 million.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:33):  I thank the parliamentary secretary for her answer. I appreciate that you are now here, Senator Collins. Senator Farrell admirably tried to answer questions in your place and I am sure that the answers he gave us were entirely consistent with those that you would have given us if you had been here.


Senator Collins, you raised the issue of families being prepared to pay a little more. Just to enlighten you, some of the discussion we had a little earlier was about the fact that if the government had not mismanaged the economy so badly it would not have to use child care as a cash cow to fund the National Quality Framework. I noted in your contribution that you were espousing the funding that was going towards the National Quality Framework. Interestingly, according to the government's own budget website, the $59.4 million you referred to for budget based funded early childhood services is not for new services; the funding is to help them meet the national quality standards that you are talking about. I just wanted to clarify this because it certainly seemed that it was like an extra bucket of funding that was going to be raining down from the sky.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  By way of assistance, I note we had a discussion with the minister earlier around what consultation had taken place with the sector and also with families in the community. The minister was asked a couple of times about that. Unfortunately he was unable to provide the Senate with an answer about the consultation that had taken place but he did, from his point of view, try to assure the Senate that indeed this was a policy that had been taken to the election, that before the election people were very clear that this was a government policy and that they were well aware of that before the election. 'Before the election,' I think he said, 'we consulted with the Australian people,' through the information that was available to them before the election, 'on this particular piece of legislation.' Perhaps though it might be useful for the chamber, given the government's election policies, that I quote into the Hansard that it said 'it will reintroduce the indexation of the childcare rebate to help eligible families meet their childcare costs and the childcare rebate covers 50 per cent of out-of-pocket childcare expenses for approved child care' up to the annual cap of $7,500. That is from the government's own election document prior to 2010. My understanding of that would be there was no indication at all to the broader community that that was actually going to be a change to the current policy—going back to Senator Farrell's comments earlier that people were well informed—and also it would seem that at that point in 2010 there was not an annual cap of $7,500, and indeed that is only going to come in if this legislation passes.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:36):  Perhaps I should start by going back to some of the earlier comments by Senator Nash and come to that final question in a moment. Childcare funding is not a cash cow. I am astounded that she would even use an expression such as that when we are dealing with affordability and cost-of-living pressures being faced by families. What this measure seeks to do, as has been covered on many other occasions, is reconfigure existing funding to help ensure that the quality of child care available to families is improved. Certainly this measure does involve saving measures. This measure was government policy at the last election and the minister spoke at several community childcare forums during the election period with parents and childcare workers about the changes. This proposed measure was contained in the 2010-11 budget papers. The minister meets regularly with representatives of the childcare sector including the Childcare Alliance, the Australian Early Childhood Association, Family Day Care Australia and United Voice. All of the sector has been committed to the national quality framework. Indeed, these measures have been discussed and consulted on during countless forums relevant to the national quality framework.


But I need to stress again that what the government is doing here is going to impact on less than one per cent of families with a relatively limited impact to ensure, being fiscally responsible, that we reconfigure existing spending to support and drive the changes in childcare quality that are necessary to deliver good services for Australia's families and children. We have not suggested in any sense that the moneys being accounted for here relate to any new services or the delivery of new services but, rather, to assist existing services make the transition to providing better quality care.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-08-23,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:39):  I note the somewhat tone of umbrage the minister used when referring to my comments on a cash cow. I think that is exactly what it is. If you need to take money from something to pay to something else that thing is providing you cash. In this particular instance it is the changes to the childcare rebate and the costs associated being borne by families that are providing that cash. Senator Farrell indicated earlier that that was indeed the case, that it was indeed a savings measure, as you have just mentioned, Minister. It is interesting to note—as you say, it is important to be financially responsible—that the parents who are going to have to bear the burden of the increase would say that, if the government had been financially responsible, they would not need to make any changes at all to the current childcare rebate to be able to access funding for other measures. That is the point, Minister, and it has been raised very clearly in this place—that the reason you need to find the funding stream, the savings measures, indeed from the childcare rebate itself, is the government's mismanagement of the finances. Again, Senator Collins was not here earlier, so to assist: I drew the analogy that the government had wasted $80.9 million administering an emissions trading scheme which does not even exist. Perhaps if that had not happened the $81 million could have been used for this purpose. It is ironic that the figures are almost identical. That is what concerns people.


You have indicated the importance of the childcare sector and these measures. Perhaps the minister might inform the chamber of the importance the government is placing on this particular area. Labor's own website talks about policies and their comprehensive agenda, and of the 51 items on that comprehensive agenda to take Australia forward not one mentions child care. Not one of 51 policy issues on the Labor govern­ment's own website mentions child care. Yet we have those on the other side trying to say how important this issue is. There are 51 policy areas and child care does not rate a mention.


To give the government the benefit of the doubt, I saw at the bottom of this, 'More information on Labor government initiatives'. So I thought I would go to that and that maybe it is hidden further down. Interestingly, no. It did not even rate a mention under 'Fresh ideas for work and family', which was apparently about financial assistance for small business, I think it was, to balance work and family. The only enlightenment I got from reading that, Senator Williams, was the fact that there was no more money available and that it had actually shut.


In all of this website there is absolutely nothing on policies for child care. Given that prior to the election, as Senator Farrell was saying earlier, this was all very clear in the minds of people out there in the community, perhaps the minister might like to give us more information—and I thank you because it is the first information we have had about the community consultation. How many forums were held and roughly where across the country? I am genuinely interested just to get the spread of where that community consultation took place.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:43):  I do not know the basis for Senator Nash's computer searches or internet searches on the Labor Party's website, nor indeed the processes she undertook to reach that figure of 51 policy areas, but I can say from my former experience—



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I am not sure it would assist because it does not necessarily guide us in the nature of the process you went through or indeed what information you potentially avoided to achieve that figure.




Senator Nash:
  On a point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman: this might help the minister be a little more relevant because it is self-explanatory as to where it came from.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
):  It is not a relevant point of order. We will continue to the end of the contribution and then you may seek to table the document.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I know from my experience that you can trawl through the internet and achieve all sorts of complexions. It is a bit like doing social research; it really depends on what questions you are asking, where you are looking and how you conflate what you have.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The main point here—once Senator Nash quietens down—is that it is fairly obvious, from what Senator Nash is putting before us now and her questions about wanting detailed information on consultation of measures that have been before us for well over 12 months, that she is seeking to extend this discussion for some reason I cannot necessarily comprehend. Perhaps it relates to the coalition's former record on children's policy that I can recall from my days as a shadow minister. If we are going to make comparisons—and I will not allow myself to be provoked into a discussion of this nature for too long—I seem to remember Larry Anthony and a national agenda for children that never surfaced despite five years of discussion about the Howard government having a national agenda for children. 


What we do know, what I have said before and what is very clear is that Labor has a very strong record of childcare affordability. The proportion of family income being spent on childcare out-of-pocket expenses has almost halved from 13 per cent down to seven per cent. Families see this; families know the level of support that they have been receiving from the government in child care. I can see the comparisons between what was available when I had young children and the support that families are receiving today. This is perhaps the most stark issue in trying to understand why the opposition is seeking to delay dealing with this matter. Again and again, we get stories about, 'It is going to cost more; there will be problems,' but why this opposition is steadfast in seeking to delay improvements in the quality agenda—the carer-to-child ratio for young children—astounds me. I really think, Senator Nash, you need to reconsider occupying the chamber's time with questions and information which is deliberately designed to protract this debate.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:47):  I did not realise that Senator Collins had actually managed to morph and pop herself inside my head and see why I am asking these questions. Apparently, she has a very good handle on exactly what I am doing on this side of the chamber. Unfortunately, she is incorrect. I have a genuine interest in this issue and I think it is quite appropriate during a committee stage to ask questions. If you do not want the scrutiny, that is up to you, but it is entirely appropriate in the committee stage to ask questions for as long as it takes to get the answers that satisfy senators. You know that very well, Minister, as everyone else does in this chamber. We often have committee processes in this place that go for a very long time. 


I have a very genuine interest in this. Like you, I have older children who were young once, and I have a very genuine interest in how this is going to impact on families in the community. If Senator Farrell had been able to give us more detailed answers earlier in regard to the consultation process and what had happened, perhaps we might be a little further through the process. Through no fault of his own, I am sure, he was not able to provide the committee with that. I am not going to apologise for standing here for a period of time and asking questions on behalf of Australian families about the rationale and the consultation behind it. There are other questions that are still to be asked. I am sorry, Minister, if you do not particularly want to be here and would prefer to be somewhere else, but this is the nature of the committee stage of legislation. 


The question I ask for clarification relates to amendment (1) on sheet BM231, paragraph 84F(1)(e), to substitute 'for the income year ending on 30 June 2011—$7,941'. That is an amendment to the existing legislation which previously was $7,500. Could you indicate to the chamber the reason for that change and am I correct in assuming that the reason for the change is that, from 1 July this year, the $7½ thousand threshold may already have been increased?

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-08-23,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:51):  I rise to speak about the Building the Education Revolution program. I do so because this program has been the largest element of the government's $42 billion Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. When complete there will have been around 24,000 projects undertaken Australia wide. The $16.2 billion BER program has been successful in modernising schools through the delivery of necessary infrastructure while supporting local jobs and stimulating investment. In many locations, such as Tasmania, students, teachers and communities are already enjoying the benefits of recently completed projects delivering world-class 21st century facilities to their schools. I have been fortunate enough to see firsthand the wonderful new facilities being built in my home state of Tasmania. I must congratulate the Tasmanian education department for the role they had in managing these projects. There have been so many opening ceremonies for new classrooms, libraries, school labs, computer labs, language centres and so much more in recent times. I feel it is important to publicly acknowledge some of these fantastic new facilities and the students, teachers and communities that are benefiting from them.


I would like to take this opportunity to speak briefly about a number of schools I have visited most recently to attend the openings of BER projects. I will start with Deloraine Primary School. Deloraine is a place close to my heart. It is not only where I went to high school but a place that has a fantastic sense of community. Naturally, I was excited to have the opportunity to attend the opening of the new library and kindergarten facilities. These new buildings will be the first experience of school for so many kindergarten children. I am happy to say they are places that will facilitate excellent learning. Deloraine Primary School received a total of $2.125 million in BER funding and constructed a new library and a new kindergarten facility.


I was also able to attend the official opening of the science laboratory of the Deloraine High School, opened by the Hon. Dick Adams MP, the federal member for Lyons. It was fantastic to be there because it brought back so many memories of the old science lab that was there when I went to school all those decades ago. To see the new facility that these young people in rural Tasmania are experiencing was a great delight. I am very proud to be part of a government that delivered these wonderful facilities.


I turn to Larmenier Catholic Primary School in Launceston, which received a total of $1.875 million in BER funding for classroom refurbishments. There is now the capacity for collaboration with neighbouring classes, access to adjacent veranda spaces, large screen televisions with internet access, a new canteen, extended storage in the basement, new student toilet facilities and a refurbished staff room. The intention of these projects was not only to ensure our education facilities are of the highest standard but also to support local jobs. This particular project supported the employment of 10 workers, which is an excellent result. I now turn to Scotch Oakburn College, which was opened by Geoff Lyons MP, the federal member for Bass. I have been to so many of these occasions with Geoff, and every one of them is an inspiration. Scotch Oakburn College received $2.7 million in BER funding for construction of a new multipurpose building. I attended the opening of this wonderful new facility and was amazed to see the clever design and thought that has gone into making a building that is so functional in so many different ways. It is not just a gymnasium, not just a classroom, not just a space for art and drama; it is all of these things rolled into one and much, much more. There are great flow-on benefits for the wider community. It is used after school hours by community groups and for learning opportunities. A vacation care program operates and there are forensic science and sporting holiday programs. These projects also support the employment of approximately 100 workers. In a place like Launceston, 100 jobs have a real impact on the local economy.


Now I turn to Invermay Primary School. Once again, I have a family connection. My older sister and brother both spent some time at this school. Invermay Primary School received a total of $2.292 million in BER funding for a new multipurpose hall and community access centre. This community hall enabled the school to have an assembly for the first time with all the students being able to attend. The school was built in 1889. The BER funding has allowed the heritage listed building to be brought into 21st century learning and to provide an early learning service to the community—a birth to five years program. It has also enabled sports programs to be held after school hours. Not only has it done that; it has brought an enormous amount of pride to that community. 


At each and every one of these school openings I have been to, I have been impressed by the young students who are the meeters and greeters. When they take you round the school, show you the schoolyard and talk about their new library or their new multipurpose centre, they have such pride in their school. This is about providing the teachers with the best facilities they can have, because they have such an impact on that future generation. I am very proud to be a member of this Labor government. This investment is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So many schools in Tasmania had not had any real money spent on infrastructure for 30 or 40 years.


I now turn to St Finn Barr's Catholic primary school at Invermay, which benefited with $2.125 million in BER funding for a new multipurpose hall. A facility such as this will make a significant difference to all the students. To be there and witness my local priest doing the blessing and to have Geoff Lyons there again doing the opening made me very proud to be a member of this Labor government. That facility was long overdue. It has transformed that school.


I now turn to the West Launceston Primary School, which received $2.125 million in BER funding for a multipurpose hall and early childhood classrooms. Something that has impressed me in each of these schools is the fact that the teachers, the school council, the P&F and the architects were all working together to make sure they got value for money. I do not believe that there was one dollar wasted in Tasmania. West Launceston Primary School is located very close to the gorge, which is one of the main tourist attractions. The school actually incorporated the environment in their building work, which reflected the gorge. A lot of thought went into that project. The young lady who met me and showed me around the new facilities had great pride in her school and knew everything about the early learning environment and the multipurpose hall. She was inspirational. This is where the investment is really going to pay off for us for a long time to come. Helen Boyer, the principal of the West Launceston Primary School said:


Our project gave us outstanding ""value for money""—we gained many solutions to issues that had frustrated our school community for years and also created educational possibilities we could only dream about. The importance of these developments to the future of our school and our local community cannot be underestimated and on behalf of our school community I sincerely and warmly thank the Federal Government for their support.


East Launceston Primary School, another one opened by Geoff Lyons MP, received $3.2 million in BER funding. The school got a new library and classrooms were refurbished. The BER project has ensured quality learning spaces throughout that school. The addition of a new 21st century library is providing the students with first-class English and ICT resources. There are a number of other schools in Launceston which have visited that library to get inspiration. 


In total, Bass has received $86 million in BER funding, Lyons has received $82 million, Franklin has benefited from more than $75 million, Dennison has had over $93 million and Braddon has received more than $100 million of BER funding. This funding has gone towards completing projects that were necessary. Their positive impact will be felt for years to come. We want educational facilities that will complement the learning of our children and that is what we have achieved through the Building the Education Revolution program. I congratulate the Prime Minister and I congratulate the minister for overseeing wonderful outcomes which will be beneficial to children not only now but into the future. (Time expired)
