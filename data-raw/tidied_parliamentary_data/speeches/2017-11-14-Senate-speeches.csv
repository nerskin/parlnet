Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:31):  Mr President, I take this opportunity to share with other colleagues in congratulating you on your recent elevation to this esteemed post. While a lot has been said—and probably a lot is still to be said—regarding some of the circumstances towards the end of Senator Parry's term as President, I want to echo the words of those on this side of the chamber and the other side of the chamber who speak of him as an incredibly distinguished, decent and good-humoured being—and I know you will share in this, Mr President. Aside from politics, all senators felt that he was an advocate for all of us. Mr President, I wish former Senator Parry the best in his future endeavours and I congratulate you on your elevation to this esteemed position.


I am pleased to rise on behalf of the opposition to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. This legislation is to do with issues around housing affordability. As my colleagues said last night, Labor supports this legislation and does not oppose the passage of it. However, we are not under any illusion that these measures will do anything for housing affordability. I note that this is an issue many members of the Senate have been very passionate about—and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge my good friend Senator Jacqui Lambie, who has just walked into the chamber.


Senator Lambie, there has obviously been a fair bit of media speculation over the past few days. I want to echo my personal view, which I know is the view of many senators across the political divide, that your contribution is a tremendous one. You are an incredible human being. You may be someone who on different policy areas at different times some of us haven't always agreed with, but what you have achieved and what you've been able to contribute, and the life experience that you have brought into this chamber, have made the Senate a better place. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.


Leave granted; debate interrupted.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (13:23):  I speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. As has already been indicated, the Greens will be supporting these bills. But I want to take the opportunity to reflect further, for the information of the Senate and in particular on behalf of the people of Queensland, on some of the underlying issues that these bills, in only a very small part, seek to address. I would remind the Senate that this legislation seeks to make a very small move to deal with one aspect of the tax laws relating to negatively geared property. It also implements a vacancy tax on properties owned by foreign investors. From the Greens point of view, and from my point of view in Queensland, even a minor tightening up of negative gearing is a good thing. But this is very much a matter of tinkering at the edges of a massive problem that has been highlighted over and over again.


Not surprisingly, as somebody who came back into this chamber yesterday after a nearly 10-year break, I have had cause to reflect on some of the things that have changed and some of the things that seem very much the same. It was indeed over 10 years ago in this place—28 March 2007, to be precise—that I moved as a matter of urgency in this chamber the need to develop an affordable housing strategy, because of the massive crisis in housing affordability for people seeking to buy a home and people renting their own home. That was a crisis 10 years ago. It's worth noting that the issue for that matter of urgency was urgent 10 years ago, but other parties in the Senate voted against that proposal to develop an affordable housing strategy. If it was urgent 10 years ago, as it undoubtedly was, it is twice as urgent now, but the lack of action has been astonishing at both federal and state level.


The area of negative gearing in particular is one that has been flagged time and time again, so much so that the Hawke government in its very early days, back in the 1980s, recognised this and abolished it before caving in to the political power—the donations and the money—of the developer lobby. It passed this chamber at the time with the support of the Australian Democrats, but was then reversed by decision of the Labor government, who didn't have the courage to follow through on it. Ever since that time, that running sore has caused continuing, growing failure in the housing market in this country, because, under the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties at state and federal level, housing policy has in effect been privatised. Perhaps alongside access to food, access to safe, secure, affordable stable housing has to be one of the most basic human rights every Australian could have, yet that has basically been contracted out to the market—a perfect case of profits being put before people.


One of the very last things I was part of when I was in this chamber last time around, in 2008, was a select committee inquiry set up by this Senate into affordable housing. It was chaired by Senator Marise Payne, who I'm pleased to see is still in this chamber in a more senior role with the current government, and produced a series of recommendations. My current colleague Senator Rachel Siewert was also part of that inquiry. That inquiry recommended that there needed to be a significant, proper review of the tax treatment of negative gearing, of the capital gains tax discount for people who are property investors and of capital gains tax exemptions for residential property, yet 10 years later we've had no action at federal level in regard to these taxation measures until this very small action just now.


At state government level in a number of states, under both Liberal and Labor governments, the massive impact of property developer donations and the property developer industry more broadly is notorious, so much so that the one area where we've had advancement in political donation reform has been the banning of political donations from property developers in New South Wales, and in my own state of Queensland just in the last month or so as a result of yet another scandal at local government level and of an inquiry into that by the Crime and Corruption Commission, which recommended banning donations from property developers to political parties at local government level. I would acknowledge that the state Labor government accepted that recommendation and sought to expand it to political parties at state level, not just for local government, but it then decided to call an early election before legislating to bring the ban into place.


This legislation—a minor incremental tightening of what let's not forget is a massive tax break for property investors in the area of negative gearing—is a small, welcome development. Negative gearing is clearly massively regressive. It costs tens of billions of dollars of foregone revenue that could otherwise be invested directly into affordable housing. This is the approach that the Greens propose, and it is the approach the Queensland Greens have explicitly proposed in this coming state election—that is, to put a massive direct investment of funds into building affordable housing for the public, for public and community housing, straight away. The money can be raised, it can be provided, particularly if you have state and federal governments working together.


Similarly, the vacancy tax that's proposed here on properties owned by foreign investors—it's a step forward of sorts. Certainly a vacancy tax is a great idea, but it should apply to all investor-owned properties, not just those from abroad. In effect, we've got this government trying to use this measure to blame somebody else again. They're trying to blame overseas investors for their own failures in housing. My own state of Queensland is facing a housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders are homeless, are on the social housing waiting list, are facing severe mortgage stress or are completely locked out of the housing market altogether. People are having to pay significant rents under a tenancy law regime where they do not have security over their own home and can be forced to move at quite short notice, with no control over the place they call home. Meanwhile, the wealthy few are allowed to have their houses remain vacant. We have a situation where there are more vacant houses today in my own city of Brisbane than there are homeless people across the entire state of Queensland. Those homeless people don't really care if that vacant house is owned by a property investor who lives overseas or a property investor who lives next door. They care that the house is vacant at a time when we have 20,000 Queenslanders who are homeless and 29,000 people on the social housing waiting list.


Tightening up negative gearing, slightly, and introducing a constricted vacancy tax are good things as far as they go, but with this bill we see the government tinkering around the edges rather than taking meaningful action that will get to the systemic problems that have been embedded and allowed to grow worse and worse with the massive market failure in this most fundamental area of social policy. Tonight there will be tens of thousands of Queenslanders sleeping rough, camping in their cars, couch surfing—and they all deserve better. They deserve a government, they deserve politicians and they deserve political parties that are committed to putting people before profit.


To this end, the Queensland Greens have outlined a bold vision for the state election that's happening the weekend after this—voting is already happening in that election—to ensure every Queenslander has a home and that meaningfully addresses the failures of the housing market, which has failed for everybody except for property developers and investors. We need to make affordable housing and the provision of housing for everybody the Medicare of the 21st century. In the same way that we recognise we need to have governments and policies and legislation that ensures that all Queenslanders, all Australians, can access education, can access health care, we recognise they also should be able to access an affordable, safe, secure home. The Queensland Greens would see the establishment of a new Queensland housing trust dedicated to this goal. Within the first 10 years, that trust would invest $60 billion to finance the construction of 200,000 affordable homes and, based on the jobs figures of the Queensland Housing Strategy, would produce more than 16,000 jobs at the same time as producing affordable housing for so many Queenslanders to move into—those 29,000 people who are currently on the waiting list, many of them who have been on that list for years.


The Greens Queensland housing trust would be supplemented with revenue from our proposed increases to mining royalties under our fair share plan and through the introduction of a tax on all deliberately vacant properties, not just on those who have investors from abroad. This would combine to provide a $10 billion boost during the first 10 years of construction. The Greens are proposing investment in beautiful, sustainable homes where people can live with dignity. I saw in the newspaper in my hometown of Brisbane, in The Sunday Mail, that apparently this was a source of horror: apparently providing beautiful, well-planned, affordable housing for everybody in Queensland was some East German Cold War nightmare. It might have something to do with the fact that it's not just the two political parties of the establishment who rely so much on the real estate industry and property developers; perhaps the corporate media's desperate reliance on money and advertising from the property industry and from the real estate industry might also be a reason they're so keen to be a mouthpiece for the Property Council.


The Greens are interested in being a voice for everyday Queenslanders, particularly those Queenslanders who are waiting for safe, secure and affordable housing, those who are having to choose between being able to pay the rent or put food on the table, and those who aren't sure whether they're going to be evicted from their home at the end of the year or whether they have long-term security of tenure in their homes. That is why the Greens have also proposed significant reforms to the tenancy laws in my home state of Queensland: to provide that security of tenure.


It takes me back to those times 10 years ago when I was in this chamber repeatedly asking the government of the day and Senator Minchin, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time—I think he was the Minister for Finance—about this issue of affordable housing. I asked what the federal government was going to do about it. Timeand time again his only answer—his answer No. 1—was to blame the states. That's a pretty standard approach for federal governments on most things. His second one was: 'Well, we keep interest rates low. That's the way you deliver affordable housing.' That has been shown to be economically illiterate. We have recently had the lowest interest rates in Australia year after year. It used to be a stick that the Liberal government used to beat the Labor Party and others over—that somehow there would always be lower interest rates under a Liberal government, as though this would deliver affordable housing. We've now had lower interest rates again for years and the housing affordability crisis is worse than ever.


The so-called economic logic behind the so-called good economic managers of the coalition government is once again shown to be a complete facade and as hollow as their words. It also showed a total lack of concern, or even probably awareness, of the huge number of Australians—the huge number of Queenslanders—who rent their own home. I am one of those people. Certainly, it's not something that anybody should feel the need to try and hide. It is something that many, many people do for all sorts of reasons, but it is a reality of the situation that our laws in all states to varying degrees are very much biased towards the property owner and against the private tenant. That is another reason why the Greens, both in this chamber at the federal level and in state parliaments around the country, have pushed for the strengthening of the rights of tenants under tenancy law. It's an example of why it is so important to have Greens in state parliaments: to be able to push the envelope, and to be able to push the other parties and whoever's in government at the time to go further and act to address the problems of the communities that elect us here.


We've just heard a number of wonderful, heartwarming speeches about Senator Lambie. It's a matter of some disappointment to me that, just as I've got here—unfortunately, at least for the moment—she's gone. One of the key themes of what people said about Senator Lambie was that, as just one person here, through her commitment to push on an issue strongly and consistently and with integrity, passion and belief she was able to get shift across pretty much the entire political spectrum. That is a classic example of how electing even just one Green into the Queensland parliament would massively shift the dynamic in that parliament. That would help to get these issues on the agenda, to get advances in tenancy law reform and to get governments to go back to having a direct responsibility for investing in providing affordable housing for the entire community, rather than, in effect, privatising it and handing it to the market, in an area where the market has failed.


Part of the reason the market has failed is not just that the rules have been rorted to benefit the property developers and the property industry, who provide so many big donations to the coffers of the two parties of the political establishment, but also that the market itself has been savagely distorted over many years by these federal tax measures. It's been distorted for decades because of negative gearing, and then that distortion got turbocharged at the end of last century by the capital gains tax discount—which, unfortunately, the Labor Party supported at the time to enable it to come into being, because it would not have got through this chamber without the support of the then Labor opposition. Those two tax measures, along with the capital gains tax exemption for residential property, have combined to create a massive market distortion, alongside a set of rules that are already basically biased towards the investor and towards the well-off.


It is time—in fact, it is well past time—that we had political parties and political representatives who will once again put forward credible, costed policies that will get quick action to address the housing affordability crisis. As I said at the start, it's a crisis that's been in place for a long period of time, and it's simply got worse and worse and worse.


The measures in these bills, whilst welcome, really do not go anywhere near the heart of the problem, even in regard to the distortion in our tax regime. We certainly are not seeing from any other political party at state level the sort of policy that the Greens are putting forward: a significant, major, direct, immediate investment in building housing infrastructure for the community, for the public, to address those massive housing waiting lists. It would get people off the streets, end homelessness and produce significant numbers of jobs as well as providing infrastructure for everybody. That is the vision the Greens have for the future. It's the vision the Greens are putting forward to the Queensland election. If we can get good legislative change at federal level alongside it, we really can make the housing affordability crisis a thing of the past.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:41):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I am pleased to say on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting these pieces of legislation. We're certainly not going to stand in the way of these bills. But we're also not under any kind of real illusion about just how little these measures will do for housing affordability.


Housing affordability is a huge issue, if not the No. 1 issue, for a generation of young Australians. A generation of young Australians rightly feel that they have been excluded from the Australian housing market, and it's incumbent on government to realise the psychological impact that this has had on this generation of young Australians. There is something fundamental about Australian identity that comes with owning your own home. It's part of our nature. It's part of our culture. While people will point to Europe and other places where homeownership rates and home occupancy rates have been a lot lower, they're actually looking at a culture that is very different in relation to housing. It is a culture that relates much more to people investing in longer term rental arrangements. We don't have that in Australia, and we've never had that in Australia. While it's great to look at some of the European examples, the reality is that that is actually pointing to a cultural phenomenon that is very alien to a lot of Australians out there.


When you look at what's really happened with property prices in a place like Sydney—and across the country but, I think, in particular in Sydney—you realise there is this disadvantage that's there because of the fundamental issue of capital gains tax and negative gearing, which is at the heart of these problems. I accept that this has been an incredibly difficult issue to deal with in politics. It's always difficult to look at taking away an entitlement that people have. In the Labor Party policy proposal, it's not a retrospective policy; it will only be a prospective policy. I note that other parties—and I note the Greens are here in the chamber—have a version of this that looks at some retrospectivity as well. I acknowledge that that is a very hard thing to do.


There are a lot of people who have chosen to invest in property as their form of superannuation. Without drawing stereotypes, there has certainly also been a very cultural element to this in places like Sydney where the migrant communities, like the migrant communities that I'm proud to represent, have over many years chosen to invest in property as a bricks-and-mortar type investment as opposed to things like shares and other types of equities that, frankly, probably don't have that kind of certainty culturally that property does. So you end up with a situation where many people have chosen to buy a second or a third property, occasionally for their child—for one of their children as they grow up—or to give them a steady source of income in their retirement. As the value of these properties has skyrocketed in our major cities, it has created a scenario where a lot of people are very wealthy largely on paper rather than in reality.


I note that in the part of Sydney that I live in, in the inner west of Sydney, we have seen property prices in double-digit growth year after year after year. Now, what that really creates is two classes of people: those who are in the market and those who are outside. Those who are outside the market, unfortunately, when prices are what they are, don't have the ability to buy in. That creates a real second-class scenario for a lot of them. Frankly, it worries me that a generation of my peers, and certainly the generation that comes after mine, won't be able to buy in the Sydney market if they aren't fortunate enough to have wealthy parents. I note this isn't a phenomenon unique to Sydney. The data seems to demonstrate that parts of Sydney and Sydney as a city as a whole, perhaps, has this worse than anywhere else in the country. But I know it's the same story in many major cities and also in many towns, especially those regional towns that have seen a boom-bust property cycle related to short-term massive increases in economic activity, such as the mining boom.


Labor have a more comprehensive proposal than what's been outlined in this bill, although we're not opposing this bill, and that's a capital gains tax and negative gearing policy that would deliver $32.1 billion over 10 years and $565 million over the forward estimates. But let's be clear: this isn't just a revenue-raising measure, though there is a revenue-raising component to it. It's about creating a cultural shift in how we deal with property and what we do with property as a nation. It's about changing the incentives. The Labor Party policy, by not being retrospective, accepts that those who have entered into this market in good faith doing the right thing, with their own savings, should not be punished for the decisions they've made. But prospectively, unless you're purchasing new property to try and create some growth in that space, it shouldn't be and it doesn't need to be retrospective.


Housing affordability is deteriorating in Australia's major cities. In 2012, which is only five years ago, Sydney's ratio of median house prices to median gross household incomes was 6.7 times and Melbourne's was 6.5 times. I want to touch on those figures a bit, because the enormity of them might be lost. In 2012—again, five years ago—prices were already skyrocketing out of control and the ratio of median gross annual income to median house prices was 6.7 times in Sydney and 6.5 times in Melbourne. In June 2017—five years later—that ratio sat at 9.1 times for Sydney and 7.5 times for Melbourne. That is a spectacular growth in property prices that those who are in the market, and those in the market with several properties, are able to benefit from but those who are outside of the market are more and more likely to be forever excluded from it. 


Since 2012, over the past five years, median dwelling prices in Sydney have increased by 60 per cent and Melbourne prices have increased by 30 per cent. I don't need to tell you that when you relate that to a figure like inflation, you see just how phenomenal those increases have been. Meanwhile, Sydney household incomes are only 18.4 per cent higher and Melbourne household incomes have increased by only 13 per cent. I don't want to be Sydney and Melbourne specific—most other capital cities have seen some change in housing affordability over the five to 10 years based on that metric—but it does appear to be Sydney and Melbourne that have really seen this happen the most. 


There are those who argue, validly, that there is a supply problem that has created some of the housing affordability challenges. There is, or has been, certainly, a supply problem when it comes to land release, nimbyism and people deciding to restrict the growth of properties and property development, particularly in areas close to train stations and closer to the cities where people tend to want to purchase. But that alone is not the problem. There are problems of both supply and demand. I know—through my experiences and the experiences of friends and colleagues, many of whom are in their mid-30s, trying to break into the housing market—the horror stories of people spending weekend after weekend going to auctions, only to be outbid by a property developer, foreign investor or property investor who has access to capital that they don't have.


To put that in perspective: when the median price in Sydney is a million dollars, it means you need to have a deposit of about $100,000 just to get started—that's assuming you can make repayments on a million-dollar property. It means you have to have two very, very good incomes or one extremely extraordinary income—but normally two very, very good incomes—just to make the repayments. Park that for a moment. You will need a $100,000 deposit—usually you are looking at LVR rates, loan-to-value-ratio rates, of 90 per cent. You will probably need some form of mortgage insurance if you don't have 80 per cent, if you only have 90 per cent. On top of that, you will have to find your stamp duty and your up-front payments of $20,000 or $30,000, and  your mortgage insurance can be another $20,000. All of a sudden, you are having to bring to the table somewhere between $100,000 and $150,000 just to be able to buy a million-dollar property, which is the median property price in a city like Sydney. 


What does that mean? It means that those who are very fortunate to have access to capital—be it because they have wealthy parents or parents who may not be wealthy in terms of liquid income but have property they can borrow against—can borrow against, say, their parents' property or a relative's property to look at those kinds of rates. It means that a generation of people who don't have that, can't. And that only relates to those people who already have access to the market. I worry about all of those who don't have access to the market, who don't have the ability to reach out, who don't have the ability to buy in and who don't have the incredibly deep pockets that are needed.


We're very fortunate here. Those of us in the Senate have a take-home income somewhere around $200,000 a year, which is extraordinary by average Australian standards. But for people who are living in a household with two teachers or two nurses or two public servants—people who make an incredible contribution to our society—what we're really saying is that they will be locked out of cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Hobart. Darwin has had some incredible property price growth in recent years and certainly Perth has too, although I note that the rate of growth has cooled off as we come to the end of the mining boom.


Housing affordability is a barbecue stopper at the moment in Australian politics, because it is about the future. It is about our children and about their ability to participate, to be part of this. Part of the challenge of this is a tax system—and it has been a bipartisan approach; it hasn't been something that just Labor has done or just the Liberals have done—that has encouraged property investment, and investment in property has now skewed the market. Fifty per cent of the benefits of negative gearing go to the top 10 per cent of income earners, and 70 per cent of the benefits of capital gains tax concessions go to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Again, we're not saying that these people have done anything wrong. They haven't. They've played by the rules. They've followed the rules. What we are saying is that the rules here are unfair. The rules need to change. Frankly, it's time for the set of rules we have to be reformed and updated.


The measures in the bills we have before us in the Senate, announced by the government in this year's budget, disallow the deduction of travel expenses for residential rental property, limit plant and equipment depreciation to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introduce an annual charge on foreign owners of underutilised residential property. These are really good changes. These are good pieces of legislation. What we on this side of the chamber are saying is that we cannot stop at just these measures. We have to go further. We have to do more than what these measures are able to achieve.


It would be remiss of me not to note that there is no place in New South Wales that has experienced the challenges of increasing property prices more than the area of Bennelong in Sydney. Nowhere is the pain of first home buyers felt more than in the seat of Bennelong in Sydney. This is a seat in Australia where almost 40 per cent of the population have a university degree—15 percentage points higher than the rest of the state or country. This is a seat where 34 per cent of the population are professionals. Yet the 2016 census tells us that 36 per cent of dwellings there are rented—a full five percentage points higher than the national average. Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per cent higher than the national average. Let me run that figure again: Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per higher than the national average. The aspirational of Bennelong are a great example of Australians struggling with the housing affordability crisis.


Fortunately—what are the chances?—the people of Bennelong now have a real option, a real choice.

While those on the other side of the chamber are doing their dirty deals with One Nation up there in Northern Queensland, we will be in Sydney highlighting that a proper, multicultural society can only be able to— (Time expired)

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (13:23):  I speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. As has already been indicated, the Greens will be supporting these bills. But I want to take the opportunity to reflect further, for the information of the Senate and in particular on behalf of the people of Queensland, on some of the underlying issues that these bills, in only a very small part, seek to address. I would remind the Senate that this legislation seeks to make a very small move to deal with one aspect of the tax laws relating to negatively geared property. It also implements a vacancy tax on properties owned by foreign investors. From the Greens point of view, and from my point of view in Queensland, even a minor tightening up of negative gearing is a good thing. But this is very much a matter of tinkering at the edges of a massive problem that has been highlighted over and over again.


Not surprisingly, as somebody who came back into this chamber yesterday after a nearly 10-year break, I have had cause to reflect on some of the things that have changed and some of the things that seem very much the same. It was indeed over 10 years ago in this place—28 March 2007, to be precise—that I moved as a matter of urgency in this chamber the need to develop an affordable housing strategy, because of the massive crisis in housing affordability for people seeking to buy a home and people renting their own home. That was a crisis 10 years ago. It's worth noting that the issue for that matter of urgency was urgent 10 years ago, but other parties in the Senate voted against that proposal to develop an affordable housing strategy. If it was urgent 10 years ago, as it undoubtedly was, it is twice as urgent now, but the lack of action has been astonishing at both federal and state level.


The area of negative gearing in particular is one that has been flagged time and time again, so much so that the Hawke government in its very early days, back in the 1980s, recognised this and abolished it before caving in to the political power—the donations and the money—of the developer lobby. It passed this chamber at the time with the support of the Australian Democrats, but was then reversed by decision of the Labor government, who didn't have the courage to follow through on it. Ever since that time, that running sore has caused continuing, growing failure in the housing market in this country, because, under the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties at state and federal level, housing policy has in effect been privatised. Perhaps alongside access to food, access to safe, secure, affordable stable housing has to be one of the most basic human rights every Australian could have, yet that has basically been contracted out to the market—a perfect case of profits being put before people.


One of the very last things I was part of when I was in this chamber last time around, in 2008, was a select committee inquiry set up by this Senate into affordable housing. It was chaired by Senator Marise Payne, who I'm pleased to see is still in this chamber in a more senior role with the current government, and produced a series of recommendations. My current colleague Senator Rachel Siewert was also part of that inquiry. That inquiry recommended that there needed to be a significant, proper review of the tax treatment of negative gearing, of the capital gains tax discount for people who are property investors and of capital gains tax exemptions for residential property, yet 10 years later we've had no action at federal level in regard to these taxation measures until this very small action just now.


At state government level in a number of states, under both Liberal and Labor governments, the massive impact of property developer donations and the property developer industry more broadly is notorious, so much so that the one area where we've had advancement in political donation reform has been the banning of political donations from property developers in New South Wales, and in my own state of Queensland just in the last month or so as a result of yet another scandal at local government level and of an inquiry into that by the Crime and Corruption Commission, which recommended banning donations from property developers to political parties at local government level. I would acknowledge that the state Labor government accepted that recommendation and sought to expand it to political parties at state level, not just for local government, but it then decided to call an early election before legislating to bring the ban into place.


This legislation—a minor incremental tightening of what let's not forget is a massive tax break for property investors in the area of negative gearing—is a small, welcome development. Negative gearing is clearly massively regressive. It costs tens of billions of dollars of foregone revenue that could otherwise be invested directly into affordable housing. This is the approach that the Greens propose, and it is the approach the Queensland Greens have explicitly proposed in this coming state election—that is, to put a massive direct investment of funds into building affordable housing for the public, for public and community housing, straight away. The money can be raised, it can be provided, particularly if you have state and federal governments working together.


Similarly, the vacancy tax that's proposed here on properties owned by foreign investors—it's a step forward of sorts. Certainly a vacancy tax is a great idea, but it should apply to all investor-owned properties, not just those from abroad. In effect, we've got this government trying to use this measure to blame somebody else again. They're trying to blame overseas investors for their own failures in housing. My own state of Queensland is facing a housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders are homeless, are on the social housing waiting list, are facing severe mortgage stress or are completely locked out of the housing market altogether. People are having to pay significant rents under a tenancy law regime where they do not have security over their own home and can be forced to move at quite short notice, with no control over the place they call home. Meanwhile, the wealthy few are allowed to have their houses remain vacant. We have a situation where there are more vacant houses today in my own city of Brisbane than there are homeless people across the entire state of Queensland. Those homeless people don't really care if that vacant house is owned by a property investor who lives overseas or a property investor who lives next door. They care that the house is vacant at a time when we have 20,000 Queenslanders who are homeless and 29,000 people on the social housing waiting list.


Tightening up negative gearing, slightly, and introducing a constricted vacancy tax are good things as far as they go, but with this bill we see the government tinkering around the edges rather than taking meaningful action that will get to the systemic problems that have been embedded and allowed to grow worse and worse with the massive market failure in this most fundamental area of social policy. Tonight there will be tens of thousands of Queenslanders sleeping rough, camping in their cars, couch surfing—and they all deserve better. They deserve a government, they deserve politicians and they deserve political parties that are committed to putting people before profit.


To this end, the Queensland Greens have outlined a bold vision for the state election that's happening the weekend after this—voting is already happening in that election—to ensure every Queenslander has a home and that meaningfully addresses the failures of the housing market, which has failed for everybody except for property developers and investors. We need to make affordable housing and the provision of housing for everybody the Medicare of the 21st century. In the same way that we recognise we need to have governments and policies and legislation that ensures that all Queenslanders, all Australians, can access education, can access health care, we recognise they also should be able to access an affordable, safe, secure home. The Queensland Greens would see the establishment of a new Queensland housing trust dedicated to this goal. Within the first 10 years, that trust would invest $60 billion to finance the construction of 200,000 affordable homes and, based on the jobs figures of the Queensland Housing Strategy, would produce more than 16,000 jobs at the same time as producing affordable housing for so many Queenslanders to move into—those 29,000 people who are currently on the waiting list, many of them who have been on that list for years.


The Greens Queensland housing trust would be supplemented with revenue from our proposed increases to mining royalties under our fair share plan and through the introduction of a tax on all deliberately vacant properties, not just on those who have investors from abroad. This would combine to provide a $10 billion boost during the first 10 years of construction. The Greens are proposing investment in beautiful, sustainable homes where people can live with dignity. I saw in the newspaper in my hometown of Brisbane, in The Sunday Mail, that apparently this was a source of horror: apparently providing beautiful, well-planned, affordable housing for everybody in Queensland was some East German Cold War nightmare. It might have something to do with the fact that it's not just the two political parties of the establishment who rely so much on the real estate industry and property developers; perhaps the corporate media's desperate reliance on money and advertising from the property industry and from the real estate industry might also be a reason they're so keen to be a mouthpiece for the Property Council.


The Greens are interested in being a voice for everyday Queenslanders, particularly those Queenslanders who are waiting for safe, secure and affordable housing, those who are having to choose between being able to pay the rent or put food on the table, and those who aren't sure whether they're going to be evicted from their home at the end of the year or whether they have long-term security of tenure in their homes. That is why the Greens have also proposed significant reforms to the tenancy laws in my home state of Queensland: to provide that security of tenure.


It takes me back to those times 10 years ago when I was in this chamber repeatedly asking the government of the day and Senator Minchin, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time—I think he was the Minister for Finance—about this issue of affordable housing. I asked what the federal government was going to do about it. Timeand time again his only answer—his answer No. 1—was to blame the states. That's a pretty standard approach for federal governments on most things. His second one was: 'Well, we keep interest rates low. That's the way you deliver affordable housing.' That has been shown to be economically illiterate. We have recently had the lowest interest rates in Australia year after year. It used to be a stick that the Liberal government used to beat the Labor Party and others over—that somehow there would always be lower interest rates under a Liberal government, as though this would deliver affordable housing. We've now had lower interest rates again for years and the housing affordability crisis is worse than ever.


The so-called economic logic behind the so-called good economic managers of the coalition government is once again shown to be a complete facade and as hollow as their words. It also showed a total lack of concern, or even probably awareness, of the huge number of Australians—the huge number of Queenslanders—who rent their own home. I am one of those people. Certainly, it's not something that anybody should feel the need to try and hide. It is something that many, many people do for all sorts of reasons, but it is a reality of the situation that our laws in all states to varying degrees are very much biased towards the property owner and against the private tenant. That is another reason why the Greens, both in this chamber at the federal level and in state parliaments around the country, have pushed for the strengthening of the rights of tenants under tenancy law. It's an example of why it is so important to have Greens in state parliaments: to be able to push the envelope, and to be able to push the other parties and whoever's in government at the time to go further and act to address the problems of the communities that elect us here.


We've just heard a number of wonderful, heartwarming speeches about Senator Lambie. It's a matter of some disappointment to me that, just as I've got here—unfortunately, at least for the moment—she's gone. One of the key themes of what people said about Senator Lambie was that, as just one person here, through her commitment to push on an issue strongly and consistently and with integrity, passion and belief she was able to get shift across pretty much the entire political spectrum. That is a classic example of how electing even just one Green into the Queensland parliament would massively shift the dynamic in that parliament. That would help to get these issues on the agenda, to get advances in tenancy law reform and to get governments to go back to having a direct responsibility for investing in providing affordable housing for the entire community, rather than, in effect, privatising it and handing it to the market, in an area where the market has failed.


Part of the reason the market has failed is not just that the rules have been rorted to benefit the property developers and the property industry, who provide so many big donations to the coffers of the two parties of the political establishment, but also that the market itself has been savagely distorted over many years by these federal tax measures. It's been distorted for decades because of negative gearing, and then that distortion got turbocharged at the end of last century by the capital gains tax discount—which, unfortunately, the Labor Party supported at the time to enable it to come into being, because it would not have got through this chamber without the support of the then Labor opposition. Those two tax measures, along with the capital gains tax exemption for residential property, have combined to create a massive market distortion, alongside a set of rules that are already basically biased towards the investor and towards the well-off.


It is time—in fact, it is well past time—that we had political parties and political representatives who will once again put forward credible, costed policies that will get quick action to address the housing affordability crisis. As I said at the start, it's a crisis that's been in place for a long period of time, and it's simply got worse and worse and worse.


The measures in these bills, whilst welcome, really do not go anywhere near the heart of the problem, even in regard to the distortion in our tax regime. We certainly are not seeing from any other political party at state level the sort of policy that the Greens are putting forward: a significant, major, direct, immediate investment in building housing infrastructure for the community, for the public, to address those massive housing waiting lists. It would get people off the streets, end homelessness and produce significant numbers of jobs as well as providing infrastructure for everybody. That is the vision the Greens have for the future. It's the vision the Greens are putting forward to the Queensland election. If we can get good legislative change at federal level alongside it, we really can make the housing affordability crisis a thing of the past.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-11-14,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:41):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I am pleased to say on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting these pieces of legislation. We're certainly not going to stand in the way of these bills. But we're also not under any kind of real illusion about just how little these measures will do for housing affordability.


Housing affordability is a huge issue, if not the No. 1 issue, for a generation of young Australians. A generation of young Australians rightly feel that they have been excluded from the Australian housing market, and it's incumbent on government to realise the psychological impact that this has had on this generation of young Australians. There is something fundamental about Australian identity that comes with owning your own home. It's part of our nature. It's part of our culture. While people will point to Europe and other places where homeownership rates and home occupancy rates have been a lot lower, they're actually looking at a culture that is very different in relation to housing. It is a culture that relates much more to people investing in longer term rental arrangements. We don't have that in Australia, and we've never had that in Australia. While it's great to look at some of the European examples, the reality is that that is actually pointing to a cultural phenomenon that is very alien to a lot of Australians out there.


When you look at what's really happened with property prices in a place like Sydney—and across the country but, I think, in particular in Sydney—you realise there is this disadvantage that's there because of the fundamental issue of capital gains tax and negative gearing, which is at the heart of these problems. I accept that this has been an incredibly difficult issue to deal with in politics. It's always difficult to look at taking away an entitlement that people have. In the Labor Party policy proposal, it's not a retrospective policy; it will only be a prospective policy. I note that other parties—and I note the Greens are here in the chamber—have a version of this that looks at some retrospectivity as well. I acknowledge that that is a very hard thing to do.


There are a lot of people who have chosen to invest in property as their form of superannuation. Without drawing stereotypes, there has certainly also been a very cultural element to this in places like Sydney where the migrant communities, like the migrant communities that I'm proud to represent, have over many years chosen to invest in property as a bricks-and-mortar type investment as opposed to things like shares and other types of equities that, frankly, probably don't have that kind of certainty culturally that property does. So you end up with a situation where many people have chosen to buy a second or a third property, occasionally for their child—for one of their children as they grow up—or to give them a steady source of income in their retirement. As the value of these properties has skyrocketed in our major cities, it has created a scenario where a lot of people are very wealthy largely on paper rather than in reality.


I note that in the part of Sydney that I live in, in the inner west of Sydney, we have seen property prices in double-digit growth year after year after year. Now, what that really creates is two classes of people: those who are in the market and those who are outside. Those who are outside the market, unfortunately, when prices are what they are, don't have the ability to buy in. That creates a real second-class scenario for a lot of them. Frankly, it worries me that a generation of my peers, and certainly the generation that comes after mine, won't be able to buy in the Sydney market if they aren't fortunate enough to have wealthy parents. I note this isn't a phenomenon unique to Sydney. The data seems to demonstrate that parts of Sydney and Sydney as a city as a whole, perhaps, has this worse than anywhere else in the country. But I know it's the same story in many major cities and also in many towns, especially those regional towns that have seen a boom-bust property cycle related to short-term massive increases in economic activity, such as the mining boom.


Labor have a more comprehensive proposal than what's been outlined in this bill, although we're not opposing this bill, and that's a capital gains tax and negative gearing policy that would deliver $32.1 billion over 10 years and $565 million over the forward estimates. But let's be clear: this isn't just a revenue-raising measure, though there is a revenue-raising component to it. It's about creating a cultural shift in how we deal with property and what we do with property as a nation. It's about changing the incentives. The Labor Party policy, by not being retrospective, accepts that those who have entered into this market in good faith doing the right thing, with their own savings, should not be punished for the decisions they've made. But prospectively, unless you're purchasing new property to try and create some growth in that space, it shouldn't be and it doesn't need to be retrospective.


Housing affordability is deteriorating in Australia's major cities. In 2012, which is only five years ago, Sydney's ratio of median house prices to median gross household incomes was 6.7 times and Melbourne's was 6.5 times. I want to touch on those figures a bit, because the enormity of them might be lost. In 2012—again, five years ago—prices were already skyrocketing out of control and the ratio of median gross annual income to median house prices was 6.7 times in Sydney and 6.5 times in Melbourne. In June 2017—five years later—that ratio sat at 9.1 times for Sydney and 7.5 times for Melbourne. That is a spectacular growth in property prices that those who are in the market, and those in the market with several properties, are able to benefit from but those who are outside of the market are more and more likely to be forever excluded from it. 


Since 2012, over the past five years, median dwelling prices in Sydney have increased by 60 per cent and Melbourne prices have increased by 30 per cent. I don't need to tell you that when you relate that to a figure like inflation, you see just how phenomenal those increases have been. Meanwhile, Sydney household incomes are only 18.4 per cent higher and Melbourne household incomes have increased by only 13 per cent. I don't want to be Sydney and Melbourne specific—most other capital cities have seen some change in housing affordability over the five to 10 years based on that metric—but it does appear to be Sydney and Melbourne that have really seen this happen the most. 


There are those who argue, validly, that there is a supply problem that has created some of the housing affordability challenges. There is, or has been, certainly, a supply problem when it comes to land release, nimbyism and people deciding to restrict the growth of properties and property development, particularly in areas close to train stations and closer to the cities where people tend to want to purchase. But that alone is not the problem. There are problems of both supply and demand. I know—through my experiences and the experiences of friends and colleagues, many of whom are in their mid-30s, trying to break into the housing market—the horror stories of people spending weekend after weekend going to auctions, only to be outbid by a property developer, foreign investor or property investor who has access to capital that they don't have.


To put that in perspective: when the median price in Sydney is a million dollars, it means you need to have a deposit of about $100,000 just to get started—that's assuming you can make repayments on a million-dollar property. It means you have to have two very, very good incomes or one extremely extraordinary income—but normally two very, very good incomes—just to make the repayments. Park that for a moment. You will need a $100,000 deposit—usually you are looking at LVR rates, loan-to-value-ratio rates, of 90 per cent. You will probably need some form of mortgage insurance if you don't have 80 per cent, if you only have 90 per cent. On top of that, you will have to find your stamp duty and your up-front payments of $20,000 or $30,000, and  your mortgage insurance can be another $20,000. All of a sudden, you are having to bring to the table somewhere between $100,000 and $150,000 just to be able to buy a million-dollar property, which is the median property price in a city like Sydney. 


What does that mean? It means that those who are very fortunate to have access to capital—be it because they have wealthy parents or parents who may not be wealthy in terms of liquid income but have property they can borrow against—can borrow against, say, their parents' property or a relative's property to look at those kinds of rates. It means that a generation of people who don't have that, can't. And that only relates to those people who already have access to the market. I worry about all of those who don't have access to the market, who don't have the ability to reach out, who don't have the ability to buy in and who don't have the incredibly deep pockets that are needed.


We're very fortunate here. Those of us in the Senate have a take-home income somewhere around $200,000 a year, which is extraordinary by average Australian standards. But for people who are living in a household with two teachers or two nurses or two public servants—people who make an incredible contribution to our society—what we're really saying is that they will be locked out of cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Hobart. Darwin has had some incredible property price growth in recent years and certainly Perth has too, although I note that the rate of growth has cooled off as we come to the end of the mining boom.


Housing affordability is a barbecue stopper at the moment in Australian politics, because it is about the future. It is about our children and about their ability to participate, to be part of this. Part of the challenge of this is a tax system—and it has been a bipartisan approach; it hasn't been something that just Labor has done or just the Liberals have done—that has encouraged property investment, and investment in property has now skewed the market. Fifty per cent of the benefits of negative gearing go to the top 10 per cent of income earners, and 70 per cent of the benefits of capital gains tax concessions go to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Again, we're not saying that these people have done anything wrong. They haven't. They've played by the rules. They've followed the rules. What we are saying is that the rules here are unfair. The rules need to change. Frankly, it's time for the set of rules we have to be reformed and updated.


The measures in the bills we have before us in the Senate, announced by the government in this year's budget, disallow the deduction of travel expenses for residential rental property, limit plant and equipment depreciation to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introduce an annual charge on foreign owners of underutilised residential property. These are really good changes. These are good pieces of legislation. What we on this side of the chamber are saying is that we cannot stop at just these measures. We have to go further. We have to do more than what these measures are able to achieve.


It would be remiss of me not to note that there is no place in New South Wales that has experienced the challenges of increasing property prices more than the area of Bennelong in Sydney. Nowhere is the pain of first home buyers felt more than in the seat of Bennelong in Sydney. This is a seat in Australia where almost 40 per cent of the population have a university degree—15 percentage points higher than the rest of the state or country. This is a seat where 34 per cent of the population are professionals. Yet the 2016 census tells us that 36 per cent of dwellings there are rented—a full five percentage points higher than the national average. Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per cent higher than the national average. Let me run that figure again: Bennelong's households are where mortgages and rents are more than 30 per higher than the national average. The aspirational of Bennelong are a great example of Australians struggling with the housing affordability crisis.


Fortunately—what are the chances?—the people of Bennelong now have a real option, a real choice.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cameron and Watt today relating to the minister's attendance before supplementary Budget estimates hearings of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee.


This is a minister with no credibility, this is a minister who has misled the parliament on at least five occasions, this is a minister who refuses to accept any accountability and this is a minister who uses every opportunity in this place to slander decent working people while she presents herself in this place by hiding, by not answering any questions and by not being accountable to the Senate. This minister is an absolute disgrace. This minister sacrificed her own minder, one of her own senior staff, to save her own skin. That's what this minister did. She has no credibility and no capacity to stand up here and argue any point on industrial relations portfolios, because she is an absolute fraud. She will be found out. She can run all she likes, as she is running out of the chamber now—she can run out of the chamber, but she will be held accountable. She will be held accountable by the Labor Party and she will be held accountable by the Senate because this minister has basically misled this place on at least five occasions. 


The minister gets up today, when workers have been locked out by their employer for month after month in Queensland, and simply regurgitates a rumour based on no evidence, saying that workers in a small town claimed that they would rape the children of any worker who didn't support strike action. That's the level that this minister has got to. She has no credibility and absolutely no sense of decency. If she had any sense of decency whatsoever, she would be providing her resignation to the Senate now. When we see good people leaving the Senate and we see Senator Cash still here, it is no wonder the public is sickened by this rabble opposite, led by a weak Prime Minister. She comes in here day after day making up allegations against trade union leaders and against workers defending their jobs and defending their right to put food on the table for their family after being locked out for month after month. 


This minister has no right to be here after misleading the Senate the way she has. She has not gone anywhere near ministerial accountability. She has not gone anywhere near being accountable to the Senate. She has simply mouthed here allegations that there are no proof of. What she wants to do every time she is asked a serious question is to try and denigrate Labor members, trade unionists and workers out there trying to defend their job. That is common for this mob over here. This lot don't care about workers' rights or decency in the workplace. They simply want workers to be subdued by the employer, come to work every day and accept what the employer says. That's the style of this mob over here.


For a minister to come here and refuse to answer any questions—this is a minister who can't keep her mouth shut when she is on her feet attacking trade unions. But when she is asked a question about her credibility, about her behaviour, she can't sit down quick enough. She has absolutely no credibility as a minister and absolutely no credibility as a member of the government. She will continue to mislead this Senate because she has got nowhere to go. She was offered, day after day, to come and make herself accountable, and she has refused to do so. She has no courage, no commitment to the Senate, no credibility as a minister. She is a disgrace and she should resign. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-11-14,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:06):  Can I first apologise to all those listening and to those in the gallery for the ugly display to which they were subjected to for the past five minutes. It was a display coming from a man, a senator, who sought to defend the criminally convicted Luke Collier at Senate estimates with over six dozen questions. Guess who Luke Collier worked for? Oh! The CFMEU. When we tell the truth—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Abetz, resume your seat. Senator Cameron, a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  A point of order. This is in relation to 193. The member should not have any imputations of improper motives or personal reflections against a member or a senator. That's exactly what this minister has done. He has got no evidence of this. I have on two occasions indicated why I was asking questions. This minister should be made to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, that is a debating point. Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  Just for those listening in, I actually happened to be the minister at the table whilst Senator Cameron was asking question after question to try to assert the integrity of one Luke Collier who is a criminally convicted individual who worked for the CFMEU. There was a protection racket going for this individual. Now, talking about the minister, Minister Cash, it was accused during question time that the minister was 'in hiding'. That would be like saying Uluru is in hiding. It sticks out. The minister is here and ready, willing and able to answer any specific question that senators had. Indeed, the opposition were given the opportunity of six questions, and all they asked were, 'Why are you in hiding?' when she was clearly, transparently, not in hiding. She was there and present, willing and able to answer specific questions. But, of course, the Labor Party, knowing they had no more material, had nowhere else to go, and so they just threw the slur. That is the way that they do their business.


In relation to the protection of workers, which Senator Cameron sought to clothe himself with, let me remind the Australian people that he is a frontbencher in a party led by a former trade union leader, Mr Shorten, who has threatened the Australian people to run Australia like a trade union. Now, how do people like Mr Shorten and the trade union movement run a trade union? Well, ask Kathy Jackson; ask Craig Thomson; ask Bruce Wilson—ask Mr Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, in fact, because what he did was a dirty deal to cut the penalty rates of the Chiquita Mushrooms workers to ensure that his union got money at the expense of low-paid workers. The only people that have cut Australians' penalty rates have been Mr Shorten and the Australian Workers' Union. Indeed, the most recent decision of the Fair Work Commission in relation to penalty rates—and let's get the history here—was as a result of deliberate amendments forced through this place by the dying Labor government, when Mr Shorten was the minister, to ensure that penalty rates were specifically looked at. Who looked at those penalty rates, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle? None other than people hand-picked by Labor onto the Fair Work Commission, appointments that I opposed and had indicated to Mr Shorten that I thought were not appropriate. Nevertheless, all of the people on the Fair Work Commission were hand-picked by Labor. Under Labor's legislation and by Labor's own hand-picked individuals, this decision was made. Why? Because they got mugged by the evidence, and the evidence is overwhelming: the higher the penalty rate, the fewer people employed in certain sectors. Might I add: we're not talking about nurses, ambulance people or fire brigades; we are talking only about the hospitality sector. They were mugged by the fact that that costs jobs.


Here we have a social justice decision out of the Fair Work Commission designed to give more Australians the opportunity to work, and what does Labor do? They say, 'We will seek to legislate to ensure that more of our fellow Australians stay on the scrap heap of unemployment.' And they claim to be the social justice party. Who do they lead-off with in this debate? The chief defender of the thugs in the CFMEU that Senator Cameron seeks to champion day after day at Senate estimates and in this place. You could never accuse Senator Cash of hiding, and it also highlights that Bill Shorten is unfit for government. (Time expired)

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-11-14,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:12):  It's no surprise that they'd send Senator Abetz in to talk about this issue, because he has really been the architect of the witch-hunt and pursuit of their political opponents that we've seen from those opposite now for more than four years. The reality of this situation is that it's actually the witch-hunt that they've had and the agenda that they've pursued that have unravelled with the overreach by Senator Cash and her office. I will come back to that in more detail, because I want to outlay some of the facts that we've seen that were outlaid by Senator Cameron—and I'm sure Senator Watt, behind me, will touch on them. They were two of the inquisitors that we saw in Senate estimates when Minister Cash failed to answer the questions, and failed to answer the questions in Senate question time as well. She may be here, but she certainly isn't answering the questions.


With Senator Cash, the reality is that she has no credibility, misled the Senate on five occasions, refuses to be accountable for ministerial standards, refuses to answer questions now in this chamber and is also refusing to attend another hearing of the estimates before parliament rises so that that can be further scrutinised. That's her record in this regard; that's the record of Senator Cash. It is unacceptable for the leader of government business in here to try to defend that. But there's a broader element to this, and that's the motivation of this government and the conduct of this minister.


Since coming to power more than four years ago, the government and the minister have spent millions of dollars pursuing Labor, pursuing a royal commission and targeting their political opponents with a whatever-it-takes attitude. The fact that they tipped off the media in regard to a raid on the AWU—I don't think that's the first time they've done it. This is really at the heart of what they have done. They use any opportunity, through this, to pursue their political opponents. They've done it, I'm sure, through the royal commission and, indeed, we've seen it in this chamber since I got elected last year. You'd get up and you'd see the front page of the paper: there would be a smear on a union or an individual that would be, no doubt, led by Senator Cash—they'd be there high-fiving in their office. Then the senator would come in here, take a question and smear again. That's what we've seen. This has been the tactic from those opposite. They've done it for four years. For four years they have pursued this, and it is now in tatters. The credibility of this attack is now in tatters. They pursued their political opponents through a royal commission. They did that, thinking it was going to impact on the last federal election campaign. They called a double dissolution on industrial relations issues, yet they never mentioned them again. We've seen over the last month that the credibility of Senator Cash, the lead attack dog on these issues, is in tatters. She didn't get a dixer on it this week—she's been focused on other things. That speaks volumes for how the government sees this and why it had to send in Senator Abetz to try to rebuild its attacks in this regard.


We know from the conduct of the staffer who tipped off the media is that there's no doubt that was encouraged within Senator Cash's office. They pursued a political strategy where they would tip off journos, to give them the heads-up, in trying to build a case against their political opponents, using every lever that they had to do it. I dare say they have, to quote a former Labor senator, a 'whatever it takes' attitude when it comes to pursuing their political opponents. That's what Senator Cash was responsible for. That's what her office was responsible for. What did they tell the Prime Minister? Did they fess up to him and say what they were up to when they met before question time? They let the staffer go, they threw him under a bus, but won't actually front up and give the answers that we are demanding and that the Australian public deserve to know in regard to this issue.


We'll continue to pursue Senator Cash and the others in regard to this, and we will continue to highlight the fact that the smear campaign against their political opponents that they've been pursuing now for four years is in tatters. In Senator Cash they've got a minister who has been at the forefront of this and who has no credibility. They've got a minister who is refusing to answer the questions that we are putting to her in regard to this, both in this chamber and through Senate estimates. And they've got a minister who should live up to the ministerial standards and make the decision to resign, because that is the only way the government can have credibility when it comes to workplace issues and governance in this country.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2017-11-14,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  I think the only thing in tatters in this chamber at the moment is the credibility of the opposition, because what we've seen here is a continuing attack on an effective and highly credible minister of the Crown, one who is performing very ably in her role and who is revealing what the populace of Australia knows about the Australian Labor Party, the current opposition, and its leader: that the links to the union movement are corrosive and destructive.


We've seen the evidence presented by Minister Cash—credible, extensive evidence—to Senate estimates hearings revealing she was not aware of the AFP raids until they occurred and were reported in television coverage. Senator Cash made it very clear that she was not aware that her staff member had made the tip-off. She was informed, in fact, that there was no such tip-off. Senator Cash has been completely up-front and honest. She has appeared before Senate estimates hearings on this topic, she has presented herself in this place and we have seen extensive questioning from the opposition that has got absolutely nowhere. Why are the opposition continuing their attack on this highly effective and credible minister? Because they are running a protection racket for their leader, Bill Shorten. They're running a protection racket on donations to his own election campaign and on donations made to GetUp! when he was national secretary of the AWU. There are very important questions to be answered in this space and the answers have not been forthcoming from the Labor Party. They attack Minister Cash and they continue their attacks even when the results are proven to be so ineffective in this place.


We've seen so many examples of union members' money being wasted on unauthorised expenditure. Recently there was a union official given a 13-month sentence for spending union members' money on things like hen's parties, botox, kitchens and other personal expenses. And everyone in this place remembers Craig Thomson and what he was using the Health Services Union credit card for.


This use of union members' money should be of absolute concern to the Australian Labor Party—to the opposition in this place—but they don't seem to care. They just want to attack Minister Cash; they want to try to run their protection racket on Bill Shorten. What have we heard from the trade union royal commission? The trade union royal commission said:


The conduct that has emerged discloses systemic corruption and unlawful conduct, including corrupt payments, physical and verbal violence, threats, intimidation, abuse of right of entry permits, secondary boycotts, breaches of fiduciary duty and contempt of court.


That is the finding of a royal commission, and the reason why the opposition continues to attack Minister Cash is because it doesn't like the findings of the royal commission. It doesn't like the efforts of this government to crack down on union corruption—to pass laws banning secret payments between unions and big business.


In the past, millions of dollars of dodgy payments changed hands in exchange for unions selling down workers' pay and conditions. They didn't like the introduction of the ABCC: they didn't like the re-introduction of the ABCC, the industrial watchdog on the block of the building industry, making sure that we try to reduce the level of criminality and negative tactics in the building industry. We've seen massive hypocrisy on penalty rates, where we've seen low-paid workers sold down the river by their union bosses. It's a disgraceful fact that, as a union boss, Mr Shorten cut deals to lower penalty rates, including in the retail and hospitality industries by the same rate the Fair Work Commission is now applying for workers on the relevant awards.


They stripped penalty rates from low-paid cleaning workers at Clean Event, with no compensation. This is why the opposition continues to attack Minister Cash, one of the most effective and high-quality operators in this place.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-11-14,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:22):  I also rise to take note of the answers of Senator Cash during question time. It was very interesting: up until a couple of weeks ago, the last sitting week or so, every day during question time we became used to Senator Cash coming into this chamber—usually on the back of a report that, coincidentally, she'd managed to get into a News Corporation paper that very day—to launch an attack on unions and working people, often based on very flimsy evidence. But it has been very interesting this week that Senator Cash has not decided to do that. She came in today and gave some answer about a question in the portfolio that she's representing another minister in. She has stayed well away this week from her traditional attacks on unions.


Now, why would that be? The only reason is that she at least has the self-awareness to understand that from estimates onwards not one person in this country takes anything that she says about unions seriously. The fact that she has launched a partisan campaign, based on flimsy evidence and using every arm of government available to her, against unions and working people was exposed at estimates, once and for all. And from that day onwards, everything that she says about unions, working people and the Labor Party no-one will ever believe again.


Let's just quickly remember what happened during estimates. We were all heading into estimates expecting to be asking questions of Minister Cash about her disgraceful handling of the other arm of the government against unions, being the ABCC. We all remember her own hand-picked appointment, Nigel Hadgkiss, who had to resign from his position in disgrace. We barely even got to that in estimates. There we were, ready to ask some questions about that, but Senator Cash and her office managed to concoct something even bigger still—an even bigger distraction from the affairs of the ABCC—and that was in the form of the AFP raid on union offices and the now notorious tip-off to the media by her own office.


It's well-known now that Minister Cash was asked about this over and over again during estimates, and on at least five occasions she misled the Senate committee as to what she knew and what her office had done in this entire affair. She had opportunities time and time again through that estimates proceeding—during lunchbreaks, morning tea breaks and afternoon tea breaks—she had every possible form of technology known to humankind in front of her and she was on it all day asking all sorts of questions of her office, but she never took the opportunity to ask her office whether the evidence she was giving the Senate was accurate. Do you know why? She didn't want to know the answer. She knew there was something going on there that she didn't want to know the full facts about. We can take only at face value the minister's answers when she said she was not aware that her own office had tipped off the media about the impending police raid on union offices, but there are so many questions that remained unanswered by this minister. They were not answered properly in estimates in any of the sessions. She was unavailable for the follow-up session and is now not making herself available for another estimates session until parliament rises for the year. Even today she has continued to refuse to answer these very legitimate questions that people all around Australia want answers to. She has still not answered, either to the committee or to the Senate, whether other members of her office were aware of the fact that the media were tipped off.


I asked Minister Cash about this on numerous occasions at the first and second estimates committee hearings, and each time she said she was unable to answer. I made it very clear that I wanted to know from her, beyond the one staff member who has resigned in disgrace, which other members of her office were aware that the media had been tipped off about the impending police raid. She has still not answered that question. She didn't answer it in estimates twice and she wasn't able to answer it and wasn't prepared to answer it here in question time again today. Beyond her own office, we still don't have answers as to what role the Prime Minister's office had in this affair. She wouldn't tell us at estimates and she won't tell us here in question time whether members of her office had spoken to the Prime Minister's office about the fact that they were tipping off media. She doesn't want to talk about that, because there's something she's still keen to hide, and today she wasn't prepared to tell us why she hid the truth from the Prime Minister. On the day this story broke she attended a question time briefing with the Prime Minister and misrepresented what one of the shadow frontbenchers, Anthony Albanese, had said on radio. She has been asked repeatedly: why did she mislead the Prime Minister? She continues to say no. We are not going to give this matter up. (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is committed to Operation Sovereign Borders and the policies that have kept children out of detention and prevented deaths at sea. The government will not be lectured to by the Labor Party on border protection. Australians have not forgotten the Labor-Greens border disaster, which saw 50,000 people arrive on more than 800 boats. The tragic mistakes of those opposite saw 8,000 children placed in detention and at least 1,200 lives lost at sea. The government will not repeat Labor's mistakes. Given the close ties between Australia and New Zealand, any resettlement of refugees in New Zealand would have serious implications for Operation Sovereign Borders. The coalition will not weaken our borders and never implement policies which risk putting people smugglers back into business.

Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government will not weaken Australia's border protection measures. Senators will recall the tragic consequences of the last time the Australian Greens dictated border policy in this country, where 1,200 men, women and children drowned at sea and 8,000 children were placed in detention. No-one would be on Manus Island or Nauru if it were not for the disastrous policies of the Greens. If Senator McKim truly cared about the welfare of those on Manus and Nauru, he would get behind the government's US resettlement arrangement and stop counselling asylum seekers to act against their own best interests.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that notice of motion No. 561 standing in the name of Senator McKim be agreed to.

  Mr President, really, we are talking about a man who poses a major threat to the security of not just our nation but, indeed, the world—the planet. This is a man who is goading the North Koreans into a nuclear conflict. This is a man who just recently was congratulating Mr Duterte, the leader of the Philippines, a man who has been involved with extrajudicial killings. Approximately 12,000 people are now dead in the drug wars in the Philippines. People have been killed without trial. We are seeing police involved. In fact, Mr Duterte himself was bragging about stabbing a man as a young person. Out here is the President of the US congratulating him, lauding him for his policies. I think to call him belligerent, narcissistic, petulant, misogynistic and racist is bang on the money.

Senator BERNARDI:
  I table an explanatory memorandum. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Bill I move today is to right a wrong committed by the Senate almost two decades ago to prevent the establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle in Australia.


Two decades ago Australia could have established a nuclear fuel cycle, particularly a nuclear energy sector that would, by now, have reached maturity. In particular, nuclear electricity generation could have provided the energy stability, affordability, security and sovereignty that Australia desperately needs.


Those who are concerned about the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the planet's atmosphere, and the various global efforts to reduce those emissions, also missed an opportunity two decades ago to curtail Australia's emissions by deploying nuclear energy. Nuclear energy results in less carbon dioxide emissions than the photovoltaic and wind generation sources preferred by those concerned about such emissions.


My home state of South Australia has an abundance of uranium which gives us a unique position in the world as a global uranium supplier. In the two decades since this Senate shut the door on a nuclear fuel cycle—followed by a succession of energy policy decisions by major parties—South Australian energy prices have risen to be among the highest in the world. Energy costs have been a significant determinant in the ongoing viability of manufacturing such as the automotive industry, which has now—regrettably—departed South Australia. 


It is a painful exercise to consider whether the South Australian economic position would have been vastly different—and more positive—had this Senate made different decisions two decades ago.


This Bill does not, by any means, open up the nuclear fuel cycle to unregulated development by the private or public sector. Instead, it removes the automatic bans that the Senate inserted into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to prevent any Ministerial or other approval of critical elements of the nuclear fuel cycle. 


The Environment Minister will still have to consider applications to establish such facilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and the Foreign Minister retains the power to decide whether or not to issue a permit for a proposed facility under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.


The passage of this Bill will signal to the world that Australia is—at last—open for business, namely open to considering the evidence, the science, the environmental, employment and economic opportunities of the nuclear fuel cycle.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-11-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:22):  There's no other way to describe what is currently happening on Manus Island than as a humanitarian calamity. There are people entering their 15th day today without access to drinking water, food, electricity and much-needed medication, thanks to the instruction given by the Australian government and the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, to cut off the essentials of life, beginning on 31 October, to well over 600 people. We've then seen Papua New Guinea police and Papua New Guinea immigration personnel go into the camp, overturn water containers, drain precious drinking water into the dust and, yesterday, deliberately drill holes in every water container they could find to stop the detainees from being able to store any rainwater they are able to catch.


This is a humanitarian calamity of bipartisan making. Remember, it was the Australian Labor Party who put every single one of these people on Manus Island in 2013. It is still unexplained why over 1,400 people who were actually on the same boats as the people that are currently on Manus Island and Nauru are here in Australia on various categories of visas, most of them living in the Australian community, while there are still over a thousand on Manus Island, in Port Moresby or in Nauru who are like the corpses that used to be impaled on the walls of medieval cities. It is a sickening, disgusting situation that is a result of a cruel, bipartisan lock step on immigration policy in this country.


Make no mistake: the world is watching in horror. The BBC, Al Jazeera, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Radio New Zealand, The New York Times—the list goes on of these global institutional media organisations who are reporting on these humanitarian crises.


Of course, it is the Liberal Party that have been running the detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru with extreme prejudice, in the most punitive and cruel way that they can, since they came to government, but the reason we still have these crises existing is that the Labor Party has forgotten itself. It's forgotten its roots. It's forgotten its compassion. It's forgotten its tolerance. If there is anything left in the famous light on the hill that Ben Chifley used to talk about with such fondness, that light is flickering; it is guttering; and, if it's still alive, it is in imminent danger of extinction.


Today I call on Labor Party members—and there are many good members of the ALP, senators and MPs who represent the ALP in this place, who we all know do not in their hearts support this policy—and I say to them: I'm pleased that you're speaking out. We are pleased about that, but it's not words that are going to solve this policy crisis; it is votes in this parliament that will solve this policy crisis. It is bums on seats that make laws in this place. It is the Labor and Liberal parties together who created this emergency by voting in favour of the cruel amendments to the Migration Act in 2013, and it is the Labor Party who have it within their capacity now to solve this issue.


If Labor stood up and voted with the Greens to end this humanitarian nightmare that well over 1,000 people are living on Manus Island and Nauru, the Liberal Party would not be able to stand up against it, because we know that the majority of the Australian people do not support what is going on on Manus Island and Nauru. Poll after poll has shown that over the last couple of weeks. We are seeing civil disobedience in ever-increasing numbers, and we will see more people engage in peaceful protest and civil disobedience in coming days and weeks. So I say to the Labor Party members who don't support this: thank you for speaking out, but please, please, vote with the Greens to end this humanitarian calamity.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-11-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:27):  It's often not what the Greens say when they speak; it is about the things that they ignore. The Greens often come into this place and argue that laws should be broken. In this case, the good senator forgot to mention that these events are as a result of a ruling of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, so it was an order. For the entire time that I have been here, these people have called for the closing of this detention centre, and, when the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled accordingly that it ought to be closed, of course overnight their voice changed. So it is not just hypocrisy; it is a concerted effort on their part to mislead the people of Australia with respect to these circumstances.


Senator McKim—can I say to you, Acting Deputy President—continued to refer to these events as a policy of the government. This is not the policy of the government. This is the government respecting the sovereignty of a foreign nation and indeed a partner in the Pacific, in Papua New Guinea, and fulfilling its wishes as ordered by the Supreme Court.


But let's just get back to the beginning. Come back to the beginning. What happened here was not the making of the government of the day. Fifty thousand people arrived illegally on over 800 boats over a period of time. It was an issue that the government inherited. The policy to put these people on Manus Island was a Greens-Labor policy, and our government had to arrive in government with a mop in one hand and a bucket in the other to clean up this mess.


You would've noted, colleagues, that not once—not once, ever—have the Greens protested about the 1,200 souls being lost at sea. Not once did they ever mention it. They want to talk about a calamity. Twelve hundred men, women and children—people whose names we don't know, in many circumstances—perished at sea, under a policy that the Greens supported in this place for many years. There were over 8,000 children detained, not under this government, but under a Labor government, and it took this government to get these children out of detention. We were able to do that, despite resistance. We're all well aware of the famous evidence by the Human Rights Commission President, who admitted, virtually, to colluding with the Labor Party, while the government was in a transitional phase, to bring criticism and to bring an inquiry onto the incoming government about children in detention. That was despite the fact that, in the early periods of this government, we removed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and got them to the smallest numbers.


These people on Manus Island have choices. They have an opportunity, many of them, to go to the United States. But we have, particularly, Senator McKim up there, falsely misleading these people, so that they are resisting the opportunities that they have. They can settle in Papua New Guinea. They can move to—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Well, they've got the choice already. If they've been determined to be refugees, they can settle in Papua New Guinea or they can apply to go to the United States. As to all of this rhetoric that comes out of the Greens about going to New Zealand: they already know what will happen. That will re-open people coming on the high seas into this part of the world, and more men, women, and children—whose lives you do not and have not valued or ever recognised—will perish at sea again. More people will die.


So we've got these people at Manus Island who've got choices. We've had the government of PNG declare publicly that there are other facilities to which they can go today. So they can move to these facilities. As to the standards and the care that they will receive, that, to date, has cost the Australian government $11 billion. That's $11,000 million to support these people. And here you would think that somehow we've left them with a fig leaf over their vital parts, that we won't feed them or water them and that we won't give them health and psychiatric support.


One of the things that has never been recognised is this: say I were a refugee or had determined myself to be a refugee, and I had fled my country and had come, via all sorts of routes, on the high seas, on boats that should have had 50 people on them but had 500 on them, and had gone through the immense trauma of that journey to this place, and had watched my brothers and sisters and mother and father and children die, nameless, with no ceremony, no grave and no place to rest. It does not surprise me that many of these people find themselves in a conflicted position. It does not surprise me that many of these people feel traumatised. And what has our government done? We have provided exceptional health and support services for these people—so much so that many Australians in need of health and psychiatric care do not get care of the same standard that these people get it and don't get it within the same time frame. And Senator McKim knows this. This is the problem. These facts are inconvenient. And that's why we hear him over here, bellowing like an old bull caught in a barbed wire fence. Seriously, Senator McKim—as to what you've tried to portray here, you've been a single voice. You don't have any support from your colleagues. They're all silent around this question.



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No; they're all here today to wave their arms around for 10 minutes while you speak, but they've been silent on this in the public. You are a minority voice, and often—as I've said about other colleagues in this place sitting opposite—you are simply an expression waiting for a thought to follow. You do not think through your statements, and you come in here with this confected anger that you've directed at the government, who have unravelled what was a humanitarian crisis—



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, I suffer from a condition called sensitive ear, and I have to step away from foghorns, and senators are interrupting me while I am speaking. I would ask that you ask Senator McKim to give me the respect that I give him.


There are difficulties up there. There are difficulties up there, because Senator McKim and his predecessor, Senator Hanson-Young, have been going up there consistently to stir these people up there. They go there to give them absolute false hope. They go up there to convince them to engage in civil disobedience—which, of course, is one of the tools in their tool bag. They want them to resist. He talks about communicating with them all the time and giving them advice. Why don't you release any communications that you've got—texts and emails—with any of these people in this camp, so that we can make an assessment as to what sound advice you're giving them or, more likely than not, not giving them.



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Senator, fancy that coming from you! Fancy you suggesting to me that I'm not telling the truth here. I just asked a question, and you need to get your colleague to provide those communications so that this Senate can make a judgement on them.



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I had an old utility that had a squeak like that and I got rid of it, and the Senate ought to get rid of you. In closing, this government has set an example to the world in terms of managing what has been a very difficult situation that it inherited from Labor and the Greens.



Senator McKim interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Jiminy cricket, he makes a lot of noise, that fellow! All I can recommend is that everybody looks carefully at the facts. Have a look not at what Senator McKim and the Greens say; have a look at what they don't say, because, when the inconvenient truths are presented, their protests sound very, very hollow.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-11-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:37):  You can determine the health of a democracy by how it treats some of its most vulnerable people. Some of those vulnerable people were asylum seekers who travelled to Australia on leaky boats some many years ago and sought asylum. It is now some five years on and those asylum seekers, men, women, and children, on Manus Island and Nauru have been languishing and have been treated appallingly by this government. They have simply been left and forgotten. As a country, we cannot abdicate our responsibility for what occurs on Manus Island. But the other thing we should not be doing is creating politics out of this—and that is exactly what the government have been doing for so many years now. They have been creating fear politics with the Australian people. This, of course, has led to these asylum seekers not being able to be settled in Australia; in fact, not being able to be settled anywhere.


These asylum seekers have indeed been forgotten by this government—so much so that the government has received incredible and ongoing criticism not just from civil society here in Australia, not just from the opposition and other parties, but also from the international community, and only as recently as a week or so ago, when the United Nations Human Rights Committee released its recommendations from its review of Australia's compliance with a key human rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—another breach of a treaty that we have signed up to, but there are so many more. One thing I learnt last year when I spent some time at the United Nations was that the one issue that we were absolutely pulled over the coals for as a nation, and rightly so, was how we were treating vulnerable people who sought asylum—how we were treating refugees.


It's obviously a very opportune week for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull because he's at the East Asia Summit. He has that opportunity again to engage with President Trump and also with Prime Minister Ardern. Both the US and the New Zealand governments have offered and agreed to settle these refugees who are desperately seeking settlement so that they can rebuild their lives and get over the trauma that they have suffered. We are still waiting, of course, for the some 1,250 that the US agreed to settle to actually be settled. There have only been about 50. But I understand from the briefings I've received that that processing is going as it should be and, hopefully, will happen sooner than later. The other offer on the table came over a year ago—probably 18 months ago now—from the former New Zealand government, but it has continued under the new New Zealand Labour government, to settle some 150 refugees a year who are on Manus.


I've written to Minister Dutton and I've written to Mr Turnbull. Labor has been constantly asking this government to act on these settlement options. But it's refusing to do so. What does that say about this government? It says that it is quite willing to leave 600 men on Manus Island, potentially in a situation where their lives are at stake and where they're fearing for their ongoing safety. It is absolutely abhorrent to me and to everyone in the Labor Party that a government would treat another human being in this way. We do have a sense of humanity and that is why we have been constantly asking this government to act, whether it's on the medical care that those on these offshore islands have required in Australia or whether it's on the New Zealand settlement arrangement. We have constantly been calling on this government to act.


I say to the Greens: I'm sure that you have well-intentioned ideals in wanting this situation to be resolved. But attacking the Labor Party time and time again is not going to get you there. We know what the facts are.




Senator McKim:
  Vote with us then!




Senator SINGH:
  Senator McKim constantly comes into this place and gets out on the media streams, saying, 'Tell everyone the facts.' We know the facts. We know how bad the facts are. We don't need you to constantly tell us the facts. We have civil society out there telling us the facts. I've had umpteen briefings from the UNHCR. Amnesty International are at this moment waiting in my office to give me another briefing. We've had so many briefings. We know how bad it is, and we have made it so public that the government knows. What we need are solutions. We need solutions to this problem. So stop playing politics with the Labor Party, because you make yourselves just as bad as the government in doing so. We know you're the protest party. You're not a party of government. But you need to make a decision. What government do you want at the next election? Do you want a Labor government or do you want a coalition government? Every time you attack the progressive side of politics, you do yourself a disservice in the sense that you are assisting the coalition to win brownie points. That is not helping the people on Manus Island, nor the people on Nauru. Giving them false hope does not help.


The Greens cannot resolve this issue. They can come in here, they can pass motions and they can get in the media, but they will not be in government. There is a two-party preferred system in this country, and at the next election either there will be a Labor government or there will be a coalition government. I know which one I'd prefer, and I certainly know which one the people in my Australian community—indeed, in my Tasmanian community—would prefer when it comes to the issue of refugees. If they want a protest vote, they can vote for the Greens.




Senator McKim:
  You've got the same policies as the Liberals!




Senator SINGH:
  But if they actually want a government—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Singh, resume your seat! Interjections are disorderly. Senators are expected to be heard in silence. Senator Singh, please address your remarks to the chair.




Senator SINGH:
  I am someone in the Labor Party—and I'm not the only person in the Labor Party—who has taken a very, very active and compassionate role in relation to the rights and the plight of refugees and asylum seekers for years. I will not have the Greens come into this place and pretend that they are holier than thou with their moral virtues, that they are somehow going to resolve this awful situation when they simply have no power to do so. Moving a motion in this place is not going to resolve that. No matter how many tweets, Facebook posts and media stunts you do they are not going to resolve that, so grow up! Grow up, and start to work out how to create good policy. The dark green taint of Senator McKim gives Senator Richard Di Natale absolutely no support whatsoever. I'm sure he will soon realise that.


I think that the Greens, to be honest, are trying somehow to remain relevant in a time when they have become more and more irrelevant. The more they've moved away from the trees and tried to move into mainstream politics, the more they have failed. So the only way that they continue to remain relevant is by wedging the progressive side of politics—by wedging the very people who have decency, who have humanity and who have care for people who sought out our protection, who sought asylum.


I am so sick of it. So many people on this side are sick of it. Why don't you actually attack the government? It's the government that is treating people so badly. It's the government that can change its policies. That's what we do! We actually address the fact that it's the government failing these people and that it's the government that needs to find solutions. Why don't you go to New Zealand and talk to new Labour Prime Minister Ardern about her offer and ensure that Malcolm Turnbull takes it up? No, you attack the Labor Party. That's the Greens. That's what happens when the Greens run out of ideas about how to continue to increase their vote numbers. Let's face it, we know their dishonest approach when it comes to this debate.


Well, here we are, in a situation that is a calamity. It is indeed a catastrophe, and I do fear for the lives of those men on Manus Island. I fear for their safety and I fear for their lives. And I will continue, day in, day out, to try to ensure that the government moves on this issue and settles these refugees so that this terrible situation comes to an end.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:47):  I rise to speak about what this matter of public importance is actually about, and that is the fate of those innocent people languishing in a jail where water and sanitation have been cut off. It is a humanitarian catastrophe, a crisis that needs to be resolved, and resolved urgently.


We now have over 400 men enclosed in the former detention centre, where food, water, sanitation and medical supplies, including medication, have been cut off from these people. As a doctor, I can only imagine what the health consequences of these actions will be. We are going to see the spread of disease as a result of the lack of access to clean drinking water and to sanitation. That is a sure thing if this continues.


We know that many of these people are traumatised. They have fled wars. They have fled persecution and trauma. These are traumatised people, many of whom are depressed and many of whom are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Their psychotropic medication has now been withdrawn. We know that the abrupt withdrawal of medication like that can precipitate suicide. We know that people will die. Anti-convulsant medication has been taken away from people with epilepsy. It is remarkable that here we are in 21st century Australia and we have a government that is prepared to inflict more cruelty and more trauma on innocent people who are suffering. These aren't just the words of the Greens or of refugee advocates. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have said this. We've heard Amnesty International describe what has happened to these people as torture. They are all saying this is a humanitarian crisis.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Who is?




Senator DI NATALE:
  I just said. I'll take Senator Macdonald's interjection. The UnitedNations and Human Rights Watch define this as a humanitarian crisis.


More than a week ago we saw water, electricity and food supplies cut off. People have been told, 'You need to move out,' but we know from the UNHCR that the reported facilities that were supposed to be ready are not fit for human habitation. But that, of course, is not the major issue. The major issue is that we are asking people to come out of that detention centre and go into an environment where there are a number of people in the local community who simply don't want them there and who are prepared to use violence to resolve this conflict. The fear of these individuals is real.


I pay tribute to Senator McKim for having the bravery and the courage to go there and bear witness to what's going on. Senator McKim stands like a beacon in this place for being prepared to bear witness. It's remarkable that people in this place would accuse Senator McKim and others of inciting violence, as though these individuals have no agency and no capacity or, because these are people who are coming from another culture, somehow they're not capable of making their own decisions. It is remarkable. The time has come for us to accept, at the very least, New Zealand's offer of generosity to take those 150 people, and to ditch the deal with the US. For God's sake, let's show a bit of humanity and a bit of decency. Why can't we bring them here? Why can't we offer these people safety?

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:51):  What an inconvenient situation for the Greens political party that I just happened to be in Papua New Guinea last week. Some lawyers, no doubt egged on by Senator McKim—and the usual bunch of lawyers that we get at every Senate estimates committee—took proceedings within the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea. That court met just last Tuesday, the 7th. The claim by these people was that the closure was unconstitutional. They were seeking orders from the Supreme Court to restrain military personnel from taking over the naval base. They were claiming orders that food should be restored and electricity and water supplies should be restored. But, of course, that was opposed by the PNG government, who are the relevant government, on the basis that services were fully provided at the east Lorengau detention centre for refugees, at the west Lorengau detention centre for refugees and at the Hillside centre for non-refugees.


I know it's not possible in this chamber for me to use props or to show this photograph, but let me describe the photograph from The National, the newspaper of Papua New Guinea, which has a policeman pointing to the east Lorengau camp that has been set up. I can't show this, but might I say it looks like a 1980s motel in Australia. It's a long building. It looks to contain 50 or so rooms. It's hard walled with cement pylons, windows and air conditioning. It has panels on the roof for electricity. When the Supreme Court heard all of the evidence from reliable sources, it dismissed the claim, saying that there were alternative facilities available. All of the lies you hear from the Greens political party and GetUp! about this being a humanitarian crisis and that people are living in a hovel are completely unnecessary, because the PNG government has provided not one, not two, but three other facilities where there is water, there is food, there is every facility and there is air conditioning—and a lot better than many Australians have in their own home. I will seek later to table this newspaper cutting, which has a photograph of the east Lorengau centre that simply puts the lie to the Greens political party. You can see how they've all gone quiet, because someone has—



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You can say what you like when no-one else is there, Senator McKim, but I happened to be there. I happened to have some discussions with the member for Manus.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  I remind all senators that interjections are disorderly and that senators should address their comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  We're told these people are in a jail. It's the sort of inflammatory language the Greens use. They sent along their GetUp! people to invade my office last Friday when I was in PNG at the time—they were too stupid to come when I was there—and they got themselves arrested because they intimidated my staff. But we expect those sorts of things from the Greens and GetUp!. If Senator McKim and Senator Singh want to know what's really happening, why go to UNHCR officials? Some of them are good; some of them you couldn't describe that way. Why not go to the honest, hardworking Australian public servants who know what is happening there?


I have the misfortune of chairing the estimates committee where immigration is brought up, and every time Senator McKim keeps asking the same questions and being told by Australian public servants what the situation is. The situation is that these people—who are not refugees, most of whom have been found not to be refugees; those who are refugees have been invited to apply to go to America or can settle within Papua New Guinea—are currently getting $174 a week in pay from the Australian taxpayer in addition to medical care and accommodation, which includes all of their food.


As Senator McKim has been told time and time again, the people on Manus are free to move around the island and in the general community there. The Courier Mail showed a wonderful photo of some of these so-called refugees being confined there, looking like they're on a holiday on a tropical island. They're allowed to do that. They live there freely. They can come and go as they please. Again, this is evidence in the Senate estimates committee. The service is much nicer at east Lorengau—I'm quoting an Australian official—than in the regional processing centre, which is where they were. All the accommodation being offered is hard walled. Each of the units in east Lorengau that people will be living in have a shared kitchen, a living facility, a number of bedrooms and a bathroom. They have a washing machine facility adjacent to the unit areas, as well as prayer rooms and other service areas where they can congregate and meet, and there are training facilities as well. Does this sound like a jail? Does this sound like the police and army in PNG are herding these people around and tipping over their only source of water? They only have to walk—they don't have to walk, they will be transported by the PNG officials—a couple of minutes away to three wonderful sites that are available and have all the food, all the medication, all the doctors, all the resources that are needed.


Yet Senator McKim would have Australians believe—and he fools some people. Some of these GetUp! numpties that run around protesting might be fooled by Senator McKim, but why don't they find out the real facts and not take the word of Senator McKim, who has a clear personal interest in this? I often wonder just how much the people smugglers donate to the Greens political party at election time, because every one of these illegal maritime arrivals was paying the people smugglers $15,000 per person. They're hardly poor people. That's in addition to the airfare to Indonesia. Senator McKim goes up there and gives these people false hope. He tells them that, if they protest enough, they might eventually get into Australia, but they will not get into Australia. They should know that. They have wonderful accommodation facilities, with food, water, clothing, electricity and air conditioning, just around the corner. But don't take my word for it; go and read the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, which made findings of fact that there was no case for those people to stay there; there was nothing holding them there; there were other perfectly good facilities, with food, water, shelter and clothing, just around the corner.


It would help if some of the people there weren't alleged to have committed sexual offences on under-aged children there. That has upset some of the locals; I know that. But the majority of those there are not in that category and they are free to come and go. In fact, as someone said in the newspaper in PNG while unfortunately I just happened to be there last week, Senator McKim, these people have actually been moving from this site to these other sites for the last three years, walking back and forth quite safely with no threat to their lives or persons. All of the facilities are there and available.


I cannot believe how Greens political party members can tell blatant lies about the situation there when it is there for anyone to see.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Senator McKim, a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  Yes, a point of order: that is clearly an unparliamentary allegation that Senator Macdonald has raised.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator McKim. It wasn't directed at any individual senator. That is not a point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It's true! The Greens political party did go around making up these lies to try to convince the gullible people who they then sent to invade my office in Townsville and intimidate my staff. Can I tell you, Senator McKim: if you're going to send them, next time at least get them to go while I'm there. They won't worry me—that is, if they get out of jail in time.


I don't want to demean this debate. I just ask anyone interested in the facts—



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  rather than the lies, to have a look at what Australian public servants say; to have a look at what the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea says—the actual facts of what's available. Everything you've heard from Senator McKim in this debate and elsewhere is factually wrong.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-11-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:02):  Peter Dutton should be charged and tried with crimes against humanity. The evidence is clear from UN bodies, the AMA and Amnesty, and we've heard the contributions of Senators Nick McKim and Richard Di Natale—like Senator Di Natale's description of what is happening to the health of the 600 men forced into the most appalling situation, which is deeply shocking on its own, and Senator McKim's description of the deprivation with regard to the removal of water containers.


How could it come to this? We know why it's come to this. The Liberals and the Nationals see this as a way to retain power. They have been cultivating fear of refugees in this country for so long. This is the ugly side of politics in the 21st century. That it has come to this is incredible. I've lived in this country all my life, but to see our government, whatever its persuasion, doing this is deeply shocking. Peter Dutton, the minister, is holding on to his seat by 1,505 votes. That is what is motivating him so deeply to cultivate this fear amongst people, hoping that's how he can cling on to power. How forceful he is in wanting to retain that tactic was shown in the way he handled the offer from the new Prime Minister of New Zealand, Prime Minister Ardern, which said very clearly that 150 of these people could go to New Zealand. Before the Australian Prime Minister had had the opportunity to discuss that offer with the New Zealand Prime Minister, he was already out there condemning and rejecting it, because he wants to hold on to this scare tactic that they're running.


Why? Because we also know what the purpose of Manus is. The Prime Minister knows it, the former minister, Mr Morrison, knows it and Minister Dutton knows it—that is, they are using Manus Island as a deterrent by making the whole place so repulsive, so brutal. The degree of suffering, abuse and torture that the 600 men who have been there for many months have experienced is beyond belief. And that's the intent of this island—to make it so repulsive that the message will percolate out: 'Don't try and come to Australia; it's a ruthless regime, and this is what will happen to you.' So that's the situation with the coalition.


Now, as to Labor: Labor do need to look at what they're doing. There is a pathway for them to change their position. The United Nations Human Rights Council has called for Manus to be closed immediately. The United Nations refugee council has talked about the unspeakable persecution going on there. And, despite what Senator Macdonald says, the PNG government has said, very clearly, that this is Australia's responsibility, as have all those people there—the AMA; Catholic Social Services; Amnesty. Labor, if they could find their backbone, would have the backing of so many. They can have a pathway to standing up and doing the right thing by Australian law and by international law.


I do congratulate the protesters who disrupted the Melbourne Cup, and those who got onto the Opera House and took over the immigration department. Direct action is now being taken up by more people. People are angry in Australia; they're deeply disturbed. I very much congratulate Senator Nick McKim for going to that island and getting evidence from those people and bringing it back here. The clear message now is: evacuate. Evacuate now. Bring these 600 people to safety. That's 600 people; other countries have millions of refugees. It's time we did the right thing, and it should start with these 600 men.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:06):  I acknowledge the passion and fire that's in the debate currently before the chamber. A number of positions have been purported to be that of the Labor Party. I think it's really instructive to note general business notice of motion No. 552, moved by Senator Carr and carried by 31 to 28 votes in this chamber today. That clearly and succinctly sets out the position of the Australian Labor Party. It reads:


That the Senate—


(a) acknowledges the failure of the Abbott-Turnbull Government to manage offshore processing arrangements and secure other third country resettlement arrangements for eligible refugees;


(b) notes the United States of America refugee resettlement agreement will resettle up to 1 250 eligible refugees from Manus Island and Nauru but that some eligible refugees will miss out on the opportunity to resettle in America;


(c) acknowledges former Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced an agreement with Prime Minister John Key on 9 February 2013 at the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders' meeting that:


   (i) New Zealand would resettle 150 refugees annually from Australia, including refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, and


   (ii) the first refugees would be resettled in 2014;


(d) notes that, if former Prime Minister Tony Abbott had not withdrawn from the agreement, as many as 600 refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand by now;


(e) acknowledges the inquiry and report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, Serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, and any like allegations in relation to the Manus, and in particular, recommendation 7: ""The committee recommends that the Australian Government give serious consideration to all resettlement offers it receives, including the Government of New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru. Further, if particular resettlement offers are considered unsuitable, the Government should clearly outline the reasons"";


(f) notes New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has renewed the offer to Australia to resettle 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru;


(g) notes Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has failed to explain why he will not accept New Zealand's offer to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru; and—


finally in this motion, the very good work of Senator Carr and others—


(h) calls on the Turnbull Government to immediately accept New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru and begin negotiating appropriate conditions, similar to the United States refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people.


This has been an issue ever since I came into this place on, I think, 1 July 2011. I can remember Senator Cash being extremely vocal on this issue. It occurred to me at that time. Right at that point I thought: 'This is Australia. Why are we fighting over this issue? Our reputation as a taker of humanitarian refugees is without question.' Without question, we have taken more humanitarian refugees per capita than almost any other nation in the world. We've done it well, we've done it successfully and I think we did it in a bipartisan way. But the tragedy of this situation now is that we can't find our way through what looks like a pretty awful situation.


I don't like to turn on the TV and see people in distress anywhere, and we certainly don't like to see people who ostensibly are under the support, care and protection of the Australian government without electricity, water, medical facilities and the like. But I'm not sure that the political parties in this place at the moment—and I exempt the Labor Party from this, but I include the Greens party and the coalition—are really working in any way collegiately and cooperatively to a proper resolution.


It appears as if our Prime Minister has unerringly bad judgement and, whenever there is a chance to make a decision, he will unfailingly make the wrong decision. There is evidence of that right throughout his prime ministership. If ever there was a case for a Prime Minister to grab an issue by the whatever you'd like to refer to and show some genuine leadership, this is it. There have been a succession of ministers in this space. I do not talk at first hand, but I've heard in our caucus previous ministers in this space who have been distressed. The immigration portfolio has been a life-changing experience. It has really changed the way they've thought about and looked at the whole of our activity in this space. So it is not an easy portfolio and we had many problems, but what has happened has become immensely political now. 


I get, like every senator in this place, the genuine concern. Australian constituents are making appointments, coming into my office and asking me to support positions which are contrary to my party policy and probably contrary to the fairly pragmatic position that I hold, but I understand the passion which they feel. They want these people to be in a better space, and it's a genuinely widely felt and deeply felt issue right throughout the Australian community. If ever there was one issue which we should be working together on, this is the type of issue where we should have no difference. Labor, Liberal, Green, Australian Conservatives—no-one should be allowed to get away with playing tawdry political games in this space.


Australia has an enviable reputation as a haven for people in humanitarian refugee intakes. I went to the town of Mount Gambier a couple of years ago, just after I became a senator. We had taken Karen refugees from the Burmese border. We had taken a chance, so to speak. We relocated them into regional South Australia, and in a very short space of time their children had taken over the schools. They were excellent in every area. The parents had got into viticulture and were all excelling at contributing to the economy. At their Australian citizenship ceremony, they sang the anthem in English, and all of them were working. We do this very well.


There is this really hard economic line about people who are refugees. Let's face it: we know that the stats say that quite a large proportion of these people on Manus Island are refugees. If we're not going to let them in here, we should be resettling them somewhere else. We shouldn't be simply saying, 'The door's closed here; you can rot in New Guinea,' because I don't think I would like to live in New Guinea. I don't think I would like the opportunity to participate in the New Guinea economy, and I qualify all this by saying I have never been in New Guinea, but, from what I have seen of some of the problems that any country that's developing has, it's not a place where I would like to go and resettle. So you can understand that these people are not actually inspired to settle in New Guinea.


But I really do think that we ought to do this debate a bit of justice and rise above the petty pointscoring and politics. I respect Senator Rhiannon's contribution, but I don't really think that roughing people up at a fundraiser or becoming strident in your verbal and physical actions is going to bring a result that helps people. I think the division that has been shown in this last hour is the problem. Harder heads need to get together, sit down and work out a compromise solution which sees these people move to New Zealand or move to the United States or move to any other resettlement option.


I don't disagree in some respects that the Hon. Peter Dutton would be the hardest of people in this space. Given that it's an extremely hard task, he has not shown any compassion, any mercy or anything other than, 'My way or the highway,' and, 'I am right on this.' Anyway, what it really looks like, and what I really have some discomfort with, is that he seems to think it's good politics. Well, if it is good politics and it gets him some votes, it's a disgraceful way to get votes by treading on people's humanity, by not affording them the generosity that was afforded to me, my family, Senator Dastyari's family and many hundreds of thousands, in fact millions, of Australians who came to this country, made a good life and were welcomed. If you want to play politics, this is the wrong issue.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (17:16):  For two weeks now, over 600 asylum seekers and refugees have been holed up in the Manus Regional Processing Centre and have rightly refused to move to the new transit accommodation at Lorengau, which they fear very much is not secure. While these men endure squalid conditions, it is business as usual for this government. Drinking water, food, medical treatment, electricity and sewerage services have been cut off. The government has now made this PNG's problem, when it really very much should be ours.


This is an international embarrassment. Worse, how can Australia diplomatically counsel other countries about their human rights obligations when we are clearly—very clearly—failing ours? Need we be reminded that in June the government settled a $70 million class action brought about by more than 1,900 men who were detained in hostile and damaging conditions? It seems that, once asylum seekers arrive by boat, this government forgets that they are human beings with needs and emotions, no different from any of us here. Many have suffered terrible events in their home country and continue to suffer in detention.


The new transit accommodation has been hastily erected, and, according to the UNHCR, the West Lorengau transit facility was still incomplete by the time the men were due to move in on 31 October. This still appears to be the case.


Given the fact that the local community doesn't want them there and these detainees are really Australia's responsibility, the government should consider New Zealand's genuine offer to resettle 150 asylum seekers. That is 150 men and women who finally get a chance to live a full and peaceful life. As for the government's argument that it will encourage asylum seekers to use New Zealand as a back door to Australia, well, that argument is very flimsy. Besides the fact that it insults New Zealand by implying that people our neighbour accepts would immediately seek to leave rather than stay there, I fail to see how this argument can be sustained. Firstly, New Zealand is only proposing to take 150 people. It's not an open-ended offer. Secondly, a similar argument can be made against the US deal, which the government was so happy to jump on.


Too many asylum seekers spend too many years wallowing in immigration detention. The irony and the horror are that we are simply doing more damage to already traumatised people, and we offer them no hope. I add my voice to that of the UNHCR and many others urging the government to accept New Zealand's offer and, over and above that, to remember its humanity and expedite resettlement of all our offshore detainees.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:19):  The humanitarian disaster that is unfolding on Manus Island makes me ashamed to be an Australian. The Australia that I know and love is a welcoming place. It's a place where we value people from all over the world. In particular, it's a place where we have welcomed refugees with open arms for decades and decades. The Australians that I know have good hearts. The Australians that I know do not condone torture—and that's what we are doing to these innocent people. The UNHCR says indefinite detention is torture—let alone leaving men to die, which is what is going on in the Manus Island detention centre now. This is Australia's Guantanamo Bay. This is our Gitmo.


The people of Australia are saying it's not happening in our name. The caring, thoughtful, welcoming people of Australia, who live in our diverse multicultural community, know that these people who we have locked up indefinitely, these people who have lost all hope, are our brothers, they are other people's brothers, they are people's husbands, they are people's children, they are people who love and live and just want a chance to be living a good life. They are people who have fled persecution from many different parts of the world—from Iran, from Iraq, from Burma. They are the Rohingyan refugees whom we in this place over the last month have been so concerned about and wanting to make sure that they could have a good life. That's who these people are. But because in their desperation to flee persecution they got on a boat to come to Australia we have turned our backs on them and said no. We've said: 'We don't see you as humans. We're just going to treat you as collateral damage. You are just the scapegoats. You are just going to be the example for the rest of the world to stop the boats.' And these men are dying to be that example.


That is not the Australia that I want to be part of. These men deserve a life. We know that we haven't even stopped the boats by having them at Manus island. We are just turning the boats away and not talking about it. We know what needs to happen to stop the boats—and that is for the world, including Australia, to accept that there are millions of refugees in the world who need to be resettled and that we need to be having serious attempts to create peace in their countries. These people are going to need to have places to be resettled in. We need to be lifting our intake of refugees in Australia, not turning people away.



We've got a chance to reshape what's going on now and actually say, 'Enough is enough. These people deserve to come to Australia. They can be Australians. They will fit in as Australians like refugees before them have done.' We have 400 people fleeing persecution. We have people there who can't be resettled in PNG because of its anti-homosexuality legislation. They would continue to be persecuted if they were to live in PNG. We should be welcoming these people as our fellow Australians and showing Australia to be the humanitarian, caring, welcoming country that we once were. (Time expired)

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (18:28):  This is not my first speech. I will continue on from where I was interrupted by question time by going to the nature of the housing crisis which is gripping our nation and locking my generation out of the housing market altogether. There are currently over 200,000 applicants waiting on the Australian social housing waiting list across the country. Of those, 69,000 are classed as in great need, meaning that they are either homeless or experiencing great risk to their health and safety on the part of their housing situation. We have a situation today in Australia where the policy mechanisms which have been adopted by this chamber and the other place have worked to create a housing market in which it is now impossible for those particularly of my generation to think of home ownership as anything other than a distant dream.


It is, quite frankly, absurd and perverse that I, as a 23-year-old Australian and senator in this place, am one of the only people of my age who could now ever consider buying or purchasing my own home. This isn't in any way surprising, and it isn't, in many ways, new. The average cost, as a percentage of disposable household income, of the average home loan has risen from 32 per cent in 1988 to 134 per cent as of 2015. Rental costs have increased 44 per cent over that time period, and, unsurprisingly, home ownership among young people has dropped significantly over that same period.


It's very easy for us all to sit here and quote these facts and statistics in the abstract as though they don't have human consequences, but I know from firsthand experience that they do. There are over 10,000 people in my home state who will tonight go to sleep without a home. Of those 10,000, 42 per cent will be below the age of 25. In my local suburb of Rockingham and in the neighbouring suburb of Mandurah, over 200 people in each suburb will go to sleep on the streets. These people are treated as though they are not our fellow Australians. They are quite often treated as though they are lesser than the animals with which they sometimes sleep. They are moved on; they are shunned; they are treated as less-thans.


They do not feature often in our political debate, and I do not find that surprising. I have been in Canberra less than a week and yet I'm already under no illusion as to why it is that issues such as homelessness and poverty so infrequently make it onto the discussion paper in this place, except when the Greens bring them up. We are paid a couple of hundred bucks every day for being here. We are on one of the highest wages in the nation. We do not see, we do not know, we do not often interact with people who experience these things.


It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that the legislation proposed by the government does little or nothing to address this fundamental issue. The reality is that the coalition government—which is so poorly represented in the chamber at the moment—upon coming into government, cut no less than $500 million from the homelessness sector under the guise of a budget emergency which we had to address lest the entire place burned down. It is quite funny to me that, subsequent to having to find that $500 million for the running of the nation, it was then able to find a further $500 million for a military exercise to follow the United States into a bombing campaign in Syria with no clear aim or objective or end date. Yet these are the decisions that we make in this place; these are the priorities of this chamber. You are confronted with the reality that your inability to act on this issue is causing people to die nightly on the streets of every single capital in this country.


It is within the power of this chamber to change that reality for the lives of tens of thousands of people and confront the vested interests, which so often seem to influence your decision-making processes to act in the common good, not just to tinker with negative gearing but to end it. It is within the power of this chamber to confront the scam of capital gains tax exemptions, where we—young people, workers, older Australians, mums and dads—subsidise a tax mechanism of which over 70 per cent of the profits go to the 10 per cent most wealthy households in the country. We could end that right now. We could inject billions of dollars into the affordable housing sector and into the community housing sector. We could establish, right now, a national rental standard so that nobody is forced into the situation where, if they are lucky enough to be able to rent a premises, that premises has a roof that leaks, no air conditioning or no floor. We could establish national tenancy rights standards so that tenants are always on an equal footing with landlords, and we could ensure that rental amounts are affordable for those who are faced with the need to pay them. The reality is that only 2.9 per cent of rental properties on the market right now are affordable and only 0.2 per cent of that number are affordable if you are on the Newstart payment. We could change this right now. The Greens would support any motion in this place to do so, and we back this legislation because at least it admits that the policies of this government are part of the problem—that homelessness is not inevitable and that it is not a reflection of a social or personal failing; it is a reflection of a policy failing, policies which have been passed through this chamber within my lifetime. We could do these things, but we do not. Instead, we sit here and we fiddle. We fiddle while people die on our streets.


I support this legislation. It spasms in the right direction, but it goes nowhere near as far as is needed. I would ask every senator in this chamber who does not sit with me on the Greens benches to reflect upon why they believe that serving the vested interests of those groups who lobby for the continuation of these policies, which do nothing but exacerbate this problem, is more important than serving the people who elected them to this chamber. Thank you.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:38):  I rise, too, to speak on the bills that we have before us and to say that Labor will not be opposing the passage of these bills through this chamber. However, we should be under no illusion about the government's measures in these bill, despite the rhetoric that we've heard from those opposite. They will do nothing to make housing more affordable. Sadly, that action has not been forthcoming from the Turnbull government. We have two bills that do nothing to address the housing crisis, and we need a comprehensive response to the crisis.


The first of the bills before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017, seeks to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for CGT purposes. This is an integrity measure that is meant to address concerns that some taxpayers have been claiming travel deductions without correctly apportioning costs or have claimed travel costs that were for private purposes. The second bill, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, imposes the vacancy fee and establishes the amount payable. Broadly, the fee, which will be payable when a dwelling is left vacant, is the fee that was payable at the time of the foreign investment application.


I must be clear: Labor is all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted, but we are the party which has been leading the debate on this. As previous speakers have noted on the Labor side—and on the Greens side—this is not a housing affordability measure. As we know, housing is a powerful determinant of social and economic participation. Australia is in a housing crisis—a crisis of supply and a crisis of affordability. This housing crisis has far-reaching consequences: people experiencing homelessness, people in rental stress, first home buyers and people relocating or downsizing. Recently, at the ACT Housing and Homelessness Summit, Labor's shadow minister for housing, Senator Doug Cameron, outlined the challenge for us:


The government's Affordable Housing Working Group has estimated that an additional 6,000 social housing dwellings will be required each year just to keep pace with future population growth, without addressing the backlog of need.


A more comprehensive estimate prepared by Dr Judith Yates for the Council for Economic Development of Australia is that Australia needs 20,000 extra affordable housing dwellings each year for at least a decade to address the backlog of need among those on low to moderate incomes.


Using the most recent estimates for the number of households in rental stress, of which there are 527,500, even if half of all the 220,000 new dwellings built each year were made affordable and available to low-moderate income households, it would take over 5 years of new supply to address rental stress amongst Australia’s poorest households. 


…   …   …


In April this year, Labor announced a package of measures that included $88 million over two years to improve transitional housing options for women and children escaping family and domestic violence, young people exiting out-of-home care and older women under financial stress who are at risk of homelessness.


A Labor government will develop and implement a national plan to reduce homelessness through the Council of Australian Governments. There is a massive gap in housing policy, and we need national leadership to address it. Labor's response to the housing and homelessness challenge requires a concerted, cooperative effort across all levels of government and society. Labor's current policies to address housing affordability include reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax and support for the creation of a bond aggregator to facilitate investment in social and affordable housing. They are important steps, but we are not stopping there. Labor is providing the national leadership that is necessary to drive a concerted national plan to address the housing crisis.


Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability and homelessness crisis. House prices in many major cities have skyrocketed. Home ownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing. The housing crisis is only getting worse. Since the government came to office in September 2013, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with increases of nearly 50 per cent in Sydney and over 30 per cent in Melbourne. Home ownership is at a 60-year low, and home ownership rates for 25- to 35-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the past 30 years.


Skyrocketing house prices have long been an issue in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, but they are now becoming a major issue in my home state of Tasmania, with house prices in Hobart now the second highest in the nation in terms of growth, according to a recent report commissioned by the insurer QBE. The report that was put out and reported on by ABC News on 25 October 2017 notes that the median house price in Hobart is forecast to rise by 11 per cent to $470,000 by 2020, while the median price for units is expected to rise by nine per cent, reaching $360,000. These sorts of prices mean that the Australian dream is very fast getting out of reach for so many Tasmanians. It has also resulted in a further tightening of the rental market, putting further stress on those already doing it tough. 


We cannot afford to ignore the human face of this. There are currently 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. If you're on one of the lowest income support payments like youth allowance or Newstart, the possibility of just renting is getting out of reach. Something needs to change. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, if current policy settings remain in place, Australia's housing affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years. In Labor's view that is completely unacceptable. This is a situation that requires action. According to the recently released Rental Affordability Index, relative to wages Hobart is the second most unaffordable Australian city after Sydney in which to rent. It is more expensive to rent a house in Hobart than it is in Melbourne or Brisbane. This disproportionately impacts on young people, who are also being priced out of the home ownership market. While Hobart's annual nine per cent growth in house prices might be appealing to people lucky enough to own their own homes, it means the door to home ownership for many young people is being slammed shut. Cashed-up speculators, many from interstate, outbid young Tasmanian first home buyers for the limited housing stock. 


The Liberals, this government, do not have a good story to tell us on housing affordability. Under their watch, home ownership rates have fallen lower than at any other point in the last 60 years. First home buyers now make up only around 17 per cent of all home purchases. This is well below the historic average of 20 per cent. The coalition government appear to have no clue on how to go about fixing this problem or, if I was being unkind, I would say they didn't care, and in government the Liberals have made things worse. Since coming to government, first under Mr Abbott and now Mr Turnbull, they have refused to address unfair and distorting tax breaks for investors. They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was essential for a number of complexes and projects in Tasmania that have been now completed. Without that National Rental Affordability Scheme those projects that now house hundreds of people would not have been able to go ahead. 


The coalition government defunded homelessness and community housing peak bodies. They failed to appoint a housing minister, so there is no-one leading the charge within the government. They abolished the National Housing Supply Council. This list is not the complete story on the government's failures. Unlike the Liberals, Labor has a plan for making more Australians have access to the housing market. Labor's policies will see the construction of over 55,000 new homes in Australia over three years and boost employment by 25,000 new jobs per year. Labor plans to improve housing affordability, increase financial stability, reduce homelessness and boost jobs.


As my colleague Senator Gallagher noted in her contribution yesterday, Labor will reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. We will limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds. Labor will facilitate a COAG process to introduce uniform vacant property tax across all major cities, and Labor will re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and reinstate a leader on housing—a minister for housing. We will implement those measures, along with others, because, unlike this government, Labor believe that the current affordable housing crisis in Australia is completely unacceptable. It requires the federal government to step in and fix it. We cannot sit on the sidelines and just hope the market will sort it out, because it won't.


Every Saturday in Australia, first home buyers are outbid at auctions by wealthy investors and property speculators who are taking advantage of some of the most generous tax concessions in the world. The current arrangements provide a bigger tax concession to an investor buying their fifth home than a young couple buying their first. How is it fair that an investor buying their fifth home receives a bigger tax concession than a young couple buying their first? Demand for housing is being turbocharged by unsustainable and distortionary tax concessions for investors. More than 90 per cent of lending for investment properties is for existing housing stock. 


Labor will take action where the Liberals are unwilling to. We will limit future negative gearing concessions to new housing and reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. These changes will moderate the growth of house prices and redirect generous tax concessions to where we most need investment—in new housing. Redirecting investment in new housing will increase housing supply and in the process will create jobs in the construction and building sector. The McKell Institute has estimated a 10 per cent increase in construction as a result of these changes, creating up to 18,500 new homes and, as I previously mentioned, as many as 25,000 new jobs per year.


Labor does not believe in retrospective tax changes. No current investments will be impacted by this change. The independent Parliamentary Budget Office has recosted the fiscal impact of this policy. This would improve the budget by $37.8 billion over the medium term. Labor's housing policy will create jobs, it will assist in budget repair and it will begin to fix the current housing affordability crisis. Housing prices in many major cities, as many of the senators that have contributed have indicated, have skyrocketed. Homeownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing—all while the government continue to sit on their hands. The current situation cannot go on. What do we have from the Turnbull government? It is a government that continues to defend existing negative gearing arrangements and capital gains tax discounts, the vast bulk of which go to those in the top 10 per cent of the income distribution. The government knows that. I'm sure Senator Smith knows that. The vast bulk of those discounts go to those in the top 10 per cent of income distribution. Change is needed and it is needed now.


As I said earlier, Labor will not oppose these bills, but make no mistake: these measures have nothing to do with housing affordability. In fact, as I said, two of these are very clearly described as integrity measures. Any housing affordability package that does not deal with negative gearing and capital gains tax discount is a sham. The government needs to deal with both negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, otherwise it will stand condemned. Labor has been leading the way on housing affordability through Senator Cameron, as the shadow minister for housing, and only Labor will properly deal with a system that advantages investors over first home buyers.


I want to once again put on record what is happening in my home town. As we know, in Tasmania, there have been reports produced about the housing property market squeezing out those who are most disadvantaged. Meg Webb of Anglicare's Social Action and Research Centre said that the rising prices—and I'm paraphrasing here—may be good for the market, but the same cannot be said for the 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. When Senator Duniam came in here yesterday to make his contribution on this legislation, he also talked about Hobart and the fact that house prices are rising. But, as far as I can recall from his contribution, he made no mention of the fact that 3,000 Tasmanians are currently on waiting lists for public and social housing. 


As I said when I started my contribution, Labor won't be opposing these bills, but these bills do not make a policy on housing affordability. (Time expired)

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:58):  Tonight about 100,000 people across Australia have no home to go to. But, meanwhile, across Australia there are many more than 100,000 homes that are vacant. That's clearly a scandal. It's a scandal that's one of the many housing scandals that's been dominating headlines for the past year. We know how serious it is. We know how hard it is for people to buy their first home. Young people, and particularly older women, are really finding it tough to stay in the housing market. So many people are close to being in a very serious situation. It's estimated that 2.3 million people are in housing stress. That means that they're one disaster away from being on the slippery slope to joining the more than 100,000 people who are homeless. If their kids get sick, if they lose their job or if they have an accident at work and their income stops, then their ability to pay their rent or their mortgage can suffer, and it's all part of this housing crisis that's been dominating the news. The issue relating to vacant houses really has scandalised people. We see more and more people sleeping on our streets—literally on our streets—and there are so many vacant houses. 


So, we have this legislation before us. What does the government come up with? The vacancy fees bill. It sounds good—fees on vacant houses. Who can argue with that? But we need to look at it more closely, because the fees only apply to foreign investors. Now, you really have to ask, when you get to this point and you realise what the government is up to: what's the difference between an investor from China and one from Point Piper, Double Bay, North Sydney, or you name it? What's the difference with who owns this vacant property? What's going on here? 


The government knows exactly what it's doing. There are a few reasons it has come up with this vacancy fees bill. It has come up with it because it needs to appear to be doing something, because the housing issue has been dominating the headlines so much for so long. But it's not just working-class families; many middle-class families are really worried about what the future holds for their children and for their loved ones, so the government had to come up with a position that gives the appearance they are doing something. And they need to deliver for their constituency: the big end of town, the property developers, the investment speculators, the real estate agencies.


But there's also a racist aspect to this, because this is dog whistling. You can get out there and do your grabs and say: 'We're doing something. We're pursuing the foreign owners.' Why do that? There's absolutely no difference at all, but the Liberal-National Party government under Prime Minister Turnbull is doing the classic dog whistling: getting out there at every turn and talking about foreign ownership of houses. People do raise it with me. They're certainly hearing that, and they're picking up on the fear. There's no need to be fearful. We need action—we certainly need action on vacant houses—but what the government is doing here is totally minimalist.


I said another reason that they're doing this is to deliver for their constituency. The constituency is very generous to the Liberal and National parties and also at times to the Labor Party. Over the past 10 years, property developers, property speculators and the real estate industry have donated more than $21 million to the Labor, Liberal and National parties. I'm not saying it's Labor's constant constituency, but there have been some years when Labor have picked up more donations from the developers than they have from unions. That's a pretty worrying state of affairs, because this is a powerful industry.


If you look at what goes on in our respective states, you'll see planning laws being weakened for the benefit of those companies, because, when the planning laws are weakened, they can make more profits. That's what's going on here. Again, what's the job of the Liberals and Nationals when they get into government? Deliver for their constituency. At the moment that means not going hard on the housing crisis that is making life so difficult for so many people, where they don't have certainty about their future and where many people are in insecure housing.


The government might pay lip service to addressing the housing crisis, but for their constituency a housing crisis works for them. What I mean by that is that they make more profits, which is what their donors, the property sector, need to do. They do it very handsomely—the profits they pull in. When you look at Meriton, Mirvac and many of those other big companies, they're making millions and millions of dollars profit every year. They're pulling in big money. That, again, is why the bill before us is so absolutely minimal.


There's the destructive side of the bill, but, even if you look at the foreign ownership side, they're not handling the issue of vacant properties in the way it needs to be. It's not a tough one. What we need to be doing when it comes to housing is recognising that we need universal housing. Housing is a human right. It's something that's recognised along with other human rights, but we barely hear about it in Australia. We have arrived at a shocking situation in this first part of the 21st century. As I said, about 100,000 people will be on the streets tonight. If 100,000 children couldn't get a place in our public schools, there'd be an outcry. It would be on the front page of the paper. If 100,000 sick people—people who had had accidents or had some worry with their health—arrived at hospitals and they couldn't be admitted, that would be scandalous. It's just not possible that it would happen. It's widely recognised, even by people who have their kids in private schools and who have private health insurance, that we need a strong public sector. When it comes to public housing, what's happened around the country, helped by successive federal governments, is that public housing has been smashed, totally discredited. The people who live there are presented as losers, people who are really just not functioning in life. The whole dignity of housing, which should be absolutely the foundation of our approach, has just been decimated in this country.


It was excellent to hear the Greens new senator Senator Andrew Bartlett speaking about the fantastic plans that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. This is precisely the approach that we need, where we have governments committed to public and social housing in such a way that it becomes much more mainstream. I'm not talking about ending the private housing market—there is still a role for that—but we need to resurrect public housing, restore respect for it and restore its dignity so it can get back to the form that it has been in the past. The plan in Queensland, for the Queensland housing trust, is very exciting. They'll start building a million affordable homes. One of the fantastic spin-offs is that, as well as the homes, this will also provide jobs—16,000 jobs a year, over 10 years, to deliver those million affordable homes. These will be homes for life, providing people with certainty because they will be able to afford their home. They will be able to gain support from this trust according to their needs and make repayments according to what they can afford.


This might sound pie-in-the-sky in Australia at the moment, when you consider what the housing market has become. Housing effectively has become another form of money, because it is a way for those who have got two, three, four or five investment properties to be able to use the tax breaks that this government won't do anything about. People who have already got money can make more money out of the way housing works in this country. Yes, we've got to get rid of those tax breaks, but we also need to rebuild the public and the social housing system in this country. Much of Europe already has this. It is not dominated by housing which is stuck in the marketplace, with people really battling and very uncertain about what their future holds because of the price of housing and the price of rents. This really is the healthy way to go; it's the responsible way to go.


If this government, the Liberal-National government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, were serious about housing, what we would be debating tonight would be the winding-down of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, because that's a rort for those who already have money, because of the way it works. It is literally robbing billions of dollars from the public purse—money that could go into something similar to the Queensland housing trust that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. We need something at the federal level like that. We need something like that in all states. This is the responsible way for any government to be taking Australia. Housing is going to become more of a crisis if we do not deal with it. Housing is a human right. Universal housing should be the foundation policy of all parties that are really serious about addressing people's needs.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:09):  This legislation purports to address the housing challenge. As many other participants in the debate have pointed out, it is not going to do a great deal about that. We support the legislation. We support measures to improve tax transparency, but in no way is this legislation an adequate response to the challenges which are facing Australians in relation to housing, and in no way has the government provided more generally an adequate policy response to the challenges of housing. 


In fact, in the not very long time that I've been here, 2½ years, all I have witnessed is a government completely unable to come to grips with this challenge—organisationally in terms of their ministerial and shadow cabinet arrangements but also bureaucratically. Every time we seek information about how the government is responding to the housing crisis, we get given about three different departments—the names of three different groups of people who may or may not be responsible or leading a particular initiative. We get told that one group of people in Treasury is responsible for leading an initiative and then we find out subsequently that actually Prime Minister and Cabinet have had to step in and they are now leading some sort of working group that's convening, and shortly to be replaced by, an IDC. There is total confusion within the Commonwealth about what the goals are for housing policy, who is responsible for leading it within the bureaucracy and what the key actions are to reach those goals. 


The fact that the bill before the chamber today purports to be a bill to address housing but, in fact, really addresses important but, in the context of housing policy, relatively insignificant tax measures says a great deal about how the government's approaching this. It's a great shame, because we do actually have quite a significant problem. There is a very big problem with a lack of affordable rental properties. Every year, Anglicare do this terrific survey where they look at what proportion of the rental properties on the market would be available to certain kinds of income groups. When they looked at it last year, they found that singles on the age pension could afford just 2.1 per cent of the 75,000 properties that they surveyed. Think about that: if you are on the age pension and trying to exist in the private rental market, just 2.1 per cent of the properties available would be suitable for you. 


There is a kind of a myth—and I hear the National Party say this often—'All you have to do is move to Orange' or 'All you have to do is move to the country.' It's a problem in regional areas as well. People on Newstart would only be able to afford 15 per cent of the 18,000 regional properties that were surveyed in this process. Even double-income families struggle. A household with two kids and two parents on a minimum wage would be able to afford just 26 per cent of the surveyed properties. If that same family were trying to get by on Newstart, they'd have access to only 1.9 per cent of the surveyed properties. It's a big problem and it requires a serious solution. We know that one solution that works is public housing. 


When we measure housing stress, a common measure of housing stress is when your housing costs are greater than 30 per cent of your disposable income and the household income is in the bottom 40 per cent of all households. Well, only half a per cent of people in public housing are in that category. One of the key benefits of public housing is that it does represent a serious and effective response to housing stress for very low-income people. Unfortunately, more than 40 per cent of all Australians who are receiving Commonwealth rent assistance are in housing stress. They spend more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. Horrifyingly, 13 per cent of them spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent. These are issues that should shock us and it should be a time when we're thinking about how to provide more public housing and how to provide more social housing. 


There's been a very significant decrease in the number of public rental housing households. Between 2007 and 2014, the number of public rental households decreased from 331,000 to 317,000, a fall of four per cent. Quite a bit of that reflects a transfer of stock from public housing to community housing, because in the same period the number of mainstream community-housing households has almost doubled. It's risen very substantially. But this shifting, this pea-and-thimble trick, doesn't really go to the core of the problem. There is simply not enough affordable housing available for people who need it.


We talk a lot about the pressures in capital cities. In fact, you sometimes get the impression that the main thing that drives our capital city newspapers is the property section. It's hard to go by any day of the week where there isn't a story about house prices in Sydney or Melbourne. But, actually, it is a really big problem in regional areas. I think senators will know that I grew up on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, and as a senator I have occasion to visit the communities on the North Coast of New South Wales. I spent a little bit of time earlier in the year with the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre. They tell me that Coffs Harbour actually doesn't have any crisis accommodation at all. The neighbourhood centre is in a lovely building. It's an old school. It's got one of those old school verandahs that people might remember from when they went to school—you used to hang your bag on the peg on the verandah. The good people at the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre have repurposed that area of their building. It's now a shelter for sometimes 20, sometimes 30, people living in Coffs Harbour who really don't have anywhere to go each evening. There is no crisis accommodation. The neighbourhood centre is not in a position to provide crisis accommodation for these people, but they are able to provide them with a place out of the rain—albeit not inside, but a place on a verandah out of the rain—where they can get a little bit of food in the morning and actually get a little bit of care. They assist these desperate people in their desperate circumstances.


It's troubling that there isn't a more structured response to these problems in our regions. Places like Coffs Harbour might not be growing as fast as the rest of the state, but it's still projected to grow very significantly between now and 2050. I struggle to get any real sense that either the state government in New South Wales or the Commonwealth government is thinking seriously about how these coastal areas cope with some very specific challenges that they face in terms of housing.


Shelter NSW, the peak group that represents housing providers and advocates on housing issues, did some great work, which they released in March this year, which took a look at regional perspectives on housing and homelessness. It's a very useful document, and I encourage senators to go and have a look at it. They go region by region and create a very specific breakdown of the kinds of issues in each of those places that are confronting those communities. In Coffs Harbour, they're finding that house prices and rents on the coast are pushing people westward for affordable rentals. Locally, certain areas have remained affordable, but the housing is run down and the market is becoming very geographically stratified. In a small town everyone knows everyone else, and there are sometimes families—a lot of people with the same name—and it only takes one person with your surname in your family to do the wrong thing for everybody in that family to be shut out of the rental market, because real estate agents are willing to apply essentially discriminatory practices in accepting or rejecting tenants.


The development of university campuses increases competition for housing. Students tend to displace locals, especially in low-end housing. In coastal towns like Coffs Harbour and my own community on the Tweed, there is huge seasonal variation in rental prices. Rents go up dramatically over Christmas and people can find themselves homeless at that point, particularly if you've got a lease that ends in the summer; it's likely that that won't be renewed because the owner is in a position to chase much higher rents from temporary holiday rentals.


There are some real challenges in regional Australia with housing. There are real challenges across the country, but the problem with the bill before us and with all of the policy settings presented by the coalition is that they're not addressing this in any systematic, focused or energetic way. There is a disregard for the issue and an apparent unwillingness to take it seriously. Labor has put a range of policies on the table, particularly around tax, negative gearing and capital gains reform. Unfortunately, these—

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (18:28):  This is not my first speech. I will continue on from where I was interrupted by question time by going to the nature of the housing crisis which is gripping our nation and locking my generation out of the housing market altogether. There are currently over 200,000 applicants waiting on the Australian social housing waiting list across the country. Of those, 69,000 are classed as in great need, meaning that they are either homeless or experiencing great risk to their health and safety on the part of their housing situation. We have a situation today in Australia where the policy mechanisms which have been adopted by this chamber and the other place have worked to create a housing market in which it is now impossible for those particularly of my generation to think of home ownership as anything other than a distant dream.


It is, quite frankly, absurd and perverse that I, as a 23-year-old Australian and senator in this place, am one of the only people of my age who could now ever consider buying or purchasing my own home. This isn't in any way surprising, and it isn't, in many ways, new. The average cost, as a percentage of disposable household income, of the average home loan has risen from 32 per cent in 1988 to 134 per cent as of 2015. Rental costs have increased 44 per cent over that time period, and, unsurprisingly, home ownership among young people has dropped significantly over that same period.


It's very easy for us all to sit here and quote these facts and statistics in the abstract as though they don't have human consequences, but I know from firsthand experience that they do. There are over 10,000 people in my home state who will tonight go to sleep without a home. Of those 10,000, 42 per cent will be below the age of 25. In my local suburb of Rockingham and in the neighbouring suburb of Mandurah, over 200 people in each suburb will go to sleep on the streets. These people are treated as though they are not our fellow Australians. They are quite often treated as though they are lesser than the animals with which they sometimes sleep. They are moved on; they are shunned; they are treated as less-thans.


They do not feature often in our political debate, and I do not find that surprising. I have been in Canberra less than a week and yet I'm already under no illusion as to why it is that issues such as homelessness and poverty so infrequently make it onto the discussion paper in this place, except when the Greens bring them up. We are paid a couple of hundred bucks every day for being here. We are on one of the highest wages in the nation. We do not see, we do not know, we do not often interact with people who experience these things.


It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that the legislation proposed by the government does little or nothing to address this fundamental issue. The reality is that the coalition government—which is so poorly represented in the chamber at the moment—upon coming into government, cut no less than $500 million from the homelessness sector under the guise of a budget emergency which we had to address lest the entire place burned down. It is quite funny to me that, subsequent to having to find that $500 million for the running of the nation, it was then able to find a further $500 million for a military exercise to follow the United States into a bombing campaign in Syria with no clear aim or objective or end date. Yet these are the decisions that we make in this place; these are the priorities of this chamber. You are confronted with the reality that your inability to act on this issue is causing people to die nightly on the streets of every single capital in this country.


It is within the power of this chamber to change that reality for the lives of tens of thousands of people and confront the vested interests, which so often seem to influence your decision-making processes to act in the common good, not just to tinker with negative gearing but to end it. It is within the power of this chamber to confront the scam of capital gains tax exemptions, where we—young people, workers, older Australians, mums and dads—subsidise a tax mechanism of which over 70 per cent of the profits go to the 10 per cent most wealthy households in the country. We could end that right now. We could inject billions of dollars into the affordable housing sector and into the community housing sector. We could establish, right now, a national rental standard so that nobody is forced into the situation where, if they are lucky enough to be able to rent a premises, that premises has a roof that leaks, no air conditioning or no floor. We could establish national tenancy rights standards so that tenants are always on an equal footing with landlords, and we could ensure that rental amounts are affordable for those who are faced with the need to pay them. The reality is that only 2.9 per cent of rental properties on the market right now are affordable and only 0.2 per cent of that number are affordable if you are on the Newstart payment. We could change this right now. The Greens would support any motion in this place to do so, and we back this legislation because at least it admits that the policies of this government are part of the problem—that homelessness is not inevitable and that it is not a reflection of a social or personal failing; it is a reflection of a policy failing, policies which have been passed through this chamber within my lifetime. We could do these things, but we do not. Instead, we sit here and we fiddle. We fiddle while people die on our streets.


I support this legislation. It spasms in the right direction, but it goes nowhere near as far as is needed. I would ask every senator in this chamber who does not sit with me on the Greens benches to reflect upon why they believe that serving the vested interests of those groups who lobby for the continuation of these policies, which do nothing but exacerbate this problem, is more important than serving the people who elected them to this chamber. Thank you.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:38):  I rise, too, to speak on the bills that we have before us and to say that Labor will not be opposing the passage of these bills through this chamber. However, we should be under no illusion about the government's measures in these bill, despite the rhetoric that we've heard from those opposite. They will do nothing to make housing more affordable. Sadly, that action has not been forthcoming from the Turnbull government. We have two bills that do nothing to address the housing crisis, and we need a comprehensive response to the crisis.


The first of the bills before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017, seeks to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for CGT purposes. This is an integrity measure that is meant to address concerns that some taxpayers have been claiming travel deductions without correctly apportioning costs or have claimed travel costs that were for private purposes. The second bill, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, imposes the vacancy fee and establishes the amount payable. Broadly, the fee, which will be payable when a dwelling is left vacant, is the fee that was payable at the time of the foreign investment application.


I must be clear: Labor is all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted, but we are the party which has been leading the debate on this. As previous speakers have noted on the Labor side—and on the Greens side—this is not a housing affordability measure. As we know, housing is a powerful determinant of social and economic participation. Australia is in a housing crisis—a crisis of supply and a crisis of affordability. This housing crisis has far-reaching consequences: people experiencing homelessness, people in rental stress, first home buyers and people relocating or downsizing. Recently, at the ACT Housing and Homelessness Summit, Labor's shadow minister for housing, Senator Doug Cameron, outlined the challenge for us:


The government's Affordable Housing Working Group has estimated that an additional 6,000 social housing dwellings will be required each year just to keep pace with future population growth, without addressing the backlog of need.


A more comprehensive estimate prepared by Dr Judith Yates for the Council for Economic Development of Australia is that Australia needs 20,000 extra affordable housing dwellings each year for at least a decade to address the backlog of need among those on low to moderate incomes.


Using the most recent estimates for the number of households in rental stress, of which there are 527,500, even if half of all the 220,000 new dwellings built each year were made affordable and available to low-moderate income households, it would take over 5 years of new supply to address rental stress amongst Australia’s poorest households. 


…   …   …


In April this year, Labor announced a package of measures that included $88 million over two years to improve transitional housing options for women and children escaping family and domestic violence, young people exiting out-of-home care and older women under financial stress who are at risk of homelessness.


A Labor government will develop and implement a national plan to reduce homelessness through the Council of Australian Governments. There is a massive gap in housing policy, and we need national leadership to address it. Labor's response to the housing and homelessness challenge requires a concerted, cooperative effort across all levels of government and society. Labor's current policies to address housing affordability include reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax and support for the creation of a bond aggregator to facilitate investment in social and affordable housing. They are important steps, but we are not stopping there. Labor is providing the national leadership that is necessary to drive a concerted national plan to address the housing crisis.


Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability and homelessness crisis. House prices in many major cities have skyrocketed. Home ownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing. The housing crisis is only getting worse. Since the government came to office in September 2013, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with increases of nearly 50 per cent in Sydney and over 30 per cent in Melbourne. Home ownership is at a 60-year low, and home ownership rates for 25- to 35-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the past 30 years.


Skyrocketing house prices have long been an issue in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, but they are now becoming a major issue in my home state of Tasmania, with house prices in Hobart now the second highest in the nation in terms of growth, according to a recent report commissioned by the insurer QBE. The report that was put out and reported on by ABC News on 25 October 2017 notes that the median house price in Hobart is forecast to rise by 11 per cent to $470,000 by 2020, while the median price for units is expected to rise by nine per cent, reaching $360,000. These sorts of prices mean that the Australian dream is very fast getting out of reach for so many Tasmanians. It has also resulted in a further tightening of the rental market, putting further stress on those already doing it tough. 


We cannot afford to ignore the human face of this. There are currently 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. If you're on one of the lowest income support payments like youth allowance or Newstart, the possibility of just renting is getting out of reach. Something needs to change. According to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, if current policy settings remain in place, Australia's housing affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years. In Labor's view that is completely unacceptable. This is a situation that requires action. According to the recently released Rental Affordability Index, relative to wages Hobart is the second most unaffordable Australian city after Sydney in which to rent. It is more expensive to rent a house in Hobart than it is in Melbourne or Brisbane. This disproportionately impacts on young people, who are also being priced out of the home ownership market. While Hobart's annual nine per cent growth in house prices might be appealing to people lucky enough to own their own homes, it means the door to home ownership for many young people is being slammed shut. Cashed-up speculators, many from interstate, outbid young Tasmanian first home buyers for the limited housing stock. 


The Liberals, this government, do not have a good story to tell us on housing affordability. Under their watch, home ownership rates have fallen lower than at any other point in the last 60 years. First home buyers now make up only around 17 per cent of all home purchases. This is well below the historic average of 20 per cent. The coalition government appear to have no clue on how to go about fixing this problem or, if I was being unkind, I would say they didn't care, and in government the Liberals have made things worse. Since coming to government, first under Mr Abbott and now Mr Turnbull, they have refused to address unfair and distorting tax breaks for investors. They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was essential for a number of complexes and projects in Tasmania that have been now completed. Without that National Rental Affordability Scheme those projects that now house hundreds of people would not have been able to go ahead. 


The coalition government defunded homelessness and community housing peak bodies. They failed to appoint a housing minister, so there is no-one leading the charge within the government. They abolished the National Housing Supply Council. This list is not the complete story on the government's failures. Unlike the Liberals, Labor has a plan for making more Australians have access to the housing market. Labor's policies will see the construction of over 55,000 new homes in Australia over three years and boost employment by 25,000 new jobs per year. Labor plans to improve housing affordability, increase financial stability, reduce homelessness and boost jobs.


As my colleague Senator Gallagher noted in her contribution yesterday, Labor will reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. We will limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds. Labor will facilitate a COAG process to introduce uniform vacant property tax across all major cities, and Labor will re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and reinstate a leader on housing—a minister for housing. We will implement those measures, along with others, because, unlike this government, Labor believe that the current affordable housing crisis in Australia is completely unacceptable. It requires the federal government to step in and fix it. We cannot sit on the sidelines and just hope the market will sort it out, because it won't.


Every Saturday in Australia, first home buyers are outbid at auctions by wealthy investors and property speculators who are taking advantage of some of the most generous tax concessions in the world. The current arrangements provide a bigger tax concession to an investor buying their fifth home than a young couple buying their first. How is it fair that an investor buying their fifth home receives a bigger tax concession than a young couple buying their first? Demand for housing is being turbocharged by unsustainable and distortionary tax concessions for investors. More than 90 per cent of lending for investment properties is for existing housing stock. 


Labor will take action where the Liberals are unwilling to. We will limit future negative gearing concessions to new housing and reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. These changes will moderate the growth of house prices and redirect generous tax concessions to where we most need investment—in new housing. Redirecting investment in new housing will increase housing supply and in the process will create jobs in the construction and building sector. The McKell Institute has estimated a 10 per cent increase in construction as a result of these changes, creating up to 18,500 new homes and, as I previously mentioned, as many as 25,000 new jobs per year.


Labor does not believe in retrospective tax changes. No current investments will be impacted by this change. The independent Parliamentary Budget Office has recosted the fiscal impact of this policy. This would improve the budget by $37.8 billion over the medium term. Labor's housing policy will create jobs, it will assist in budget repair and it will begin to fix the current housing affordability crisis. Housing prices in many major cities, as many of the senators that have contributed have indicated, have skyrocketed. Homeownership rates have plummeted, and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing—all while the government continue to sit on their hands. The current situation cannot go on. What do we have from the Turnbull government? It is a government that continues to defend existing negative gearing arrangements and capital gains tax discounts, the vast bulk of which go to those in the top 10 per cent of the income distribution. The government knows that. I'm sure Senator Smith knows that. The vast bulk of those discounts go to those in the top 10 per cent of income distribution. Change is needed and it is needed now.


As I said earlier, Labor will not oppose these bills, but make no mistake: these measures have nothing to do with housing affordability. In fact, as I said, two of these are very clearly described as integrity measures. Any housing affordability package that does not deal with negative gearing and capital gains tax discount is a sham. The government needs to deal with both negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, otherwise it will stand condemned. Labor has been leading the way on housing affordability through Senator Cameron, as the shadow minister for housing, and only Labor will properly deal with a system that advantages investors over first home buyers.


I want to once again put on record what is happening in my home town. As we know, in Tasmania, there have been reports produced about the housing property market squeezing out those who are most disadvantaged. Meg Webb of Anglicare's Social Action and Research Centre said that the rising prices—and I'm paraphrasing here—may be good for the market, but the same cannot be said for the 3,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for public and social housing. When Senator Duniam came in here yesterday to make his contribution on this legislation, he also talked about Hobart and the fact that house prices are rising. But, as far as I can recall from his contribution, he made no mention of the fact that 3,000 Tasmanians are currently on waiting lists for public and social housing. 


As I said when I started my contribution, Labor won't be opposing these bills, but these bills do not make a policy on housing affordability. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-11-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:58):  Tonight about 100,000 people across Australia have no home to go to. But, meanwhile, across Australia there are many more than 100,000 homes that are vacant. That's clearly a scandal. It's a scandal that's one of the many housing scandals that's been dominating headlines for the past year. We know how serious it is. We know how hard it is for people to buy their first home. Young people, and particularly older women, are really finding it tough to stay in the housing market. So many people are close to being in a very serious situation. It's estimated that 2.3 million people are in housing stress. That means that they're one disaster away from being on the slippery slope to joining the more than 100,000 people who are homeless. If their kids get sick, if they lose their job or if they have an accident at work and their income stops, then their ability to pay their rent or their mortgage can suffer, and it's all part of this housing crisis that's been dominating the news. The issue relating to vacant houses really has scandalised people. We see more and more people sleeping on our streets—literally on our streets—and there are so many vacant houses. 


So, we have this legislation before us. What does the government come up with? The vacancy fees bill. It sounds good—fees on vacant houses. Who can argue with that? But we need to look at it more closely, because the fees only apply to foreign investors. Now, you really have to ask, when you get to this point and you realise what the government is up to: what's the difference between an investor from China and one from Point Piper, Double Bay, North Sydney, or you name it? What's the difference with who owns this vacant property? What's going on here? 


The government knows exactly what it's doing. There are a few reasons it has come up with this vacancy fees bill. It has come up with it because it needs to appear to be doing something, because the housing issue has been dominating the headlines so much for so long. But it's not just working-class families; many middle-class families are really worried about what the future holds for their children and for their loved ones, so the government had to come up with a position that gives the appearance they are doing something. And they need to deliver for their constituency: the big end of town, the property developers, the investment speculators, the real estate agencies.


But there's also a racist aspect to this, because this is dog whistling. You can get out there and do your grabs and say: 'We're doing something. We're pursuing the foreign owners.' Why do that? There's absolutely no difference at all, but the Liberal-National Party government under Prime Minister Turnbull is doing the classic dog whistling: getting out there at every turn and talking about foreign ownership of houses. People do raise it with me. They're certainly hearing that, and they're picking up on the fear. There's no need to be fearful. We need action—we certainly need action on vacant houses—but what the government is doing here is totally minimalist.


I said another reason that they're doing this is to deliver for their constituency. The constituency is very generous to the Liberal and National parties and also at times to the Labor Party. Over the past 10 years, property developers, property speculators and the real estate industry have donated more than $21 million to the Labor, Liberal and National parties. I'm not saying it's Labor's constant constituency, but there have been some years when Labor have picked up more donations from the developers than they have from unions. That's a pretty worrying state of affairs, because this is a powerful industry.


If you look at what goes on in our respective states, you'll see planning laws being weakened for the benefit of those companies, because, when the planning laws are weakened, they can make more profits. That's what's going on here. Again, what's the job of the Liberals and Nationals when they get into government? Deliver for their constituency. At the moment that means not going hard on the housing crisis that is making life so difficult for so many people, where they don't have certainty about their future and where many people are in insecure housing.


The government might pay lip service to addressing the housing crisis, but for their constituency a housing crisis works for them. What I mean by that is that they make more profits, which is what their donors, the property sector, need to do. They do it very handsomely—the profits they pull in. When you look at Meriton, Mirvac and many of those other big companies, they're making millions and millions of dollars profit every year. They're pulling in big money. That, again, is why the bill before us is so absolutely minimal.


There's the destructive side of the bill, but, even if you look at the foreign ownership side, they're not handling the issue of vacant properties in the way it needs to be. It's not a tough one. What we need to be doing when it comes to housing is recognising that we need universal housing. Housing is a human right. It's something that's recognised along with other human rights, but we barely hear about it in Australia. We have arrived at a shocking situation in this first part of the 21st century. As I said, about 100,000 people will be on the streets tonight. If 100,000 children couldn't get a place in our public schools, there'd be an outcry. It would be on the front page of the paper. If 100,000 sick people—people who had had accidents or had some worry with their health—arrived at hospitals and they couldn't be admitted, that would be scandalous. It's just not possible that it would happen. It's widely recognised, even by people who have their kids in private schools and who have private health insurance, that we need a strong public sector. When it comes to public housing, what's happened around the country, helped by successive federal governments, is that public housing has been smashed, totally discredited. The people who live there are presented as losers, people who are really just not functioning in life. The whole dignity of housing, which should be absolutely the foundation of our approach, has just been decimated in this country.


It was excellent to hear the Greens new senator Senator Andrew Bartlett speaking about the fantastic plans that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. This is precisely the approach that we need, where we have governments committed to public and social housing in such a way that it becomes much more mainstream. I'm not talking about ending the private housing market—there is still a role for that—but we need to resurrect public housing, restore respect for it and restore its dignity so it can get back to the form that it has been in the past. The plan in Queensland, for the Queensland housing trust, is very exciting. They'll start building a million affordable homes. One of the fantastic spin-offs is that, as well as the homes, this will also provide jobs—16,000 jobs a year, over 10 years, to deliver those million affordable homes. These will be homes for life, providing people with certainty because they will be able to afford their home. They will be able to gain support from this trust according to their needs and make repayments according to what they can afford.


This might sound pie-in-the-sky in Australia at the moment, when you consider what the housing market has become. Housing effectively has become another form of money, because it is a way for those who have got two, three, four or five investment properties to be able to use the tax breaks that this government won't do anything about. People who have already got money can make more money out of the way housing works in this country. Yes, we've got to get rid of those tax breaks, but we also need to rebuild the public and the social housing system in this country. Much of Europe already has this. It is not dominated by housing which is stuck in the marketplace, with people really battling and very uncertain about what their future holds because of the price of housing and the price of rents. This really is the healthy way to go; it's the responsible way to go.


If this government, the Liberal-National government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, were serious about housing, what we would be debating tonight would be the winding-down of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, because that's a rort for those who already have money, because of the way it works. It is literally robbing billions of dollars from the public purse—money that could go into something similar to the Queensland housing trust that the Queensland Greens are taking to this election. We need something at the federal level like that. We need something like that in all states. This is the responsible way for any government to be taking Australia. Housing is going to become more of a crisis if we do not deal with it. Housing is a human right. Universal housing should be the foundation policy of all parties that are really serious about addressing people's needs.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-11-14,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:09):  This legislation purports to address the housing challenge. As many other participants in the debate have pointed out, it is not going to do a great deal about that. We support the legislation. We support measures to improve tax transparency, but in no way is this legislation an adequate response to the challenges which are facing Australians in relation to housing, and in no way has the government provided more generally an adequate policy response to the challenges of housing. 


In fact, in the not very long time that I've been here, 2½ years, all I have witnessed is a government completely unable to come to grips with this challenge—organisationally in terms of their ministerial and shadow cabinet arrangements but also bureaucratically. Every time we seek information about how the government is responding to the housing crisis, we get given about three different departments—the names of three different groups of people who may or may not be responsible or leading a particular initiative. We get told that one group of people in Treasury is responsible for leading an initiative and then we find out subsequently that actually Prime Minister and Cabinet have had to step in and they are now leading some sort of working group that's convening, and shortly to be replaced by, an IDC. There is total confusion within the Commonwealth about what the goals are for housing policy, who is responsible for leading it within the bureaucracy and what the key actions are to reach those goals. 


The fact that the bill before the chamber today purports to be a bill to address housing but, in fact, really addresses important but, in the context of housing policy, relatively insignificant tax measures says a great deal about how the government's approaching this. It's a great shame, because we do actually have quite a significant problem. There is a very big problem with a lack of affordable rental properties. Every year, Anglicare do this terrific survey where they look at what proportion of the rental properties on the market would be available to certain kinds of income groups. When they looked at it last year, they found that singles on the age pension could afford just 2.1 per cent of the 75,000 properties that they surveyed. Think about that: if you are on the age pension and trying to exist in the private rental market, just 2.1 per cent of the properties available would be suitable for you. 


There is a kind of a myth—and I hear the National Party say this often—'All you have to do is move to Orange' or 'All you have to do is move to the country.' It's a problem in regional areas as well. People on Newstart would only be able to afford 15 per cent of the 18,000 regional properties that were surveyed in this process. Even double-income families struggle. A household with two kids and two parents on a minimum wage would be able to afford just 26 per cent of the surveyed properties. If that same family were trying to get by on Newstart, they'd have access to only 1.9 per cent of the surveyed properties. It's a big problem and it requires a serious solution. We know that one solution that works is public housing. 


When we measure housing stress, a common measure of housing stress is when your housing costs are greater than 30 per cent of your disposable income and the household income is in the bottom 40 per cent of all households. Well, only half a per cent of people in public housing are in that category. One of the key benefits of public housing is that it does represent a serious and effective response to housing stress for very low-income people. Unfortunately, more than 40 per cent of all Australians who are receiving Commonwealth rent assistance are in housing stress. They spend more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. Horrifyingly, 13 per cent of them spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent. These are issues that should shock us and it should be a time when we're thinking about how to provide more public housing and how to provide more social housing. 


There's been a very significant decrease in the number of public rental housing households. Between 2007 and 2014, the number of public rental households decreased from 331,000 to 317,000, a fall of four per cent. Quite a bit of that reflects a transfer of stock from public housing to community housing, because in the same period the number of mainstream community-housing households has almost doubled. It's risen very substantially. But this shifting, this pea-and-thimble trick, doesn't really go to the core of the problem. There is simply not enough affordable housing available for people who need it.


We talk a lot about the pressures in capital cities. In fact, you sometimes get the impression that the main thing that drives our capital city newspapers is the property section. It's hard to go by any day of the week where there isn't a story about house prices in Sydney or Melbourne. But, actually, it is a really big problem in regional areas. I think senators will know that I grew up on the Far North Coast of New South Wales, and as a senator I have occasion to visit the communities on the North Coast of New South Wales. I spent a little bit of time earlier in the year with the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre. They tell me that Coffs Harbour actually doesn't have any crisis accommodation at all. The neighbourhood centre is in a lovely building. It's an old school. It's got one of those old school verandahs that people might remember from when they went to school—you used to hang your bag on the peg on the verandah. The good people at the Coffs Harbour Neighbourhood Centre have repurposed that area of their building. It's now a shelter for sometimes 20, sometimes 30, people living in Coffs Harbour who really don't have anywhere to go each evening. There is no crisis accommodation. The neighbourhood centre is not in a position to provide crisis accommodation for these people, but they are able to provide them with a place out of the rain—albeit not inside, but a place on a verandah out of the rain—where they can get a little bit of food in the morning and actually get a little bit of care. They assist these desperate people in their desperate circumstances.


It's troubling that there isn't a more structured response to these problems in our regions. Places like Coffs Harbour might not be growing as fast as the rest of the state, but it's still projected to grow very significantly between now and 2050. I struggle to get any real sense that either the state government in New South Wales or the Commonwealth government is thinking seriously about how these coastal areas cope with some very specific challenges that they face in terms of housing.


Shelter NSW, the peak group that represents housing providers and advocates on housing issues, did some great work, which they released in March this year, which took a look at regional perspectives on housing and homelessness. It's a very useful document, and I encourage senators to go and have a look at it. They go region by region and create a very specific breakdown of the kinds of issues in each of those places that are confronting those communities. In Coffs Harbour, they're finding that house prices and rents on the coast are pushing people westward for affordable rentals. Locally, certain areas have remained affordable, but the housing is run down and the market is becoming very geographically stratified. In a small town everyone knows everyone else, and there are sometimes families—a lot of people with the same name—and it only takes one person with your surname in your family to do the wrong thing for everybody in that family to be shut out of the rental market, because real estate agents are willing to apply essentially discriminatory practices in accepting or rejecting tenants.


The development of university campuses increases competition for housing. Students tend to displace locals, especially in low-end housing. In coastal towns like Coffs Harbour and my own community on the Tweed, there is huge seasonal variation in rental prices. Rents go up dramatically over Christmas and people can find themselves homeless at that point, particularly if you've got a lease that ends in the summer; it's likely that that won't be renewed because the owner is in a position to chase much higher rents from temporary holiday rentals.


There are some real challenges in regional Australia with housing. There are real challenges across the country, but the problem with the bill before us and with all of the policy settings presented by the coalition is that they're not addressing this in any systematic, focused or energetic way. There is a disregard for the issue and an apparent unwillingness to take it seriously. Labor has put a range of policies on the table, particularly around tax, negative gearing and capital gains reform. Unfortunately, these—

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Today is World Diabetes Day. The theme for World Diabetes Day 2017 is women and diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 199 million women are currently living with diabetes worldwide. It is the ninth leading cause of death in women globally, causing 2.1 million deaths per year. People who have diabetes lose their ability to properly regulate their blood sugar. Out-of-control blood sugar can lead to nerve damage, heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and lower limb amputation. The total annual cost impact of diabetes in Australia is estimated at $14.6 billion a year. Around 1.7 million Australians already have diabetes, and they are joined by 280 Australians every day—about one person every five minutes. This means that eight per cent of the Australian population is already living with diabetes. This is expected to increase to 14 per cent over the next two decades. Diabetes is the leading cause of preventable blindness in Australia, and there are more than 4,400 diabetic amputations every year in this country.


Socially and economically disadvantaged people in every country carry that great burden of diabetes and are often the most affected financially. Most people with diabetes have a form of the illness, like type 2, that disproportionately strikes people, young and old, who may be overweight and sedentary. But when a patient develops type 1 diabetes, their body attacks and destroys its own ability to produce any insulin at all. No-one knows why, but, at the moment, type 1 diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of all diabetes diagnoses in Australia, affects nearly 16,000 Australians and is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting children in Australia. Type 1 diabetes low blood sugar can end in hypoglycaemic fits or even death, while high blood sugar might develop into diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma and, within a week, death, to say nothing of the severe long-term health impacts that people with type 1 diabetes live with. Because of this, type 1 diabetes is responsible for significant financial and emotional burdens on those afflicted and their families and the community. Many who suffer complications lose their incomes because they cannot work and, moreover, treatment can be expensive. Insulin is unaffordable for many people in low- and middle-income countries, where most with diabetes are living, and, without insulin, type 1 diabetics die. Even in high-income countries like Australia, the cost of best-practice treatment, like continuous blood glucose monitoring, is beyond the reach of most.


I have come to learn a lot about type 1 diabetes over the years, as one of my staff has the disease. I have seen how well he manages. But that is all it is; it is just managing. Management of diabetes is all there can be, because there is no cure. While type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, a healthy lifestyle is an important part of effective management of the disease. Indeed, up to 70 per cent of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented through the adoption of a healthy lifestyle.


The Labor Party are on record as welcoming the government's investment in diabetes treatment and research, including the provision of free continuous glucose monitoring devices to eligible children and people under the age of 21 with type 1 diabetes, but we do call on the government to extend this much-needed support at the very least to pregnant women and adults with severe hypoglycaemia and limited awareness of their condition who have never been able to afford the technology and the improvements in their health care that would provide them with a degree of safety. If the government wants to save lives, and in the long-term save taxpayers money, this is a decision the government must make. Today we mark World Diabetes Day, and we hope for all of those people who live with the disease that we find a cure and diabetes will be prevented in the future.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (19:30):  I won't respond to Senator Dastyari's interjection. Too many people in this place are lured in by him in that very way. I congratulate you, Acting Deputy President Kitching, on your first time of serving on the Temporary Chairs of Committees. It's an honour to be in that chair and it's nice to be here on the first occasion of your time in it. Could I also just say in response to Senator Steele-John's recent contribution that I might not be as young as the senator, but, believe me, I still have plenty of passion in this place for the Australian people. I think we're better when we're all working together—youth and older people; country, city and regions—and that's why I'm very pleased to put on the record tonight some remarks around the suicide prevention trials that I visited in Western Australia.


I am very pleased, frankly, to be assisting themember for Franklin, Julie Collins, in her role as the shadow minister for mental health. Labor is committed to continue to work with the Turnbull government in bipartisanship to reduce the very significant rate of suicide right across this country. We are also committed to rolling out 12 suicide prevention trial sites, as per the National Mental Health Commission recommendation. I'm pleased that the government adopted Labor's position, which was declared early in the 2016 campaign. They indicated eight trial sites initially but moved, finally, to 12. Indeed, there are now 12 suicide prevention trial sites being rolled out, including in the western part of New South Wales.


Since the last sitting period, I've been fortunate enough to spend some time in western New South Wales. I visited the areas of Cobar, Bourke and Brewarrina. I met with inspirational people out there—inspiring mental health service providers and community leaders—who were more than willing to discuss the strengths of their community but also the very concerning issue of suicide prevention, which is on their radar. I met with mental health service providers, the local PHN and community leaders from, as I said, Cobar, Bourke and Brewarrina and Walgett as they were participating in a suicide prevention trial discussion. I welcomed very much this opportunity to meet with mental health service providers and listen to them about what's happening on the ground so that we can find ways to reduce the thousands of lives that are sadly lost to suicide each year. I would, personally, like to thank each one of them for their generosity in sharing their knowledge and insights with me. I acknowledge the passion and dedication they have to the task.


It is extremely encouraging that New South Wales, given the size of our population, has two suicide prevention sites: one in western New South Wales and one on the North Coast, which I will certainly be visiting early in the new year. It is particularly promising that western New South Wales was chosen as a trial site. According to SANE Australia, suicide rates in rural Australia are consistently 40 per cent higher than the rates in metropolitan Australia. Rural and remote areas need policies that are tailored to their needs, which do not necessarily translate to the same as those in urban areas. My home place is only an hour and a half north of Sydney, but it might as well be 500 miles away for many people because of the limitation on access to services and the challenge of putting petrol in their car when they're in insecure employment and have, perhaps, one child who is unwell. These are the sorts of pressures that mount on people that end up putting them into a frame of mind where they see a tunnel and hopelessness descends. We need to be able to interrupt that and we need to be able to do it particularly for our Indigenous people—our first nation people.


In the four local government areas chosen in Western Australia, first nation people are very significantly represented. It is extremely encouraging that the western New South Wales PHN identified first nation people as a high-priority group for the trial site. But, as Senator Williams is here, I think they've got room for a few broken-down shearers, as you describe some of the people who are out in the bush. So it is a genuine community response, but noticing in that community that there are differentiated needs that require an adequate and differentiated response. 


Elders in Brewarrina, first nation elders in particular, made it clear that identity issues are contributing to the experience of mental ill health for our first nation people. We need to make sure that we are listening to the concerns of the first nation people and allowing them their voice in their own community. They made it extremely clear that they have plans to improve the wellbeing of the community. But can I put on the record my alarm at being in a state-of-the-art building for child health—a building that was $2 million in production—and hearing about women in the local area who were part of the CDP, were unable to attend their CDP and were losing their income because there was nowhere safe for them to put their children, despite the fact that there were two childcare rooms ready and waiting for use in that community.
