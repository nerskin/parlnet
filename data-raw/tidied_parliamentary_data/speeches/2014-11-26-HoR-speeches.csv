Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (09:04):  I seek leave to move the following motion:


That the House:


(1) notes that the Minister for Defence:


(a) that the Minister for Defence promised on 8 May 2013 that the coalition would deliver those submarines from right here at ASC South Australia. The coalition today has committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide—



Mr Nikolic interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bass!




Mr SHORTEN:
  The motion goes on:


and then broke that promise worth $20 billion.


(b) cut the real pay, Christmas and recreation leave for Australia's Defence men and women—



Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Gorton will desist!




Mr SHORTEN:
  The motion goes on:


(c) insulted the highly skilled and dedicated workers at ASC on 25 November 2014 by saying he ""did not trust them to build a canoe"";


(2) calls on the Prime Minister to immediately attend the House and confirm:


(a) why he has failed to direct the Minister for Defence to withdraw his insulting remarks; and


(b) whether he retains full confidence in the Minister for Defence; and


(3) should the Prime Minister fail to attend the House, that the House:


(a) condemns the Prime Minister for his failure to stand up for Australia’s Defence personnel; and


(b) calls on the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Defence.


Leave not granted.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion forthwith—


That the House:


(1) notes that the Minister for Defence:


(a) promised on 8 May 2013 that the Coalition ""will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia. The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide."", and then broke that promise worth $20 billion;



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bass will remove himself under standing order 94(a)!



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  And you as well. The member for Isaacs and the member for Bass will both go under 94(a)!




The member for Bass then left the chamber.





The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.





Mr SHORTEN:
  The motion continues:


(b) cut the real pay, Christmas and recreation leave for Australia's Defence men and women; and


(c) insulted the highly skilled and dedicated workers at ASC on 25 November 2014 by saying he ""did not trust them to build a canoe"";


(2) calls on the Prime Minister to immediately attend the House and confirm:


(a) why he has failed to direct the Minister for Defence to withdraw his insulting remarks; and


(b) whether he retains full confidence in the Minister for Defence; and


(3) should the Prime Minister fail to attend the House, that the House:


(a) condemns the Prime Minister for his failure to stand up for Australia’s Defence personnel; and


(b) calls on the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Defence.


These are most important matters which do need to be debated by the House. We have seen chronic underperformance in the Defence portfolio since this government was elected. We have seen this government systemically undermine security by trashing confidence in our platforms and capacity; undermine the reputation of Australian industry and the economy more widely; and destroy the morale of the Royal Australian Navy and their confidence in their ships and submarines. 


The comments by the Minister for Defence will affect recruitment and retention in the Navy. It is—not that the government would care about it—a shocking insult to the thousands of Australian men and women working at the Australian Submarine Corporation. Indeed, this is part of the consistent record of incompetence and intemperance that we see from this minister. Does the defence minister still have the Prime Minister's confidence?


This motion should be debated. After the defence minister's bombshell yesterday, where he trashed the reputation of our submarine builder, we saw the Prime Minister last night issue a startling repudiation of the Minister for Defence's comments. But does this hapless defence minister realise the hot water he is in? Not at all. That reflects his general lack of awareness of his portfolio. But this morning the opposition are saying: if the government want to draw a line under this Defence confusion, this melee, then the Prime Minister should come in and simply say those magic words which every minister on the ropes, every minister cut adrift, has desperately wanted to hear from their leader: 'I have full confidence in the minister.' There is deafening silence. The Minister for Defence has been abandoned by his government—but there are good reasons why the Minister for Defence should be abandoned by his government. 


Let us have a look at the last 15 months of chronic failure. This is a government who has let Australia's defence capacity down. There has been no progress on the Land 400 project to replace our armoured vehicles. The SEA 1000 Future Submarine is an absolute debacle, where we see decisions made about where we spend billions of dollars—

Mr BURKE

 (
Watson
—
Manager of Opposition Business
) (
09:19
):  I second the motion. Rather than defend the defence minister the government have decided they would rather shut down debate. We have given them the opportunity today for the Prime Minister to come into this chamber and decide whether or not they have a defence minister worth defending. One by one, they have all lined up and said, 'No'. They would rather not have the debate. They would rather not have the discussion or be forced into a situation where someone on that side has to claim, 'We have a fit and proper person in the Defence portfolio.' Last night, the Prime Minister of Australia hung his own defence minister out to dry. We had the member for Mayo going out as a member of the executive, completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have Senator Birmingham completely disowning the comments of the Minister for Defence. We have the Prime Minister, in a statement, distancing himself from it. This is now a test of leadership for the Prime Minister of Australia. Either he backs his defence minister or he backs his federal Liberal MPs. The Prime Minister, if he has no confidence in the defence minister, should accept the challenge to get rid of his defence minister. 


Just think: we have a defence minister showing no confidence at all in Australia's capacity to build our own submarines, with everything that means—and the defence that he put up on radio this morning! I never thought I would hear a defence minister for our nation use this line:


That was a rhetorical flourish that I don't want to be taken literally. 


The Minister for Defence on radio said to Australia and to the world, 'Please do not take me seriously.' He has also apologised to the South Australian opposition leader, Stephen Marshall, saying:


I'm happy to apologise if he is offended by this …


When he was told that some of his colleagues want his job, that they could do a better job, he said, 'Of course everybody would say that.' 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  Yes, they would. Yes, they would—because of all the people, of all the jobs where somebody might be a situation where you would think they would be backing in—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  I have just been told, just while people were starting to vote, that there is apparently a reason why the Leader of the House was late—although he did get to the chamber in time. He was apparently in a radio interview and he was asked to express confidence in the defence minister in that radio interview. He did not take the opportunity.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  He did not take the opportunity to express confidence in the defence minister. No doubt he is working on a petition right now to work out what should happen to the defence minister. 


We have the embarrassment of a government in chaos in front of us now. Of all the portfolios where you cannot afford chaos, it should be that of the defence of the nation. It should be the defence minister. We have a very happy, smiling pretender here at the table right now, seeing opportunity right in front of him. But there is no opportunity here for the Australian Defence Force if there is a defence minister who no-one has any confidence in. There is no opportunity for the people of South Australia if our own workers are being bagged and having their work put down by the defence minister of Australia. 


On 22 October the defence minister did not attend the national security meeting of cabinet. When asked why, he told a Senate estimates hearing that the reason he had not attended was: 'I was not going to add too much to what was going to inform the National Security Committee.'



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  Even the defence minister knows he has nothing to offer. Liberal MPs know he has nothing to offer.



The SPEAKER:  Those on my left should give respect to their own speaker.




Mr BURKE:
  The Prime Minister of Australia refuses to back him in and yet no-one has the courage to say to the defence minister, 'It is time to move on. 'This is a government that has gone for something in the order of 250 days since we have had an Assistant Treasurer. Now we discover we have a defence minister who they do not want either. The Prime Minister should be called into the chamber now. The Prime Minister should come into the chamber and make clear whether or not this defence minister is going to stay or whether Australia is going to have the humiliation of a defence minister no-one will defend.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (09:24):  Well, this is rich, isn't it? This is extraordinarily rich.



The SPEAKER:  I remind those on my left that the same rules apply with regard to behaviour being disorderly as applies during question time. We will have some silence while we hear the speakers.




Mr ROBERT:
  If there was ever a shiny example of a whitewashed tomb and hypocrisy, it is this. Not content with handing over to our government a situation where $16 billion was ripped out of Defence, the Labor Party had a revolving door of three Defence ministers. The first one Labor took into power was described as an electrician in a suit. 


Not content with taking levels of Defence funding as a proportion of GDP to levels not seen since 1938, not content with reducing project-spending capability—the Labor Party impacted 46 per cent of all projects through their cuts—and not content with having 14 ministerial reshuffles over their six moribund years in parliament, the Labor Party comes in this morning to cry foul. Seriously, are you kidding the nation?


The legacy that Labor left when it comes to defence should have their heads hanging in shame. A 2009 white paper went completely and utterly unfunded. Capability was thrown to the winds. At the height of what the Labor Party was doing in Defence, capability spending as a proportion of the total budget was a mere 18 per cent. That is absolutely and utterly appalling.


This is the party that decided to cut counter-IED phase 2 funding whilst we were doing combat operations in Afghanistan. And this party has the hide, the temerity and the audacity to come in and lecture this government about how defence is done. This is the first year in seven years when Defence funding has been stable—$3.9 billion more in Defence funding has been provided, in macro terms, this year than the previous year.


Defence funding as a proportion of GDP is 1.8 per cent this year. What was it under the Labor Party? It was 1.56 per cent—the lowest level since 1938. I do not think that any of those opposite were born prior to 1938, which means that there is no-one on the other side that has seen Defence funding drop to such a low level under their watch.


With that as a background—as a history; as a stinking, rotten carcase sitting over the shoulders of the Labor Party—they walk in here and have the temerity to lecture this government on exactly how defence should be managed. Let's look through the history of exactly what the Labor Party did in government. The then Prime Minister—the ultimate minister when it comes to national security—Prime Minister Gillard, could not be bothered attending the National Security Committee of cabinet. Who did she send? She sent her bodyguard. That is how the Labor Party treats defence. Their Prime Minister sent her bodyguard along to the National Security Committee of cabinet. 


What did Prime Minister Rudd do? Let's look at the consistency of the Labor Party. Prime Minister Rudd sent an adviser to the National Security Committee of cabinet. That is the extent to which the Labor Party treats the National Security Committee. It is simply extraordinary.

Mr ROBERT:
  He has made it very clear. He has been very open. He has been very honest, as you would expect a competent minister to be. 



Ms Plibersek interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sydney will desist.




Mr ROBERT:
  He has been extraordinarily honest in terms of his comments. We all know that the submarine process has at least six months to go. Why does it still have six months to go? Because for six, long, horrid, wintry years, the Labor Party made zero decisions on submarines. Zero decisions were made on our submarine capability—to the point where we are facing a very real capability gap. The Labor Party refused to make a call on the next generation submarine and now demand that we as a government clean up all of their mistakes. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. It is no wonder we were forced to shut down the Leader of the Opposition. Not even his own side could sit quietly and believe what he had to say. It is extraordinary.


Let us look at the other failures of the Labor Party when it comes to defence—because the failure is extraordinary. We saw everything from a white paper that was not funded to defence capability plans that were not approved. We saw everything from Labor saying they would index DFRDB pensions and failing to do so through to reducing our forces to impotence. The Labor Party are especially good at spin, but—

The SPEAKER
 (10:10):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014, amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to provide that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, be a member of the Security Management Board. Alternatively, in place of the commissioner, a deputy commissioner or senior executive AFP employee, may be a member of the Security Management Board for Parliament House upon nomination by the presiding officers. The bill also amends the existing functions of the board to include the operation of security measures.


As Speaker of the House of Representatives, my primary concern is for the safety of Parliament House, but more importantly its occupants, and to ensure that people may go about their business in a safe and secure environment. As members will be aware, the existing security arrangements for Parliament House have been enhanced and strengthened over the past few weeks, following the national terrorism public alert level being raised from medium to high. As I have said before in this House, the security arrangements in the parliamentary precincts are under continual and careful assessment, and I am working closely with a range of departments including security and intelligence agencies, in carrying out the necessary security works within the parliamentary precinct. 


Together with the President of the Senate, we have already implemented additional measures here at Parliament House, including enhanced perimeter controls, changed access arrangements for the public and private areas of Parliament House, and an armed response capability. We have also increased the armed presence guarding our parliament, which now includes long armed weapons. Whilst we have taken the necessary steps on security early, building occupants will notice significant building security works being undertaken in the weeks and months ahead. 


As part of the physical security enhancements, we have been reviewing the governance arrangements for security matters within Parliament House. This bill seeks to further strengthen those governance arrangements in two important areas.


Firstly, this bill will enable a representative of the Australian Federal Police to be a full member of the Security Management Board, a board which is established under section 65A of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999. This Board provides advice to the presiding officers as required, on security policy and the management of security measures, for Parliament House.


Other members of the board include representatives from the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of Parliamentary Services, and the Department of the Senate. The function of the board is to provide advice to the presiding officers on a range of security measures, and having the Australian Federal Police as a member of the board will boost the board's capability and reach on security matters.


Secondly, this bill will amend the remit of the board, which is set out in subsection 65A(5) of the act, to allow the board to provide advice to the presiding officers on the management or operation of security measures for Parliament House. This will mean that the board may provide a wide range of advice to the presiding officers on both short-term and long-term security matters. 


Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (10:15):  On behalf the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the following reports to the 44th Parliament:


Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 20-30 October 2014, Legislative Instruments received 20 September-10 October 2014 (sent to the Speaker on 14 November 2014, pursuant to standing order 247)—Report, November 2014.


Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 14-19 November 2014, Legislative Instruments received 11-23 October 2014—Report, incorporating a dissenting report, November 2014.


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  by leave—I rise to speak on the tabling of the 16th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights to the 44th Parliament. The committee considered 15 bills. Of these, four do not require further scrutiny as they are compatible with human rights. The committee has decided to further defer its consideration of eight bills. The committee has identified three bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information.


Of the bills considered, those which are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 24 November include the Broadcasting and Other Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Amendment bill 2014.


The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights. I encourage my fellow members to the look to the committee's report to inform their deliberations on the merits of the proposed legislation.


I would like to make some remarks to remind members of the context in which the committee undertakes its task of assessing legislation on compatibility with human rights. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, or PJC, is one of only three legislative scrutiny committees established or administered by the Senate. It is sometimes forgotten that legislative scrutiny committees perform a unique and important institutional role in the parliament, which is to undertake technical—and I stress that—assessments of bills and legislation against scrutiny criteria or, in the case of the PJC, establish human rights standards. Those points are extremely important to bear in mind.


This unique function of scrutiny committees has always been reflected in the bipartisan spirit in which they operate. With this bipartisan approach and with the support of well-respected external legal advisers, the scrutiny committees' reports have been trusted and credible sources of information since the establishment of the parliament's first scrutiny committee, the regulation and ordinances committee, in the 1930s.


Noting the many opportunities that exist for members of parliament to engage in the robust party and political debates that are a familiar feature of our parliament, the scrutiny committees therefore provide a balanced and objective source of information to educate and inform parliamentarians. However, if scrutiny work is not to have the character of contest that we are also familiar with in this chamber, what is the role of a scrutiny committee member if not to prosecute the case on the merits of policy? The answer to that, I believe, is that the role of scrutiny committee members has been and is to ensure that scrutiny committee reports are legally and technically credible as well as consistent with past practice. That is naturally done at meetings through testing and questioning of the issues and through the analysis provided in the committees' reports.


Members also contribute to directing the tone and nature of the committees' dialogue with ministers and to shaping the committees' actions in cases where legislation may offend a relevant scrutiny principle. Hundreds of parliamentarians have served on the parliament scrutiny committees and have conscientiously worked within the constraints of the scrutiny approach to serve the parliament's ethos of informed inquiry.


However, it is equally important to note that scrutiny committee members are not and have never been bound by the contents and inclusion of scrutiny committee reports. They are obviously free to otherwise engage in debates over the policy merits of legislation according to the dictates of party conscience, belief, outlook or even prejudice, as the case may be.


Scrutiny committee members may also legitimately apply the technical knowledge gleaned from their service as scrutiny committee members to mount arguments outside the technical scrutiny arena. Clearly involvement in the scrutiny dialogues enhances members' technical knowledge of legislation and enhances their capacity to prosecute their own views with reference to established and well-known principles, be they of a human rights or parliamentary variety.


I therefore encourage members who may not have yet performed service on a scrutiny committee to consider, understand and appreciate the distinct character of scrutiny committees and the particular benefits they provide in relation to not only informing debates in this place but also the broader ability of members to engage in informed and principled debate on the merits of legislation.


I want to turn very briefly to the minority report in this particular case. The committee concluded that one piece of legislation looked at in this report infringed upon privacy, equality and non-discriminatory rights in this country. I note that the minister declined to answer questions in regards to proportionality. I note that it was said that the person who would in future have to have all of their previous names on the back of their citizenship form controlled that document. That is clearly not the case because employers can ask for access to that document.


I want to briefly say that in a week where we all in this parliament were running around wearing a white ribbon the particular provision that in future people would have all of their various names listed on the back of a citizenship form could create a situation for people who have chosen to change their name because of very dire domestic violence histories. We could have situations where people have changed their gender. We could have situations where people have changed their name because in parts of the world their name would identify them as a particular ethnic or religious group. Cases that come to mind very quickly are the Tutsis and Hutus from Rwanda; different tribes in South Sudan, where there is conflict; and Christians and Muslims—and different types of Muslims—in the Middle East, northern Nigeria or Afghanistan. People might not travel on passports. They might choose to have these documents as a form of identification in those countries when they visit them. They may have changed their names to avoid being identified, and yet they could be identified, pulled off a bus and shot dead—by the Taliban, for instance.


There is a very serious matter of proportionality in this. It would be extremely dangerous for this country to allow an extension of people's private information to documents such as this, especially when the case has not been made that this would fundamentally aid the alleged campaign to reduce fraud.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (10:15):  On behalf the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the following reports to the 44th Parliament:


Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 20-30 October 2014, Legislative Instruments received 20 September-10 October 2014 (sent to the Speaker on 14 November 2014, pursuant to standing order 247)—Report, November 2014.


Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 14-19 November 2014, Legislative Instruments received 11-23 October 2014—Report, incorporating a dissenting report, November 2014.


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  by leave—I rise to speak on the tabling of the 16th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights to the 44th Parliament. The committee considered 15 bills. Of these, four do not require further scrutiny as they are compatible with human rights. The committee has decided to further defer its consideration of eight bills. The committee has identified three bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information.


Of the bills considered, those which are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 24 November include the Broadcasting and Other Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill 2014 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Amendment bill 2014.


The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights. I encourage my fellow members to the look to the committee's report to inform their deliberations on the merits of the proposed legislation.


I would like to make some remarks to remind members of the context in which the committee undertakes its task of assessing legislation on compatibility with human rights. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, or PJC, is one of only three legislative scrutiny committees established or administered by the Senate. It is sometimes forgotten that legislative scrutiny committees perform a unique and important institutional role in the parliament, which is to undertake technical—and I stress that—assessments of bills and legislation against scrutiny criteria or, in the case of the PJC, establish human rights standards. Those points are extremely important to bear in mind.


This unique function of scrutiny committees has always been reflected in the bipartisan spirit in which they operate. With this bipartisan approach and with the support of well-respected external legal advisers, the scrutiny committees' reports have been trusted and credible sources of information since the establishment of the parliament's first scrutiny committee, the regulation and ordinances committee, in the 1930s.


Noting the many opportunities that exist for members of parliament to engage in the robust party and political debates that are a familiar feature of our parliament, the scrutiny committees therefore provide a balanced and objective source of information to educate and inform parliamentarians. However, if scrutiny work is not to have the character of contest that we are also familiar with in this chamber, what is the role of a scrutiny committee member if not to prosecute the case on the merits of policy? The answer to that, I believe, is that the role of scrutiny committee members has been and is to ensure that scrutiny committee reports are legally and technically credible as well as consistent with past practice. That is naturally done at meetings through testing and questioning of the issues and through the analysis provided in the committees' reports.


Members also contribute to directing the tone and nature of the committees' dialogue with ministers and to shaping the committees' actions in cases where legislation may offend a relevant scrutiny principle. Hundreds of parliamentarians have served on the parliament scrutiny committees and have conscientiously worked within the constraints of the scrutiny approach to serve the parliament's ethos of informed inquiry.


However, it is equally important to note that scrutiny committee members are not and have never been bound by the contents and inclusion of scrutiny committee reports. They are obviously free to otherwise engage in debates over the policy merits of legislation according to the dictates of party conscience, belief, outlook or even prejudice, as the case may be.


Scrutiny committee members may also legitimately apply the technical knowledge gleaned from their service as scrutiny committee members to mount arguments outside the technical scrutiny arena. Clearly involvement in the scrutiny dialogues enhances members' technical knowledge of legislation and enhances their capacity to prosecute their own views with reference to established and well-known principles, be they of a human rights or parliamentary variety.


I therefore encourage members who may not have yet performed service on a scrutiny committee to consider, understand and appreciate the distinct character of scrutiny committees and the particular benefits they provide in relation to not only informing debates in this place but also the broader ability of members to engage in informed and principled debate on the merits of legislation.


I want to turn very briefly to the minority report in this particular case. The committee concluded that one piece of legislation looked at in this report infringed upon privacy, equality and non-discriminatory rights in this country. I note that the minister declined to answer questions in regards to proportionality. I note that it was said that the person who would in future have to have all of their previous names on the back of their citizenship form controlled that document. That is clearly not the case because employers can ask for access to that document.


I want to briefly say that in a week where we all in this parliament were running around wearing a white ribbon the particular provision that in future people would have all of their various names listed on the back of a citizenship form could create a situation for people who have chosen to change their name because of very dire domestic violence histories. We could have situations where people have changed their gender. We could have situations where people have changed their name because in parts of the world their name would identify them as a particular ethnic or religious group. Cases that come to mind very quickly are the Tutsis and Hutus from Rwanda; different tribes in South Sudan, where there is conflict; and Christians and Muslims—and different types of Muslims—in the Middle East, northern Nigeria or Afghanistan. People might not travel on passports. They might choose to have these documents as a form of identification in those countries when they visit them. They may have changed their names to avoid being identified, and yet they could be identified, pulled off a bus and shot dead—by the Taliban, for instance.


There is a very serious matter of proportionality in this. It would be extremely dangerous for this country to allow an extension of people's private information to documents such as this, especially when the case has not been made that this would fundamentally aid the alleged campaign to reduce fraud. I commend the report to the House.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:23):  Labor welcomes the Australian War Memorial Amendment Bill 2014. The bill amends the Australian War Memorial Act to prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian War Memorial is located in my electorate and combines a shrine, a world-class museum and an extensive archive. The memorial's purpose is to commemorate the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war. Its mission is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.


In addition to this mission, the Australian War Memorial offers, on a fee-for-service basis, a number of additional services such as venue hire and educational and school holiday programs. The fees from these services contribute to the funding of the Australian War Memorial. These services will not be affected by the amendments in the bill that prohibit the levying of entry or parking fees at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell. The Australian War Memorial will continue to provide, and charge a fee for, these additional services. The amendments in the bill will also not prevent the Australian War Memorial from receiving voluntary donations at the Australian War Memorial premises in Campbell.


In the aftermath of the Battle of Pozieres in 1916, Australia's official war historian Charles Bean began to develop plans for a national memorial to commemorate the sacrifices made by his fellow Australians. He felt it was important for such a memorial to include an extensive military collection in order to help Australians at home understand the wartime experience. In the words of Charles Bean:


It had always been in the mind of many Australians soldiers that records and relics of their fighting would be preserved in some institutions in Australia, and to several of us it had seemed that a museum housing these would form the most natural, interesting, and inspiring memorial to those who fell.


Today the War Memorial commemorates the sacrifice of Australians who have died in war. It helps Australians remember and understand through maintaining the Roll of Honour and conducting national commemorative ceremonies. 


Each year on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day the memorial holds national ceremonies on the Parade Ground. These are attended by thousands of official guests and visitors, and are followed by the wreathlaying at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. Official visitors to the memorial usually pay tribute to Australia's war dead by laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier or at the Inauguration Stone. School groups and veterans' groups also conduct commemorative wreathlaying ceremonies in these areas. The War Memorial's main building and grounds are conserved and developed as a national memorial to Australians who served and died at war. As well as the Commemorative Courtyard, the Sculpture Garden provides another dignified and attractive focus for commemoration within the memorial grounds.


In the context of the grounds, I cannot help recounting a story of one of my constituents, Gerry, who served in Vietnam. His tank was placed in the War Memorial grounds. While on service in Vietnam his unit had written on the side of the tank, and he went back to show his wife the graffiti that they had placed on the side of the tank. Overhearing this conversation, one of the local guards was shocked and raced up and said: 'You can't graffiti on the tanks!' Gerry said: 'I'm sorry, mate; we did. We did it in Vietnam.'


The War Memorial's galleries showcase one of the world's greatest military collections, thus fulfilling Charles Bean's vision of a national memorial. The displays provide direct evidence of the lives, actions and fate of the men and women who served and died for Australia in war and military operations. The loss of over 60,000 Australian lives in the First World War and 40,000 in the Second World War, as well as the numerous deaths in other conflicts, might become little more than statistical information were it not for the memorial's national collection, which illustrates the effect of war on individuals, families, and communities. The memorial's historians research and foster research into Australia's military history. This provides the depth and breadth of knowledge required to support the memorial's unique displays and commemorative functions. At the heart of the memorial building is the Roll of Honour: a long series of bronze panels recording the names of over 102,000 members of the Australian armed forces who have died during or as a result of war service, warlike service, non-warlike service and certain peacetime operations. The database is compiled from data used to create the Roll of Honour and is available on the memorial's web site. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (13:30):  I rise to speak on a very important and concerning issue relating to the decision by banks in Australia to close the accounts of remittance services in Australia. Remittance services have been a very important aspect of the banking system for some years. These services allow many communities to send money back to families in developing nations that often do not have established banking networks, or modern forms of electronic fund transfer capabilities. It needs to be understood that the payment of remittances is not simply some birthday present or bonus payment that communities try to send from time to time—it goes to the core of people looking after their families and why they go to work each day. 


I have written to the finance minister asking that the government take action on this. It is important to these communities in Australia that we find a way for remittance services to be resumed. There are occasions when specific transactions can and should be stopped for national security reasons, but to stop all remittance services in the manner that has occurred pushes many hardworking Australians into a circumstance where they cannot help people who are from their family who are completely reliant on that help. This has been a big issue in my electorate. Earlier this week in Canberra I met with representatives of the Somali community in Melbourne. It is within the grasp and the gift of the government to work with the banks and have this issue fixed.

The SPEAKER
 (15:16):  Yesterday I said, as a result of a personal explanation by the Leader of the Opposition, that I would review the tapes. After the Leader of the Opposition made a personal explanation in the House yesterday about a remark that he was alleged by the Prime Minister to have made by interjection earlier in question time, I undertook to review the tape, which I have done. Just before the Prime Minister responded to what he said was an interjection from the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition appears to make some remarks, but those remarks are not audible on the tape. So I am not in a position to adjudicate on this matter on the basis of the material I have reviewed today. However, I am investigating whether it is possible to enhance the sound and hear the words—

I simply make the point to all members that they are accountable for what they say in the House, even by way of interjection, and there are various forms of the House to ensure that members can be held to account.

"Feeney, David, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (15:20):  This is a very important matter of public importance, because the failure of the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Defence means that this government now crawls forward with yet another bleeding wound. It is plainly obvious that the Prime Minister must act. Dennis Shanahan posted in The Australian only a short time ago: 'David Johnston's job as defence minister ""finished""'. And we saw earlier from Paul Kelly, in today's edition of The Australian,that this government now confronts 'a growing crisis of trust'. This is a government going forward with a wounded Minister for Defence, and it cannot stand. The real tragedy and atrocity here is that the Australian Defence Force—its men and women—are currently on operations in the Middle East while being led by a bumbling minister. And this is not a minister who has been bumbling for a day, or for hours, but he has been bumbling for 15 months. This is known to those opposite.


Over the last 12 months, the Minister for Defence has given 40 speeches and interviews, while the foreign affairs minister has given 200. This is a minister who has been in the witness protection program of the Prime Minister for quite some time. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced 600 ADF personnel were to be deployed to the Middle East, he had standing by his side the Chief of the Defence Force. But where was the defence minister? He remained in hiding. And so, as this country sent its people into war, we saw Hugh White, Professor of Strategic Studies at the ANU, make the remark: 'He was incapable of answering the most basic of questions about why we are undertaking this military operation.' For 15 months, we have seen this minister deal with nothing but inaction and failure. You might recall, some short time ago, it took the minister two weeks to respond to claims made about the alleged mistreatment of asylum seekers by Royal Australian Navy sailors. And when he finally emerged, he said, 'I have not said much because, I have to confess, I was extremely angry and I have required some period of time to cool off.' Well, here is a man who lacks the temperament to be the Minister for Defence. Such a man has his finger on the trigger? Be reassured that he does not have his finger on the trigger. The Prime Minister and his colleagues have made sure that in fact this Minister for Defence has very little responsibility at all.


At the Australian Strategic Policy Institute submarine conference David Johnston began his contribution by saying, 'I have been told to say this and I have been told not to deviate from my speech.' He is on a very tight leash indeed. Most spectacularly of all, when asked to explain his absence at a meeting of the National Security Committee—a meeting of the NSC held while Australians are at war—he said, 'I didn't have much to add.' At the very beginning of his time as Minister for Defence he found himself overruled by the Prime Minister on the composition of his white paper planning team. It is the most fundamental of responsibilities in his portfolio and one with which he was not trusted.


The atrocities continue. We saw retired Major General Molan appear after a mere three weeks of service with the minister, which was all he could take of working with a minister who was in fact responsible for nothing. Major General Molan is a loyal, Liberal advocate—he is seeking Liberal party preselection in New South Wales. Notwithstanding those allegiances, when it came to criticising the minister he said, 'That's a conclusion you can come to. I'll have something to say with others in private.' Clearly he did, because this Minister for Defence remains absolutely in the witness protection program.


Broken promises have been a spectacular feature of Senator Johnston's time. He stood at the Australian Submarine Corporation in South Australia on 8 May 2013 and said:


We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.


…   …   …


The Coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide …


That is a promise that has not survived first contact, but it is plain to all of us that it is a promise they should keep or that at the very least they should bring themselves to ensure that there is an open tender for this multibillion dollar, multidecade policy.


Senator Johnston came into office as defence minister after intimating to the shipbuilding industry that he would bridge the valley of death by commissioning a fourth air warfare destroyer, another undertaking that did not survive first contact. Then, when talking about rescuing the shipbuilding industry in this country, he commissioned the Winter review. On the basis of that review he has denigrated the industry again and again and again. But what is the most striking feature of the Winter review, Deputy Speaker? No-one knows—



The SPEAKER:  There is no Deputy Speaker in the chair.




Mr FEENEY:
  Quite right. No-one knows, because this report remains secret. Despite the minister's undertakings to deliver this report to the Australian people, it remains a secret.


There we have it, a defence minister who has been in the witness protection program for quite some time, who is not trusted with serious responsibility, who is not allowed to make serious decisions and with whom senior retired personnel from the ADF cannot work. This is a sinking feeling that those opposite are now well acquainted with, a sinking feeling that has been made manifest in the last 24 hours. After his extraordinary remark that he would not trust the ASC to build a canoe—an extraordinary indulgence—we saw the Liberal Party scatter as they sought to distance themselves from this broken reed of a minister. One senior Liberal said, 'Senator Johnston's comments were breathtaking.' We have seen revealed the fact that these comments came just one fortnight after he apologised to the ASC chairman, Bruce Carter, for being critical of the agency's work. That was an apology that did not survive two weeks. We heard another senior Liberal say:


This whole process has been undermined by Johnston and his office from the very beginning.


Another senior Liberal said in the press today that these 'were some of the most stupid words I have ever heard from a senior minister.' Last night, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Jamie Briggs, said Senator Johnston's comments were just 'wrong'. In the aftermath of Senator Johnston's extraordinary performance, we saw the Prime Minister himself rush to contradict him, saying, 'I have full confidence in the ASC and its sustainment work for the Royal Australian Navy.' Very rarely do we see a Prime Minister rush to contradict a minister so quickly. Senator Birmingham, a South Australian Liberal Party senator, said:


We should be honest about the problems submarines and shipbuilding have faced at Osborne, but that is no excuse for denigration of the workforce or of the extensive capabilities that South Australia has.


Perhaps most spectacularly, we have heard today Steven Marshall, the leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia, say:


Unless he can rebuild some connection, some rapport, some confidence within the industry, then I don't think he has any alternative (but to resign) …


I don't think that his current position is tenable unless he can rebuild that confidence with the sector.


This minister's collapse is manifest to all, and with the Australian newspaper making it plain to us today, it seems that soon we will not be able to read the Australian as well as not be able to watch the ABC. We have a defence minister who has gone from lame duck to dead duck. We have a minister who today is plainly on life support.


In the last year, ASC has transformed its submarine maintenance program. Again and again it has exceeded the Navy's target for submarine readiness. We have seen improvements in the availability of the Collins class fleet to defend our national interests. This has been done on the back of a reform process that the former Labor government was very proud to have initiated and that even those opposite were forced to concede had done the job and done it well. Notwithstanding that, we have a minister who apparently feels that he can denigrate the industry and the ASC without any regard for the fact that the ASC today, right now, is responsible for sustaining and maintaining our submarine capability. There are literally hundreds of submariners under the oceans of this world who rely on the work of the ASC, and they are told by this debacle of a minister that that organisation could not be trusted to build a canoe. This is an atrocity that cannot stand. To add insult to injury he now says it was a rhetorical flourish. This is a man who does not have the temperament to be the Minister for Defence. This plainly is a man who does not have the judgement to be the Minister for Defence. This is a man who has a record of 15 months of inaction and dithering. The words 'blundering' and 'withering' appear again and again in reference to this minister. Over the course of 12 months we have seen this minister do next to nothing. There has been failure after failure to proceed with the important LAND400 project. Those opposite spout about how important is SEA1000, the Future Submarine project, but 15 months down the track we have nothing. We have a shipbuilding industry that is in crisis because after 15 months this government has yet to achieve anything except send our shipbuilding work overseas, feeding the shipyards of foreign nations without any regard to our own and breaking its own promises and intimations to the industry that there would be work and reform in the industry. Again and again we see this minister relying on the fact that, he says, this industry is not up to the job and relying on a report that remains a secret. (Time expired)

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (15:30):  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on defence and to remind the nation that there are no better hands for the Department of Defence and its fighting men and women than the coalition, those on this side of the House. It is interesting to reflect that 1,600 questions have been asked during question time and, out of those, only one has been asked to me, by the member for Batman, on defence—just one. So let's be very up-front: those opposite are not interested in substantive matters of defence and national security. They are interested in politics, plain and simple.


The Leader of the Opposition has jumped on this like a rabid dog to a bone, despite the Leader of the Opposition being at the cabinet table when $16 billion was ripped out of defence. I wonder what the Leader of the Opposition said around that cabinet table. Perhaps he was too busy worrying about who he was going to backstab. So let's see this confected outrage for what it is. It comes from an opposition leader who is directionless.


The Minister for Defence, to his credit, has come out this morning and apologised for the comments that he made in the heat of the moment. I think it is reasonable to say that a rhetorical flourish is hardly reason for dismissal of a minister let alone a matter of public importance in the House. But if Labor wants to have a debate and if the member for Hunter, who has just turned up, wants to have a debate, let's have it. Let's not forget that those opposite had 16 ministerial reshuffles in the defence portfolio in six years. That is one every five months. The member for Hunter was removed for breaking the ministerial code of conduct. That is a fact. So if those opposite want to talk about the strengths of defence portfolio ministers they should be wary of the winding road and the red or blue tablet that you take.


I think it is reasonable to say that the Labor Party are directionless when it comes to the issue of defence. Arguments that seek to whitewash their shame, their inadequacy and their history of doing nothing will not wash in here. So let's put the facts on the table when it comes to defence in South Australia, because the facts and the truth, Member for Batman, will truly set you free.


This year the government will spend $34 million in South Australia on the Future Submarine program, building our competencies and knowledge base in cooperation with industry. Over the next four years, in anticipation of the defence white paper, $4.2 billion will be spent in South Australia. This year alone, almost $1 billion worth of defence procurement and sustainment work is being undertaken in South Australia. In fact, 25 per cent of all sustainment across the nation is South Australian. That state is seriously punching above its weight on numbers, to its credit. There are 44 separate acquisition projects, including: the air warfare destroyer program; support for and upgrade of the P3 Orions; and upgrades to the Anzac class frigates and the army's communications systems.


South Australia is also home to some 58 separate sustainment programs, including the sustainment of Collins and the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. In February this year, the PM announced that Australia will acquire eight P8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft that will be based at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. The government will consider four additional P8As as part of the defence white paper process. There are enormous opportunities for industry and jobs in South Australia. Businesses in that state stand to benefit by as much as $1 billion through the construction of facilities at Edinburgh and elsewhere to meet the requirements.


In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the government had committed to the acquisition of the highly capable Triton UAV. This will also be based in Adelaide, South Australia, bringing significant further economic benefits. The acquisition will require approximately $140 million worth of new facilities, $100 million of which will be invested in South Australia. Support requirements for Triton will create a further $20 million worth in opportunities annually for businesses in South Australia. In March, the Prime Minister announced a contract that includes $78 million in work for BAE in South Australia, part of a five-year multimillion dollar contract with Boeing for the sustainment of the Wedgetail.


As you can see, there is an enormous amount of work that goes to South Australia. There is a plan for shipbuilding, and there is a plan for shipbuilding in South Australia. There are management issues. There is no question about that when it comes to our fleet of ships. There is a reform strategy for the air warfare destroyer project, a gift from those opposite two years late and up to $600 million over budget. There is nothing like fiscal gifts from the Labor Party!


In June, the government committed a further $78.2 million to accelerate work on the future frigate that will keep alive the option of building future frigates in Australia—another gift, legacy and disgrace left by the Labor Party. Be in no doubt—the nation should be in no doubt at all—that there is a huge budget being spent on defence work in South Australia.


The substance of this motion is fraudulent. We know it, the House knows it and the member for Batman knows it. Let's not forget the without-precedent and baseless slur in Senator Conroy's attack on Lieutenant General Campbell. Senator Conroy is the shadow minister for defence. He accused a three-star general, one of the most senior military officers in the country, of running a political cover-up. What did the leader of the opposition do? Nothing. The shadow minister for defence accused an outstanding, credentialled three-star general of a cover-up, and the Leader of the Opposition turned his back. Did he demand an apology from Conroy? No. Did he censure Conroy? No. Did he demand Conroy make public statements? No, he turned his back.


And what did the member for Batman do about that? On 27 February this year, during an interview with Peter van Onselen on Sky, this issue was raised. The member for Batman said of the matter that it was sufficient for Senator Conroy to withdraw his remarks—it was sufficient. That was the member for Batman's view—that it was sufficient that Senator Conroy just withdraw his remarks after saying to a three star general: 'This is a cover-up'.


Yet today, clearly, the Minister for Defence publicly apologising and making a statement in the Senate is not good enough. It is good enough for Senator Conroy but not good enough for anyone else. Do you know what that is called? It is called hypocrisy. It is called hypocrisy—writ large. It is called a whitewash too. It is called a brood of vipers. It is called hypocrisy.


If we want to talk about hypocrisy, if we want to unpack hypocrisy from the Labor Party, the list is long. I refer to a publication, The Little Book of Labor's Defence Backflips, that goes through about 30 of them in nauseating detail. Let us look at them. Prime Minister Rudd sent an adviser to the national security cabinet. Prime Minister Gillard sent her bodyguard to the national security cabinet. Defence spending reached the lowest level of GDP since 1938. On 38 occasions, Labor ministers promised three per cent growth in the Defence budget, and what did we get? $16 billion worth of cuts. You did not even come close, did you? You missed it by this much!


You promised, before 2007, to index DFRDB pensions. How did that go? It went nowhere! In fact, this side of the House tried to pass private members' bills, as well as using other processes of the House. There were three attempts. And what did you do? You broke the promise. You promised to build 12 family health clinics. How many did you build? None. You promised to look after Defence personnel—and then you tried to take travel away from 21,000 of them. You decided in 2013 to have a white paper, and all you had was some dross you served up with a $150,000 backdrop of jets, fighters and other defence gear. Your 2012-13 budget delayed and cancelled capability—a 34 per cent reduction in Defence Capability Plan funding and over 40 per cent of DCP projects impacted by cuts. Despite all that, the Labor Party has the temerity, the audacity, the blatant effrontery to come in here and demand that we remove an effective defence minister. Hypocrisy, my friend. Hypocrisy is your name.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:40):  I rise today as the member for the electorate in which the Australian Submarine Corporation is located. I rise to say squarely to the Prime Minister: this defence minister must go. The comments yesterday were the most reckless and insulting remarks you could imagine from a defence minister, but they were not isolated. They were just the latest in a series of slip-ups, broken promises, blunders and other acts of sheer incompetence by this fellow who has clearly—it is now absolutely clear—been promoted above his ability.


You do not have to take it just from the member for Batman, from me or from other speakers on this side of the House, because colleague after colleague on the government benches are lining up to say this defence minister is a joke. Some of them are doing it on the record. Every South Australian MP, with the exception of the member for Sturt, has stood up in the media, put their name to it and said that his comments were hopeless. They have disassociated themselves from his comments—except for the member for Sturt, who refuses to do that.


We have just seen another audition, this time from the assistant minister. He is but one of a series of frontbenchers—most of whom do it by backgrounding, not putting their name to it—lining up like Tonya Harding to take this defence minister out at the knees, because they have picked up the smell of blood. The member for Bass is up there because he knows that if the assistant minister moves up then he moves up to be a parliamentary secretary. You can tell it—right up to the back. The furthest back of the backbenchers have picked up the smell of blood. They know this guy is hanging in the breeze—but not the Prime Minister, apparently.


The Prime Minister is dreadfully happy with this chap. He thinks he is doing an outstanding job. He has his full confidence. He is quite happy to see a minister stand up and disparage, in the other place, the skills of some of the most highly skilled tradesmen and tradeswomen in this country who are building and sustaining some of the most important naval assets this country has—our submarines and our air warfare destroyers.


Before I get to some of those policy issues that the member for Batman has so skilfully outlined, consider the human impact. There are 3,000 workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation, mainly in South Australia but also in Western Australia. Thousands of those workers have had their capacity, their lifelong skills, impugned by this defence minister. They rightly regard themselves as having some of the best skills in this country, but they are also intensely proud to be part of the nation's defence apparatus, building and sustaining incredibly important naval assets. You have to ask yourself—even the member for Bass, I am sure, will ask himself—how does that make those families feel? How does that make the proud community of Port Adelaide feel?


I will not talk about that. Instead I will quote Andrew Daniels, who is an Australian Submarine Corporation worker—has been for years. He is a proud worker with amazing skills. He said this yesterday in the media:


We're being trashed. When I go home to my family and this guy—


the defence minister—


is telling me I'm useless ... I don't feel useless and that's pretty gutting to 3,000 workers in South Australia and Western Australia. It's not a great feeling to have your Defence Minister, you're out there doing your best job for the country and he's trashing you.


He is trashing them and that is not good. This minister does not even have the grace to apologise properly.


The Prime Minister in question time today said this minister had apologised and withdrawn his remarks. That is just not true. The only person I have heard this minister apologise to in the last 24 hours is the Liberal Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, who—as the member for Batman said—thinks that this defence minister has pretty much satisfied the criteria for resignation or sacking. He said this minister's position was 'untenable'. And it is untenable. Any veneer of objectivity in the extremely important job of deciding that next generation of submarines project has utterly gone now. This minister is clearly committed to giving these jobs overseas to Japan. He must go or be sacked.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (15:45):  There you have it! Getting lessons from Labor on ministerial accountability is a bit like getting lesson on ethics from Eddie Obeid, or lessons from Stephen Smith about how to treat ADFA commandants, or lessons from Stephen Conroy on how to treat Lieutenant-Generals in Senate estimates, or lessons from Kevin Rudd on team building perhaps. So thank you for those lessons. 


What this MPI reveals is that Labor remains in a miasma of denial. They are damned by their own record of the most appalling dysfunction during six years of Labor and Labor-Greens government—and not just dysfunction but destruction of the Defence portfolio. 


We heard the member for Fadden talk about 16 reshuffles. Labor had three defence ministers during their six years. I know that, because I worked to all three of them. We had the member for Hunter, who did not serve his turn; he left after admitting he did not comply with the ministerial code of conduct. We had Senator Faulkner, who left 12 months later—very soon after Kevin Rudd had been politically knifed by the current Leader of the Opposition. We had Stephen Smith, who spent most of his tenure manning the ATM, scratching the fiscal itch; whenever Penny Wong and Wayne Swan called for it he would ring up the Defence ATM and hand over the dollars—$16 billion of defence funding. So when you come into this place and you talk about ministerial accountability, pause for a moment and reflect on your record. 


I remember the member for Hunter and the Cessnock conference—the grand bargain between Defence and the Labor government of the day. It was reliant on government providing real increases in the defence budget of three per cent between 2009 and 2017-18; 2.2 per cent beyond 2017-18 to 2030—and they said they would give them a deal on indexation. Then they said to Defence: 'Your part of this grand bargain is to come up with $20 billion of internal savings'—about eight to 10 per cent of their budget, year on year. Yet here they are complaining about 4.4 per cent from the ABC, and they impose 10 per cent on Defence, year on year, for a decade. 


But the combined effects of those two things—government investment in defence and the $20 billion in savings—was meant to deliver something called Force 2030—do you remember that? It was 12 submarines the famous Rudd-pluck of 12 submarines, determined on the back of the same envelope that the NBN plan was written on. It is little wonder that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has referred to the defence budget under that mob as an unsustainable mess. 


I listened with incredulity earlier today when the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to come into this place and talk about submarines. In six years they failed to progress SEA 1000; six years, and not even first pass approval; no contracts or key milestones achieved; no meaningful work at all. 



Ms Butler interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Griffith is interjecting from outside of her place in this chamber.




Mr NIKOLIC:
  Cost overruns on the Air Warfare Destroyer of plus-$360 million, and two years overdue. So, if you want to talk about legacies, I love talking about Labor's legacy when it comes to defence. 


Labor's approach to defence projects was all about delay and obfuscation. It was about insufficient resources. It was about constantly changing plans. Who can ever forget that wonderful campaign promise by the former Leader of the Labor Party, Kevin Rudd, to move the entire Navy from Garden Island to Brisbane? Can we all remember that? If that is not ministerial irresponsibility, I do not know what is. 


The results of Labor's inaction on things like the submarine project are plain for all to see: the potential for the Collins class submarines to reach the end of their usable life when the new subs are not ready. That is called a capability gap, and that is a capability gap that you cannot fill easily. The Leader of the Opposition says: 'If we were in government, here is what we would do with all these projects'. Well, you had six years, and what did you do? You ruined this country economically, diplomatically and militarily. So spare us your sanctimonious lectures. Admit your considerable failings and get out of our way as we fix your mess.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (15:50):  Talk about 'spare us the sanctimonious lectures'! Not once did the speaker mention the minister's name, and this is all about the performance, or the lack thereof, of the Minister for Defence. 


What we saw last night and over the past 24 hours from the Minister for Defence is absolutely outrageous. His comments were a complete kick in the guts to the highly skilled and dedicated workers of the AFC—and not just the AFC; a range of industries support the AFC in South Australia. There are hundreds and hundreds of workers in industries throughout South Australia who were supporting those workers. What the minister did last night was kick them in the guts. We heard from the former speaker about what it actually felt like to be one of those workers, to hear the minister's view of those workers. It is absolutely outrageous. It is complete kick in the guts and a complete insult. 


Australia expects more from its defence minister. Australia expects more, particularly when we are dealing with capability that is incredibly significant for the nation's security. And we are talking about jobs that are incredibly significant for the nation's security—3,000 South Australian workers, and what did he do to them last night? He gave them a significant kick in the guts. And it is not just them; it is also the families of these people that go, each day, and do great work in supporting capability to defend our nation 


What do you think those families thought when those people came home? It is absolutely outrageous. And, as the member for Batman said, what about the families of those submariners who are out there serving the country, defending our nation, doing it tough away from their families? Imagine how their mothers felt; imagine how their fathers felt; imagine how their brothers and sisters felt when they heard that the organisation that is there to support the capability that they are serving the nation in could not build a canoe. How outrageous were those comments from the minister. How insulting. What a kick in the guts to workers.


This minister has form on this. We have seen what he has done in terms of ADF pay and conditions—cutting ADF pay and conditions so that the pay deal that has been offered by this minister and this government is below inflation. It means that these people are expected to basically take a pay cut. And it is not just that. It is the cut to conditions that is even more insulting—hard-fought-for conditions after many, many years. These include cuts to recreation leave, cuts to Christmas leave and cuts to opportunities for families who have not seen each other throughout the year to get together. That has all gone as a result of what this minister and this government has done in the outrageous pay deal—the slap in the face that you have delivered through the ADF pay deal and the cut to conditions, as well.


You have until 1 December to turn back this ridiculous decision. We have been calling on you to reverse this decision and to reverse these cuts to pay and conditions. The ADF community has been calling on you to do it. We have been calling on you to do it. Are you going to make a reversal of that decision by 1 December? Time is running out, everyone. Are you listening to your constituents? Are you listening to the ADF members in your electorates? Are you listening to the families and the children of those ADF members? They are outraged. What they are most outraged by is the fact that they see this as them being part of collateral damage when the real target is cuts to pay and conditions for public servants. These guys just see themselves as, absolutely, collateral damage in the real quest to cut the conditions and pay for public servants. You have until 1 December to reverse the decision. Reverse that decision, listen to your constituents, listen to the ADF members, listen to the families and listen to the children of those families.


On the weekend—although I do not know whether those opposite actually took any notice—there was a major rally in Townsville. Two hundred people turned out—ADF members in civilian clothes, ADF family members and parents of ADF members. They were absolutely outraged at what you have done on this. They are going to maintain the fight. The DFWA is going to maintain the fight. The RSL is going to maintain the fight. ADF members and their families right across Australia are going to maintain the fight. And we will maintain the fight to ensure that ADF members and their families get decent pay and conditions.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:55):  It is a privilege to be able to participate in this debate, moved by the good member for Batman, on sacking ministers. The member for Batman has a lot of form in not only sacking ministers but actually sacking prime ministers. So we should go back: we are now a little over 12 months in to cleaning up the mess from the worst, most incompetent and most dysfunctional government in our nation's history. Across every portfolio, every minister that has come into their portfolio has had an absolutely diabolical mess to clean up.


I would like to, perhaps, pose the question: which minister has inherited the greatest mess and has had the greatest problems with what they have had to clean up? I will start with the Treasurer. We should remember that the past financial year was the year that the budget was meant to be in surplus. We can remember the former Treasurer standing at the dispatch box and saying 'the four years of surpluses I announce tonight' and 'this budget delivers a surplus'. Well, we know what happened. There was no surplus; there was a deficit—a $48 billion deficit. Then we could look at the Minister for Small Business. What was the mess that he inherited? There are 500,000 fewer jobs in the small business sector and 3,000 fewer small businesses employing people after this mess. Or perhaps we could look at the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has been trying to clean up the debacle of a previous minister whose main concerns were about whether he had silk pyjamas, about traveling first class or about the quality of the meal in business class. Or we could look at the Minister for Communications. He had to clean up the mess of the NBN, with a catastrophic blow-out of $29 billion. Or perhaps we could look at the Minister for Education and the mess that he has had to clean up. Under Labor's reign, according to the World Economic Forum, our educational standards in this country slipped from eighth in the world all the way back to 23rd. And then we have the ministers for industry and the environment. They have had to clean up the mess of the carbon tax, which put Australia's industry at a competitive disadvantage. And then, of course, the minister for immigration could also challenge for the award.



Mr Champion interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Interjecting from outside of your place in this chamber, member for Wakefield, is very disorderly.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Fifty thousand arrivals, 800 illegal boats, 1,000 more deaths—this is the mess that has been carried out. But of all the portfolios the ministry has had to clean up, I think the Minister for Defence has had the most difficult job. Let's go through the mess that the Defence minister has had to inherit and has had to clean up.



Mr Champion interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Wakefield! It is disorderly to interject outside of your place in this chamber.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  We had the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, promise a three per cent annual increase in Defence spending. What did they deliver? Sixteen billion dollars worth of cuts. You come in here and you cry these crocodile tears when you were responsible for $16 billion worth of cuts from Defence. You reduced Defence expenditure in this nation to the lowest level since 1938, when Neville Chamberlain stood up and said, 'There will be peace in our time'. That is how you reduced Defence expenditure in this country. In your last budget, you slashed Defence expenditure by 10 per cent.


You come in here and cry these crocodile tears and you march in the streets about a 4.6 per cent cut to the ABC. Where were you people when you were cutting 10 per cent from Defence? Nowhere to be seen. This is the mess we have inherited. This is the mess our Defence minister, Senator Johnston, has inherited. What a debacle. Not only that, we have an obligation to pay the interest on the debt that this mob ran up. Every single month we must pay $1 billion in interest. One billion dollars every single month goes out to pay the interest on the debt this mob created. 


This MPI will go for one hour. In that time, because of the debt this mob have run up, we must find as a nation $1.5 million in interest. It is an absolute mess. We are working to clean it up and every minister in this place is doing a good job and has my support. (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:00):  I speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Batman. Last year the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, said on 8 May 2013: 'We will deliver those submarines from right here at ASC in South Australia.' He said, 'The coalition today is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' It was no slip of the tongue. It was said very deliberately, because the submarine contract mattered to South Australia in the period leading up to the election. It was indeed a key South Australian federal election issue. The minister at the time knew that and made that commitment in order to try to win votes in South Australia.


It is interesting, as we debate this, that there is not a South Australian Liberal member of parliament here in the chamber to support the workers of South Australia. I remind those South Australian federal Liberal MPs that we on this side of the House will remind the voters of South Australia—right through to the next election—about the commitment made by Minister Johnston in 2013. They can rest assured of that. We will remind them, because it is another broken promise of the Abbott government for South Australia.


On top of having had the auto industry shafted, South Australians see this issue as even more important now than it was in 2013. The Abbott government is now trying to shift the promise from 'We will build the submarines in South Australia,' to 'The work will be centred around South Australia.' We heard the word 'centred' used by the Prime Minister today in answer to a question from me and others on this side of the House.




Mr Feeney:
  It is deceitful!




Mr ZAPPIA:
  As the member for Batman said, it is deceitful, because the words were 'We will build them there.' It is part of their mantra and it will not wash with the people of South Australia. Even worse—and quite disgracefully—the minister has now embarked on a narrative of trashing the ASC in South Australia. First, he said it will cost $60 billion to $80 billion to build the submarines in South Australia—without ever giving any figures or discussing the matter with them—and then he talked about the disgraceful mess regarding the Air Warfare Destroyer program, knowing full well that most of the reasons for the cost blow-out were matters beyond the control of the ASC.


Yesterday, when he said, 'Do you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe here?' he simply went too far. The comments are insulting, they are ignorant, they are ill informed and they offend the thousands of workers of that industry—workers, engineers and designers—who know that is simply not true. The problem is, he will not even commit to an open-tender process. If he were a fair minister on this issue why would he not commit to an open-tender process and allow everyone to put in their bids? 


I will quickly go to another matter. Last year, the Prime Minister visited Japan in April. In June, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the Defence minister went to Japan. In August, the Prime Minister of Japan visited Australia. Also in August a Japanese delegation visited the ASC facilities, in South Australia, for undisclosed purposes. It may be just coincidence, but it begs the question: what backroom deals were done by the Prime Minister to secure the Japan-Australia free trade agreement, and was the submarine contract part of those deals?


This is indeed a serious matter. It goes to the heart of Australia's national security. It commits Australia to tens of billions of dollars of government expenditure and it affects the jobs of thousands of Australians. Most importantly, it is critical to Australia's Defence manufacturing capability. Senator Johnston, not just through his comments yesterday but also through a series of actions since the election, has shown himself to be incompetent. He is now a lame-duck defence minister. 


The future of Australia's national security is far too important to be entrusted to a defenceless minister, and the Prime Minister should cut him adrift. That is what this motion seeks to do. I assure members opposite that I have had emails from people in South Australia who are as outraged about the minister's comments as we are on this side of the House. The Prime Minister should take note of what people are saying out there in the community.

An opposition member:  Tell us about David Johnston!




Mr HOWARTH:
  I will get to the minister in a minute, member for Batman. The Labor Party are all about political point-scoring. Their MPI debates, their 90-second statements and their constituency statements are all negative. There is nothing positive. On this side of the House we are very positive about the Australian Defence Force.



Mr Champion interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Wakefield—




Mr HOWARTH:
  We heard from the member for Batman. He got up on this MPI and said the reason the Defence minister needs to go is that he has not made enough speeches. Member for Batman: it is not about speeches, mate, it is about performance. That is what counts here. 


The member for Port Adelaide got up and said, 'This minister's got slip-ups in incompetence.' Then he went on a rant that was totally unfounded. The member for Canberra—who has decided to leave and not even stick around for the rest of the debate—gets up and wants to go on about ADF pay and conditions, yet she was a member of the previous government that saw the biggest fiscal turnaround in this country since federation in 1901. 


We left them with billions in the bank. They racked up billions in debt. We have $1 billion a month that we are repaying in debt. And she wants to go on about ADF pay and conditions. Well, she should have thought of that before she spent a truck load of money and left all these people up here in the gallery, and every other Australian, with a heap of debt.

  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: can I seek clarification as to whether the member said 'Johnson' or 'Johnston'?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is not a point of order. In fact it is disorderly, and the member for Hunter should know that.




Mr HOWARTH:
  The member for Makin spoke about South Australian members and so forth. Well, defence affects all members of this parliament. Defence affects all Australians. He wants to give us advice on defence acquisitions. Well, on this side of the House we take advice from the minister; and also from the assistant minister, the member for Fadden, who had a distinguished career in the Defence Force; and also from the member for Bass, who spoke on this MPI today, who was a distinguished brigadier in the Defence Force and sits on our defence backbench committee. I am quite happy to take recommendations from those members on our side of the parliament. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  The Labor Party are negative. I am quite happy to talk about the Minister for Defence. I judge people by what I see when I meet them. I have spoken to the Minister for Defence on several occasions and I believe he is passionate about the ADF and believes Australia needs to have a strong Defence Force. Let's look at what the minister said today in the Senate. He said: 'The frustrations of successive governments with the performance of both the Collins class sustainment and the AWD program are well documented. I am committed to leading the effort to fix our problems. I did express my frustrations in the past performance of ASC—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HOWARTH:
  Listen up, 'shadow minister'. He said: 'In these comments I never intended to cause offence and regret that offence may have been taken.' But that is not good enough for the opposition because they are Mr and Mrs Negativity. What is Labor's record on defence? We have heard it from other members, and I will not go into it all again, but we know that they launched a defence white paper and then cut $16 billion out of defence. Many new members are sitting around me here. We made the decision to run for our seats in parliament because of your past performance, because of the cuts that you made to defence and the many, many things that you did—and you have the gall to come in here and raise this in an MPI debate. Under Labor, defence spending dropped to 1.56 per cent, the lowest since 1938. We have made a commitment to invest in defence. We will continue to do so and ensure taxpayers' money is spent well.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:10):  In World War II they had posters that said 'Loose lips sink ships', and we have got a defence minister with the loosest lips in the history of the Federation! Unfortunately, this is all part of the form of the Liberal Party, who have been undermining the Collins class submarine, one of the best diesel electric submarines in the world, since the 1990s. In the 1990s they went after the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who is now the Australian Ambassador to the United States, in a totally partisan attack. They went after the Collins class submarine to undermine the then Leader of the Opposition. And now they are after the Collins class submarine again, they are after the ASC again, they are after workers again.


They have got form on this. This is no mere 'rhetorical flourish' as it was described by the defence minister this morning on 891 ABC. This minister is a blackguard. He is out to get workers, he is out to get the Collins class submarine, he is out to get the ASC and he is out to get South Australia. Loose lips sink ships. The minister is sinking fast because he tried to attack national institutions and he tried to attack workers. He was a bit too smart, a bit too full on, a bit too hot headed in the Senate yesterday. And what do we see? All of this damage. And what do you lot do? There is not one South Australian in the room. We have to roll out these Tasmanians to defend the minister—and even they do not mention the minister's name!



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  I will tell you what South Australians think. The Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Marshall, says the minister's position is untenable and he should resign. Mr Briggs, the member for Mayo, says he is wrong. Senator Birmingham says there are no excuses for the behaviour, no excuses for the language. Mr Southcott said Senator Johnston's comments were 'deeply regrettable, unhelpful and wrong'. Even Senator Edwards—who let me tell you sticks with the Liberal Party through thick and thin; I have been on the receiving end of some of his campaigning—says there should be an open tender and he has full confidence in the workers at ASC. And in The Australian the 'unknown' Liberals say that it is bizarre, breathtaking, stupid. That is what they say about this minister—'bizarre, breathtaking, stupid'.


We know that there are some good Liberals around the place. I beat one of them in 2007. His name is David Fawcett. He is the bloke who should be defence minister. He knows more about defence than all of you. It is a great pity that he is not in the chamber today—well, it is not such a pity; I am glad he is in the Senate! He should be defence minister. He has called for an open tender. He knows how damaging this minister is, he knows how important this submarines decision is and he knows how good the Collins class submarine is. But it is not just all of us in this debate. Hugh White, from the ANU, said the minister could not actually articulate the reasons why we are in Iraq. That is what Hugh White says. Jim Molan went on the Bolt Report and praised everybody but the minister. When Andrew Bolt said, You seem to be pointing to the minister, David Johnston.' He said, 'Well I do not really want to go into that. I will say what I need to say privately.' That is what is going on. We know what he said. We know this minister is absent from the national security council. He is cutting pay. And we know he is a loose lipped minister. He is a foolish minister. He is a hot-headed minister.


The Prime Minister has to choose between this foolish idiot as a Defence minister and workers, the national interest, our sub mariners, the ASC, shipbuilding workers and the national institution. He has to choose between an incompetent minister and the national interest. That is the choice here. None of you have done a particularly good job of defending Minister Johnston because you all know loose lips sink ships. Johnson has to go.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (16:15):  The sheer hypocrisy of this MPI. All this MPI succeeds in doing is highlighting the double standards shown by the opposition when it comes to deciding what is deemed worthy in regards to sacking someone. The nerve of those opposite to talk about witness protection programs. Let's talk about your witness protection programs.


We have all heard of Craig Thomson, who is currently awaiting sentencing for fraud with 65 convictions. We talk about 'loose lips sink ships'. Craig Thompson is a classic example of 'those in glass houses should not throw stones'. What about Peter Slipper? Those opposite in the Labor Party supported someone who forged documents to line his own pockets, effectively stealing from taxpayers. What did those opposite do? They did the same thing they did for Craig Thomson—they defended him at every opportunity.


When it comes to sacking people, Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, has been very keen to sack people. He stabbed in the back poor Julia and he stabbed in the back poor Kevin. I have never seen a union hack so keen on the idea of unfair dismissal. What a wonderful example the former member for Dobell and the opposition have set for the hypocrisy of today's MPI subject.


This MPI is also a chance to highlight the lack of interest shown in Defence by the opposition when previously in government. No investment in Defence spelt 1.56 per cent of the GDP. The year 2012-13 was the lowest level of Defence funding since 1938. I would like to point out which Prime Minister was in charge during this disgusting abandonment of our Defence portfolio but it is just too confusing because during the time of the chaos there were two Prime Ministers, three Deputy Prime Minister's—the list goes on.


But we are all aware that on the opposition's watch the 10.5 per cent cut in the 2012-13 budget was the biggest since the Korean conflict. And another example of the opposition's refusal to sack a member of their party would be their highly unsuccessful border protection policies. Was the Minister for Immigration sacked when on his watch more than 50,000 illegals arrived and more than 800 boats? Were moves made to sack any member of the opposition when Labor's failed border protection policies caused a budget blow-out of $11 billion? What about when tragically 1,100 drownings occurred at sea on Labor's watch? The list goes on and on.


Another fine example of the hypocrisy of calling for the sack of our hard-working minister—and I will name him, David Johnston—is the opposition's failure to make decisions. Six years is how long the opposition failed to make a decision on the protection capability of our country. And that is as long as it takes for a student to go from year 7 to year 12 in high school. This was six years of jobs uncertainty, six years of empty promises and Defence spending cuts. Perhaps the opposition should look at its own failures and mess before trying to create make-believe stories about issues and policy they obviously know nothing about, proven by their failures during their time in government. But luckily for the Australian people, the Abbott government takes Defence and national security seriously. More importantly, Australian people now have a Minister for Defence—and I will name him again, David Johnston—who understands how critical a strong Defence Force is for our nation.


Instead of sitting around twiddling thumbs and staring at ageing ships in need of replacement, we are taking steps to ensure our Navy is properly equipped and providing the Australian shipbuilding industry with a long-term strategic direction it lacked during the years under Labor's rule. Instead of stripping nearly $20 billion out of the future submarine program, we are concentrating on an affordable and deliverable plan to ensure that the huge national investment in a viable defence capability is done properly. The coalition is ensuring that Australia has the military capability to deter threats and to protect our forces in our neighbourhood.


The vital need for a strong credible Defence approach is even more important to me since observing Operation Resolute earlier this year. It was there that I witnessed first-hand the outstanding job that our men and women do in our armed services. Having observed and been part of Operation Resolute, I am in awe of the professionalism, commitment and dedication of the men and women tasked to protect our borders. This is why I am proud to be part of a government which makes the right decisions for the right reasons. (Time expired)

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (16:21):  As I was saying, all of these industries are of major importance to the Australian economy and are indeed growing in size and importance. The master of a ship or pilot of any aircraft may also bring the ship or aircraft to a place other than a port or airport due to the stress of weather or other reasonable cause. Extending customs control and examination powers to these non-proclaimed places will minimise the risks that these activities may pose. In short, this bill is about addressing the situation that currently exists but also situations that become an issue in the future. For example, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that at some point in the future the epidemic of people-smuggling by boat could become an epidemic of people-smuggling by small light plane. Given the many hundreds of small islands and remote areas around Australia, this is not impossible. However, with the vision and planning of this government, we are slamming the door shut in the face of people smugglers. We are taking the sugar off the table before it has even been placed on the table, literally saying to the people smugglers and other nefarious types intent on doing no good, 'Don't even think about it.' This bill is consistent with everything the coalition has done in government. It is consistent with our plan, our contract with the Australian people. In the final analysis, this bill is consistent with our mission to continue to restore hope, reward and opportunity.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (16:23):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is an important one. There are a number of specific provisions of this bill that I will come to shortly and commend to the House. But it is important to explain to the House the very sorry state of affairs that this government inherited in the area of customs and border protection, because we saw six years of abject failure by those opposite in this area. Of course we are all very familiar with the failings in the area of border protection and illegal boat arrivals, but it is also very important to comment on the failure to screen goods whose entry into Australia was being sought during the period of the previous government. And under the previous Minister for Home Affairs and Justice we saw an appalling degradation of the capacity of our border security at Customs.


You might recall that back in 2012 we saw an appalling instance of this with the arrival of a large gun shipment that came through Customs and actually showed up at a post office in Sydney, in Sylvania Waters, not far from my electorate of Banks. Understandably, this concerned the community immensely, because the whole point of having a customs and border protection service is to stop this sort of contraband getting into this country. We must stop the flow of illegal guns. We must stop drugs and other illegal merchandise before it gets into the country. You would think that there would be unanimity on that point of view, and you would think that even the most incompetent of governments would commit resources to addressing this fundamental issue, but the last government failed in a spectacular fashion in this space. As the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said, Customs is not just a border security issue; it is a national security issue, because if you do not control the flow of goods at the borders, how do you know what is coming in? And if you do not know what is coming in, you do not know what is coming in. What that means is that there is every chance that criminals will seek to exploit that weakness—and of course that is exactly what they do.


Let us have a look at some of the failings of the previous government in this area, and I will come in a moment to how in our time in government we have addressed these incredible blunders. One of the first things that Labor did was to cut staff in Customs. There was a substantial cut in staff in Customs, from 5,700 to 5,000, and this was at a time when, because of the flow of illegal boat arrivals appearing on the horizon on an almost daily basis—and sometimes more than one a day—Customs was already under immense pressure. A sensible government would stop the flow of boat arrivals; a government that was less sensible but at least conscious of the issues would not cut the staff to address Customs problems when they were in fact increasing so dramatically. We have heard a lot about so-called budget cuts, but what about the cuts that Labor made to Customs, totalling over $700 million out to 2017-18—that is about three-quarters of a billion dollars in the area of Customs. And again, this is an area that is so fundamental to our national security, so how could a responsible government not seek to put its best foot forward in this space?


We did become aware in recent years of allegations of extensive corruption within the customs service, and these allegations were aired as early as 2007. People came forward to the previous government and said, 'There is a real concern about potential criminality at our ports and the involvement of criminal cartels and so on.' But what did the previous government do? Well, they did not do anything until late in 2012, when the Minister for Home Affairs—in his Hollywood fashion—put out a big announcement and press release and said that investigations would be conducted. But it would have been good to conduct those investigations back in 2007 when the issue was first brought to the attention of the government. Again, they did not do that.


The other extraordinary thing that occurred was the huge cut in the screening of sea cargo. Of course, sea cargo is the most common form by which illegal contraband goods get into the country. Sea cargo has a capacity for volume that is more difficult in airborne cargo. Labor's approach here was also novel. In an environment where there are allegations of corruption within Customs on their watch and an environment where we know that there is a huge increase in the demands upon Customs because of all the chaos that is going on at the borders, what Labor said was, 'You know what we should do? Let's dramatically reduce the amount of cargo that we screen.' This is really quite extraordinary. In the 2009-10 budget, back in those days of Labor, there was a cut to the Customs cargo screening program of $58 million. That was an extraordinary act by the government in a long litany of incompetencies. But they actually cut the budget for the screening of sea cargo, when as a society and a nation one of our highest priorities must be to ensure that illegal goods, guns, drugs and all the other terrible things that unfortunately criminals try to peddle in our society are kept out. You do not to that by dramatically cutting the budget.


The result of the cutting the budget to cargo screening is quite instructive. It is very instructive indeed. Under the Howard government, 60 per cent of air cargo consignments were expected. That was more than half. Under Labor, five per cent of air cargo consignments were inspected. The difference is so dramatic that it beggars belief, but it is accurate. Sixty per cent of air cargo consignments were screened under the Howard government and five per cent were screened by the end of Labor's term, which is just an extraordinary dereliction of duty on the part of those opposite.


There was a very significant drop in sea cargo inspections. The ratio of reductions is about 40 per cent, relative to what was inspected before. Less than one per cent of sea cargo under Labor was physically examined. Less than one in 100 items of sea cargo were actually examined. So if you are a criminal, you are think, 'Gee, can we get some illegal goods into this country?' They have probably got a 99 per cent chance that no-one is going to look. Physical examinations were 0.5 per cent. About 3½ per cent were inspected in some way. But physical examinations were of one in 200 items of sea cargo by the end of Labor's term in office. That is really just absolutely appalling. They were going to create a department of homeland security. It was all very grand. It did not happen. It was quietly dumped a little bit after the election. They promised a coast guard. Again, it was a nice announcement prior to the 2007 election, but it did not happen.


There is just a record of abject failure. The failures in relation to physical cargo were more than matched by the failures of the previous government in relation to border security more generally. We know the numbers. More than 50,000 illegal arrivals happened under the previous Labor party's watch. There was a cavalcade of ministers going through the revolving door there. You had the member for Watson, who had a go; the member for McMahon and the member for Gorton—various others were tried out. It was just a colossal failure. It was at a budget cost of about $11.6 billion.


The ABS says that there is about nine million households in Australia. A $11.6 billion blow-out works out at about $1,300 for every household in Australia. That was the cost of that border protection failure under Labor. The option for the previous government was, if it was to have taken a truthful approach to the 2007 campaign, it could have said, 'All right, here are your options. We will just leave things as they are—that was working very successfully under Prime Minister Howard, the member for Berowra and others—or you can adopt a radically different approach under us, which will lead to 50,000 illegal arrivals and a cost to the average household of about $1,300.'


That is important, because imagine what the average household could do with $1,300 if there were provided with tax relief. That would be if there was competence at our borders. If there was competence at our borders, there would not have been the $11 billion budget blow-out. If there was not the $11 billion budget blow-out, there would not have been an impact of about $1,300 per household. But, unfortunately, all of that did happen and the cost was $1,300 per household. We know that ,despite the extraordinarily sanctimonious arguments we hear from those opposite, the human cost of their policies on the border were appalling. I will leave that at that.


The bill that we discussed today has a number of important provisions. It is good to see the Minister for Immigration here as we discuss these matters. There are important provisions under the Customs Amendment Bill. One of the anomalies in the existing law is that domestic travellers on a domestic leg of an international flight are not subject to inspection. That is not logical. We should fix that and that is what this bill does. If you are on a domestic leg of an international flight, Customs will now have the power to inspect that cargo. That is entirely appropriate, because there is obviously an intermingling of domestic and international passengers in those situations and an intermingling of domestic and international cargo. We need to be able to put a stop to any use of domestic flights to bring illegal substances into the country.


Another important provision in the bill is this change to allow Customs to inspect goods at what are known as non-proclaimed places. Non-proclaimed places is essentially a fancy term that basically means a place that is not on the list of usual ports of embarkation. It is your airports, your major ports and so on. Sometimes, companies seek to bringing goods at other locations—sometimes cruise liners, sometimes in the resources industry and so on. Unfortunately, under the current act, Customs does not have the power to inspect goods in those non-proclaimed places. This bill will make that change and enable Customs to go to those non-proclaimed places and conduct inspections as appropriate. This is particularly important because if you were trying to get illegal goods into the country, you may well go to a non-proclaimed place. By extending the power of Customs to those non-proclaimed places we extend its reach, and that is absolutely appropriate.


We will also have simpler rules about the transferring of goods between different vessels, and so on, at the borders. Obviously, the point of transfer between different transport means is a point of vulnerability in the system, and it is important that there is a good system of permissions for those transfers, which all occur under the watchful eye of Customs, and that nothing is lost in the process. We also want to introduce some additional flexibility into the reporting of goods that are to come in to the country to give Customs greater visibility of what shipping companies and others are planning, and therefore ensuring that the right Customs resources are there when the goods arrive. These are great changes that move away from the era of appalling management of this space, which we saw under Labor. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:39):  by leave—I wish to make a brief announcement in relation to the government's handling of matters in the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio relating to Ebola. Processing of visas will recommence for residents of the Democratic Republic of Congo after the World Health Organisation declared the west African nation Ebola free. Last month, the government announced stronger border control measures, temporarily suspending processing of all visa applications for applicants from Ebola virus disease affected countries. 


It is pleasing that the outbreak has ended in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the World Health Organisation, this outbreak resulted in a total of 66 cases, including eight health workers. This decision by the WHO will allow the over 200 visa applications, which have been paused, to be processed by my department. The government's strict health screening requirements for other Ebola affected countries in Africa remain in place. Australians travelling home are urged to alert our border officers if they have been in any of the Ebola affected countries in Africa up to 21 days prior to their arrival, and provide details of their travel history as requested. 


The government recently rolled out a new travel history card to facilitate this, and this information at the border will assist other agencies, including the Department of Health, to ensure that Australia remains Ebola free. These arrangements may inconvenience some travellers; however, the safety of the Australian community is paramount, and it is critical that Australia is not exposed to this disease. The government remains committed to protecting Australians and ensuring our border measures remain strong. I thank the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:40):  I would like to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 2014. This bill builds on the good work already undertaken by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Scott Morrison, in this portfolio area. It is another example of how the coalition government is maintaining a steady hand on the reins of government and focusing on getting the job done.


While the amendments in this bill are mostly minor, they seek to update what is essentially a Federation era act to ensure that the guardians of one of Australia's most important assets, its border, are legislatively equipped to best fulfil their duties. It begins to lay the very early groundwork for the merger of Customs and Immigration and the Australian Border Force subsequent to its establishment.


Specifically, this bill seeks to do six things. Firstly, it allows for class based authorisations to include offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. Secondly, it extends Customs controls to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. Thirdly, it will provide for greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia, and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. Fourthly, it seeks to improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. This legislation will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. Fifthly, it provides an extension of Custom's powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage. Sixthly, it provides an enhancement of the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited goods.


This is a sensitive bill that fixes up a bit more of Labor's mess from their time in government. In this case, it involves border protection as it relates to Customs. Before I proceed, I would like to use this opportunity to remind the House that the previous Labor government's border protection failure was not limited to their incompetence when it came to the illegal boat arrivals. As the member for Banks told us, that was some 50,000 people and cost this country $11 billion. Can you imagine what $11 billion would have done to enhance customs and border protection? The opposition would not have had to make the cuts that they enacted while they were in government for six years. That $11 billion could have added to the protection and scrutiny of our borders and those coming across our borders. 


If Labor had remained in government over $734.8 million—or close to three quarters of a billion dollars—would have been cut from the Customs budget over the forward estimates. That is their own figures. These cuts would have followed the 700 job losses that had occurred in Customs under Labor. In other words, they had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce. And they want to talk about efficiency dividends in the ABC! They had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, and a $58.1 million cut in the 2009-10 budget for the Customs cargo-screening program. These cuts resulted in the reduction of 25 per cent in sea cargo inspection and a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, despite an increase in imports 


As the previous speaker told us, it went from 60 per cent of air cargo inspections during the Howard government era to five per cent under Labor, because of the cuts. They pulled the budget on them so they could not do the job. Sea cargo inspections went from 40 per cent to 3½ per cent. The $11 billion that was squandered on changing a program that had fixed our borders to finding a solution to unfix them could have been used to fund proper scrutiny of our borders. As I said, the inspection of sea containers is one of the most disgraceful things. 


We know that as a maritime country, Australia relies on exports and imports into the country by sea and by air, but the number of physical inspections of the massive containers that come through our ports got down to 3½ per cent and less. We heard that a half per cent of them were physically inspected. If you want to be a crim and bring stuff into this country, the best way is to play 'container lotto', and make sure that you bring it in by container, because you know that your chances of being caught are pretty remote. 


We also know that over $44 million was cut from Australia's international passenger facilitation program. This has continued to put our Customs officers under the pump in intercepting contraband and prohibited items, simply because they have had their funding pulled. To call what Labor did to Australia's border services a failure is probably being generous, because in actual fact Labor's attitude towards Customs was the same blase attitude that it took towards Defence and national security; it was itself a form of negligence. That attitude, as we know, came right from the top—remember: Rudd-Gillard-Rudd. On 24 January last year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that the 9/11 decade was over. David Wroe of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote:


Ms Gillard said the behaviour of countries would once again dominate Australia's national security thinking, ending an era in which ''non-state actors'', such as terrorist groups, posed the greatest risk.


What a way to base your international policy on the assumptions about what is a happening overseas rather than making sure you actually do the job properly here. 


It is 18 months later, and the greatest risk to Australia right now is radicalised extremists returning to Australia and to the South-East Asian region, spreading their hate and seeking to harm Australia, its citizens and their interests. An article in the Australian published on 21 of August by Peter Alford quotes Indonesia saying that officially there are 50 Indonesians fighting in Iraq and Syria and at risk of return. However, the article points out that some security experts place that number at 500—10 times the official figure. There has been a good working relationship between our countries, and I have the greatest confidence in the ability of both Indonesia and Malaysia to counter such threats. In a world so uncertain, Australia cannot afford to be found sleeping at the wheel—and that is what we were doing under the previous government. 


I have told you where the problem was; now I am going to tell you what we are doing about it. Since coming to government, the coalition has turned around the fiscal position of Customs and Border Protection. As previously stated, on 1 July 2015, the Australian Border Force will be established as part of the amalgamation of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Not only will this amalgamation see costs relating to the duplication of back-of-house operations reduced; it will also allow the department and specifically the ABF to focus their resources on front-line operations, protecting Australians and keeping our borders secure. The coalition government will be delivering a $480 million package, which will include $98 million for enforcement operations and supplement the acquisition of six additional patrol vessels to the tune of $249.6 million, to support the National Border Targeting Centre to develop and advance its intelligence capability and systems; over $70 million to establish a Trusted Trader framework to reward those individuals who do the right thing and allow the ADF to focus their resources on high-risk areas; and a $53.6 million allowance for the consolidation of workforce and the establishment of an ABF college. 


While we are on that, one of the ways that Customs does its job is by profiling. If you are a passenger coming through the airport—and we have all done this—you wonder why they stand there and look at you and say, 'You go that way and you go this way. You go and get your bag searched. You keep going through.' It is because nine times out of 10 they have done a profile on you before you have even got there. If you have come from a country where there is a high risk of people wanting to do nefarious things, it is a good chance that you will go to the bag search area. If you have got a clean criminal record in Australia and you have not been involved in drugs or any bad behaviour, they will probably send you along with the majority of people—straight out the front. This profiling was reduced. As we said, the intelligence capability of the systems were reduced by Labor cuts, but we are putting money back into it. We are taking the threats to border security seriously, and the investment this government is making, combined with the measures that we are taking to strengthen our legislative instruments, as in this amendment, are crucial to keeping our borders safe. I could go through other issues, but, as the other speakers have done that rather well, I will not take the time of the House to do so. 


However, I want to conclude by saying a few things. The amendments contained within this bill seek to bring about a common sense approach to the problems that the Australian Customs and Border Protection Services faces on an almost daily basis. This is another example of how the coalition is keeping a tight grip on the reins of government and, in this particular case, getting on with the job of making our borders secure, not just from illegal entrants but, as I said, at ports and airports and in a whole range of others areas where people wish to enter Australia illegally. We have not even mentioned the fact that, if people want to misbehave and do something illegal, they do not necessarily come through the front door of an airport. They might find some remote airstrip somewhere in the Northern Territory or elsewhere. We have also seen people arriving at desolate and isolated spots on our coast, which also need border protection. We know customs has planes to do this; we know that customs is even interested in heading towards the use of drones to do this—because that is the modern way of surveillance. 


We have stopped the boats; we are shutting down the detention centres; we are going to save those billions of dollars a year. We have not heard the latest figure, but I do know that so far there has only been one boat that is reached Australia in the last 12 months—compared to 350 or thereabouts in the same period of time. That is, one boat compared to so many boats and 20,000 people in the community who Labor is still trying to stop us from processing, and that is still costing us money though it is costing us a darn sight less than when Labor was in charge of the Treasury benches. We have stopped deaths at sea and we are taking children out of the detention centres. It really makes you grimace when you hear our critics talking about children in detention—we are taking them out; we are educating them; we are paying for them to go to school in detention centres, unlike the previous government. We are doing something to fix up the mess we inherited. We are doing what we said we would do and we are delivering on what we said we would do. 


I recall vividly before the last federal election, as I went around my electorate doorknocking, people said to me: 'You can't stop them—the gate's open—there's no way in the world that you guys will be able to stop them.'




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Were you out doorknocking? I don't believe it. I want the photo!




Mr RANDALL:
  Let me say to the member for Hunter that if you ever want to come doorknocking with me, see if you can keep up. I don't think you would have the stamina. The last door you would have knocked on would have been the front door of your local pub. Don't tell me about doorknocking—I am the doorknocking king from Western Australia. You need to understand that. We understand border protection policies and I say that these amendments will enhance what we are able to do on a whole range of issues. I commend this bill to the House.

"Goodenough, Ian, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:54):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is designed to build on the government's legislative agenda of border protection by strengthening the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. This will serve to prevent the entry of prohibited items and illicit goods into our country and clamp down on the avoidance of import duties on dutiable items. 


The challenges faced by our customs and border protection agency is compounded by the vastness of the Australian continent, which covers an area of more than 7.6 million square kilometres with a total coastline length of 35,876 kilometres and an additional 23,859 kilometres of island coastlines and some 758 remote estuaries around the country at which vessels may land. Australia's extensive exclusive economic zone covers 8.1 million square kilometres. We have a sparsely populated continent with a significant number of remote towns, where only basic port and airport facilities exist, without the advanced security found in capital cities. It is in this context that the task of monitoring our borders and controlling the international flow of passengers and goods represents a massive undertaking for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.


By improving our border protection capabilities to intercept contraband and the smuggling of illegal cargo—such as drugs, weapons, and materials subject to quarantine—we will be able to combat transnational crime, preserve the biosecurity of our agricultural industry and promote greater national security. This bill seeks to make a number of relatively minor technical amendments to the Customs Act of 1901, which will serve to close a number of loopholes that could potentially allow illicit cargo and prohibited items to go undetected or be transferred from vessels and aircraft within Australian jurisdictions.


The anticipated future increase in the flow of passengers and goods across international borders is brought about by the emerging economies in our region with increased international trade facilitated by free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China. Trade is projected to increase further as a free trade agreement is expected to be reached with India and as Australia develops stronger economic partnerships with the 10 member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and beyond. Our customs service must be adequately prepared and resourced to cope with the increased demands encountered at all entry points to Australia.


Perhaps the most significant of the proposed amendments are designed to allow customs officers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights. Currently, under section 30 of the act, customs control does not extend to domestic goods, which include domestic cargo or personal effects of domestic travellers once they are loaded onto or unloaded from international ships and aircraft. Section 186 of the act does not adequately provide for the examination of domestic goods on domestic legs of international flights and voyages. In practice, domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the customs controlled areas of ports and airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded or unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg without any authority or permission under the act. The bill seeks to correct this anomaly by granting customs officers the necessary powers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights.


Another key aspect of the bill proposes that customs control be extended to goods on board a ship which docks or an aircraft which lands at any place in Australia that is not a designated port or airport 


Currently, the act does not extend Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or an aircraft at a place other than a designated port or airport in Australia. From time to time it may be necessary for vessels or aircraft to dock or land at places on the Australian mainland due to adverse weather conditions or other reasonable causes under section 58(1) of the act, or if the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a collector to bring the ship or aircraft to land under section 58(2) of the act.


For instance, the cruise ship industry regularly seeks permission to visit non-proclaimed areas of the Australian coastline, and the stopover may involve disembarking travellers or unloading goods in these locations where government agencies do not have a presence. Goods on board a ship or aircraft in these circumstances are not currently subject to Customs control and cannot, therefore, be examined by an officer of Customs under section 186. To ensure that border risks and intervention activities can be managed appropriately, it is proposed that Customs control be extended to goods on board a ship or aircraft at the place to which the ship or aircraft has been brought under the circumstances covered in sections 58(1) or 58(2) of the act. Item 5 repeals and substitutes section 31 of the act to ensure that all goods on board a ship or aircraft from a place outside Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within Australia.


 The bill also contains amendments which add legal certainty to the circumstances in which the Chief Executive Officer of Customs can authorise persons to carry out functions under the act. Currently, the CEO of Customs can authorise an individual by name or position, or a class of offices or positions, to be authorised officers for the purposes of carrying out functions under particular provisions in the act. Unlike delegations, the law remains ambiguous as to whether an authorisation will apply to future offices or positions created within an authorised class that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendment proposes to amend the definition of 'authorised officer' in the act so that authorisations can apply to future offices or positions created. This will preclude the need to update authorisation instruments on a regular basis to ensure that new offices are covered.


In addition, the bill will improve and make consistent with other parts of the Customs Act the application process for permission to load and unload a ship's and an aircrafts' stores, and for the transfer of goods between certain vessels. The proposed amendments are designed to standardise the application processes in the act by requiring applications for certificates of clearance to be in an approved form. This supports the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service's initiatives to streamline processes and eventually allow applicants to apply for clearance certificates online.


The bill will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These changes will allow earlier assessment and the planning of resources required if the stores or prohibited goods reported present risks, including the management of firearms, weapons, and narcotics. The bill will also correct a technical error in relation to the interaction of Custom and Border Protection's Infringement Notice Scheme and claims process for seized goods under the Customs Act.


In summary, the measures contained in the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 are designed to incrementally improve the security of our national borders by addressing anomalies in the current system. By giving the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service the necessary powers to examine domestic goods en route to and from international destinations in the circumstances outlined, and at places within Australia other than at ports and airports where foreign vessels or aircraft land, the government can intercept prohibited items, illicit goods, and dutiable items, preventing them from crossing our borders. The bill also ensures that the legislation is brought up to date with current Customs practice, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:05):  In relation to the Customs Amendment Bill 2014, I want to tell the story of what is happening in Townsville at the moment. Townsville has a limited international airport. We want to start new international flights to another destination—say, Bali. To do that, we have to get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville. On a discount-airline basis, it is a very competitive trade. But if we have to fly in these people and all these things, then all the extra costs in this space mean that we are no longer competitive. We previously had that flight when Strategic Airlines did it. To get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville it ended up costing us more on the ground that it did in the air. So it was no longer competitive to come through Townsville to go to Bali. So when we did that, no-one used it and the thing shut down. What we need in Townsville—and this plays into the development of Northern Australia as well—is assistance to get customs, immigration and quarantine services up and running and to get them underway.


Minister Scott Morrison and his office have been fantastic to me and to Townsville airport in relation to our discussions in the space. But at every turn I have come up against the problem with the massive cost overruns we have had over the last six years. Our border protection policies, all that sort of stuff, has been in so much strife—$11 billion. No matter what the cost, we have got a real issue when it comes to being able to provide new services.


I see the member for Solomon in here. The member for Solomon is a valued member of the development of Northern Australia white paper committee. She has been around the north of Australia. She has been to my city of Townsville and she knows what a great place it is, as I know that Darwin is a great place. What the member for Solomon and I are all about is growing the north, growing opportunity.


But at every level government must balance its budget, and must live within its means. What we have to do is to try to figure out how we are going to get this service up and running when you have to fly in staff and it has to be on a cost recovery basis. So when it gets to trying to get customs, immigration and quarantine services, we are starting from so far behind the starting line that we cannot catch up.


Deputy Speaker Kelly, I heard you in Federation Chamber this morning talking about business. You spoke about going overseas and getting things done and all sorts of stuff about running a business. Up until 2007, Australia, as a business, ran with a great return to the company. We were reinvesting in the company of Australia, of Team Australia. We were getting all our stuff rolled out. We had money in the bank. We were investing for the future. We were able to afford anything. If anything happened, we were able to do that. The GFC hit, and no-one is denying that the GFC caused a lot of pain. I see the communications minister down there sitting at the table. He was the leader of the opposition at the time and he backed the first round of stimulus, as was right. He was also right when he walked away from the second round of stimulus and said that they were going too hard. And they just ran up so much debt. The member for Wentworth, now communications minister, was also right when he said we are losing control of what we are trying to do here. There was too much money going out and there was too much debt. Once you lose control of your cash flow, once your cash flow is going into paying interest instead of paying for other products or paying for upgraded plant and equipment in your business, you lose control of your business.


I am an auctioneer by trade, and my area of specialisation was in insolvency. I would go into businesses and shut them down, sell off of the plant and equipment, and move on. Just about every insolvency was around cash. If you lose control of your cash flow, you lose control of your business, if your debts are ratcheted up too high. I worked through the Keating recession of the early 1990s, when interest rates were in their 20s, and what really knocked a lot of businesses around was that so much of their working capital went into the business of paying off debt. And that is where we are at the moment.


So when it comes to the customs, immigration and quarantine services, the Customs Amendment Bill does a whole heap of things. It amends the Customs Act 1901. It is about making sure that we balance our books. It is about making sure that we are living inside our means. It is about making sure that we do have that base from which we can grow. If I had had this opportunity in 2007, it would have been a no-brainer. If I had had the opportunity in 2007 to put an international airport into Townsville or start international flights through Townsville—because we are a limited international airport at the moment—it would have been a no-brainer. We would have done it. Because we had the cash there to say 'Okay, that sounds like a great idea, we will do that.' But now, because of the way things are, money is very tight. So to get $2 million or whatever we need to get started is very hard.


All the way through, no matter what bill we are talking about—and this is the Customs Amendment Bill 2014—it all comes back to the economy. It all comes back to being able to afford what you want to do. If you have cash in the bank you can do anything you want.


I remember that great Australian story on the ABC on Kerry Packer about his kidney transplant. The great line that he said was: 'The beauty about having cash is you can go anywhere you want. I could have this operation in New York, or Geneva or wherever.' He said that the best bloke to do it was in Sydney. But he said that if you have the cash you make the decisions. If you lose control of your cash, you are not making your own decisions. You are playing catch-up and you are trying to do things you are not supposed to be doing.


When I speak about this bill, I speak about living within my means. I speak about making sure that we do live within our means and making sure that everything is affordable.


If I can just quickly touch on the ABC cuts in relation to this customs bill, because it all comes back to what you do with your cash. When you make your decisions, when you make your statements, you make it with the information you have at hand at the time. Six months down the track, or 15 months down the track, circumstances are vastly different and so your decisions have to be very different. And that is as it goes with the Customs Amendment Bill. It all comes down to making sure that we live within our means. It all comes down to making sure that we do the right thing by the economy. We can do what we want if we do that, if we get in touch with our base and build our base.


I remember reading just recently the valedictory speech of the great Labor finance minister Peter Walsh. He left the Senate in 1993. He bemoaned the fact that he did not think we would ever pay back the debt Labor had run up at that time. He did not think we would ever pay it back. The quote I love is where he said that the first thing you lose is your economic sovereignty, and then you lose your political sovereignty. As in business, you end up with administrators and liquidators moving in. As a country, you end up having to make decisions that no one is happy about. I support the bill and I thank the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2014-11-26,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:15):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 makes a number of small amendments to the Customs Act. The amendments are mostly technical—they are not controversial. They aim to improve and strengthen the act that outlines our customs framework. Minister Morrison has proven to be one of the most effective ministers in the Abbott government. He certainly has been one of the most effective immigration and border protection ministers that this country has ever seen. It is through his strong leadership and dedication that the Abbott government has been able to stop the flow of illegal maritime arrivals into Australia. As promised before the last election, we have all but stopped the boats. We are now working on the massive backlog of asylum seekers that the previous Labor government simply stopped processing. It thought that by some magical intervention some solution would appear and fix the mess they had got themselves into. We know what that solution is—it is the Abbott government. Once again we have to fix the mess that the Labor Party left us. We are about getting Australia back on track and providing some certainty especially to those people who were seeking asylum under Labor. Those people were left with no answers and no idea about when their applications for asylum would be processed. Minister Morrison has also proven to be an excellent advocate for Australian customs issues. He is methodically and logically working through bits of the customs legislation and ironing out some of the creases, once again to get things back on track.


My electorate of Solomon covers the cities of Darwin and Palmerston, and we are quite often the front line for on-water Customs operations as well as Customs operations through the Darwin International Airport. Mr Morrison recognises that there is some important work carried out in the Top End and that is why he has visited many times, both before the election and certainly after the election. He has met personally with Customs and Border Protection personnel, and he always seeks their feedback on what is working and what is not working. Minister Morrison recognises that they are the subject matter experts—they are on the front line, they have a wealth of knowledge and they know what is needed to protect our borders from particularly unwanted goods.


The bill contains various amendments to the Customs Act. More broadly, those changes are about improving the administration of the appointment of authorised officers. The allowance of class-based authorisations will include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The bill is about extending Customs controls to those places where ships and aircraft arrive in Australia that are not proclaimed ports or airports and where agencies do not necessarily have a strong presence. It is about providing greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. It is also about improving application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. The bill is also about extending Customs powers in relation to the examination of baggage for domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and of domestic cargo that is carried on international flights and voyages, even though these travels may not be on an international leg. The bill also corrects a technical error, resulting in the enhancement of the interaction of the Infringement Notice Scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports. These amendments aim to improve the practicalities of protecting our borders from unauthorised entries and undesirable goods entering Australia.


My electorate, covering the areas of Darwin and Palmerston, faces a number of different customs threats. For example, every fishing season there are scores of illegal fishing vessels intercepted off the Top End. Illegal fishing poses a real threat to Australian fish stocks and the Australian economy. The waters off Darwin are a pristine marine environment that we regulate to avoid overfishing and pollution causing damage to our marine life. Illegal fishing activity directly undermines the Australian government's hard work and integrity measures put in place to ensure that we fish sustainably and harvest seafood in a way that enables future generations to access the wonderful range of foods we are so fortunate to have in our oceans.


Customs and Border Protection are committed to protecting Australian borders on the high seas and are particularly effective in intercepting illegal entries, considering our unfathomably large borders. Just yesterday Border Protection Command and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority intercepted two foreign fishing vessels just 170 nautical miles off Darwin The vessels had on board 14 crew, 45 kilograms of dried fish, 10 kilograms of fresh fish, six live fish and some fishing and diving equipment, all of which, thankfully, has been seized. They were intercepted by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service vessel Dame Roma Mitchell. The two boats have been apprehended on suspicion of illegal fishing activity in Australian waters.


In May this year HMAS Glenelg intercepted a foreign fishing vessel off the coast of Darwin. This boat was also suspected of illegal fishing activity in the Australian Fishing Zone. Border Protection Command personnel found almost 50 kilos of Spanish mackerel, 20 kilos of tuna, 20 kilos of dolphinfish and 10 kilos of barracuda on this vessel.


Illegal fishing poses a threat to my electorate, because one in three households in my electorate has a boat. We have a lot of keen fishermen in my electorate. But it is not only the recreational fishers that are impacted by illegal fishing; it is also the small businesses. Many local businesses rely on the regulation of commercial fishing in our region. These large amounts of seafood being taken illegally from our waters mean more work with fewer positive outcomes for our local businesses.


Back in April, the Australian Customs vessel Cape St George intercepted two foreign fishing vessels, also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone, after detection by an Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Dash 8 surveillance aircraft. On Monday, 28 April, Border Protection Command personnel boarded these vessels approximately 167 nautical miles north-north-west of Darwin. The vessels had around 190 kilograms of wet trepang—that is a lot of sea cucumber. They also had some diving equipment on this boat. Customs personnel also saw people on a second boat throwing items overboard, and they were also found to have various fishing equipment and bags of salt, all indicating that there was illegal fishing activity occurring.


Also in April, HMAS Launceston intercepted a foreign fishing vessel approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin, which was also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone. It was found to have approximately 20 kilos of salted trepang, five reef fish and five kilos of dried fish, along with hookah and some diving gear.


Also in April, a foreign fishing vessel was detected approximately 275 nautical miles west of Darwin by, once again, an Australian Customs Dash 8 surveillance aircraft and was intercepted by the Australian Customs vessel Botany Bay. The vessel had fishing lines deployed and over 500 kilograms of fish on board. That is just outrageous.


In March this year, four foreign fishing vessels with a total of 58 crew were apprehended approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin. The wooden vessels were intercepted on Wednesday, 12 March and Thursday, 13 March by HMAS ships Launceston and Glenelg. Over 60 giant clams were found on board the vessels, as well as large quantities in their holds. Personnel also found a large quantity of sea cucumber and another large number of assorted fish. 


I would like to put on record the outstanding work that our Customs and Border Protection people do. I think the examples I have just given highlight the success that they have been able to achieve.


Another pressing issue in my electorate is the running of drugs in and out of our international airport and also our domestic airfields to remote communities around the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Police do an amazing job of monitoring this dangerous trade. The knowledge and expertise of our Australian Customs is invaluable in sharing information and skills. 


As drug runners use more creative ways to evade authorities, Customs must be appropriately equipped to deal with these constantly changing tactics. The coalition is ensuring that Customs and Border Protection agencies are well funded and properly resourced, so they can continue to protect not only my constituents but also the rest of the Australian communities from drugs, crime and disadvantage associated with drug use.


Customs officers working in my electorate in monitoring or looking after Darwin International Airport do an incredible job combating drug trafficking. The Top End is often referred to as Australia's gateway to Asia. This is because there are eight capital cities and 69 international airports within a four-hour flight north of Darwin. This means Customs officers have a huge responsibility in protecting Australia's borders at Darwin International Airport. We have many international flights in and out of Darwin. We need to do all we can to support these hard workers, who are often the front line of defence from external threats coming through our airports. 


It is obvious that customs officers in my electorate are doing a fantastic job by the large drug busts that they have made this year alone, which I will relay to you. An investigation beginning in July resulted in one arrest and the seizure of 1.6 kilos of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in Darwin last month. Thank God those drugs are no longer available in the community. 


The joint agency operation targeting air cargo began when Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers in Darwin identified multiple consignments of suspicious packaging originating from Bangkok. In September Customs personnel apprehended a 42-year-old UK national and a 56-year-old Australian national, who have now appeared in Darwin court charged with the attempted smuggling of two kilos of ephedrine into Australia. In July, a Victorian man arrived on a flight from Malaysia and he was found to have a laser pointer, a knuckle duster, 30 electric shock devices disguised as torches, a spring-loaded knife, 700 steroid tablets and 1,400 tablets containing Viagra. Thankfully they are also not available in our community anymore. You can tell that the operation does fantastic work in my electorate. As the member for Solomon, I recognise the important role Customs officers play and I am united with the minister in wanting to ensure our Customs and Border Protection agencies are properly resourced. I commend this bill to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:30):  The member for Solomon, in her contribution today, demonstrated very clearly why the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is important and also the challenges being faced by this wonderful island nation, with its extensive coastline. I also want to commend her for her complimentary remarks in relation to the Australian Customs and Border Protection officers and their work. From Darwin and into your area they do an amazing job—and I did meet some of them when I was there previously. They have a huge task, and clearly they are very effective. And they have someone strong to represent their issues here in the parliament, so well done, Member for Solomon. There are many challenges, as we heard from the member for Solomon, with illegal fishing and drugs. When I was listening to the member for Solomon, one of the issues that hit me, as a farmer, was how difficult it is to protect our biosecurity in this country, with so much coastline and so many people, for different reasons, wanting to land here in Australia. With wooden-hulled boats come a whole lot of risks and challenges, so the work done by our Customs and Border Protection officers is certainly significant.


The measures within this bill are technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901, and they will assist our Customs officers in the job that they do. These amendments will allow class based authorisations to include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given; extend Customs control to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act; provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These are just practical measures.


The bill will also improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. That is of course a time-saving, very practical way of managing this. The bill will also extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage, and enhance the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports.


A reference to 'Customs' in the explanatory memorandum simply means the agency continued in existence under subsection 4(1) of the Customs Administration Act 1985—that is, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The explanatory memorandum says:


Section 31 of the Act provides that all goods on board any ship or aircraft from a place outside Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within the limits of any port or airport in Australia. Under section 186 of the Act, all goods that are subject to Customs control may be examined by an officer of Customs.


Currently the Act does not extend Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or aircraft at a place other than a port or airport in Australia to which:


(a) a ship or aircraft has been brought because of stress of weather or other reasonable cause …; or


(b) the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a Collector to bring the ship or aircraft under subsection 58(2) of the Act.


As a result, goods on board a ship or aircraft in these circumstances are not currently subject to Customs control and cannot, therefore, be examined by an officer of Customs under section 186.


Goods on board a ship or aircraft brought to a place other than a port or airport in Australia pose the same border risks as goods on board a ship or aircraft within the limits of any port or airport in Australia.


To ensure that border risks and intervention activities can be managed appropriately, it is proposed that Customs control be extended to goods on board a ship or aircraft at a place to which a ship or aircraft has been brought under subsections 58(1) or 58(2) of the Act.


The explanatory memorandum also says:


Domestic cargo, and domestic travellers and their personal effects, are carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports other than proclaimed ports or airports by approved ships or aircraft. Domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the Customs controlled areas of ports or airports and mix with international travellers—


you see them wandering around—


… during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage.


Domestic cargo can currently be loaded and unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg of an international voyage or flight without any authority or permission under the Act.


The explanatory memorandum also says:


The mixing of domestic goods and imported goods or goods for export presents risks for diversion of goods from one stream to the other, especially if goods are of a kind that if imported or exported would be prohibited or subject to border related duties and taxes.


It is therefore proposed that the Act be amended to provide that domestic goods (which may be either domestic cargo carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages or personal effects of domestic travellers …) can be examined by an officer of Customs.


The new subsections 186AA(1) and (2) provide for examination powers in relation to domestic goods. That is what these specific technical amendments are for.


The safety and security of the Australian people and those who are visiting our country are a priority for this government. We have heard repeatedly about some of the measures we have taken in our strong response to a range of threats, be it ISIL or other terrorist threats in Australia or overseas. We have seen close corporation to combat transnational crime with international allies and neighbouring countries. We have seen an investment of $630 million in Australian security and law enforcement agencies for counterterrorism measures. We as a government take these responsibilities seriously.


I see that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the member for Cook, is sitting in the chamber. I commend him for his outstanding effort in his quest to control Australia's border and his commitment to stopping the boats. I think everybody, no matter where they are in the world, has a very clear message about the minister's intent and his commitment to this task. This bill furthers his efforts to make sure that Australians are secure and safe in every way that the Australian government can contribute to that. The Australian has made a contribution of $400,000 to support INTERPOL's foreign fighters initiatives, over and above our ongoing annual membership contributions. The global and interconnected world that we live in basically also creates a borderless ongoing criminal threat. I see that the minister is constantly aware and working on the constantly changing threat that we in this nation face as a result of the fact that we are in a global environment and one of transnational crime. Customs and justice are a key part of that. This government takes very seriously both of those roles. We have seen that through the member for Cook and his very dedicated approach to this.


The government has also invested $20 million to boost AUSTRAC's ability to stop cash being funnelled to terrorists and to crack down on money laundering by organised crime that funds the trade in drugs such as crystal meth and others. We heard from the member for Solomon some of the extraordinary amounts in value and weight of drugs that the Customs service is intercepting not just here but around the world. I notice that the AFP intercepted 81 credit card knives, as they are called, at airports around Australia. I hope some of the measures contained in this bill will assist with this. The knives were detected through airport screening. They are dangerous weapons. They are illegal and are banned from being taken on domestic and international flights. Of course, buying these knives is illegal, but I note through the work that I do in the online space that most of these are bought online. All jurisdictions have offences relating to the sale of a knife that is manufactured to disguise or conceal the blade or to give the impression that it is an innocuous item such as a plastic card of similar dimensions to a credit card. I am very pleased that the government has sourced and resourced additional Australian Federal Police offices at our airports. We also have an AFP counterterrorism officer in Turkey cooperating on global issues and concerns about terrorism and transnational crime. The AFP's international network includes 99 positions across 29 partner countries overseas as well as in Australia.


The recent passage of the crimes legislation dealing with psychoactive substances is also part of our very direct focus on all forms of the safety and security of Australians. We have a very clear duty to protect the safety and security of Australian citizens here and wherever else we can. That has been a commitment by the minister. I think all of us took and are taking very seriously the issues surrounding the disappearance of MH370. They are very real in Western Australia, from where the recovery effort is being managed out of RAAF Base Pearce and other parts of Western Australia.


We are aware that terrorists are constantly changing what they do and how they do it. They are increasingly sophisticated. They are constantly evolving what they do and how they do it. Our customs and border protection agencies need to be able to constantly change what they to, to adapt what they do. We need to give them the tools through these sorts of technical amendments to be able to do the job that we employ them to do. They take very seriously the job we give them.


Returning to biosecurity, we have seen so much wonderful news about three very valuable free trade agreements—those with Japan, Korea and China—and we are working on another free trade agreement, with India, in the year ahead. We will see a lot of produce and goods in and out of Australia as a result of these agreements. Yes, Australia is open for business. That is very clearly demonstrated by this government. There will be increasing demands on Customs because of the trade of goods. The amendments in this bill will assist Customs in the job they have to do in this space. I have no doubt that these measures will assist the officers in the job that they do.


Finally, once again, I have great respect for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I commend him on the outstanding job that he has done on border protection. I know that this is probably not the last piece of legislation that he will bring before the House. His vigilance in his role is greatly appreciated not just by me as the member for Forrest. It is one of the matters that I receive a lot of feedback on in my electorate. It is good to know that we have such strong representation and an absolute commitment to the safety and security of Australia and its borders.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (17:44):  I want to thank members for their contributions to this debate, particularly the government members, who have been the major contributors to this debate. I want to thank the member for Forrest and my many other colleagues for their strong encouragement of the work that the government is doing not just in the area of customs but more broadly on the issues of border protection.


I also want to note that the opposition indicated their support for this bill in their response earlier today. This is a fairly significant moment. It is fairly common for the opposition to oppose us on border protection measures. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition must have been on autopilot because he did not even know he had voted against a bill here in this very place when the question was put to him about it today when he was speaking at the National Press Club. It is an oddity for the opposition to support this government on stronger border protection but, at least in this case, for what are fairly routine but nonetheless very important matters that are presented in this bill we welcome their support.


This bill is part of a much broader package of measures and initiatives that the government is bringing in on border protection, not just Operation Sovereign Borders and what is being done there to stop the boats so successfully and save lives as a result, to restore integrity to our immigration program and give Australians all over the country confidence in our immigration program. To see that confidence restored in the way our borders are being managed and the way our immigration program is being run in the surveys that have been most recently conducted by Professor Markus and the work of the Scanlon Foundation is very pleasing.


In border protection in particular we are working towards the start-up of the Australian Border Force on 1 July next year. That measure which will see both this year and over the out years the reinvestment of over $700 million back into our Customs and Border Protection Service and the Border Force reverses the cuts that were made to Customs and Border Protection by the previous government of the same amount over their time in government. So we have replaced what the previous government had removed when it comes to protecting our borders and ensuring not just the work of countering people smuggling but the very important work that is done in passage facilitation and goods facilitation.


The member for Forrest made a very good point—and that is that the tremendous work done by the Minister for Trade and Investment has opened up enormous opportunities for this country. That will see much trade now take place between Australia, Japan and Korea as well, of course, as with China. We look forward to arrangements with India and many more opportunities.


The truth of these things is that where those legitimate economic opportunities come, with the movement of both goods and people, the crooks use the same planes, the same internet and the same methods that legitimate traders do. That means that when we expand and open ourselves up, as we should, for greater economic opportunities we also then must redouble our efforts when it comes to ensuring that the crooks, gangs, thugs, people smugglers and traffickers are not able to exploit that increase in economic trade as an opportunity to ply their own nefarious activities and become rich as a result and compromise something that is very dear to this country, and that is the integrity of our borders. It is very much a matter of sovereignty.


These measures have also about bringing to the table quite straightforward, simple changes that will seek to tighten up the legislation even more and close off any loopholes and opportunities that we have identified such that those who might seek to compromise our borders will be frustrated in that purpose.


We have reversed those cuts. There was $88 million in addition to what I mentioned before, which was put in immediately upon coming to government. That has significantly increased our screening capacity. In the first quarter of this financial year, we saw a significant increase in the levels of detections as well as increased screening levels, particularly for sea cargo and air cargo. That is welcome.


There has also been a $150 million investment in our borders as part of the counter-terrorism package which I know many of the government speakers made reference to in their contributions to this debate. This is an omnibus bill that proposes some minor but important changes to the Customs Act of 1901. These changes will extend Customs control to places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. They will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. The reforms contained in this bill will improve the application processes for approvals to load, unload and use ships' and aircrafts' stores and permissions to transfer goods between certain vessels and applications for certificates of clearance. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these approvals, permissions and certificates.


Importantly, the reforms contained in this bill will extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage.  Domestic cargo and domestic travellers and their personal effects are carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports other than proclaimed ports or airports by approved ships or aircraft. Domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the Customs controlled areas of ports or airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded and unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg of an international voyage or flight without any authority or permission under the act. The mixing of domestic goods and imported goods or goods for export presents risks for diversion of goods from one stream to the other, especially if goods are of a kind that if imported or exported would be prohibited or subject to border related duties and taxes. The reforms in this legislation will expand the scope of Customs inspection powers to ensure that these vulnerabilities do not persist in the border management environment.


Further enhancements to the act contained in this bill include enhancements to the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports and provisions that permit class based authorisations to include future officers or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendments in this bill will enhance Customs controls and examination powers and improve Customs compliance and enforcement activities. These enhancements will modernise the environment within which the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and their successor, the Australian Border Force, operates and help ensure that our border management processes support the best possible systems to facilitate legitimate movement of people and goods and stop those who seek to conduct illicit and illegitimate activity on Australia's borders.


I thank the members for their contributions to this debate. The work of border protection is in the detail. It is about closing off every opportunity for those who would seek to compromise our borders. The package of measures in this bill is yet another step forward by the government to demonstrate our commitment to stronger borders in all areas. I commend the bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:40):  I would like to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 2014. This bill builds on the good work already undertaken by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Scott Morrison, in this portfolio area. It is another example of how the coalition government is maintaining a steady hand on the reins of government and focusing on getting the job done.


While the amendments in this bill are mostly minor, they seek to update what is essentially a Federation era act to ensure that the guardians of one of Australia's most important assets, its border, are legislatively equipped to best fulfil their duties. It begins to lay the very early groundwork for the merger of Customs and Immigration and the Australian Border Force subsequent to its establishment.


Specifically, this bill seeks to do six things. Firstly, it allows for class based authorisations to include offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. Secondly, it extends Customs controls to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. Thirdly, it will provide for greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia, and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. Fourthly, it seeks to improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. This legislation will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. Fifthly, it provides an extension of Custom's powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage. Sixthly, it provides an enhancement of the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited goods.


This is a sensitive bill that fixes up a bit more of Labor's mess from their time in government. In this case, it involves border protection as it relates to Customs. Before I proceed, I would like to use this opportunity to remind the House that the previous Labor government's border protection failure was not limited to their incompetence when it came to the illegal boat arrivals. As the member for Banks told us, that was some 50,000 people and cost this country $11 billion. Can you imagine what $11 billion would have done to enhance customs and border protection? The opposition would not have had to make the cuts that they enacted while they were in government for six years. That $11 billion could have added to the protection and scrutiny of our borders and those coming across our borders. 


If Labor had remained in government over $734.8 million—or close to three quarters of a billion dollars—would have been cut from the Customs budget over the forward estimates. That is their own figures. These cuts would have followed the 700 job losses that had occurred in Customs under Labor. In other words, they had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce. And they want to talk about efficiency dividends in the ABC! They had a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, and a $58.1 million cut in the 2009-10 budget for the Customs cargo-screening program. These cuts resulted in the reduction of 25 per cent in sea cargo inspection and a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo inspections, despite an increase in imports 


As the previous speaker told us, it went from 60 per cent of air cargo inspections during the Howard government era to five per cent under Labor, because of the cuts. They pulled the budget on them so they could not do the job. Sea cargo inspections went from 40 per cent to 3½ per cent. The $11 billion that was squandered on changing a program that had fixed our borders to finding a solution to unfix them could have been used to fund proper scrutiny of our borders. As I said, the inspection of sea containers is one of the most disgraceful things. 


We know that as a maritime country, Australia relies on exports and imports into the country by sea and by air, but the number of physical inspections of the massive containers that come through our ports got down to 3½ per cent and less. We heard that a half per cent of them were physically inspected. If you want to be a crim and bring stuff into this country, the best way is to play 'container lotto', and make sure that you bring it in by container, because you know that your chances of being caught are pretty remote. 


We also know that over $44 million was cut from Australia's international passenger facilitation program. This has continued to put our Customs officers under the pump in intercepting contraband and prohibited items, simply because they have had their funding pulled. To call what Labor did to Australia's border services a failure is probably being generous, because in actual fact Labor's attitude towards Customs was the same blase attitude that it took towards Defence and national security; it was itself a form of negligence. That attitude, as we know, came right from the top—remember: Rudd-Gillard-Rudd. On 24 January last year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that the 9/11 decade was over. David Wroe of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote:


Ms Gillard said the behaviour of countries would once again dominate Australia's national security thinking, ending an era in which ''non-state actors'', such as terrorist groups, posed the greatest risk.


What a way to base your international policy on the assumptions about what is a happening overseas rather than making sure you actually do the job properly here. 


It is 18 months later, and the greatest risk to Australia right now is radicalised extremists returning to Australia and to the South-East Asian region, spreading their hate and seeking to harm Australia, its citizens and their interests. An article in the Australian published on 21 of August by Peter Alford quotes Indonesia saying that officially there are 50 Indonesians fighting in Iraq and Syria and at risk of return. However, the article points out that some security experts place that number at 500—10 times the official figure. There has been a good working relationship between our countries, and I have the greatest confidence in the ability of both Indonesia and Malaysia to counter such threats. In a world so uncertain, Australia cannot afford to be found sleeping at the wheel—and that is what we were doing under the previous government. 


I have told you where the problem was; now I am going to tell you what we are doing about it. Since coming to government, the coalition has turned around the fiscal position of Customs and Border Protection. As previously stated, on 1 July 2015, the Australian Border Force will be established as part of the amalgamation of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Not only will this amalgamation see costs relating to the duplication of back-of-house operations reduced; it will also allow the department and specifically the ABF to focus their resources on front-line operations, protecting Australians and keeping our borders secure. The coalition government will be delivering a $480 million package, which will include $98 million for enforcement operations and supplement the acquisition of six additional patrol vessels to the tune of $249.6 million, to support the National Border Targeting Centre to develop and advance its intelligence capability and systems; over $70 million to establish a Trusted Trader framework to reward those individuals who do the right thing and allow the ADF to focus their resources on high-risk areas; and a $53.6 million allowance for the consolidation of workforce and the establishment of an ABF college. 


While we are on that, one of the ways that Customs does its job is by profiling. If you are a passenger coming through the airport—and we have all done this—you wonder why they stand there and look at you and say, 'You go that way and you go this way. You go and get your bag searched. You keep going through.' It is because nine times out of 10 they have done a profile on you before you have even got there. If you have come from a country where there is a high risk of people wanting to do nefarious things, it is a good chance that you will go to the bag search area. If you have got a clean criminal record in Australia and you have not been involved in drugs or any bad behaviour, they will probably send you along with the majority of people—straight out the front. This profiling was reduced. As we said, the intelligence capability of the systems were reduced by Labor cuts, but we are putting money back into it. We are taking the threats to border security seriously, and the investment this government is making, combined with the measures that we are taking to strengthen our legislative instruments, as in this amendment, are crucial to keeping our borders safe. I could go through other issues, but, as the other speakers have done that rather well, I will not take the time of the House to do so. 


However, I want to conclude by saying a few things. The amendments contained within this bill seek to bring about a common sense approach to the problems that the Australian Customs and Border Protection Services faces on an almost daily basis. This is another example of how the coalition is keeping a tight grip on the reins of government and, in this particular case, getting on with the job of making our borders secure, not just from illegal entrants but, as I said, at ports and airports and in a whole range of others areas where people wish to enter Australia illegally. We have not even mentioned the fact that, if people want to misbehave and do something illegal, they do not necessarily come through the front door of an airport. They might find some remote airstrip somewhere in the Northern Territory or elsewhere. We have also seen people arriving at desolate and isolated spots on our coast, which also need border protection. We know customs has planes to do this; we know that customs is even interested in heading towards the use of drones to do this—because that is the modern way of surveillance. 


We have stopped the boats; we are shutting down the detention centres; we are going to save those billions of dollars a year. We have not heard the latest figure, but I do know that so far there has only been one boat that is reached Australia in the last 12 months—compared to 350 or thereabouts in the same period of time. That is, one boat compared to so many boats and 20,000 people in the community who Labor is still trying to stop us from processing, and that is still costing us money though it is costing us a darn sight less than when Labor was in charge of the Treasury benches. We have stopped deaths at sea and we are taking children out of the detention centres. It really makes you grimace when you hear our critics talking about children in detention—we are taking them out; we are educating them; we are paying for them to go to school in detention centres, unlike the previous government. We are doing something to fix up the mess we inherited. We are doing what we said we would do and we are delivering on what we said we would do. 


I recall vividly before the last federal election, as I went around my electorate doorknocking, people said to me: 'You can't stop them—the gate's open—there's no way in the world that you guys will be able to stop them.'




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Were you out doorknocking? I don't believe it. I want the photo!




Mr RANDALL:
  Let me say to the member for Hunter that if you ever want to come doorknocking with me, see if you can keep up. I don't think you would have the stamina. The last door you would have knocked on would have been the front door of your local pub. Don't tell me about doorknocking—I am the doorknocking king from Western Australia. You need to understand that. We understand border protection policies and I say that these amendments will enhance what we are able to do on a whole range of issues. I commend this bill to the House.

"Goodenough, Ian, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:54):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is designed to build on the government's legislative agenda of border protection by strengthening the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. This will serve to prevent the entry of prohibited items and illicit goods into our country and clamp down on the avoidance of import duties on dutiable items. 


The challenges faced by our customs and border protection agency is compounded by the vastness of the Australian continent, which covers an area of more than 7.6 million square kilometres with a total coastline length of 35,876 kilometres and an additional 23,859 kilometres of island coastlines and some 758 remote estuaries around the country at which vessels may land. Australia's extensive exclusive economic zone covers 8.1 million square kilometres. We have a sparsely populated continent with a significant number of remote towns, where only basic port and airport facilities exist, without the advanced security found in capital cities. It is in this context that the task of monitoring our borders and controlling the international flow of passengers and goods represents a massive undertaking for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.


By improving our border protection capabilities to intercept contraband and the smuggling of illegal cargo—such as drugs, weapons, and materials subject to quarantine—we will be able to combat transnational crime, preserve the biosecurity of our agricultural industry and promote greater national security. This bill seeks to make a number of relatively minor technical amendments to the Customs Act of 1901, which will serve to close a number of loopholes that could potentially allow illicit cargo and prohibited items to go undetected or be transferred from vessels and aircraft within Australian jurisdictions.


The anticipated future increase in the flow of passengers and goods across international borders is brought about by the emerging economies in our region with increased international trade facilitated by free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China. Trade is projected to increase further as a free trade agreement is expected to be reached with India and as Australia develops stronger economic partnerships with the 10 member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and beyond. Our customs service must be adequately prepared and resourced to cope with the increased demands encountered at all entry points to Australia.


Perhaps the most significant of the proposed amendments are designed to allow customs officers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights. Currently, under section 30 of the act, customs control does not extend to domestic goods, which include domestic cargo or personal effects of domestic travellers once they are loaded onto or unloaded from international ships and aircraft. Section 186 of the act does not adequately provide for the examination of domestic goods on domestic legs of international flights and voyages. In practice, domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the customs controlled areas of ports and airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded or unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg without any authority or permission under the act. The bill seeks to correct this anomaly by granting customs officers the necessary powers to examine domestic goods carried on domestic legs of international flights.


Another key aspect of the bill proposes that customs control be extended to goods on board a ship which docks or an aircraft which lands at any place in Australia that is not a designated port or airport 


Currently, the act does not extend Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or an aircraft at a place other than a designated port or airport in Australia. From time to time it may be necessary for vessels or aircraft to dock or land at places on the Australian mainland due to adverse weather conditions or other reasonable causes under section 58(1) of the act, or if the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a collector to bring the ship or aircraft to land under section 58(2) of the act.


For instance, the cruise ship industry regularly seeks permission to visit non-proclaimed areas of the Australian coastline, and the stopover may involve disembarking travellers or unloading goods in these locations where government agencies do not have a presence. Goods on board a ship or aircraft in these circumstances are not currently subject to Customs control and cannot, therefore, be examined by an officer of Customs under section 186. To ensure that border risks and intervention activities can be managed appropriately, it is proposed that Customs control be extended to goods on board a ship or aircraft at the place to which the ship or aircraft has been brought under the circumstances covered in sections 58(1) or 58(2) of the act. Item 5 repeals and substitutes section 31 of the act to ensure that all goods on board a ship or aircraft from a place outside Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within Australia.


 The bill also contains amendments which add legal certainty to the circumstances in which the Chief Executive Officer of Customs can authorise persons to carry out functions under the act. Currently, the CEO of Customs can authorise an individual by name or position, or a class of offices or positions, to be authorised officers for the purposes of carrying out functions under particular provisions in the act. Unlike delegations, the law remains ambiguous as to whether an authorisation will apply to future offices or positions created within an authorised class that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendment proposes to amend the definition of 'authorised officer' in the act so that authorisations can apply to future offices or positions created. This will preclude the need to update authorisation instruments on a regular basis to ensure that new offices are covered.


In addition, the bill will improve and make consistent with other parts of the Customs Act the application process for permission to load and unload a ship's and an aircrafts' stores, and for the transfer of goods between certain vessels. The proposed amendments are designed to standardise the application processes in the act by requiring applications for certificates of clearance to be in an approved form. This supports the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service's initiatives to streamline processes and eventually allow applicants to apply for clearance certificates online.


The bill will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These changes will allow earlier assessment and the planning of resources required if the stores or prohibited goods reported present risks, including the management of firearms, weapons, and narcotics. The bill will also correct a technical error in relation to the interaction of Custom and Border Protection's Infringement Notice Scheme and claims process for seized goods under the Customs Act.


In summary, the measures contained in the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 are designed to incrementally improve the security of our national borders by addressing anomalies in the current system. By giving the Australian Customs and Border Protections Service the necessary powers to examine domestic goods en route to and from international destinations in the circumstances outlined, and at places within Australia other than at ports and airports where foreign vessels or aircraft land, the government can intercept prohibited items, illicit goods, and dutiable items, preventing them from crossing our borders. The bill also ensures that the legislation is brought up to date with current Customs practice, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:05):  In relation to the Customs Amendment Bill 2014, I want to tell the story of what is happening in Townsville at the moment. Townsville has a limited international airport. We want to start new international flights to another destination—say, Bali. To do that, we have to get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville. On a discount-airline basis, it is a very competitive trade. But if we have to fly in these people and all these things, then all the extra costs in this space mean that we are no longer competitive. We previously had that flight when Strategic Airlines did it. To get customs, immigration and quarantine services into Townsville it ended up costing us more on the ground that it did in the air. So it was no longer competitive to come through Townsville to go to Bali. So when we did that, no-one used it and the thing shut down. What we need in Townsville—and this plays into the development of Northern Australia as well—is assistance to get customs, immigration and quarantine services up and running and to get them underway.


Minister Scott Morrison and his office have been fantastic to me and to Townsville airport in relation to our discussions in the space. But at every turn I have come up against the problem with the massive cost overruns we have had over the last six years. Our border protection policies, all that sort of stuff, has been in so much strife—$11 billion. No matter what the cost, we have got a real issue when it comes to being able to provide new services.


I see the member for Solomon in here. The member for Solomon is a valued member of the development of Northern Australia white paper committee. She has been around the north of Australia. She has been to my city of Townsville and she knows what a great place it is, as I know that Darwin is a great place. What the member for Solomon and I are all about is growing the north, growing opportunity.


But at every level government must balance its budget, and must live within its means. What we have to do is to try to figure out how we are going to get this service up and running when you have to fly in staff and it has to be on a cost recovery basis. So when it gets to trying to get customs, immigration and quarantine services, we are starting from so far behind the starting line that we cannot catch up.


Deputy Speaker Kelly, I heard you in Federation Chamber this morning talking about business. You spoke about going overseas and getting things done and all sorts of stuff about running a business. Up until 2007, Australia, as a business, ran with a great return to the company. We were reinvesting in the company of Australia, of Team Australia. We were getting all our stuff rolled out. We had money in the bank. We were investing for the future. We were able to afford anything. If anything happened, we were able to do that. The GFC hit, and no-one is denying that the GFC caused a lot of pain. I see the communications minister down there sitting at the table. He was the leader of the opposition at the time and he backed the first round of stimulus, as was right. He was also right when he walked away from the second round of stimulus and said that they were going too hard. And they just ran up so much debt. The member for Wentworth, now communications minister, was also right when he said we are losing control of what we are trying to do here. There was too much money going out and there was too much debt. Once you lose control of your cash flow, once your cash flow is going into paying interest instead of paying for other products or paying for upgraded plant and equipment in your business, you lose control of your business.


I am an auctioneer by trade, and my area of specialisation was in insolvency. I would go into businesses and shut them down, sell off of the plant and equipment, and move on. Just about every insolvency was around cash. If you lose control of your cash flow, you lose control of your business, if your debts are ratcheted up too high. I worked through the Keating recession of the early 1990s, when interest rates were in their 20s, and what really knocked a lot of businesses around was that so much of their working capital went into the business of paying off debt. And that is where we are at the moment.


So when it comes to the customs, immigration and quarantine services, the Customs Amendment Bill does a whole heap of things. It amends the Customs Act 1901. It is about making sure that we balance our books. It is about making sure that we are living inside our means. It is about making sure that we do have that base from which we can grow. If I had had this opportunity in 2007, it would have been a no-brainer. If I had had the opportunity in 2007 to put an international airport into Townsville or start international flights through Townsville—because we are a limited international airport at the moment—it would have been a no-brainer. We would have done it. Because we had the cash there to say 'Okay, that sounds like a great idea, we will do that.' But now, because of the way things are, money is very tight. So to get $2 million or whatever we need to get started is very hard.


All the way through, no matter what bill we are talking about—and this is the Customs Amendment Bill 2014—it all comes back to the economy. It all comes back to being able to afford what you want to do. If you have cash in the bank you can do anything you want.


I remember that great Australian story on the ABC on Kerry Packer about his kidney transplant. The great line that he said was: 'The beauty about having cash is you can go anywhere you want. I could have this operation in New York, or Geneva or wherever.' He said that the best bloke to do it was in Sydney. But he said that if you have the cash you make the decisions. If you lose control of your cash, you are not making your own decisions. You are playing catch-up and you are trying to do things you are not supposed to be doing.


When I speak about this bill, I speak about living within my means. I speak about making sure that we do live within our means and making sure that everything is affordable.


If I can just quickly touch on the ABC cuts in relation to this customs bill, because it all comes back to what you do with your cash. When you make your decisions, when you make your statements, you make it with the information you have at hand at the time. Six months down the track, or 15 months down the track, circumstances are vastly different and so your decisions have to be very different. And that is as it goes with the Customs Amendment Bill. It all comes down to making sure that we live within our means. It all comes down to making sure that we do the right thing by the economy. We can do what we want if we do that, if we get in touch with our base and build our base.


I remember reading just recently the valedictory speech of the great Labor finance minister Peter Walsh. He left the Senate in 1993. He bemoaned the fact that he did not think we would ever pay back the debt Labor had run up at that time. He did not think we would ever pay it back. The quote I love is where he said that the first thing you lose is your economic sovereignty, and then you lose your political sovereignty. As in business, you end up with administrators and liquidators moving in. As a country, you end up having to make decisions that no one is happy about. I support the bill and I thank the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2014-11-26,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:15):  The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 makes a number of small amendments to the Customs Act. The amendments are mostly technical—they are not controversial. They aim to improve and strengthen the act that outlines our customs framework. Minister Morrison has proven to be one of the most effective ministers in the Abbott government. He certainly has been one of the most effective immigration and border protection ministers that this country has ever seen. It is through his strong leadership and dedication that the Abbott government has been able to stop the flow of illegal maritime arrivals into Australia. As promised before the last election, we have all but stopped the boats. We are now working on the massive backlog of asylum seekers that the previous Labor government simply stopped processing. It thought that by some magical intervention some solution would appear and fix the mess they had got themselves into. We know what that solution is—it is the Abbott government. Once again we have to fix the mess that the Labor Party left us. We are about getting Australia back on track and providing some certainty especially to those people who were seeking asylum under Labor. Those people were left with no answers and no idea about when their applications for asylum would be processed. Minister Morrison has also proven to be an excellent advocate for Australian customs issues. He is methodically and logically working through bits of the customs legislation and ironing out some of the creases, once again to get things back on track.


My electorate of Solomon covers the cities of Darwin and Palmerston, and we are quite often the front line for on-water Customs operations as well as Customs operations through the Darwin International Airport. Mr Morrison recognises that there is some important work carried out in the Top End and that is why he has visited many times, both before the election and certainly after the election. He has met personally with Customs and Border Protection personnel, and he always seeks their feedback on what is working and what is not working. Minister Morrison recognises that they are the subject matter experts—they are on the front line, they have a wealth of knowledge and they know what is needed to protect our borders from particularly unwanted goods.


The bill contains various amendments to the Customs Act. More broadly, those changes are about improving the administration of the appointment of authorised officers. The allowance of class-based authorisations will include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The bill is about extending Customs controls to those places where ships and aircraft arrive in Australia that are not proclaimed ports or airports and where agencies do not necessarily have a strong presence. It is about providing greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. It is also about improving application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. The bill is also about extending Customs powers in relation to the examination of baggage for domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and of domestic cargo that is carried on international flights and voyages, even though these travels may not be on an international leg. The bill also corrects a technical error, resulting in the enhancement of the interaction of the Infringement Notice Scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports. These amendments aim to improve the practicalities of protecting our borders from unauthorised entries and undesirable goods entering Australia.


My electorate, covering the areas of Darwin and Palmerston, faces a number of different customs threats. For example, every fishing season there are scores of illegal fishing vessels intercepted off the Top End. Illegal fishing poses a real threat to Australian fish stocks and the Australian economy. The waters off Darwin are a pristine marine environment that we regulate to avoid overfishing and pollution causing damage to our marine life. Illegal fishing activity directly undermines the Australian government's hard work and integrity measures put in place to ensure that we fish sustainably and harvest seafood in a way that enables future generations to access the wonderful range of foods we are so fortunate to have in our oceans.


Customs and Border Protection are committed to protecting Australian borders on the high seas and are particularly effective in intercepting illegal entries, considering our unfathomably large borders. Just yesterday Border Protection Command and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority intercepted two foreign fishing vessels just 170 nautical miles off Darwin The vessels had on board 14 crew, 45 kilograms of dried fish, 10 kilograms of fresh fish, six live fish and some fishing and diving equipment, all of which, thankfully, has been seized. They were intercepted by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service vessel Dame Roma Mitchell. The two boats have been apprehended on suspicion of illegal fishing activity in Australian waters.


In May this year HMAS Glenelg intercepted a foreign fishing vessel off the coast of Darwin. This boat was also suspected of illegal fishing activity in the Australian Fishing Zone. Border Protection Command personnel found almost 50 kilos of Spanish mackerel, 20 kilos of tuna, 20 kilos of dolphinfish and 10 kilos of barracuda on this vessel.


Illegal fishing poses a threat to my electorate, because one in three households in my electorate has a boat. We have a lot of keen fishermen in my electorate. But it is not only the recreational fishers that are impacted by illegal fishing; it is also the small businesses. Many local businesses rely on the regulation of commercial fishing in our region. These large amounts of seafood being taken illegally from our waters mean more work with fewer positive outcomes for our local businesses.


Back in April, the Australian Customs vessel Cape St George intercepted two foreign fishing vessels, also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone, after detection by an Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Dash 8 surveillance aircraft. On Monday, 28 April, Border Protection Command personnel boarded these vessels approximately 167 nautical miles north-north-west of Darwin. The vessels had around 190 kilograms of wet trepang—that is a lot of sea cucumber. They also had some diving equipment on this boat. Customs personnel also saw people on a second boat throwing items overboard, and they were also found to have various fishing equipment and bags of salt, all indicating that there was illegal fishing activity occurring.


Also in April, HMAS Launceston intercepted a foreign fishing vessel approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin, which was also suspected of illegally fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone. It was found to have approximately 20 kilos of salted trepang, five reef fish and five kilos of dried fish, along with hookah and some diving gear.


Also in April, a foreign fishing vessel was detected approximately 275 nautical miles west of Darwin by, once again, an Australian Customs Dash 8 surveillance aircraft and was intercepted by the Australian Customs vessel Botany Bay. The vessel had fishing lines deployed and over 500 kilograms of fish on board. That is just outrageous.


In March this year, four foreign fishing vessels with a total of 58 crew were apprehended approximately 180 nautical miles north-west of Darwin. The wooden vessels were intercepted on Wednesday, 12 March and Thursday, 13 March by HMAS ships Launceston and Glenelg. Over 60 giant clams were found on board the vessels, as well as large quantities in their holds. Personnel also found a large quantity of sea cucumber and another large number of assorted fish. 


I would like to put on record the outstanding work that our Customs and Border Protection people do. I think the examples I have just given highlight the success that they have been able to achieve.


Another pressing issue in my electorate is the running of drugs in and out of our international airport and also our domestic airfields to remote communities around the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Police do an amazing job of monitoring this dangerous trade. The knowledge and expertise of our Australian Customs is invaluable in sharing information and skills. 


As drug runners use more creative ways to evade authorities, Customs must be appropriately equipped to deal with these constantly changing tactics. The coalition is ensuring that Customs and Border Protection agencies are well funded and properly resourced, so they can continue to protect not only my constituents but also the rest of the Australian communities from drugs, crime and disadvantage associated with drug use.


Customs officers working in my electorate in monitoring or looking after Darwin International Airport do an incredible job combating drug trafficking. The Top End is often referred to as Australia's gateway to Asia. This is because there are eight capital cities and 69 international airports within a four-hour flight north of Darwin. This means Customs officers have a huge responsibility in protecting Australia's borders at Darwin International Airport. We have many international flights in and out of Darwin. We need to do all we can to support these hard workers, who are often the front line of defence from external threats coming through our airports. 


It is obvious that customs officers in my electorate are doing a fantastic job by the large drug busts that they have made this year alone, which I will relay to you. An investigation beginning in July resulted in one arrest and the seizure of 1.6 kilos of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in Darwin last month. Thank God those drugs are no longer available in the community. 


The joint agency operation targeting air cargo began when Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers in Darwin identified multiple consignments of suspicious packaging originating from Bangkok. In September Customs personnel apprehended a 42-year-old UK national and a 56-year-old Australian national, who have now appeared in Darwin court charged with the attempted smuggling of two kilos of ephedrine into Australia. In July, a Victorian man arrived on a flight from Malaysia and he was found to have a laser pointer, a knuckle duster, 30 electric shock devices disguised as torches, a spring-loaded knife, 700 steroid tablets and 1,400 tablets containing Viagra. Thankfully they are also not available in our community anymore. You can tell that the operation does fantastic work in my electorate. As the member for Solomon, I recognise the important role Customs officers play and I am united with the minister in wanting to ensure our Customs and Border Protection agencies are properly resourced. I commend this bill to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:30):  The member for Solomon, in her contribution today, demonstrated very clearly why the Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is important and also the challenges being faced by this wonderful island nation, with its extensive coastline. I also want to commend her for her complimentary remarks in relation to the Australian Customs and Border Protection officers and their work. From Darwin and into your area they do an amazing job—and I did meet some of them when I was there previously. They have a huge task, and clearly they are very effective. And they have someone strong to represent their issues here in the parliament, so well done, Member for Solomon. There are many challenges, as we heard from the member for Solomon, with illegal fishing and drugs. When I was listening to the member for Solomon, one of the issues that hit me, as a farmer, was how difficult it is to protect our biosecurity in this country, with so much coastline and so many people, for different reasons, wanting to land here in Australia. With wooden-hulled boats come a whole lot of risks and challenges, so the work done by our Customs and Border Protection officers is certainly significant.


The measures within this bill are technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901, and they will assist our Customs officers in the job that they do. These amendments will allow class based authorisations to include future offices or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given; extend Customs control to those places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act; provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These are just practical measures.


The bill will also improve the application processes for several permissions under the act. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these permissions. That is of course a time-saving, very practical way of managing this. The bill will also extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage, and enhance the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports.


A reference to 'Customs' in the explanatory memorandum simply means the agency continued in existence under subsection 4(1) of the Customs Administration Act 1985—that is, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The explanatory memorandum says:


Section 31 of the Act provides that all goods on board any ship or aircraft from a place outside Australia are subject to Customs control while the ship or aircraft is within the limits of any port or airport in Australia. Under section 186 of the Act, all goods that are subject to Customs control may be examined by an officer of Customs.


Currently the Act does not extend Customs control to goods which are on board a ship or aircraft at a place other than a port or airport in Australia to which:


(a) a ship or aircraft has been brought because of stress of weather or other reasonable cause …; or


(b) the master of a ship or the pilot of an aircraft has received permission from a Collector to bring the ship or aircraft under subsection 58(2) of the Act.


As a result, goods on board a ship or aircraft in these circumstances are not currently subject to Customs control and cannot, therefore, be examined by an officer of Customs under section 186.


Goods on board a ship or aircraft brought to a place other than a port or airport in Australia pose the same border risks as goods on board a ship or aircraft within the limits of any port or airport in Australia.


To ensure that border risks and intervention activities can be managed appropriately, it is proposed that Customs control be extended to goods on board a ship or aircraft at a place to which a ship or aircraft has been brought under subsections 58(1) or 58(2) of the Act.


The explanatory memorandum also says:


Domestic cargo, and domestic travellers and their personal effects, are carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports other than proclaimed ports or airports by approved ships or aircraft. Domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the Customs controlled areas of ports or airports and mix with international travellers—


you see them wandering around—


… during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage.


Domestic cargo can currently be loaded and unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg of an international voyage or flight without any authority or permission under the Act.


The explanatory memorandum also says:


The mixing of domestic goods and imported goods or goods for export presents risks for diversion of goods from one stream to the other, especially if goods are of a kind that if imported or exported would be prohibited or subject to border related duties and taxes.


It is therefore proposed that the Act be amended to provide that domestic goods (which may be either domestic cargo carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages or personal effects of domestic travellers …) can be examined by an officer of Customs.


The new subsections 186AA(1) and (2) provide for examination powers in relation to domestic goods. That is what these specific technical amendments are for.


The safety and security of the Australian people and those who are visiting our country are a priority for this government. We have heard repeatedly about some of the measures we have taken in our strong response to a range of threats, be it ISIL or other terrorist threats in Australia or overseas. We have seen close corporation to combat transnational crime with international allies and neighbouring countries. We have seen an investment of $630 million in Australian security and law enforcement agencies for counterterrorism measures. We as a government take these responsibilities seriously.


I see that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the member for Cook, is sitting in the chamber. I commend him for his outstanding effort in his quest to control Australia's border and his commitment to stopping the boats. I think everybody, no matter where they are in the world, has a very clear message about the minister's intent and his commitment to this task. This bill furthers his efforts to make sure that Australians are secure and safe in every way that the Australian government can contribute to that. The Australian has made a contribution of $400,000 to support INTERPOL's foreign fighters initiatives, over and above our ongoing annual membership contributions. The global and interconnected world that we live in basically also creates a borderless ongoing criminal threat. I see that the minister is constantly aware and working on the constantly changing threat that we in this nation face as a result of the fact that we are in a global environment and one of transnational crime. Customs and justice are a key part of that. This government takes very seriously both of those roles. We have seen that through the member for Cook and his very dedicated approach to this.


The government has also invested $20 million to boost AUSTRAC's ability to stop cash being funnelled to terrorists and to crack down on money laundering by organised crime that funds the trade in drugs such as crystal meth and others. We heard from the member for Solomon some of the extraordinary amounts in value and weight of drugs that the Customs service is intercepting not just here but around the world. I notice that the AFP intercepted 81 credit card knives, as they are called, at airports around Australia. I hope some of the measures contained in this bill will assist with this. The knives were detected through airport screening. They are dangerous weapons. They are illegal and are banned from being taken on domestic and international flights. Of course, buying these knives is illegal, but I note through the work that I do in the online space that most of these are bought online. All jurisdictions have offences relating to the sale of a knife that is manufactured to disguise or conceal the blade or to give the impression that it is an innocuous item such as a plastic card of similar dimensions to a credit card. I am very pleased that the government has sourced and resourced additional Australian Federal Police offices at our airports. We also have an AFP counterterrorism officer in Turkey cooperating on global issues and concerns about terrorism and transnational crime. The AFP's international network includes 99 positions across 29 partner countries overseas as well as in Australia.


The recent passage of the crimes legislation dealing with psychoactive substances is also part of our very direct focus on all forms of the safety and security of Australians. We have a very clear duty to protect the safety and security of Australian citizens here and wherever else we can. That has been a commitment by the minister. I think all of us took and are taking very seriously the issues surrounding the disappearance of MH370. They are very real in Western Australia, from where the recovery effort is being managed out of RAAF Base Pearce and other parts of Western Australia.


We are aware that terrorists are constantly changing what they do and how they do it. They are increasingly sophisticated. They are constantly evolving what they do and how they do it. Our customs and border protection agencies need to be able to constantly change what they to, to adapt what they do. We need to give them the tools through these sorts of technical amendments to be able to do the job that we employ them to do. They take very seriously the job we give them.


Returning to biosecurity, we have seen so much wonderful news about three very valuable free trade agreements—those with Japan, Korea and China—and we are working on another free trade agreement, with India, in the year ahead. We will see a lot of produce and goods in and out of Australia as a result of these agreements. Yes, Australia is open for business. That is very clearly demonstrated by this government. There will be increasing demands on Customs because of the trade of goods. The amendments in this bill will assist Customs in the job they have to do in this space. I have no doubt that these measures will assist the officers in the job that they do.


Finally, once again, I have great respect for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I commend him on the outstanding job that he has done on border protection. I know that this is probably not the last piece of legislation that he will bring before the House. His vigilance in his role is greatly appreciated not just by me as the member for Forrest. It is one of the matters that I receive a lot of feedback on in my electorate. It is good to know that we have such strong representation and an absolute commitment to the safety and security of Australia and its borders.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (17:44):  I want to thank members for their contributions to this debate, particularly the government members, who have been the major contributors to this debate. I want to thank the member for Forrest and my many other colleagues for their strong encouragement of the work that the government is doing not just in the area of customs but more broadly on the issues of border protection.


I also want to note that the opposition indicated their support for this bill in their response earlier today. This is a fairly significant moment. It is fairly common for the opposition to oppose us on border protection measures. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition must have been on autopilot because he did not even know he had voted against a bill here in this very place when the question was put to him about it today when he was speaking at the National Press Club. It is an oddity for the opposition to support this government on stronger border protection but, at least in this case, for what are fairly routine but nonetheless very important matters that are presented in this bill we welcome their support.


This bill is part of a much broader package of measures and initiatives that the government is bringing in on border protection, not just Operation Sovereign Borders and what is being done there to stop the boats so successfully and save lives as a result, to restore integrity to our immigration program and give Australians all over the country confidence in our immigration program. To see that confidence restored in the way our borders are being managed and the way our immigration program is being run in the surveys that have been most recently conducted by Professor Markus and the work of the Scanlon Foundation is very pleasing.


In border protection in particular we are working towards the start-up of the Australian Border Force on 1 July next year. That measure which will see both this year and over the out years the reinvestment of over $700 million back into our Customs and Border Protection Service and the Border Force reverses the cuts that were made to Customs and Border Protection by the previous government of the same amount over their time in government. So we have replaced what the previous government had removed when it comes to protecting our borders and ensuring not just the work of countering people smuggling but the very important work that is done in passage facilitation and goods facilitation.


The member for Forrest made a very good point—and that is that the tremendous work done by the Minister for Trade and Investment has opened up enormous opportunities for this country. That will see much trade now take place between Australia, Japan and Korea as well, of course, as with China. We look forward to arrangements with India and many more opportunities.


The truth of these things is that where those legitimate economic opportunities come, with the movement of both goods and people, the crooks use the same planes, the same internet and the same methods that legitimate traders do. That means that when we expand and open ourselves up, as we should, for greater economic opportunities we also then must redouble our efforts when it comes to ensuring that the crooks, gangs, thugs, people smugglers and traffickers are not able to exploit that increase in economic trade as an opportunity to ply their own nefarious activities and become rich as a result and compromise something that is very dear to this country, and that is the integrity of our borders. It is very much a matter of sovereignty.


These measures have also about bringing to the table quite straightforward, simple changes that will seek to tighten up the legislation even more and close off any loopholes and opportunities that we have identified such that those who might seek to compromise our borders will be frustrated in that purpose.


We have reversed those cuts. There was $88 million in addition to what I mentioned before, which was put in immediately upon coming to government. That has significantly increased our screening capacity. In the first quarter of this financial year, we saw a significant increase in the levels of detections as well as increased screening levels, particularly for sea cargo and air cargo. That is welcome.


There has also been a $150 million investment in our borders as part of the counter-terrorism package which I know many of the government speakers made reference to in their contributions to this debate. This is an omnibus bill that proposes some minor but important changes to the Customs Act of 1901. These changes will extend Customs control to places at which ships and aircraft arrive in Australia in accordance with section 58 of the act. They will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting of stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. The reforms contained in this bill will improve the application processes for approvals to load, unload and use ships' and aircrafts' stores and permissions to transfer goods between certain vessels and applications for certificates of clearance. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for these approvals, permissions and certificates.


Importantly, the reforms contained in this bill will extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic passengers on international flights and voyages and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage.  Domestic cargo and domestic travellers and their personal effects are carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports other than proclaimed ports or airports by approved ships or aircraft. Domestic travellers on international flights or voyages access the Customs controlled areas of ports or airports and mix with international travellers prior to, during and after the domestic leg of the flight or voyage. Domestic cargo can currently be loaded and unloaded from a ship or aircraft on a domestic leg of an international voyage or flight without any authority or permission under the act. The mixing of domestic goods and imported goods or goods for export presents risks for diversion of goods from one stream to the other, especially if goods are of a kind that if imported or exported would be prohibited or subject to border related duties and taxes. The reforms in this legislation will expand the scope of Customs inspection powers to ensure that these vulnerabilities do not persist in the border management environment.


Further enhancements to the act contained in this bill include enhancements to the interaction of the infringement notice scheme with the claims process under the act in relation to prohibited imports and provisions that permit class based authorisations to include future officers or positions that come into existence after the authorisation is given. The amendments in this bill will enhance Customs controls and examination powers and improve Customs compliance and enforcement activities. These enhancements will modernise the environment within which the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and their successor, the Australian Border Force, operates and help ensure that our border management processes support the best possible systems to facilitate legitimate movement of people and goods and stop those who seek to conduct illicit and illegitimate activity on Australia's borders.


I thank the members for their contributions to this debate. The work of border protection is in the detail. It is about closing off every opportunity for those who would seek to compromise our borders. The package of measures in this bill is yet another step forward by the government to demonstrate our commitment to stronger borders in all areas. I commend the bill to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:30):  During parliament this week, in fact in most question times, and during a number of debates that the government has had and many of their speakers have had, there has been all of this talk and the excitement about the free-trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea. There has been talk of the billions of dollars that it will create for the Australian economy and for Australian businesses, particularly in agriculture. There has been talk about the jobs that it will create.


But this debate is quite hollow and this rhetoric—I believe it is rhetoric—is not really exposing or answering the questions that many in the community have, including in my own community. There is concern about the jobs that have been created by these free-trade agreements: who will work them? That is because within these free-trade agreements, there is the ability for people to come over here on 457 visas and for people to come over here on holiday work visas to work in this country. What we are learning every day through investigations with Fair Work Australia and what I am learning every day when I go out to workplaces is that people who are on these temporary visas here in Australia tend to be exploited. They are an underclass of workers who are being exploited in our workplaces. Our Fair Work system is struggling to handle this issue.




Mr John Cobb:
  That is rubbish.




Ms CHESTERS:
  A few people in the chamber are sniggering and saying that this cannot be true. Well, it is. This includes in the CBD in Melbourne. Cleaners who are international students actually stopped work to demonstrate the exploitative conditions that they are in. They are here as international students. Their intention in coming here was to study and they wanted a part-time job, which we encourage them to do. Yet the company that they work for said, 'If you want to work for us, you have to get ABN. You have to become an Australian small business to be a cleaner.' When they did the math and got their first pay cheque, they were being paid less than the Australian workers or the permanent migrants who were working next to them.


There is a problem with our visa work system here in this country. On all the talk that our free-trade agreements are going to create jobs, my question to the government is: what kind of jobs are you creating and who will work these jobs? The Australian newspaper is not usually a newspaper that I quote from, because it is not normally a newspaper that I like to read. But it actually stated this last week, after the release and the great news about the China free trade agreement:


Under the free-trade agreement with China, Chinese companies will be able to bring in workers on 457 visas to install and maintain equipment on projects for up to three months.


The paper also stated:


The Abbott government has also agreed to allow up to 1800 chefs, martial-arts coaches, Mandarin language tutors and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to apply for 457 visas. Five thousand Chinese visitors a year will also be given the right to work…


I am not opposed to skilled migration. My parents are both skilled migrants. My mum came here as a 10-pound Pom and my dad came here as a skilled mechanic. But what they had when they came here was the opportunity to be treated like everybody else in the workplace. They were not employed on a temporary visa. They were not subject to the position of the employer where if they stood up and said, 'I don't like what is going on in my workplace,' they could be sacked and sent home.


The potential exploitation of people on 457 visas, on student visas and work holiday visas is actually happening. We are learning every day—whether it is in Fair Work Australia or in other forums—about the exploitation that is occurring. We need to ensure that if people come to Australia on work visas then they do have workplace protections, we need to ensure that their conditions are maintained and we need to ensure that in any visa system that we have they have the same rights and protections as other Australia workers. There is a division within our workplaces and these free-trade agreements are not doing anything to address that. I call on the government to do the right thing by these workers.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (10:12):  In 2012, South Australians were disappointed by the decision by BHP Billiton to shelve a $30 billion expansion of the Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs. Olympic Dam is one of South Australia's most significant ore bodies with copper, uranium, gold and silver worth at least $1 trillion, and a deposit so big it would take 200 years to mine.


Before the election the coalition said that we would remove any government impediments to the future expansion of Olympic Dam and work with BHP on ways that we could assist, particularly in terms of approval processes and political stability in decision making. We approached BHP shortly after the election to discuss such issues as one-stop environmental approval procedures and certainty about the carbon and mining taxes. We repealed the carbon tax and we repeal the mining tax. 


In September the federal government helped cut through the green tape with a ruling that a trial of heap leaching technology could proceed without the extra cost or lost time of more environmental checks on top of the existing environmental impact statement that had already been done.


Yesterday in question time I asked the Minister for Industry about the benefits of the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement to the resource sector. Amongst the many benefits of the FTA is the elimination of tariffs on copper and uranium. BHP is expecting a big rise in demand for those commodities over the next few decades. Annual demand for copper is expected to rise from 27 million to 40 million tonnes by 2030. There will also be higher demand for uranium from China as it reduces its usage of fossil fuel and shifts to nuclear energy. 


BHP Billiton's CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, told his AGM that BHP are looking at using that heap leaching technology to expand Olympic Dam in stages, ramping up copper production from 184,000 tonnes a year now to 450,000 tonnes a year by 2024.


If uranium production grew proportionately it would be at least 10,000 tonnes a year. These plans would turn Olympic Dam into the world's second-biggest copper mine and potentially the world's biggest uranium mine. This level of expansion would mean a significant boost to South Australia's economy—which everyone knows is flagging—and thousands of potential jobs. However, as BHP's chief financial officer, Peter Beaven, has said, this is not a slam dunk. As he said, if we are going to get this project up we are really going to need the support of the broader community, the support of the government and so on. The Prime Minister has already indicated that the coalition government will assist however it can to advance the Olympic Dam expansion. If this project goes ahead, it will be significant for our state for the next 100 years. I think that South Australians should be optimistic about this project and make it clear to BHP, to the state government and to the federal government that they fully support an expansion of the Olympic Dam mine.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:43):  I am pleased to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. At its heart this bill goes to what we in the coalition see as the role of government. It is about freeing the hands of our entrepreneurs—encouraging them to take risks, encouraging them to experiment with new products, and encouraging them to experiment and strive for new markets—because that is what creates the wealth in our nation. In contrast, those on the other side of the chamber are more fixated on central planning where you have a lot of bureaucrats handling the levers of the economy. 


The other thing this goes to is our understanding that you have to create the wealth of this country through hard work and through entrepreneurial activity. The welfare of our nation is not a fixed pie, as so many members of the opposition seem to think, so that the size is fixed and you just argue about how to cut it to redistribute the pie. The coalition believe it is about growing the size of the pie. We also need to remember that if we engage in policies that harm our small business community especially, put red tape in their way, burn them with mandating the use of inefficient forms of electricity generation that costs them more, those things can cause the size of the pie to shrink. So we need to make sure that we are doing everything possible to increase the size of the economic pie.


Two hundred years of economic history have shown that the best way to do this is to encourage risk and to provide opportunity because it is the provision of opportunity that creates the innovation that we need to create new goods and services, to create new forms of communication and new methods of transport, to create new medicines. These all help to increase our prosperity. 


A fortnight ago we had the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One of the reasons the Berlin Wall came down was the failure of central planning, where bureaucrats trying to run the economy took away hope, reward and opportunity. Countries locked behind the Iron Curtain simply did not create the new goods and the new markets to build prosperity. Their economies collapsed, as did their societies, and eventually the Berlin Wall came down.


This bill is all about encouraging our entrepreneurs in export markets. Ultimately, 98 per cent of the world's GDP occurs beyond our shores. When we talk about hope, reward and opportunity, it is not just within the Australian landscape; we need opportunities for Australian exporters to sell their goods to the world. Exporters can do that. In Australia, we produce good products. This bill is part of a suite of measures to encourage people to take the risk in overseas markets. We scrapped the carbon tax at the start because it acted as a reverse tariff. So if you were doing any type of manufacturing work in Australia you would pay the carbon tax, but if you were producing those same goods offshore, you did not pay the tax. That put our manufacturers, our own people, at a competitive disadvantage in the export market field. 


The other thing we are doing is free trade agreements. We have seen them with South Korea, with Japan and with China. These absolutely remarkable achievements will create so more opportunities for Australian entrepreneurs to sell goods to those markets, creating wealth and prosperity in this nation. Recently, we had a visit from the Indian Prime Minister. Our free trade agreement with India is a work in progress, another market which our entrepreneurs can target, to find just a little niche to market to more than 1.2 billion Indian people.


One of the issues exporters often have is how they to finance exports. It is great to bring an export order back home in your pocket but often the thing is how you are going to finance it. This is something I can speak about from practical experience. Before I came to this place, I was working in a small family business and I was responsible for a lot of the export orders. I travelled to places like Singapore and Thailand. I did work in Indonesia. I travelled extensively through the Middle East. I did work in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon and even the USA and Canada. You would bundle your samples up under your arm, you would take them on the plane and go to sit in a boardroom to try to get export orders. 


As an Australian company, everywhere I went I found that representing an Australian company I was given a great deal of respect. Often the hardest part of the job was not getting the order. It was coming back and organising the production and the finance for that production. That is what Efic does. It helps those small businesses by providing extra opportunity for them to get the finance that they need. 


We have an overly concentrated banking sector here in Australia. That is great for bank profits; it is great for people that have shares in the banks. But for those small businesses that pay all of those high fees and charges, it is not so great. So Efic comes in to provide that export finance, where our banks are unable to provide it. It also provides insurance, because when you export there are always the questions of: how you are going to get paid? What guarantee of payment do you have? What are the risks of not getting paid? You often do not have access to Australian court systems when you are dealing overseas. Yes, you can negotiate to obtain a letter of credit, but the questions are: what is the strength of the bank that provides that letter of credit? What are the terms of that letter of credit? What documents do you need to provide? There are many risks in our exporters not getting paid.


Another thing Efic provides is insurance premiums. You can actually go to Efic and say, 'I've got this risk; it's a commercial risk. What's the premium given that I will not get paid?' For a small premium, you take that risk, so if something goes wrong—if there is a political risk or an insolvency risk—you can actually insure against that through Efic. That, again, encourages our entrepreneurs. 


An important thing to note is that our financing of Efic through government is not a leg-up, handout or subsidy to our business community; Efic actually returns a profit. Last year it returned a profit of $22 million; it is actually funding itself and returning a profit to the taxpayer for the money that is invested as well as providing these valuable services to our exporters.


In the last budget, this government put another $200 million equity injection into Efic. That will help Efic loan more, provide more funds and become a stronger organisation to get out there and help promote and educate businesses in Australia to have a go at those markets.


Moving on to what this bill does: previously Efic could only fund the export of capital goods. If a business that produced non-capital goods and had an export order and went to Efic, Efic would say, 'Sorry, we can't help you.' This bill changes that. We are opening it up where it can be all goods—capital or non-capital. If you are an Australian business that can go offshore, get an export order, produce the goods in the country and have difficulty with financing the production—as often some things can take 12 months to produce, and it can be 12 months or longer until you actually get paid for the goods you produce—Efic will now give you that working capital. That service is now available, because of the changes that we are making to both capital and non-capital goods.


This is one of the things that we need to do. We went into the last election with the words: hope, reward and opportunity. We want to extend that; we want to encourage the entrepreneurs in our country, we want to encourage those small business people to get out there and have a crack in those export markets. Yes, there are risks. We know a lot of the time companies might have to change their product, or their product may not fit in certain markets. But with 98 per cent of the world's economy beyond our shores, that is the message we want to give to the exporters—those wealth creators that create the wealth for this nation and help expand the size of the pie.


Why are things like this important? We hear a lot of whingeing from the other side about cuts to this and cuts to that, and how unfair it is. Ultimately, the wealth that we create is driven by the entrepreneurs of this country. The more opportunity we can give to them, the greater we free up their hands to get out there and have a go. The more wealth we can create, the more money will flow into the government coffers, which means the more we can spend on many of those much-needed social programs. That is what this is all about.


We can never forget the current financial situation that we are in. Often we talk about debt, deficit, surpluses and balanced budgets, but I think perhaps an easier way to talk about it is that for the last six years the previous government were running this country at a loss. Every year, as the government, they were losing money. 


In the last budget—2013-14—where all the parameters were set by the previous Labor government, we actually lost $48½ billion. This was the sixth loss in a year. For every single year they were simply running the country at a loss. What that 'running the country at a loss' means is we have had to borrow the money to cover the loss. There is no problem borrowing money—we are a wealthy country and we can borrow that money. But what it creates is an obligation to pay the interest.


Because the country has been running at a loss for six years, the obligation we have to pay that interest is now $13.5 billion every year. That is just the interest. It is not paying one cent of the principal. It is over $1 billion every single month we as the Commonwealth government now have to find. We have to take that money and pay about 70 per cent of it overseas—out of the country—to pay the debt on the six years of loss. That is why bills like this are so important. 


If we are going to dig ourselves out of the hole that the previous Labor government got us into, if we are going to afford the things we need to do in the future—things such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and everyone in this parliament talks about how wonderful it is but no one has thought about how we will pay for it all, in full—we need to encourage the entrepreneurs of this nation. We need to encourage them to get out there and take those risks, to expand and to experiment. We want them to get out there and have a crack at those export markets. 


That is exactly what this bill does. It opens up the Export Financial Insurance Corporation to enable it to loan for both capital and non-capital goods. Although it is only a small step, it is part of a suite of measures we are making to provide that hopeful and rewarding opportunity to the business people of Australia. They are the ones who create the wealth of this nation and that is what enables us to provide all those valuable social programs. I commend this bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:57):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this export finance and insurance corporation bill, as I believe it will provide benefits to small and medium businesses right around Australia. Members will be aware of my passion for micro and small business. Before entering parliament I ran my own small business for 10 years, so I understand the challenges that small-business owners face. Since entering parliament I have spent a great deal of my time talking to the small-business operators in my electorate of Canberra and advocating for their needs and interests.


Small businesses are the engine room of our economy and we need to develop the policy environment for them to thrive. Small businesses employ more than five million Australians and contribute almost 50 per cent of private-sector employment. That is why I am particularly pleased with the number of amendments that are in this bill on that front. By broadening Efic's ability to lend in all-goods export transactions, not only capital-goods transactions, there is the potential to see this country's export potential grow significantly.


The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is a statutory body that offers trade finance and insurance services to support Australian exporters. The export credit agency operates on a commercial basis and partners with businesses and banks to provide finances to SMEs that are exporters, companies in an export supply chain, companies looking to expand their business overseas and companies operating in emerging and frontier markets.


Efic provides financial services to companies that have been unable to secure adequate finance from the private sector. It fills a gap in the market. It provides SMEs with an opportunity, a chance that conservative Australian banks just cannot do. It will often take a risk on an SME where a bank would not. This kind of risk is crucial in getting SMEs off the ground and ultimately helps lead to innovation in this country.


Labor's record with the Export Finance Insurance Corporation goes back to its establishment. In 1991, the Hawke Labor government passed the original Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill to re-establish the Efic known as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This original bill established the Efic as an independent statutory corporation separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. It is pleasing to see that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation still operates today under the minister's statement of expectations issued by Labor's former minister for trade, Dr Craig Emerson.


There are a number of amendments in this act which will help Australian businesses flourish and I support them wholeheartedly. This bill gives Efic the ability to lend in all goods export transactions not only capital goods transactions, as I said before. This will expand Efic's capacity to support Australian businesses, particularly SMEs, as the vast majority of Australian exporters are not capital goods. To implement this measure, it requires deleting the word 'capital' from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic act. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only five per cent of Australian exports are actually capital goods yet under the current Efic Act, Efic can lend directly in support of capital goods but not all goods. This means Efic cannot lend for exports for many of the products for which Australia is famous—that is, goods like food and wine. It can, however, support the export of cows but not milk. From a business point of view, this just does not make sense. As I mentioned earlier, allowing Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exports significantly improves Australia's export potential. This is particularly good for small business, particularly good for jobs and particularly good for Australia.


The second substantial amendment effected by this bill is the widening of the competitive neutrality provisions as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Currently such provisions only apply to short-term insurance contracts. This is outdated as Efic now lists only medium-sized insurance as a product. In its 2012 inquiry report, the Productivity Commission recommended that Efic should pay a tax equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee in order to ensure that the Efic's activity on the commercial account complies with competitive neutrality arrangements. This bill implements this recommendation.


Labor welcomes measures that make it easier for Australian businesses to export their goods internationally and that is why we welcome this bill. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trade opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future and this bill is consistent with that objective.


I want to touch briefly on my experience of Efic. In my former life I worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a diplomat. I worked on the Middle East desk couple of years. During that time, I worked on Iran and was involved in the normalisation of the relationship with Iran. I commend Tim Fischer, who actually drove the change to that policy. It was a significant change to our policy. We had diplomatic relationships with Iran and had not severed those after 1980, but the relationship was not terribly strong. There had been no exchanges, no business trips, no ministerial visits.


Tim Fischer saw the opportunities that Iran offered, particularly for sugar exporters and for a range of other resources in addition to just services and products. I was involved first up in the normalisation of the relationship and, secondly, in the first ministerial visit to Iran in 10 years. Tim Fischer was the minister at the time and led a business delegation to Tehran. As I said, there was a broad range of people that were involved in that delegation. There were people from BHP, there were people from CSR Sugar. We had people who wanted to export tiles into Iran and people who were looking at exporting gems into Iran. A very broad range of potential exporters took part in that delegation. It was a historic delegation. It was a significant delegation and Efic was there alongside these potential exporters to identify potential opportunities for them to engage in trade with Iran.


The beauty about Efic, too, was the fact that because they understand government and work closely with them they were involved in the discussion that I was also involved in, which was led by BHP, where we engaged in a negotiation on a banking and finance agreement with Iran. They were involved in those discussions. They took about two days to get going and to finalise. Again, it was a major outcome of that visit—not just the symbolic gesture that was shown by actually having a minister there for the first time in 10 years but also the fact that we had this significant business delegation and produced a range of agreements, most importantly, this banking and finance agreement, which in a way provided the framework for exporters to engage in trade and export opportunities with Iran for the future. 


In terms of the relationship with Iran, the environment was very different from what it is today. At that stage Khatami had just been elected and Iran was looking to engage in greater liberalisation and was also opening up to the world. There are gestures being shown at the moment that they are also keen to engage more openly with the rest of the world and, in a way, liberalise. But at that stage there was this real sense of energy and momentum for change and a real will for change in that country. It was completely appropriate for the then minister, Tim Fischer, to have a vision for what the relationship could be with Iran at that stage, to engage in that ministerial visit, to take that business delegation to Iran and to engage in negotiating those agreements. It was a very different environment to what we see at the moment, but I do once again applaud the former minister for actually having the vision for that relationship and realising it through that ministerial visit.


Labor especially welcomes measures that benefit small businesses and I personally welcome these measures. As I said to you before, prior to this life I was a diplomat and then after that I had my own small business for 10 years, which was a wonderful experience. I am always looking for mechanisms to improve opportunities for small business and particularly to provide the right policy settings for businesses, both micro and small and medium, to thrive. 


I want to take this opportunity to sing the praises of a number of Canberra businesses which have achieved great things on the export front. In October the ACT Chief Minister held her export awards and a number of businesses won those awards. Some of them you know. Aspen Medical—we all know of Aspen Medical—have just won the Ebola contract. That business went from being a kitchen table business 10 to 12 years ago to being an absolute multinational, international civilian and military outfit that is winning awards all over Australia and contracts all over the world. They are a class outfit. Glenn Keys and his team do an extraordinary job. They are based in my electorate here in Canberra and, as I said, they are exporting to the world. Every time I see Glenn he has another clutch of awards under his arm that he has won. He is an extraordinary individual with a great vision and he is always a great contributor to the Canberra community. So it is not surprising that, once again, Aspen Medical won the health and biotechnology award.


I want to sing the praises of another company—that is, Canberra-based technology company Seeing Machines. They were crowned ACT Exporter of the Year. Again, this is an extraordinary company. In Canberra we have these very specialised businesses that usually provide services, but they have a real cutting edge and they really do us proud. Seeing Machines develops state-of-the-art fatigue and distraction monitoring technology. They developed the driver safety system, which is already being used by mining, commercial road transport and automotive industries worldwide. The company was founded in 1999. It now has 95 employees across Canberra, San Francisco, Arizona and Tuscany, with export sales accounting for 53 per cent of its revenue. It was recognised as Exporter of the Year just a month after the company announced a collaboration deal with Samsung that aims to bring face- and eye-tracking technology to the consumer electronics market.


I also want to make mention of another company, Intelledox, who have also done some great work in terms of linking up with South Asia and also exporting to Singapore. They are an outfit that recently made a significant donation to the ANU. They digitalise processes through mobile-ready smart web forms. They are involved in document automation, data transformation and business integration. They are essentially a data management outfit that have done some great work here in Canberra in the Public Service and right across Australia, and now they are exporting to Singapore. They were founded in 1992 and they are headquartered here and have offices in Singapore, New York, London and Toronto, as well as global partners throughout the world. They have been awarded Telstra ACT Business of the Year, they were listed on Anthill Magazine's 2013 Smart 100 list and they were named a BRW Fast 100 company in 2010 and 2011. Again, they are another class outfit from Canberra that is exporting to the world with particularly creative and innovative solutions.


In closing, I want to touch on Labor's record on small business, because it is a very good one and it is a very proud one. We supported and established a range of programs to assist small businesses to expand their trade and export opportunities. The Export Market Development Grants scheme is a terrific example of this. The scheme provides assistance to aspiring and current exporters, and the grants are a key measure in supporting Australia's small and medium-sized business who want to develop export markets. As I said, as a former small business owner myself, I know that deciding to export involves a great deal of risk—it is a real leap of faith. The research, promotion and travel required to identify the markets and build the relationships to begin exporting is incredibly costly. This scheme reimburses a significant amount of eligible export promotion expenses.


Labor, as we know, also increased the small business instant asset write-off threshold from $1,000 to $6,500. In our 2012 budget, we announced that we would provide tax relief for business by allowing them to carry back tax losses of up to $1 million so they could receive a refund against tax already paid. And it was Labor that commissioned the first Small Business Commissioner in this country. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trading opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future, and this bill is consistent with that objective.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:13):  It has been pleasing to hear the member for Hughes initially, and just then my good colleague the member for Canberra, talk about the important role that Efic plays and the gap in the market that it fills. This is where government certainly does have a role. Even more pleasing to hear was the number of companies that the member for Canberra referred to that are exporting their goods and services around the world—in particular, a couple of very successful medical companies. This is where this country needs to go with greater exports and more companies creating more employment, significantly, for our country. It is these exporters that are taking advantage of some of the fastest growing markets around the world. It is so important that we help them flourish and encourage them along their journey. Sometimes their journey can be tough, and that is where a body like Efic comes into play and has an important role. From my own experiences working in trade and investment overseas in Europe, when we were trying to assist some SMEs to get into new markets they did need some assistance from specialists in the field—not that I was the only specialist. There were others, whether it be Austrade or other Australian businessmen already located there, who were able to pass on their expertise and advice to help them enter those markets. Often it is the SMEs too, and this is where Efic really has a significant role to play where the banks are not willing to finance some of their operations. SMEs are the engine room of our economy. They are so important to growing our markets and taking advantage of the opportunities overseas. In terms of those opportunities overseas, I will speak a bit later about the free trade agreements.


A classic in terms of SMEs is the South Australian economy, where around 98 per cent of all enterprises operating are SMEs, and around 90 per cent of those employ fewer than 19 people. When you think about it, these are real microbusinesses, but they are so important in the fabric of our economy. On the weekend I was promoting the Shop Small campaign, which I think is a good initiative. I went around to a few local businesses in Torrensville—the Master of Bread bakery, who were very hospitable and offered some of their fine products, as well as the Little Canton restaurant. At both places the operators are very passionate, dedicated businesspeople who are having a real crack and hoping to make a go. The Little Canton restaurant has been there for a number of years.


In terms of the hard work required, these businesses take risks. They put their houses on the line. We as a government—and all governments for that matter, whether they be state or federal—need to do what we can to assist them to create the best environment. That is why such a measure is important. It broadens the scope for a body like Efic to provide financing. As we have heard before in this place, it reduces regulation and red tape—over $2 billion of savings—which, combined with the repeal of the carbon tax, is giving small businesses a great start to get on and do what they do best.


This is a common-sense reform to broaden the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's capacity—we have backed this, and I was pleased to hear that Labor are also supporting it in terms of the merits of the bill—because it prioritises an area that can be improved to help the export potential of SMEs, and it allows Efic to focus on helping small and medium-sized Australian companies to seize the opportunities. The main area where it does this is through lending directly to exporters of non-capital goods. The Minister for Small Business, the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Agriculture—the three combined—must be congratulated for driving some of these changes through.


Prior to these changes, Efic could only lend directly for the export of capital goods that are used in the production of other goods and not an end product. What do we mean by this? As some of my colleagues have pointed out, a classic anomaly is in the area of dairy, which is a significantly growing area for the Australian agricultural sector. We have seen how dairy has been such a boon for the New Zealand economy, with it quadrupling in recent years. This change in the legislation means that Efic can apply both to cows and to milk. This goes broader than just that one example, obviously. This restriction had applied to all other goods, including pharmaceuticals, food and fibre, medical products and consumer goods such as wine.


In these instances Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank, which will then do the actual lending. It was clear that there was a need to extend the ability of Efic to lend to enterprises that export non-capital goods and not confine them to just a credit guarantee, which at the end of the day equated to extra costs. Again I say that this is a common-sense reform that directly benefits the Australian economy and SMEs.


In terms of the free trade agreements, the recent Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement means that beef exporters will no longer have to pay $70 for a certificate of origin for each shipment. It also means that 97 per cent of our exports to Japan get preferential or duty-free access. These are just a couple of examples. When combined with what we are doing with China and South Korea, there are significant opportunities for our exporters and our SMEs to take advantage of some great foundations and some areas of growth in the economy that can help grow prosperity and, importantly, jobs.


I have heard many stories in my electorate where businesses have found it increasingly difficult to do business. We are making it easier. We are fostering a better environment and letting business get on with what they do best. I commend this bill to the House.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:19):  I also rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I agree with what the member for Hindmarsh said about the importance of Efic to our economy and to our businesses. I want to commend the member for Canberra for a characteristically interesting speech about her time working in small business and also working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.


The original Efic bill was a proud legacy of the Hawke government in 1991. In that bill, they did build on the corporation which is an independent statutory corporation that is separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. Its purpose is to assist Australian companies, as the member for Hindmarsh said, and enable them to win business, to grow internationally and to achieve export success.


As our export credit agency, the corporation operates on a commercial basis and partners with banks to provide financial solutions for businesses that are exporters, Australian companies with export supply chain and Australian companies operating in emerging and frontier markets. They are all very important aspirations. In performing that role, as others have said when they spoke before me, it does give our companies the leg up that some need in the financial world in order to compete. That is particularly in our own region of Asia.


The reason that Labor is supporting the bill before the parliament today is because there are changes that can be made to make sure that Efic keeps up with changes in the composition of our exports and other changes. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that only five per cent of our exports right now are capital goods. Members would be aware that Efic, as it stands, can only directly assist capital exporters. That does exclude 95 per cent of our exporters, who are people who want to do business in Asia and beyond and who want to export things like wine and products that are not necessarily the capital goods—so that 95 per cent of our export composition.


We do need to make sure that our trade arrangements—Efic and also our broader trade arrangements—keep up with the changes in our economy and the changes in the global economy. This bill certainly does that. The other problem with Efic as it stands that the bill seeks to rectify is that it does lock out from direct assistance a lot of the small and medium enterprises that we do want to be encouraging in our economy. It is important this bill fixes that problem up.


As the member for Canberra mentioned, on this side of the House we do have are proud record of supporting small business. We had in government things like a variety of tax concessions for the two million small businesses, who employ something like five million Australians; we had the tax-loss carry back; we had the instant asset write-off and we had the special depreciation rules for motor vehicles. Unfortunately, these have been scrapped by those opposite. That is an unfortunate development for small businesses in particular. We do want those small businesses and medium businesses to be able to access Efic finance, which is what this bill is all about today.


In terms of the bill itself, it will create amendments to that original Efic act from the Hawke government in 1991. It will give Efic the ability to lend, as I said, in all goods export transactions, not just capital goods transactions. In that way, the most substantial change that the amendment to the act makes is to remove capital from capital goods and the definition of eligible export transactions and make all the consequential amendments that flow from that. It allows direct lending to those exporters of goods, not just capital goods.


Other speakers have mentioned that as it stands right now if you are excluded from direct Efic assistance on the basis that you are a goods exporter and not a capital goods exporter, you previously or until now had to go through all sorts of rigmarole to tee up guarantees and all sorts of arrangements in order to access some assistance. That would be a burden for SMEs in our economy. It is important that they are now eligible for direct assistance after the passage of this bill. As I said before, that brings those other 95 per cent of exporters into the net of people who can be assisted by Efic.


We support the changes. We did have some more ambitious changes on the table when the government changed. Those have now lapsed unfortunately. We did have slightly higher horizons for changes to Efic but in the absence of those, which have lapsed, disappointingly, we do support the changes brought forward by the government for a lot of the reasons that the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Canberra mentioned earlier. In the absence of those three tax concession measures that were dumped by the current government but that existed under the previous government, we are looking for any way we can to help small- and medium-size businesses compete, particularly in our export markets.


So what we hope to see as a consequence of the passage of this bill is more businesses benefiting from the good work that Efic does. We want to see more small- and medium-sized enterprises prosper from that good work and we want to make sure that Australian businesses, not just big businesses and not just exporters of capital goods but all of Australian businesses, can benefit from Efic we want to see them eligible, we want to see them competing and we want to see them succeeding.

"Hutchinson, Eric, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (11:26):  I join the member for Rankin and in acknowledging that I too enjoyed the member for Canberra's contribution to this debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and her experience that she has had in this area of trade and, indeed, in small businesses. To be brutally honest, to look at the track record of the previous government in terms of small business, it is rather disingenuous when you consider that during six years they had five ministers for small business, start-ups of small businesses in Australia fell through the floor and small business failures under the previous administration increased enormously. Why? Because the burden and the costs on small businesses were going up. The regulatory burden was going up. Taxes were going up. The things that we said when we came to government were indeed about trying to reduce that regulatory burden, trying to reduce the cost of particularly taxes. We have removed the carbon tax, which, most small business in this country were simply unable to pass on. They were not considered as export exposed industries and this hurt enormously.


I note the comments in respect of this Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 before the House, particularly around the notion of competitive neutrality. It is indeed important because this is a government participating in a space where there is other competition. But it has been acknowledged on both sides that it is very worthwhile work that work Efic does. I have had experience of this myself. It is important that that competitive neutrality is indeed adhered to. I acknowledge that part of the changes that are being moved.


Australia is indeed an exporting nation and $300 billion worth of goods were exported out of this country. We should be doing as a government everything we can to help businesses to help themselves. That is indeed what these amendments are intended to do. They are designed to suit support small businesses, medium enterprises and larger businesses as well to do what they do best—that is, get on with business, create markets, explore markets and open markets. Sometimes they need some assistance in funding those opportunities or, as has been mentioned, getting insurance with certain customers, which of course comes at a cost.


I think of my experiences in a previous life within the wool textile industry. I worked for an exporting business in Melbourne. Efic enabled businesses. We had internal provisions around who and who we could not deal with. Without being able to access Efic insurance cover, we would not have been able to do business with many of the customers that were indeed good customers. That was a cost of doing business. It was the cost of risk. But once that Efic insurance cover is approved and once that Efic finance facility is in place it is, indeed, bankable. It is something that you can take to your bank and use as collateral, which then allows you to expand your business. Certainly within the wool-exporting business in this country, access to capital is indeed an enormous challenge from time to time. As has been mentioned, it just simply did not make sense that in this country the five per cent of goods that were eligible for finance under the Efic scheme were capital goods and 95 per cent were something other than capital goods. 


The changes made within this bill to reflect the reality of the situation will benefit us enormously. As the member for Canberra mentioned, we could previously get cover for cows but not milk. It does not make any sense at all. These are practical changes that we have seen within this bill. I think of some of the exporters in my home state and indeed in my electorate, meat exporters in the form of JBS Australia, which are based in Longford. I think of the 2013 Regional Exporter of the Year, Tasmanian Quality Meats, which are based in Cressy, also within my electorate. They are currently growing that business enormously. As I said, they were the Australian Regional Exporter of the Year. They particularly have a focus at the moment on the Middle East but I know they have plans, particularly off the back of some of the free trade agreements that we have been able to secure as government since coming to power in 2013. There are opportunities that exist for their business to grow, with the appropriate accreditation and the like, but to grow the opportunities that present in places such as China are, indeed, enormous. 


I think also of the seafood exporters, the well-known salmon producers that, as I say, are very much part of the Tasmanian brand. Huon Aquaculture; Tassal and Petuna Seafoods all have operations of some kind or another within my electorate. I think of some of the more innovative seafood businesses, such as Seafoods Tasmania, in dealing with what is a consequence of international trade in terms of sea urchins that are now, unfortunately, very prevalent off the east coast of Tasmania. There have been numerous efforts to find ways of dealing with this invasive species, all of which have failed. It has now turned into a commercial opportunity. The work that Seafoods Tasmania do at Goshen, a small town just north of St Helens in my electorate, involves harvesting those sea urchins. Those of you who enjoy sushi will know this as izumi if you are in Japan. The work that they are doing there to turn that into an export product, both into China, Hong Kong, Singapore and also Japan is tremendous.


Last year one of the recipients of support from Efic was a Tasmania-based shipbuilding company, Incat. They make outstanding catamarans that sail all around the world. They receive some Efic support to fund a liquid natural gas powered ferry, the first in the world. This is outstanding work. Another business in the north-west of the state, Specialised Vehicle Solutions, have also received support from Efic in the past 12 months. 


Exporting is not an easy business. I go back to my former life within the wool industry. Many of the retail businesses around get paid in cash and that is wonderful. But very rarely in the business I was involved in did you ever see cash. It was done on terms; it would be for 30 days if you were really, really lucky. More often than not, it was done on 90 day terms. I remember back in the late eighties, and some might say the heady days of the wool industry, it was a common practice to have terms when doing business in the Soviet Union—as it was at the time—of 180 days, and in some cases 360 days. The notion of cash and therefore the capacity to be able to fund exports and business, is indeed a challenge—particularly, for smaller businesses that are growing and finding their way. There is no question that this is a real challenge for many of them.


These are businesses indeed. I note the member for Hughes's contribution in this debate. These people are indeed the wealth creators of our nation, and we should be doing everything we can to support them. It is through the work that they do, the people they employ and the taxes they ultimately pay that allows this nation is able to—if we manage the books properly—pay for the services that the people of Australia rightly expect their government to provide. It is not a magic pudding though and therefore governments should—like households and small businesses—learn to live within their means. 


This is unfortunately and tragically the great failure of the six years that we had under the previous Labor government. They simply could not live within their means. This is the legacy that we have inherited; this is the challenge that we are dealing with. Yes, some of the decisions that we have been asked to make have been difficult decisions—nobody disputes that for one second—but they are challenges that we are up for. They are challenges that the people of Australia truly expect us to get on with. This is our lot in life.


I welcome these changes. An additional $200 million of capital is, indeed, timely. Taking a look at the role of Efic, I remind all who may take an interest in this space, it is competing in an area where there are other providers of these services; we should always remember that. The competitive neutrality is acknowledged within the changes in this bill. We should always be mindful—and that process should be reviewed from time to time—that we are not getting into a space where the private sector and others can provide these services appropriately. But, as it stands at the moment, we fully support the work that Efic does and the roles that they play to support, capitalise, fund and provide opportunities for small, medium and large businesses in this country selling Australian produce around the world.


The changes around increasing this to include non-capital goods is common sense. Our job is to also communicate that to businesses that are looking to expand their operations. Part of the role that we play as parliamentarians is to make sure that businesses that are looking to grow their business, create more jobs and export products out of this country are aware of the opportunities that they have under the Efic Corporation. Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in this debate.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:39):  I rise today to speak on the coalition government's continued commitment to small and medium businesses in Australia, as evidenced by the intent of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. While this coalition government continues to make great progress in the freeing up of markets under our trade agreement framework, which has seen many new markets opened up for Australian businesses, there still needs to be more in the way of support for business to truly expand internationally.


This is the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic. They have been doing a good job of helping exporters to secure finance, insurance, risk assessments and the advice that they need. However, direct lending has only been available to those exporters who compete in the capital goods markets. To understand why this is such a problem, we need to define what is a capital good. The Oxford English Dictionary defines capital goods as 'goods that are used in producing other goods, rather than being bought by consumers'. That is straightforward enough but very limiting, as Australia does not produce many capital goods. This can create some confusion. As colleagues have said before me, if a cow is exported to be a producer of milk, but not meat, it can be considered a capital good. However, cattle exported for meat are considered a consumer good. That is why the amendments proposed in this bill are so important for businesses who deal in consumer goods, those goods bought by the end consumer, not by producers. 


Let us consider an example. If Poppy's Chocolate, based in the member for Forde's electorate, were to export machinery for making chocolate to Japan, they would be able to access direct funding for this venture. However, if they wanted to sell their primary product—that is, the eating chocolate—to Japan, they would not qualify for direct funding from Efic. While I am all for businesses diversifying and innovating, this should not be at the cost of their primary business. Why should we not support those businesses selling consumer goods to expand their operations to take advantage of the many new trade agreements negotiated by the coalition government? Australia produces some fine consumer goods, and the rest of the world clamours for them in certain markets. Not that many years ago, there was in fact a Vegemite shortage in Japan. Tim Tams gained a cult following in the USA following the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Asia has an insatiable appetite for ice cream that Australian producers could help fill if they could just get their goods into those markets. 


On this side of the House, we understand that business occasionally needs a helping hand in order to expand. I was disappointed that the member for Rankin claimed that Labor had 'higher horizons' for Efic and wanted to help Efic, yet, when the member for Rankin was part of the then Labor Treasurer's team, they produced a shameful record with Efic. Labor gutted Efic, ripping $200 million of equity out of Efic as a one-off special dividend in the 2012 budget when they were indulging in a desperate search for their delusional surplus, scratching down the back of the couch looking for the loose change to try to prop up the surplus they claimed several times but never delivered. In its 2013 annual report, Efic noted that this caused 'material breaches' of prudential guidelines.


The coalition has reversed that raid on Efic's capital base, restoring $200 million of new equity capital to Efic in the 2014 budget. Once again, the coalition are demonstrating our genuine support for small business and small business exporters. Larger businesses mean more employees, which means fewer people out of work and a broader tax base—or, to put it simply for those opposite: less outgoings and more incomings for the government to pay for health, education, roads and infrastructure without needing to continually increase the limit on the nation's credit card. 


The coalition government understand how business works. We do not see business as a milch cow, an unlimited supply of money to be taxed. We understand the drive, ambition and dedication it takes to put your house on the line to fund your dream. We appreciate that business owners are usually the last ones paid if there is anything left over after they have paid their employees and their creditors. So we are offering them a hand up, with a simple change to the goods that qualify for direct funding from Efic. 


I know that Labor would prefer we did not give business a helping hand because that is not what they do. Rather than support businesses to build a stronger economy, they would tax them to the point of breaking. But the coalition is a government that fosters trade and supports local companies to take advantage of the opportunities the many new and upcoming trade agreements will bring to Australian businesses. The coalition government is here to help. With this change, thousands of small and medium enterprises will be able to take on the world. Surely, that is a goal worth pursuing. 


Once again, the people of Australia are faced with a stark contrast: a coalition that fosters business and creates jobs and growth or the antithesis of our beliefs, the 'tear business down' mentality of Labor. This bill makes a small but very meaningful change to the operation of Efic, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Rick, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (11:44):  I speak today in support of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill will amend the Efic Act to lift the restrictions on direct lending to allow Efic to provide loans to exporters of both capital and non-capital goods. It is unambiguously a good bill for small business. 


Previously, we heard the member for Canberra waxing lyrically about Labor's proud record on small business and talking up its record on the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. In fact, Labor gutted the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It took $25 million of funding out of that scheme, and the coalition has delivered on its election promise to put $50 million back into that scheme. 


In terms of small business, Labor also presided over 500 job losses in the small to medium enterprise sector. It introduced a huge number of small business-unfriendly acts such as expanding the reach of the so-called unfair dismissal laws. It also introduced the carbon tax, which had a deleterious impact across a whole range of small and medium exporters. 


But I go back to the bill. Currently, the Efic Act only allows for the lending of money to support the export of capital goods. Capital goods are defined as goods which are used to produce other goods, rather than an end product. They include machinery and goods used to manufacture end products. Capital goods currently make up only five per cent of Australia's exports, and some suggest that capital goods producers may be better placed to fund their own export endeavours than those seeking to export non-capital goods. Non-capital goods, on the other hand, are end products or consumer goods. 


Currently, when an exporter requires funds for the export of non-capital goods, Efic cannot lend to them directly but can facilitate a loan by providing a guarantee to the exporter's bank. This often results in duplication of paperwork, multiple or increased fees and extended loan-processing times. Small- to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are the main producers of non-capital goods and thus bear the brunt of these inefficiencies and extra costs. 


Small to medium enterprises, by definition, are businesses employing less than100 people or with a turnover of less than $100 million. They make up the majority of the enterprises in my electorate of O'Connor. This bill, when passed, will permit Efic to lend directly to small to medium enterprises and will allow SMEs to capitalise on global trade opportunities. For the primary producers of my electorate of O'Connor, these legislative changes will have a significant impact. 


Non-capital, or consumer goods, are largely the realm of rural and regional areas. These include beef, sheep meat, livestock, fibre, horticulture, wine, grains, flour, milk and dairy produce. These primary producers are usually SMEs who are often most hampered in their efforts to secure export finance through conventional lenders like the banks. 


Banks are traditionally dependent upon security, which is often lacking in export contracts, particularly for first-time exporters or for those exporting to emerging markets. Many of my constituents relay stories of waiting times of over a year to have bank finance approved or, worse still, to have their finance knocked back. Many have received sound and helpful advice from Efic and welcome the opportunity these amendments will afford them to engage directly with Efic for the financial support of their export endeavours. This amendment bill, when passed, will enable Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exported goods and therefore improve SME export potential and advance regional and rural economies. 


In my electorate, there are many SMEs kicking goals in export markets, and I am proud to announce that one of this year's big winners in the recent Western Australian Industry and Export Awards came from the horticultural food bowl of my electorate, Manjimup. I congratulate the Truffle & Wine Company on being awarded both the Premier's Award for Excellence and the Regional Exporter of the Year Award. They produce over five tonnes of premium Tuber melanosporum, or black winter truffles, of which over 95 per cent are exported. They are keenly sought after by top chefs and Michelin-starred restaurants worldwide. The Truffle & Wine Company is the single largest producer of black winter truffles in the world and benefits from being able to supply counterseasonal produce to the lucrative and growing European and Asian markets. 


I take this opportunity to thank Cassandra McCredden and Stuart Hutchinson for their hospitality on my recent visit to their Manjimup truffiere and I wish the team at the Truffle & Wine Company every success in the coming 52nd Australian Export Awards on 27th November.


I would like to further acknowledge O'Connor's burgeoning truffle industry with the Manjimup area alone having over 30 truffieres producing over 80 per cent of Australia's truffles. Truffle Producers of Western Australia's Chairman, Mark Horwood, maintains our WA product is lauded in Europe but the industry has so far been unable to crack the Chinese market. Mr Horwood believes that the recent China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will give the Australian produce the seal of approval that Chinese buyers need and anticipates that truffle production will treble in the next five years.


Another former winner of the WA export industry award for agribusiness is Ferngrove Vineyards in the Frankland River winegrowing region of my electorate. Ferngrove is a large exporter of premium wines to China and I do not doubt their business will also be further enhanced by last week's signing of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


Local fertiliser manufacturers Australian Mineral Fertilisers, AMF, recently shared with me their story of the financial barriers they faced when their small regional manufacturing plant tried to break into the lucrative export market. AMF are an innovative SME in the Great Southern region of WA. They produce high-performance, non-toxic fertilisers through the blending of essential minerals and specially coated soil microbes to create powerful 'living' fertilisers for both the domestic and export markets. AMF ultimately secured bank finance through a long and frustrating process, complicated by the low value of their landholding in Tenterden as security and the uncertainty of the emerging markets that they sought to export into; yet their product is non-toxic, is certified organic and fetches a premium in an increasingly environmentally conscious consumer market. Surely, these are the sorts of producers we should be supporting. CEO and ex-local farmer Rob Edkins firmly believes in regional enterprise and seeks to continue to provide his small regional community with sustainable employment opportunities through expanding the export aspect of his Tenterden based business.


Last month, I was joined by the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Bruce Billson, on a tour of Kalgoorlie drilling component manufacturer Harlsan Industries. Brothers and co-owners Harley and Dean Hollier received advice from Efic which assisted them in securing independent funding for the export of their RC drilling equipment. Together, they welcome any legislative changes that would simplify the funding of their exports into the developing markets of Africa, South America, Mongolia and South-East Asia.


Many other SMEs in my electorate have expressed the opinion that there appears to be considerable risk aversion and bias against lending by traditional institutions and that establishing markets in developing countries is not secure enough for most banks. Efic's 'capability based' approach supports loans based on an exporter's ability to meet their contract, rather than the traditional bank approach to lending to SMEs with the most tangible security. It therefore currently supports enterprises that can demonstrate the best business practice in the export of their capital goods. Expanding this approach to the producers of non-capital goods will only enhance the potential of SMEs to export our premium primary produce to the world.


Wellard Rural Exports is one of the world's leading livestock exporters and transports a large proportion of the cattle and sheep originating from my electorate to distant markets.

Mr WILSON:
  Recently, Efic assisted Wellard to facilitate the export of 2,000 quality dairy cattle to Sri Lanka as part of their commitment to help establish a 22,500-head high-production dairy herd in that country. To fulfil the initial contract, Wellard was required to arrange finance for the buyer. Sri Lanka was still dealing with the aftermath of civil war and found themselves with limited access to foreign capital. Given the general unwillingness of the private sector to fund exports into some emerging frontier markets, Efic stepped in to provide a guarantee to an international bank to provide a loan or buyer finance to the Sri Lankan government. The success of this first contract has led Wellard to winning more substantial contracts in Sri Lanka. Wellard similarly maintain, and I quote from a recent personal communication:


Efic has been a very good supporter of the development of the live export industry … when developing the beef breeder and dairy heifer market in China.


Efic also provided a credit facility to an Eastern European cattle importer to import Australian beef breeding cattle.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if I may digress for a moment to recount my own personal experience with Efic, as a young farmer I had a considerable amount of income exposed to an Iraqi wheat debt incurred from the sale of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board to Iraq on credit terms over the period 1988-90. Efic agreed to insure between 70 and 80 per cent of any payment default on these wheat exports to Iraq, with the Australian Wheat Board bearing the remaining exposure. Following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent imposition of United Nations economic sanctions, Iraq defaulted on payments. Efic subsequently paid credit insurance claims. After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, the international community decided to support Iraq's economic recovery. ln November 2004, the Paris Club of creditors agreed to provide Iraq with 80 per cent debt forgiveness. The remaining debt stock is scheduled to be repaid over the 17 years from 2011. To date, Iraq has paid all principal and interest instalments in full and on time. Efic receives these repayments from Iraq semi-annually, and passes the wheat growers' portion to Agrium Asia Pacific, or APPI, which now owns the Australian Wheat Board's assets. APPI then distributes the proceeds to the Australian farmers. Overall, wheat farmers are likely to recover about 84 per cent of the original contract value, comprising the Efic claim payment of around 80 per cent and the Paris Club recovery of 20 per cent of the remaining uninsured exposure. 


Efic is managing this process with Iraq to ensure that Australian wheat farmers like me will receive their entitled share of repayments. I make note that Efic no longer provides short-term trade credit insurance, having sold this aspect of the business to the private sector in 2003. I thank the House for indulging me in recounting my personal story and use it to reiterate that Efic has already played an important role in maximising Australia's trade potential.


The changes proposed in this amendment bill will expand upon and enhance the ability of Efic to ensure that no Australian enterprise whether they produce a capital product, such as a piece of mining or manufacturing equipment, or a non-capital good, such as O'Connor's renowned primary produce, will be denied the opportunity to grow their business overseas simply because they are unable to access finance. These new direct lending arrangements will remove the need for exporters of non-capital goods to obtain a guarantee from Efic before they can secure funds from a bank. This doubled the due diligence processing time and required duplication of documentation and considerable additional legal fees. This will become a real benefit to all exporters by reducing the time and paperwork required to access Efic support. This will ensure that Efic is able to provide products and services that will match the evolving needs of modern businesses.


This bill forms an integral part of Minister Robb's refocus on providing financial service to SMEs seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities, so I give today's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 my unreserved support.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (12:11):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and thank the House for this opportunity. The bill will create amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 and by doing so will vastly improve the commercial opportunities of the many Australian export businesses right around the country. Today's bill is another piece of important legislation that has been analysed, reviewed and amended by this side of government. This legislation is crucial and an ongoing part of the coalition's plan to revive Australian's small- to medium-size enterprises, which employ the largest number of employees and make up the bulk of our economy.


The opportunity to speak on this bill today has coincided perfectly with the freshly inked trade agreements which have concluded with China, Korea and Japan. Existing tariffs on many popular exports such as agriculture, horticulture and seafood will phase out in the next few years, meaning billions of dollars can be added to our economy. In light of this historic agreement we must not let existing legislation hinder business opportunities and instead work in combination to achieve the optimum result for our export enterprises. Both the bill and the respective trade agreements will allow prospects of export trading with these countries to flourish. The timing could not have been better, and I am certain that many export businesses, from the traditional agriculture sector to retail goods, are breathing a sigh of relief knowing their future is viable under the coalition.


Today's bill enhances the capacity of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to back small- and medium-size businesses seeking to capitalise on opportunities for global trade. As our nation and our government supports and encourages entrepreneurs, we must do all that we can to ensure opportunities that are presented to businesses can be seized and accomplished without unnecessary obstacles.


Globalised and increasingly integrated trading means businesses often look beyond state borders to seek and relish new commercial opportunities. This could be a combination offering a niche product with domestic expertise that is best suited to other markets or a multinational cooperative with other communities that can benefit from our products or services. Whatever the reason may be, this government fully stands behind the plethora of aspiring entrepreneurs and businesses that want to create and compete. Furthermore, whenever prospects arise for such businesses to export their goods and services, our policies should allow for employment and growth opportunities, as these flow directly back into the Australian economy.


We are a small nation, but the goods and services that we provide are second to none, and these are not just limited to the resources sector. Australia's wide range of consumer goods, including pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticulture products, wine, flour, fibre and cheese, coupled with increased international exposure from trade shows and tourism, means people are becoming increasingly aware of the exceptional quality and thus demand for these items. Statistics show that within the last two financial years there was an increase from 44,000 exports of goods and services to over 45,000. Whilst the biggest contributor of exported goods is still the mining sector, general use of service exporters is on the rise. It would be a real shame for Australian businesses to lose precious commercial opportunities to export our goods due to a lack of finance, excessive red tape and bureaucracy. The coalition has always been committed to strengthening the opportunities to support our small and medium-sized businesses, and this legislation today provides a vital pathway for that. 


The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation plays a crucial role in assisting export business ventures, stepping in to provide insurance and financial backing where traditional lenders have declined assistance. Efic was established as Australia's credit agency and operates commercially, partnering with the banks to provide financial solutions to various Australian small and medium-sized exporters, and has been essential in helping exporters take advantage of potential contract opportunities that might otherwise have been impossible.


It is important not to underestimate how much Australian exporters contribute to our economy and to our GDP. Exports are worth approximately $1 out of every $5 in Australia's national income. The International Monetary Fund has previously stated in its World Economic Outlook that Australia's export volumes will continue to fuel our economy and potentially taper the negative effects of a downturn in mining investments. Since the global financial crisis, the general slump of economies and their interdependence means that we must allow policies to provide businesses the resilience to withstand change. While some industries are subject to cyclical change and subdued growth, others may experience growth and expansion. Nevertheless, none should have to suffer from unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic burden where none is needed. Enhanced efficiencies in various competitive export sectors can significantly increase sales potential and renew further investment in the Australian economy. 


It is estimated that changes to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in terms of direct lending will help overcome some of the barriers exporters face. Currently, many Australian products that we excel in, such as those previously mentioned—pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticultural products, wine, flour, fibres and cheese—are not considered capital goods, as they are classified as consumer goods. Yet the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can only lend to exporters of capital goods. In reality, however, capital goods make up a mere five per cent of all Australian goods exported. So, whilst the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can directly lend for exporting dairy cows, it cannot directly lend to those wishing to export milk. 


In addition, exporters of non-capital goods have traditionally had to obtain a guarantee from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation before securing funds from a bank, meaning additional time is spent on paperwork before any transaction actually occurs. In these scenarios, Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank at the request of the exporter, and the bank then directly lends the finances. The application to Efic, as well as to the bank, means two separate lots of credit approvals, associated documentation, administration and legal fees. 


The coalition is committed to ensuring new direct lending arrangements that will remove the current restrictions in place for Australian exporters and the excessive red tape. When business compliance costs amount to approximately $1 billion per annum, this measure is vital to restoring faith to our regional, rural and general exporting sector. Mr Deputy Speaker Porter, you can imagine the potential monetary loss to the economy and to businesses. Changes to the Efic legislation will ensure regional and rural economies can thrive, with demand from emerging and developed international markets. 


Fundamentally, the measure contained in this legislation supports our election commitment to helping Australian businesses by a reduction in compliance costs. Time and again, small businesses right around Australia speak of the compliance costs which make and break their enterprises, and we owe it to them to provide the right framework that would cultivate ongoing opportunities. Enabling Efic to facilitate more financial options for Australian exporters is an important start. Expanding the scope and power of Efic is not targeted at marginalising private sector contributions; rather, it is about helping commercially viable exporters overcome financial obstacles that would otherwise prevent them from reaching overseas markets. The coalition have always been the party that stood for encouraging and nurturing current and future entrepreneurs, and we believe the change proposed today is essential to building a stronger and successful economy. 


Today's positive reforms follow on from this government's earlier enhancement for SME exporters in the 2014-15 budget, where an injection of $200 million was granted to Efic. This injection was much needed after a prior raid by the opposition. Restoration of Efic's finances means it can focus on this objective of helping and supporting Australian exporters, especially the small- to medium-sized enterprises, which make up the engine room of our economy.


Today's bill is so important to Australian export businesses because its implementation will ultimately increase Australia's reputation and competitiveness on the international stage. A recent survey of Australian export businesses by the Export Council of Australia revealed that the majority of difficulties experienced by exporters were regulatory compliance and access to finance respectively. As smaller companies rely more on international revenue from developed and emerging markets, increased or difficult bureaucracies would simply render them unfeasible. The survey further revealed that the majority of businesses, regardless of size, engage in a variety of business operations not limited to outsourcing, foreign investment, production and research and development. Australian exports amounted to over $310 billion in recent years. This demonstrates the potential of Australian businesses and, more importantly, how much more potential there is with the right policies in place. 


As global trends point to trade liberalisation, encouraging consumers, stakeholders and businesses working together, the government must ensure that export businesses have the right backing and support to enable them to reach their full potential. As I have discussed before, the rewards for businesses have a flow-on effect to our society, by employing Australians and contributing to our overall economy. With our two significant trade partnerships with Japan and China, we can now expect further growth and opportunities. 


The coalition has always been at the forefront of backing entrepreneurs. Expanding Efic will allow businesses which need capital to tap into current and emerging markets and to do so without red tape and bureaucracy. This side of government fully believes in and supports our exporters whether they are rural, regional or metropolitan based businesses. Australia's range of consumer goods and services deserve international reach for its outstanding quality and a chance to present these on an international scale should be fostered. 


Today's bill is one step to forging a supportive path for exporters and continuing to strengthen our economy. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is often the vital link between small- to medium-sized enterprises through the provision of insurance and finance. By previously having their support limited to only those with capital goods, which is a mere five per cent of all Australian exports, it has seen some of Australian businesses simply unable to gain momentum or a foothold in emerging markets. 


Today's measure will ensure that all businesses can have the opportunity to expand into international markets by streamlining financial processes and alleviating unnecessary red tape. I commend the bill to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (12:22):  I rise to sum up the government's case for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The government is firmly committed to reducing red tape. This bill achieves that goal. Amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act benefit small and medium sized businesses while at the same time reducing business compliance costs by $1 billion per annum. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic, helps ensure Australian small and medium sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their business overseas. As has been stated before, the goal of this bill is to increase Efic's capacity to finance small and medium sized businesses seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities. These global trade opportunities benefit all and they are about to get a whole lot bigger with the commencement of free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and now China covering over 50 per cent of all exports from Australia. 


Efic plays an important role in supplementing the provision of credit for exporters and we are repositioning it to best support exporters into the future. Efic has played a very strong role over many decades and is the one financial body in Australia that has expertise in assessing the risk in small and developing nations in our region. It often provides important opportunities for exporters to get those opportunities when they would not get finance from other financial institutions. They fill the gap. They fill the financial gap that exists for these sorts of lending, especially to small and medium businesses.


This builds on our restoration of $200 million in capital to Efic in the recent budget, reversing Labor's shameful act of economic vandalism when it ripped out a $200 million special dividend in 2013 and caused Efic to be placed into a position where they were not able to meet the prudential requirements that they had placed on themselves in order to act in a responsible manner. This was a highly irresponsible act and it gives the lie to a number of the contributions that we have heard from those opposite during this debate.


Efic is currently only able to provide direct lending for the export of capital goods—items used in the production of other goods—but cannot directly lend for the export of goods themselves. For instance, this means that presently, as other speakers have noted, Efic can provide direct lending for the export of cows but not for the export of milk. Efic can provide direct lending for the export of bull semen, a capital good, but not a steer that is destined to be a hamburger. This is an oversight from the outset of Efic, which makes no sense and has had quite a costly consequence over time. This means that 95 per cent of goods exported from Australia are currently denied direct lending support from Efic, as only five per cent of Australian goods are capital goods.


To implement this measure in this bill we are simply removing one word—that is, 'capital'—from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic Act. If you like, it is one very small step for Efic but one giant leap for our SME exporters. By allowing direct lending arrangements, exporters of non-capital goods will no longer need to go through a two-step process of first obtaining a guarantee from Efic and then finding a bank willing to lend against that guarantee. These outdated arrangements double the due diligence processing time for export credits and require two sets of documentation and legal fees. Through these changes, these duplicated processes will go—a reduction, a serious reduction, in red tape and costs. Business will no longer need to pay a bank a fee of up to three per cent simply to have the bank accept a AAA-rated Efic guarantee. These changes will save businesses time and money.


We are also ensuring these changes do not bring Efic into direct competition with private sector financiers, by applying competitive neutrality principles. To achieve this, the bill provides for Efic to pay a debt neutrality charge and a tax-equivalent payment. This measure ensures competitive neutrality and reflects the recommendation on competitive neutrality in the 2012 Productivity Commission report on Australia's export credit arrangements. As stated, this bill expands Efic's powers to allow direct lending for export transactions involving all goods, not just capital goods, and provides for competitive neutrality principles to apply to Efic's operations. It is an important part of our efforts to reduce red tape. The bill helps to ensure that Australian small- and medium-sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their businesses overseas, which in turn supports job growth. It fits with our overarching theme of displacing big government from centre stage and replacing it with robust growth of the private sector.


I thank all of those on both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:43):  I am pleased to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. At its heart this bill goes to what we in the coalition see as the role of government. It is about freeing the hands of our entrepreneurs—encouraging them to take risks, encouraging them to experiment with new products, and encouraging them to experiment and strive for new markets—because that is what creates the wealth in our nation. In contrast, those on the other side of the chamber are more fixated on central planning where you have a lot of bureaucrats handling the levers of the economy. 


The other thing this goes to is our understanding that you have to create the wealth of this country through hard work and through entrepreneurial activity. The welfare of our nation is not a fixed pie, as so many members of the opposition seem to think, so that the size is fixed and you just argue about how to cut it to redistribute the pie. The coalition believe it is about growing the size of the pie. We also need to remember that if we engage in policies that harm our small business community especially, put red tape in their way, burn them with mandating the use of inefficient forms of electricity generation that costs them more, those things can cause the size of the pie to shrink. So we need to make sure that we are doing everything possible to increase the size of the economic pie.


Two hundred years of economic history have shown that the best way to do this is to encourage risk and to provide opportunity because it is the provision of opportunity that creates the innovation that we need to create new goods and services, to create new forms of communication and new methods of transport, to create new medicines. These all help to increase our prosperity. 


A fortnight ago we had the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. One of the reasons the Berlin Wall came down was the failure of central planning, where bureaucrats trying to run the economy took away hope, reward and opportunity. Countries locked behind the Iron Curtain simply did not create the new goods and the new markets to build prosperity. Their economies collapsed, as did their societies, and eventually the Berlin Wall came down.


This bill is all about encouraging our entrepreneurs in export markets. Ultimately, 98 per cent of the world's GDP occurs beyond our shores. When we talk about hope, reward and opportunity, it is not just within the Australian landscape; we need opportunities for Australian exporters to sell their goods to the world. Exporters can do that. In Australia, we produce good products. This bill is part of a suite of measures to encourage people to take the risk in overseas markets. We scrapped the carbon tax at the start because it acted as a reverse tariff. So if you were doing any type of manufacturing work in Australia you would pay the carbon tax, but if you were producing those same goods offshore, you did not pay the tax. That put our manufacturers, our own people, at a competitive disadvantage in the export market field. 


The other thing we are doing is free trade agreements. We have seen them with South Korea, with Japan and with China. These absolutely remarkable achievements will create so more opportunities for Australian entrepreneurs to sell goods to those markets, creating wealth and prosperity in this nation. Recently, we had a visit from the Indian Prime Minister. Our free trade agreement with India is a work in progress, another market which our entrepreneurs can target, to find just a little niche to market to more than 1.2 billion Indian people.


One of the issues exporters often have is how they to finance exports. It is great to bring an export order back home in your pocket but often the thing is how you are going to finance it. This is something I can speak about from practical experience. Before I came to this place, I was working in a small family business and I was responsible for a lot of the export orders. I travelled to places like Singapore and Thailand. I did work in Indonesia. I travelled extensively through the Middle East. I did work in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon and even the USA and Canada. You would bundle your samples up under your arm, you would take them on the plane and go to sit in a boardroom to try to get export orders. 


As an Australian company, everywhere I went I found that representing an Australian company I was given a great deal of respect. Often the hardest part of the job was not getting the order. It was coming back and organising the production and the finance for that production. That is what Efic does. It helps those small businesses by providing extra opportunity for them to get the finance that they need. 


We have an overly concentrated banking sector here in Australia. That is great for bank profits; it is great for people that have shares in the banks. But for those small businesses that pay all of those high fees and charges, it is not so great. So Efic comes in to provide that export finance, where our banks are unable to provide it. It also provides insurance, because when you export there are always the questions of: how you are going to get paid? What guarantee of payment do you have? What are the risks of not getting paid? You often do not have access to Australian court systems when you are dealing overseas. Yes, you can negotiate to obtain a letter of credit, but the questions are: what is the strength of the bank that provides that letter of credit? What are the terms of that letter of credit? What documents do you need to provide? There are many risks in our exporters not getting paid.


Another thing Efic provides is insurance premiums. You can actually go to Efic and say, 'I've got this risk; it's a commercial risk. What's the premium given that I will not get paid?' For a small premium, you take that risk, so if something goes wrong—if there is a political risk or an insolvency risk—you can actually insure against that through Efic. That, again, encourages our entrepreneurs. 


An important thing to note is that our financing of Efic through government is not a leg-up, handout or subsidy to our business community; Efic actually returns a profit. Last year it returned a profit of $22 million; it is actually funding itself and returning a profit to the taxpayer for the money that is invested as well as providing these valuable services to our exporters.


In the last budget, this government put another $200 million equity injection into Efic. That will help Efic loan more, provide more funds and become a stronger organisation to get out there and help promote and educate businesses in Australia to have a go at those markets.


Moving on to what this bill does: previously Efic could only fund the export of capital goods. If a business that produced non-capital goods and had an export order and went to Efic, Efic would say, 'Sorry, we can't help you.' This bill changes that. We are opening it up where it can be all goods—capital or non-capital. If you are an Australian business that can go offshore, get an export order, produce the goods in the country and have difficulty with financing the production—as often some things can take 12 months to produce, and it can be 12 months or longer until you actually get paid for the goods you produce—Efic will now give you that working capital. That service is now available, because of the changes that we are making to both capital and non-capital goods.


This is one of the things that we need to do. We went into the last election with the words: hope, reward and opportunity. We want to extend that; we want to encourage the entrepreneurs in our country, we want to encourage those small business people to get out there and have a crack in those export markets. Yes, there are risks. We know a lot of the time companies might have to change their product, or their product may not fit in certain markets. But with 98 per cent of the world's economy beyond our shores, that is the message we want to give to the exporters—those wealth creators that create the wealth for this nation and help expand the size of the pie.


Why are things like this important? We hear a lot of whingeing from the other side about cuts to this and cuts to that, and how unfair it is. Ultimately, the wealth that we create is driven by the entrepreneurs of this country. The more opportunity we can give to them, the greater we free up their hands to get out there and have a go. The more wealth we can create, the more money will flow into the government coffers, which means the more we can spend on many of those much-needed social programs. That is what this is all about.


We can never forget the current financial situation that we are in. Often we talk about debt, deficit, surpluses and balanced budgets, but I think perhaps an easier way to talk about it is that for the last six years the previous government were running this country at a loss. Every year, as the government, they were losing money. 


In the last budget—2013-14—where all the parameters were set by the previous Labor government, we actually lost $48½ billion. This was the sixth loss in a year. For every single year they were simply running the country at a loss. What that 'running the country at a loss' means is we have had to borrow the money to cover the loss. There is no problem borrowing money—we are a wealthy country and we can borrow that money. But what it creates is an obligation to pay the interest.


Because the country has been running at a loss for six years, the obligation we have to pay that interest is now $13.5 billion every year. That is just the interest. It is not paying one cent of the principal. It is over $1 billion every single month we as the Commonwealth government now have to find. We have to take that money and pay about 70 per cent of it overseas—out of the country—to pay the debt on the six years of loss. That is why bills like this are so important. 


If we are going to dig ourselves out of the hole that the previous Labor government got us into, if we are going to afford the things we need to do in the future—things such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and everyone in this parliament talks about how wonderful it is but no one has thought about how we will pay for it all, in full—we need to encourage the entrepreneurs of this nation. We need to encourage them to get out there and take those risks, to expand and to experiment. We want them to get out there and have a crack at those export markets. 


That is exactly what this bill does. It opens up the Export Financial Insurance Corporation to enable it to loan for both capital and non-capital goods. Although it is only a small step, it is part of a suite of measures we are making to provide that hopeful and rewarding opportunity to the business people of Australia. They are the ones who create the wealth of this nation and that is what enables us to provide all those valuable social programs. I commend this bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:57):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this export finance and insurance corporation bill, as I believe it will provide benefits to small and medium businesses right around Australia. Members will be aware of my passion for micro and small business. Before entering parliament I ran my own small business for 10 years, so I understand the challenges that small-business owners face. Since entering parliament I have spent a great deal of my time talking to the small-business operators in my electorate of Canberra and advocating for their needs and interests.


Small businesses are the engine room of our economy and we need to develop the policy environment for them to thrive. Small businesses employ more than five million Australians and contribute almost 50 per cent of private-sector employment. That is why I am particularly pleased with the number of amendments that are in this bill on that front. By broadening Efic's ability to lend in all-goods export transactions, not only capital-goods transactions, there is the potential to see this country's export potential grow significantly.


The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is a statutory body that offers trade finance and insurance services to support Australian exporters. The export credit agency operates on a commercial basis and partners with businesses and banks to provide finances to SMEs that are exporters, companies in an export supply chain, companies looking to expand their business overseas and companies operating in emerging and frontier markets.


Efic provides financial services to companies that have been unable to secure adequate finance from the private sector. It fills a gap in the market. It provides SMEs with an opportunity, a chance that conservative Australian banks just cannot do. It will often take a risk on an SME where a bank would not. This kind of risk is crucial in getting SMEs off the ground and ultimately helps lead to innovation in this country.


Labor's record with the Export Finance Insurance Corporation goes back to its establishment. In 1991, the Hawke Labor government passed the original Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill to re-establish the Efic known as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This original bill established the Efic as an independent statutory corporation separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. It is pleasing to see that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation still operates today under the minister's statement of expectations issued by Labor's former minister for trade, Dr Craig Emerson.


There are a number of amendments in this act which will help Australian businesses flourish and I support them wholeheartedly. This bill gives Efic the ability to lend in all goods export transactions not only capital goods transactions, as I said before. This will expand Efic's capacity to support Australian businesses, particularly SMEs, as the vast majority of Australian exporters are not capital goods. To implement this measure, it requires deleting the word 'capital' from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic act. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only five per cent of Australian exports are actually capital goods yet under the current Efic Act, Efic can lend directly in support of capital goods but not all goods. This means Efic cannot lend for exports for many of the products for which Australia is famous—that is, goods like food and wine. It can, however, support the export of cows but not milk. From a business point of view, this just does not make sense. As I mentioned earlier, allowing Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exports significantly improves Australia's export potential. This is particularly good for small business, particularly good for jobs and particularly good for Australia.


The second substantial amendment effected by this bill is the widening of the competitive neutrality provisions as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Currently such provisions only apply to short-term insurance contracts. This is outdated as Efic now lists only medium-sized insurance as a product. In its 2012 inquiry report, the Productivity Commission recommended that Efic should pay a tax equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee in order to ensure that the Efic's activity on the commercial account complies with competitive neutrality arrangements. This bill implements this recommendation.


Labor welcomes measures that make it easier for Australian businesses to export their goods internationally and that is why we welcome this bill. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trade opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future and this bill is consistent with that objective.


I want to touch briefly on my experience of Efic. In my former life I worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a diplomat. I worked on the Middle East desk couple of years. During that time, I worked on Iran and was involved in the normalisation of the relationship with Iran. I commend Tim Fischer, who actually drove the change to that policy. It was a significant change to our policy. We had diplomatic relationships with Iran and had not severed those after 1980, but the relationship was not terribly strong. There had been no exchanges, no business trips, no ministerial visits.


Tim Fischer saw the opportunities that Iran offered, particularly for sugar exporters and for a range of other resources in addition to just services and products. I was involved first up in the normalisation of the relationship and, secondly, in the first ministerial visit to Iran in 10 years. Tim Fischer was the minister at the time and led a business delegation to Tehran. As I said, there was a broad range of people that were involved in that delegation. There were people from BHP, there were people from CSR Sugar. We had people who wanted to export tiles into Iran and people who were looking at exporting gems into Iran. A very broad range of potential exporters took part in that delegation. It was a historic delegation. It was a significant delegation and Efic was there alongside these potential exporters to identify potential opportunities for them to engage in trade with Iran.


The beauty about Efic, too, was the fact that because they understand government and work closely with them they were involved in the discussion that I was also involved in, which was led by BHP, where we engaged in a negotiation on a banking and finance agreement with Iran. They were involved in those discussions. They took about two days to get going and to finalise. Again, it was a major outcome of that visit—not just the symbolic gesture that was shown by actually having a minister there for the first time in 10 years but also the fact that we had this significant business delegation and produced a range of agreements, most importantly, this banking and finance agreement, which in a way provided the framework for exporters to engage in trade and export opportunities with Iran for the future. 


In terms of the relationship with Iran, the environment was very different from what it is today. At that stage Khatami had just been elected and Iran was looking to engage in greater liberalisation and was also opening up to the world. There are gestures being shown at the moment that they are also keen to engage more openly with the rest of the world and, in a way, liberalise. But at that stage there was this real sense of energy and momentum for change and a real will for change in that country. It was completely appropriate for the then minister, Tim Fischer, to have a vision for what the relationship could be with Iran at that stage, to engage in that ministerial visit, to take that business delegation to Iran and to engage in negotiating those agreements. It was a very different environment to what we see at the moment, but I do once again applaud the former minister for actually having the vision for that relationship and realising it through that ministerial visit.


Labor especially welcomes measures that benefit small businesses and I personally welcome these measures. As I said to you before, prior to this life I was a diplomat and then after that I had my own small business for 10 years, which was a wonderful experience. I am always looking for mechanisms to improve opportunities for small business and particularly to provide the right policy settings for businesses, both micro and small and medium, to thrive. 


I want to take this opportunity to sing the praises of a number of Canberra businesses which have achieved great things on the export front. In October the ACT Chief Minister held her export awards and a number of businesses won those awards. Some of them you know. Aspen Medical—we all know of Aspen Medical—have just won the Ebola contract. That business went from being a kitchen table business 10 to 12 years ago to being an absolute multinational, international civilian and military outfit that is winning awards all over Australia and contracts all over the world. They are a class outfit. Glenn Keys and his team do an extraordinary job. They are based in my electorate here in Canberra and, as I said, they are exporting to the world. Every time I see Glenn he has another clutch of awards under his arm that he has won. He is an extraordinary individual with a great vision and he is always a great contributor to the Canberra community. So it is not surprising that, once again, Aspen Medical won the health and biotechnology award.


I want to sing the praises of another company—that is, Canberra-based technology company Seeing Machines. They were crowned ACT Exporter of the Year. Again, this is an extraordinary company. In Canberra we have these very specialised businesses that usually provide services, but they have a real cutting edge and they really do us proud. Seeing Machines develops state-of-the-art fatigue and distraction monitoring technology. They developed the driver safety system, which is already being used by mining, commercial road transport and automotive industries worldwide. The company was founded in 1999. It now has 95 employees across Canberra, San Francisco, Arizona and Tuscany, with export sales accounting for 53 per cent of its revenue. It was recognised as Exporter of the Year just a month after the company announced a collaboration deal with Samsung that aims to bring face- and eye-tracking technology to the consumer electronics market.


I also want to make mention of another company, Intelledox, who have also done some great work in terms of linking up with South Asia and also exporting to Singapore. They are an outfit that recently made a significant donation to the ANU. They digitalise processes through mobile-ready smart web forms. They are involved in document automation, data transformation and business integration. They are essentially a data management outfit that have done some great work here in Canberra in the Public Service and right across Australia, and now they are exporting to Singapore. They were founded in 1992 and they are headquartered here and have offices in Singapore, New York, London and Toronto, as well as global partners throughout the world. They have been awarded Telstra ACT Business of the Year, they were listed on Anthill Magazine's 2013 Smart 100 list and they were named a BRW Fast 100 company in 2010 and 2011. Again, they are another class outfit from Canberra that is exporting to the world with particularly creative and innovative solutions.


In closing, I want to touch on Labor's record on small business, because it is a very good one and it is a very proud one. We supported and established a range of programs to assist small businesses to expand their trade and export opportunities. The Export Market Development Grants scheme is a terrific example of this. The scheme provides assistance to aspiring and current exporters, and the grants are a key measure in supporting Australia's small and medium-sized business who want to develop export markets. As I said, as a former small business owner myself, I know that deciding to export involves a great deal of risk—it is a real leap of faith. The research, promotion and travel required to identify the markets and build the relationships to begin exporting is incredibly costly. This scheme reimburses a significant amount of eligible export promotion expenses.


Labor, as we know, also increased the small business instant asset write-off threshold from $1,000 to $6,500. In our 2012 budget, we announced that we would provide tax relief for business by allowing them to carry back tax losses of up to $1 million so they could receive a refund against tax already paid. And it was Labor that commissioned the first Small Business Commissioner in this country. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trading opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future, and this bill is consistent with that objective.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:13):  It has been pleasing to hear the member for Hughes initially, and just then my good colleague the member for Canberra, talk about the important role that Efic plays and the gap in the market that it fills. This is where government certainly does have a role. Even more pleasing to hear was the number of companies that the member for Canberra referred to that are exporting their goods and services around the world—in particular, a couple of very successful medical companies. This is where this country needs to go with greater exports and more companies creating more employment, significantly, for our country. It is these exporters that are taking advantage of some of the fastest growing markets around the world. It is so important that we help them flourish and encourage them along their journey. Sometimes their journey can be tough, and that is where a body like Efic comes into play and has an important role. From my own experiences working in trade and investment overseas in Europe, when we were trying to assist some SMEs to get into new markets they did need some assistance from specialists in the field—not that I was the only specialist. There were others, whether it be Austrade or other Australian businessmen already located there, who were able to pass on their expertise and advice to help them enter those markets. Often it is the SMEs too, and this is where Efic really has a significant role to play where the banks are not willing to finance some of their operations. SMEs are the engine room of our economy. They are so important to growing our markets and taking advantage of the opportunities overseas. In terms of those opportunities overseas, I will speak a bit later about the free trade agreements.


A classic in terms of SMEs is the South Australian economy, where around 98 per cent of all enterprises operating are SMEs, and around 90 per cent of those employ fewer than 19 people. When you think about it, these are real microbusinesses, but they are so important in the fabric of our economy. On the weekend I was promoting the Shop Small campaign, which I think is a good initiative. I went around to a few local businesses in Torrensville—the Master of Bread bakery, who were very hospitable and offered some of their fine products, as well as the Little Canton restaurant. At both places the operators are very passionate, dedicated businesspeople who are having a real crack and hoping to make a go. The Little Canton restaurant has been there for a number of years.


In terms of the hard work required, these businesses take risks. They put their houses on the line. We as a government—and all governments for that matter, whether they be state or federal—need to do what we can to assist them to create the best environment. That is why such a measure is important. It broadens the scope for a body like Efic to provide financing. As we have heard before in this place, it reduces regulation and red tape—over $2 billion of savings—which, combined with the repeal of the carbon tax, is giving small businesses a great start to get on and do what they do best.


This is a common-sense reform to broaden the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's capacity—we have backed this, and I was pleased to hear that Labor are also supporting it in terms of the merits of the bill—because it prioritises an area that can be improved to help the export potential of SMEs, and it allows Efic to focus on helping small and medium-sized Australian companies to seize the opportunities. The main area where it does this is through lending directly to exporters of non-capital goods. The Minister for Small Business, the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Agriculture—the three combined—must be congratulated for driving some of these changes through.


Prior to these changes, Efic could only lend directly for the export of capital goods that are used in the production of other goods and not an end product. What do we mean by this? As some of my colleagues have pointed out, a classic anomaly is in the area of dairy, which is a significantly growing area for the Australian agricultural sector. We have seen how dairy has been such a boon for the New Zealand economy, with it quadrupling in recent years. This change in the legislation means that Efic can apply both to cows and to milk. This goes broader than just that one example, obviously. This restriction had applied to all other goods, including pharmaceuticals, food and fibre, medical products and consumer goods such as wine.


In these instances Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank, which will then do the actual lending. It was clear that there was a need to extend the ability of Efic to lend to enterprises that export non-capital goods and not confine them to just a credit guarantee, which at the end of the day equated to extra costs. Again I say that this is a common-sense reform that directly benefits the Australian economy and SMEs.


In terms of the free trade agreements, the recent Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement means that beef exporters will no longer have to pay $70 for a certificate of origin for each shipment. It also means that 97 per cent of our exports to Japan get preferential or duty-free access. These are just a couple of examples. When combined with what we are doing with China and South Korea, there are significant opportunities for our exporters and our SMEs to take advantage of some great foundations and some areas of growth in the economy that can help grow prosperity and, importantly, jobs.


I have heard many stories in my electorate where businesses have found it increasingly difficult to do business. We are making it easier. We are fostering a better environment and letting business get on with what they do best. I commend this bill to the House.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-11-26,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:19):  I also rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I agree with what the member for Hindmarsh said about the importance of Efic to our economy and to our businesses. I want to commend the member for Canberra for a characteristically interesting speech about her time working in small business and also working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.


The original Efic bill was a proud legacy of the Hawke government in 1991. In that bill, they did build on the corporation which is an independent statutory corporation that is separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters. Its purpose is to assist Australian companies, as the member for Hindmarsh said, and enable them to win business, to grow internationally and to achieve export success.


As our export credit agency, the corporation operates on a commercial basis and partners with banks to provide financial solutions for businesses that are exporters, Australian companies with export supply chain and Australian companies operating in emerging and frontier markets. They are all very important aspirations. In performing that role, as others have said when they spoke before me, it does give our companies the leg up that some need in the financial world in order to compete. That is particularly in our own region of Asia.


The reason that Labor is supporting the bill before the parliament today is because there are changes that can be made to make sure that Efic keeps up with changes in the composition of our exports and other changes. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that only five per cent of our exports right now are capital goods. Members would be aware that Efic, as it stands, can only directly assist capital exporters. That does exclude 95 per cent of our exporters, who are people who want to do business in Asia and beyond and who want to export things like wine and products that are not necessarily the capital goods—so that 95 per cent of our export composition.


We do need to make sure that our trade arrangements—Efic and also our broader trade arrangements—keep up with the changes in our economy and the changes in the global economy. This bill certainly does that. The other problem with Efic as it stands that the bill seeks to rectify is that it does lock out from direct assistance a lot of the small and medium enterprises that we do want to be encouraging in our economy. It is important this bill fixes that problem up.


As the member for Canberra mentioned, on this side of the House we do have are proud record of supporting small business. We had in government things like a variety of tax concessions for the two million small businesses, who employ something like five million Australians; we had the tax-loss carry back; we had the instant asset write-off and we had the special depreciation rules for motor vehicles. Unfortunately, these have been scrapped by those opposite. That is an unfortunate development for small businesses in particular. We do want those small businesses and medium businesses to be able to access Efic finance, which is what this bill is all about today.


In terms of the bill itself, it will create amendments to that original Efic act from the Hawke government in 1991. It will give Efic the ability to lend, as I said, in all goods export transactions, not just capital goods transactions. In that way, the most substantial change that the amendment to the act makes is to remove capital from capital goods and the definition of eligible export transactions and make all the consequential amendments that flow from that. It allows direct lending to those exporters of goods, not just capital goods.


Other speakers have mentioned that as it stands right now if you are excluded from direct Efic assistance on the basis that you are a goods exporter and not a capital goods exporter, you previously or until now had to go through all sorts of rigmarole to tee up guarantees and all sorts of arrangements in order to access some assistance. That would be a burden for SMEs in our economy. It is important that they are now eligible for direct assistance after the passage of this bill. As I said before, that brings those other 95 per cent of exporters into the net of people who can be assisted by Efic.


We support the changes. We did have some more ambitious changes on the table when the government changed. Those have now lapsed unfortunately. We did have slightly higher horizons for changes to Efic but in the absence of those, which have lapsed, disappointingly, we do support the changes brought forward by the government for a lot of the reasons that the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Canberra mentioned earlier. In the absence of those three tax concession measures that were dumped by the current government but that existed under the previous government, we are looking for any way we can to help small- and medium-size businesses compete, particularly in our export markets.


So what we hope to see as a consequence of the passage of this bill is more businesses benefiting from the good work that Efic does. We want to see more small- and medium-sized enterprises prosper from that good work and we want to make sure that Australian businesses, not just big businesses and not just exporters of capital goods but all of Australian businesses, can benefit from Efic we want to see them eligible, we want to see them competing and we want to see them succeeding.

"Hutchinson, Eric, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (11:26):  I join the member for Rankin and in acknowledging that I too enjoyed the member for Canberra's contribution to this debate on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and her experience that she has had in this area of trade and, indeed, in small businesses. To be brutally honest, to look at the track record of the previous government in terms of small business, it is rather disingenuous when you consider that during six years they had five ministers for small business, start-ups of small businesses in Australia fell through the floor and small business failures under the previous administration increased enormously. Why? Because the burden and the costs on small businesses were going up. The regulatory burden was going up. Taxes were going up. The things that we said when we came to government were indeed about trying to reduce that regulatory burden, trying to reduce the cost of particularly taxes. We have removed the carbon tax, which, most small business in this country were simply unable to pass on. They were not considered as export exposed industries and this hurt enormously.


I note the comments in respect of this Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 before the House, particularly around the notion of competitive neutrality. It is indeed important because this is a government participating in a space where there is other competition. But it has been acknowledged on both sides that it is very worthwhile work that work Efic does. I have had experience of this myself. It is important that that competitive neutrality is indeed adhered to. I acknowledge that part of the changes that are being moved.


Australia is indeed an exporting nation and $300 billion worth of goods were exported out of this country. We should be doing as a government everything we can to help businesses to help themselves. That is indeed what these amendments are intended to do. They are designed to suit support small businesses, medium enterprises and larger businesses as well to do what they do best—that is, get on with business, create markets, explore markets and open markets. Sometimes they need some assistance in funding those opportunities or, as has been mentioned, getting insurance with certain customers, which of course comes at a cost.


I think of my experiences in a previous life within the wool textile industry. I worked for an exporting business in Melbourne. Efic enabled businesses. We had internal provisions around who and who we could not deal with. Without being able to access Efic insurance cover, we would not have been able to do business with many of the customers that were indeed good customers. That was a cost of doing business. It was the cost of risk. But once that Efic insurance cover is approved and once that Efic finance facility is in place it is, indeed, bankable. It is something that you can take to your bank and use as collateral, which then allows you to expand your business. Certainly within the wool-exporting business in this country, access to capital is indeed an enormous challenge from time to time. As has been mentioned, it just simply did not make sense that in this country the five per cent of goods that were eligible for finance under the Efic scheme were capital goods and 95 per cent were something other than capital goods. 


The changes made within this bill to reflect the reality of the situation will benefit us enormously. As the member for Canberra mentioned, we could previously get cover for cows but not milk. It does not make any sense at all. These are practical changes that we have seen within this bill. I think of some of the exporters in my home state and indeed in my electorate, meat exporters in the form of JBS Australia, which are based in Longford. I think of the 2013 Regional Exporter of the Year, Tasmanian Quality Meats, which are based in Cressy, also within my electorate. They are currently growing that business enormously. As I said, they were the Australian Regional Exporter of the Year. They particularly have a focus at the moment on the Middle East but I know they have plans, particularly off the back of some of the free trade agreements that we have been able to secure as government since coming to power in 2013. There are opportunities that exist for their business to grow, with the appropriate accreditation and the like, but to grow the opportunities that present in places such as China are, indeed, enormous. 


I think also of the seafood exporters, the well-known salmon producers that, as I say, are very much part of the Tasmanian brand. Huon Aquaculture; Tassal and Petuna Seafoods all have operations of some kind or another within my electorate. I think of some of the more innovative seafood businesses, such as Seafoods Tasmania, in dealing with what is a consequence of international trade in terms of sea urchins that are now, unfortunately, very prevalent off the east coast of Tasmania. There have been numerous efforts to find ways of dealing with this invasive species, all of which have failed. It has now turned into a commercial opportunity. The work that Seafoods Tasmania do at Goshen, a small town just north of St Helens in my electorate, involves harvesting those sea urchins. Those of you who enjoy sushi will know this as izumi if you are in Japan. The work that they are doing there to turn that into an export product, both into China, Hong Kong, Singapore and also Japan is tremendous.


Last year one of the recipients of support from Efic was a Tasmania-based shipbuilding company, Incat. They make outstanding catamarans that sail all around the world. They receive some Efic support to fund a liquid natural gas powered ferry, the first in the world. This is outstanding work. Another business in the north-west of the state, Specialised Vehicle Solutions, have also received support from Efic in the past 12 months. 


Exporting is not an easy business. I go back to my former life within the wool industry. Many of the retail businesses around get paid in cash and that is wonderful. But very rarely in the business I was involved in did you ever see cash. It was done on terms; it would be for 30 days if you were really, really lucky. More often than not, it was done on 90 day terms. I remember back in the late eighties, and some might say the heady days of the wool industry, it was a common practice to have terms when doing business in the Soviet Union—as it was at the time—of 180 days, and in some cases 360 days. The notion of cash and therefore the capacity to be able to fund exports and business, is indeed a challenge—particularly, for smaller businesses that are growing and finding their way. There is no question that this is a real challenge for many of them.


These are businesses indeed. I note the member for Hughes's contribution in this debate. These people are indeed the wealth creators of our nation, and we should be doing everything we can to support them. It is through the work that they do, the people they employ and the taxes they ultimately pay that allows this nation is able to—if we manage the books properly—pay for the services that the people of Australia rightly expect their government to provide. It is not a magic pudding though and therefore governments should—like households and small businesses—learn to live within their means. 


This is unfortunately and tragically the great failure of the six years that we had under the previous Labor government. They simply could not live within their means. This is the legacy that we have inherited; this is the challenge that we are dealing with. Yes, some of the decisions that we have been asked to make have been difficult decisions—nobody disputes that for one second—but they are challenges that we are up for. They are challenges that the people of Australia truly expect us to get on with. This is our lot in life.


I welcome these changes. An additional $200 million of capital is, indeed, timely. Taking a look at the role of Efic, I remind all who may take an interest in this space, it is competing in an area where there are other providers of these services; we should always remember that. The competitive neutrality is acknowledged within the changes in this bill. We should always be mindful—and that process should be reviewed from time to time—that we are not getting into a space where the private sector and others can provide these services appropriately. But, as it stands at the moment, we fully support the work that Efic does and the roles that they play to support, capitalise, fund and provide opportunities for small, medium and large businesses in this country selling Australian produce around the world.


The changes around increasing this to include non-capital goods is common sense. Our job is to also communicate that to businesses that are looking to expand their operations. Part of the role that we play as parliamentarians is to make sure that businesses that are looking to grow their business, create more jobs and export products out of this country are aware of the opportunities that they have under the Efic Corporation. Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in this debate.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:39):  I rise today to speak on the coalition government's continued commitment to small and medium businesses in Australia, as evidenced by the intent of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. While this coalition government continues to make great progress in the freeing up of markets under our trade agreement framework, which has seen many new markets opened up for Australian businesses, there still needs to be more in the way of support for business to truly expand internationally.


This is the role of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic. They have been doing a good job of helping exporters to secure finance, insurance, risk assessments and the advice that they need. However, direct lending has only been available to those exporters who compete in the capital goods markets. To understand why this is such a problem, we need to define what is a capital good. The Oxford English Dictionary defines capital goods as 'goods that are used in producing other goods, rather than being bought by consumers'. That is straightforward enough but very limiting, as Australia does not produce many capital goods. This can create some confusion. As colleagues have said before me, if a cow is exported to be a producer of milk, but not meat, it can be considered a capital good. However, cattle exported for meat are considered a consumer good. That is why the amendments proposed in this bill are so important for businesses who deal in consumer goods, those goods bought by the end consumer, not by producers. 


Let us consider an example. If Poppy's Chocolate, based in the member for Forde's electorate, were to export machinery for making chocolate to Japan, they would be able to access direct funding for this venture. However, if they wanted to sell their primary product—that is, the eating chocolate—to Japan, they would not qualify for direct funding from Efic. While I am all for businesses diversifying and innovating, this should not be at the cost of their primary business. Why should we not support those businesses selling consumer goods to expand their operations to take advantage of the many new trade agreements negotiated by the coalition government? Australia produces some fine consumer goods, and the rest of the world clamours for them in certain markets. Not that many years ago, there was in fact a Vegemite shortage in Japan. Tim Tams gained a cult following in the USA following the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Asia has an insatiable appetite for ice cream that Australian producers could help fill if they could just get their goods into those markets. 


On this side of the House, we understand that business occasionally needs a helping hand in order to expand. I was disappointed that the member for Rankin claimed that Labor had 'higher horizons' for Efic and wanted to help Efic, yet, when the member for Rankin was part of the then Labor Treasurer's team, they produced a shameful record with Efic. Labor gutted Efic, ripping $200 million of equity out of Efic as a one-off special dividend in the 2012 budget when they were indulging in a desperate search for their delusional surplus, scratching down the back of the couch looking for the loose change to try to prop up the surplus they claimed several times but never delivered. In its 2013 annual report, Efic noted that this caused 'material breaches' of prudential guidelines.


The coalition has reversed that raid on Efic's capital base, restoring $200 million of new equity capital to Efic in the 2014 budget. Once again, the coalition are demonstrating our genuine support for small business and small business exporters. Larger businesses mean more employees, which means fewer people out of work and a broader tax base—or, to put it simply for those opposite: less outgoings and more incomings for the government to pay for health, education, roads and infrastructure without needing to continually increase the limit on the nation's credit card. 


The coalition government understand how business works. We do not see business as a milch cow, an unlimited supply of money to be taxed. We understand the drive, ambition and dedication it takes to put your house on the line to fund your dream. We appreciate that business owners are usually the last ones paid if there is anything left over after they have paid their employees and their creditors. So we are offering them a hand up, with a simple change to the goods that qualify for direct funding from Efic. 


I know that Labor would prefer we did not give business a helping hand because that is not what they do. Rather than support businesses to build a stronger economy, they would tax them to the point of breaking. But the coalition is a government that fosters trade and supports local companies to take advantage of the opportunities the many new and upcoming trade agreements will bring to Australian businesses. The coalition government is here to help. With this change, thousands of small and medium enterprises will be able to take on the world. Surely, that is a goal worth pursuing. 


Once again, the people of Australia are faced with a stark contrast: a coalition that fosters business and creates jobs and growth or the antithesis of our beliefs, the 'tear business down' mentality of Labor. This bill makes a small but very meaningful change to the operation of Efic, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Rick, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (11:44):  I speak today in support of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill will amend the Efic Act to lift the restrictions on direct lending to allow Efic to provide loans to exporters of both capital and non-capital goods. It is unambiguously a good bill for small business. 


Previously, we heard the member for Canberra waxing lyrically about Labor's proud record on small business and talking up its record on the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. In fact, Labor gutted the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It took $25 million of funding out of that scheme, and the coalition has delivered on its election promise to put $50 million back into that scheme. 


In terms of small business, Labor also presided over 500 job losses in the small to medium enterprise sector. It introduced a huge number of small business-unfriendly acts such as expanding the reach of the so-called unfair dismissal laws. It also introduced the carbon tax, which had a deleterious impact across a whole range of small and medium exporters. 


But I go back to the bill. Currently, the Efic Act only allows for the lending of money to support the export of capital goods. Capital goods are defined as goods which are used to produce other goods, rather than an end product. They include machinery and goods used to manufacture end products. Capital goods currently make up only five per cent of Australia's exports, and some suggest that capital goods producers may be better placed to fund their own export endeavours than those seeking to export non-capital goods. Non-capital goods, on the other hand, are end products or consumer goods. 


Currently, when an exporter requires funds for the export of non-capital goods, Efic cannot lend to them directly but can facilitate a loan by providing a guarantee to the exporter's bank. This often results in duplication of paperwork, multiple or increased fees and extended loan-processing times. Small- to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are the main producers of non-capital goods and thus bear the brunt of these inefficiencies and extra costs. 


Small to medium enterprises, by definition, are businesses employing less than100 people or with a turnover of less than $100 million. They make up the majority of the enterprises in my electorate of O'Connor. This bill, when passed, will permit Efic to lend directly to small to medium enterprises and will allow SMEs to capitalise on global trade opportunities. For the primary producers of my electorate of O'Connor, these legislative changes will have a significant impact. 


Non-capital, or consumer goods, are largely the realm of rural and regional areas. These include beef, sheep meat, livestock, fibre, horticulture, wine, grains, flour, milk and dairy produce. These primary producers are usually SMEs who are often most hampered in their efforts to secure export finance through conventional lenders like the banks. 


Banks are traditionally dependent upon security, which is often lacking in export contracts, particularly for first-time exporters or for those exporting to emerging markets. Many of my constituents relay stories of waiting times of over a year to have bank finance approved or, worse still, to have their finance knocked back. Many have received sound and helpful advice from Efic and welcome the opportunity these amendments will afford them to engage directly with Efic for the financial support of their export endeavours. This amendment bill, when passed, will enable Efic to lend for the other 95 per cent of exported goods and therefore improve SME export potential and advance regional and rural economies. 


In my electorate, there are many SMEs kicking goals in export markets, and I am proud to announce that one of this year's big winners in the recent Western Australian Industry and Export Awards came from the horticultural food bowl of my electorate, Manjimup. I congratulate the Truffle & Wine Company on being awarded both the Premier's Award for Excellence and the Regional Exporter of the Year Award. They produce over five tonnes of premium Tuber melanosporum, or black winter truffles, of which over 95 per cent are exported. They are keenly sought after by top chefs and Michelin-starred restaurants worldwide. The Truffle & Wine Company is the single largest producer of black winter truffles in the world and benefits from being able to supply counterseasonal produce to the lucrative and growing European and Asian markets. 


I take this opportunity to thank Cassandra McCredden and Stuart Hutchinson for their hospitality on my recent visit to their Manjimup truffiere and I wish the team at the Truffle & Wine Company every success in the coming 52nd Australian Export Awards on 27th November.


I would like to further acknowledge O'Connor's burgeoning truffle industry with the Manjimup area alone having over 30 truffieres producing over 80 per cent of Australia's truffles. Truffle Producers of Western Australia's Chairman, Mark Horwood, maintains our WA product is lauded in Europe but the industry has so far been unable to crack the Chinese market. Mr Horwood believes that the recent China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will give the Australian produce the seal of approval that Chinese buyers need and anticipates that truffle production will treble in the next five years.


Another former winner of the WA export industry award for agribusiness is Ferngrove Vineyards in the Frankland River winegrowing region of my electorate. Ferngrove is a large exporter of premium wines to China and I do not doubt their business will also be further enhanced by last week's signing of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


Local fertiliser manufacturers Australian Mineral Fertilisers, AMF, recently shared with me their story of the financial barriers they faced when their small regional manufacturing plant tried to break into the lucrative export market. AMF are an innovative SME in the Great Southern region of WA. They produce high-performance, non-toxic fertilisers through the blending of essential minerals and specially coated soil microbes to create powerful 'living' fertilisers for both the domestic and export markets. AMF ultimately secured bank finance through a long and frustrating process, complicated by the low value of their landholding in Tenterden as security and the uncertainty of the emerging markets that they sought to export into; yet their product is non-toxic, is certified organic and fetches a premium in an increasingly environmentally conscious consumer market. Surely, these are the sorts of producers we should be supporting. CEO and ex-local farmer Rob Edkins firmly believes in regional enterprise and seeks to continue to provide his small regional community with sustainable employment opportunities through expanding the export aspect of his Tenterden based business.


Last month, I was joined by the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Bruce Billson, on a tour of Kalgoorlie drilling component manufacturer Harlsan Industries. Brothers and co-owners Harley and Dean Hollier received advice from Efic which assisted them in securing independent funding for the export of their RC drilling equipment. Together, they welcome any legislative changes that would simplify the funding of their exports into the developing markets of Africa, South America, Mongolia and South-East Asia.


Many other SMEs in my electorate have expressed the opinion that there appears to be considerable risk aversion and bias against lending by traditional institutions and that establishing markets in developing countries is not secure enough for most banks. Efic's 'capability based' approach supports loans based on an exporter's ability to meet their contract, rather than the traditional bank approach to lending to SMEs with the most tangible security. It therefore currently supports enterprises that can demonstrate the best business practice in the export of their capital goods. Expanding this approach to the producers of non-capital goods will only enhance the potential of SMEs to export our premium primary produce to the world.


Wellard Rural Exports is one of the world's leading livestock exporters and transports a large proportion of the cattle and sheep originating from my electorate to distant markets.

Mr WILSON:
  Recently, Efic assisted Wellard to facilitate the export of 2,000 quality dairy cattle to Sri Lanka as part of their commitment to help establish a 22,500-head high-production dairy herd in that country. To fulfil the initial contract, Wellard was required to arrange finance for the buyer. Sri Lanka was still dealing with the aftermath of civil war and found themselves with limited access to foreign capital. Given the general unwillingness of the private sector to fund exports into some emerging frontier markets, Efic stepped in to provide a guarantee to an international bank to provide a loan or buyer finance to the Sri Lankan government. The success of this first contract has led Wellard to winning more substantial contracts in Sri Lanka. Wellard similarly maintain, and I quote from a recent personal communication:


Efic has been a very good supporter of the development of the live export industry … when developing the beef breeder and dairy heifer market in China.


Efic also provided a credit facility to an Eastern European cattle importer to import Australian beef breeding cattle.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if I may digress for a moment to recount my own personal experience with Efic, as a young farmer I had a considerable amount of income exposed to an Iraqi wheat debt incurred from the sale of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board to Iraq on credit terms over the period 1988-90. Efic agreed to insure between 70 and 80 per cent of any payment default on these wheat exports to Iraq, with the Australian Wheat Board bearing the remaining exposure. Following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent imposition of United Nations economic sanctions, Iraq defaulted on payments. Efic subsequently paid credit insurance claims. After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, the international community decided to support Iraq's economic recovery. ln November 2004, the Paris Club of creditors agreed to provide Iraq with 80 per cent debt forgiveness. The remaining debt stock is scheduled to be repaid over the 17 years from 2011. To date, Iraq has paid all principal and interest instalments in full and on time. Efic receives these repayments from Iraq semi-annually, and passes the wheat growers' portion to Agrium Asia Pacific, or APPI, which now owns the Australian Wheat Board's assets. APPI then distributes the proceeds to the Australian farmers. Overall, wheat farmers are likely to recover about 84 per cent of the original contract value, comprising the Efic claim payment of around 80 per cent and the Paris Club recovery of 20 per cent of the remaining uninsured exposure. 


Efic is managing this process with Iraq to ensure that Australian wheat farmers like me will receive their entitled share of repayments. I make note that Efic no longer provides short-term trade credit insurance, having sold this aspect of the business to the private sector in 2003. I thank the House for indulging me in recounting my personal story and use it to reiterate that Efic has already played an important role in maximising Australia's trade potential.


The changes proposed in this amendment bill will expand upon and enhance the ability of Efic to ensure that no Australian enterprise whether they produce a capital product, such as a piece of mining or manufacturing equipment, or a non-capital good, such as O'Connor's renowned primary produce, will be denied the opportunity to grow their business overseas simply because they are unable to access finance. These new direct lending arrangements will remove the need for exporters of non-capital goods to obtain a guarantee from Efic before they can secure funds from a bank. This doubled the due diligence processing time and required duplication of documentation and considerable additional legal fees. This will become a real benefit to all exporters by reducing the time and paperwork required to access Efic support. This will ensure that Efic is able to provide products and services that will match the evolving needs of modern businesses.


This bill forms an integral part of Minister Robb's refocus on providing financial service to SMEs seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities, so I give today's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 my unreserved support.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (12:11):  I rise to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and thank the House for this opportunity. The bill will create amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 and by doing so will vastly improve the commercial opportunities of the many Australian export businesses right around the country. Today's bill is another piece of important legislation that has been analysed, reviewed and amended by this side of government. This legislation is crucial and an ongoing part of the coalition's plan to revive Australian's small- to medium-size enterprises, which employ the largest number of employees and make up the bulk of our economy.


The opportunity to speak on this bill today has coincided perfectly with the freshly inked trade agreements which have concluded with China, Korea and Japan. Existing tariffs on many popular exports such as agriculture, horticulture and seafood will phase out in the next few years, meaning billions of dollars can be added to our economy. In light of this historic agreement we must not let existing legislation hinder business opportunities and instead work in combination to achieve the optimum result for our export enterprises. Both the bill and the respective trade agreements will allow prospects of export trading with these countries to flourish. The timing could not have been better, and I am certain that many export businesses, from the traditional agriculture sector to retail goods, are breathing a sigh of relief knowing their future is viable under the coalition.


Today's bill enhances the capacity of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to back small- and medium-size businesses seeking to capitalise on opportunities for global trade. As our nation and our government supports and encourages entrepreneurs, we must do all that we can to ensure opportunities that are presented to businesses can be seized and accomplished without unnecessary obstacles.


Globalised and increasingly integrated trading means businesses often look beyond state borders to seek and relish new commercial opportunities. This could be a combination offering a niche product with domestic expertise that is best suited to other markets or a multinational cooperative with other communities that can benefit from our products or services. Whatever the reason may be, this government fully stands behind the plethora of aspiring entrepreneurs and businesses that want to create and compete. Furthermore, whenever prospects arise for such businesses to export their goods and services, our policies should allow for employment and growth opportunities, as these flow directly back into the Australian economy.


We are a small nation, but the goods and services that we provide are second to none, and these are not just limited to the resources sector. Australia's wide range of consumer goods, including pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticulture products, wine, flour, fibre and cheese, coupled with increased international exposure from trade shows and tourism, means people are becoming increasingly aware of the exceptional quality and thus demand for these items. Statistics show that within the last two financial years there was an increase from 44,000 exports of goods and services to over 45,000. Whilst the biggest contributor of exported goods is still the mining sector, general use of service exporters is on the rise. It would be a real shame for Australian businesses to lose precious commercial opportunities to export our goods due to a lack of finance, excessive red tape and bureaucracy. The coalition has always been committed to strengthening the opportunities to support our small and medium-sized businesses, and this legislation today provides a vital pathway for that. 


The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation plays a crucial role in assisting export business ventures, stepping in to provide insurance and financial backing where traditional lenders have declined assistance. Efic was established as Australia's credit agency and operates commercially, partnering with the banks to provide financial solutions to various Australian small and medium-sized exporters, and has been essential in helping exporters take advantage of potential contract opportunities that might otherwise have been impossible.


It is important not to underestimate how much Australian exporters contribute to our economy and to our GDP. Exports are worth approximately $1 out of every $5 in Australia's national income. The International Monetary Fund has previously stated in its World Economic Outlook that Australia's export volumes will continue to fuel our economy and potentially taper the negative effects of a downturn in mining investments. Since the global financial crisis, the general slump of economies and their interdependence means that we must allow policies to provide businesses the resilience to withstand change. While some industries are subject to cyclical change and subdued growth, others may experience growth and expansion. Nevertheless, none should have to suffer from unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic burden where none is needed. Enhanced efficiencies in various competitive export sectors can significantly increase sales potential and renew further investment in the Australian economy. 


It is estimated that changes to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in terms of direct lending will help overcome some of the barriers exporters face. Currently, many Australian products that we excel in, such as those previously mentioned—pharmaceuticals, beef, sheep meat, livestock, horticultural products, wine, flour, fibres and cheese—are not considered capital goods, as they are classified as consumer goods. Yet the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can only lend to exporters of capital goods. In reality, however, capital goods make up a mere five per cent of all Australian goods exported. So, whilst the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation can directly lend for exporting dairy cows, it cannot directly lend to those wishing to export milk. 


In addition, exporters of non-capital goods have traditionally had to obtain a guarantee from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation before securing funds from a bank, meaning additional time is spent on paperwork before any transaction actually occurs. In these scenarios, Efic provides a financial guarantee to the bank at the request of the exporter, and the bank then directly lends the finances. The application to Efic, as well as to the bank, means two separate lots of credit approvals, associated documentation, administration and legal fees. 


The coalition is committed to ensuring new direct lending arrangements that will remove the current restrictions in place for Australian exporters and the excessive red tape. When business compliance costs amount to approximately $1 billion per annum, this measure is vital to restoring faith to our regional, rural and general exporting sector. Mr Deputy Speaker Porter, you can imagine the potential monetary loss to the economy and to businesses. Changes to the Efic legislation will ensure regional and rural economies can thrive, with demand from emerging and developed international markets. 


Fundamentally, the measure contained in this legislation supports our election commitment to helping Australian businesses by a reduction in compliance costs. Time and again, small businesses right around Australia speak of the compliance costs which make and break their enterprises, and we owe it to them to provide the right framework that would cultivate ongoing opportunities. Enabling Efic to facilitate more financial options for Australian exporters is an important start. Expanding the scope and power of Efic is not targeted at marginalising private sector contributions; rather, it is about helping commercially viable exporters overcome financial obstacles that would otherwise prevent them from reaching overseas markets. The coalition have always been the party that stood for encouraging and nurturing current and future entrepreneurs, and we believe the change proposed today is essential to building a stronger and successful economy. 


Today's positive reforms follow on from this government's earlier enhancement for SME exporters in the 2014-15 budget, where an injection of $200 million was granted to Efic. This injection was much needed after a prior raid by the opposition. Restoration of Efic's finances means it can focus on this objective of helping and supporting Australian exporters, especially the small- to medium-sized enterprises, which make up the engine room of our economy.


Today's bill is so important to Australian export businesses because its implementation will ultimately increase Australia's reputation and competitiveness on the international stage. A recent survey of Australian export businesses by the Export Council of Australia revealed that the majority of difficulties experienced by exporters were regulatory compliance and access to finance respectively. As smaller companies rely more on international revenue from developed and emerging markets, increased or difficult bureaucracies would simply render them unfeasible. The survey further revealed that the majority of businesses, regardless of size, engage in a variety of business operations not limited to outsourcing, foreign investment, production and research and development. Australian exports amounted to over $310 billion in recent years. This demonstrates the potential of Australian businesses and, more importantly, how much more potential there is with the right policies in place. 


As global trends point to trade liberalisation, encouraging consumers, stakeholders and businesses working together, the government must ensure that export businesses have the right backing and support to enable them to reach their full potential. As I have discussed before, the rewards for businesses have a flow-on effect to our society, by employing Australians and contributing to our overall economy. With our two significant trade partnerships with Japan and China, we can now expect further growth and opportunities. 


The coalition has always been at the forefront of backing entrepreneurs. Expanding Efic will allow businesses which need capital to tap into current and emerging markets and to do so without red tape and bureaucracy. This side of government fully believes in and supports our exporters whether they are rural, regional or metropolitan based businesses. Australia's range of consumer goods and services deserve international reach for its outstanding quality and a chance to present these on an international scale should be fostered. 


Today's bill is one step to forging a supportive path for exporters and continuing to strengthen our economy. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is often the vital link between small- to medium-sized enterprises through the provision of insurance and finance. By previously having their support limited to only those with capital goods, which is a mere five per cent of all Australian exports, it has seen some of Australian businesses simply unable to gain momentum or a foothold in emerging markets. 


Today's measure will ensure that all businesses can have the opportunity to expand into international markets by streamlining financial processes and alleviating unnecessary red tape. I commend the bill to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (12:22):  I rise to sum up the government's case for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The government is firmly committed to reducing red tape. This bill achieves that goal. Amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act benefit small and medium sized businesses while at the same time reducing business compliance costs by $1 billion per annum. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, Efic, helps ensure Australian small and medium sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their business overseas. As has been stated before, the goal of this bill is to increase Efic's capacity to finance small and medium sized businesses seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities. These global trade opportunities benefit all and they are about to get a whole lot bigger with the commencement of free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and now China covering over 50 per cent of all exports from Australia. 


Efic plays an important role in supplementing the provision of credit for exporters and we are repositioning it to best support exporters into the future. Efic has played a very strong role over many decades and is the one financial body in Australia that has expertise in assessing the risk in small and developing nations in our region. It often provides important opportunities for exporters to get those opportunities when they would not get finance from other financial institutions. They fill the gap. They fill the financial gap that exists for these sorts of lending, especially to small and medium businesses.


This builds on our restoration of $200 million in capital to Efic in the recent budget, reversing Labor's shameful act of economic vandalism when it ripped out a $200 million special dividend in 2013 and caused Efic to be placed into a position where they were not able to meet the prudential requirements that they had placed on themselves in order to act in a responsible manner. This was a highly irresponsible act and it gives the lie to a number of the contributions that we have heard from those opposite during this debate.


Efic is currently only able to provide direct lending for the export of capital goods—items used in the production of other goods—but cannot directly lend for the export of goods themselves. For instance, this means that presently, as other speakers have noted, Efic can provide direct lending for the export of cows but not for the export of milk. Efic can provide direct lending for the export of bull semen, a capital good, but not a steer that is destined to be a hamburger. This is an oversight from the outset of Efic, which makes no sense and has had quite a costly consequence over time. This means that 95 per cent of goods exported from Australia are currently denied direct lending support from Efic, as only five per cent of Australian goods are capital goods.


To implement this measure in this bill we are simply removing one word—that is, 'capital'—from the definition of an eligible export transaction in the Efic Act. If you like, it is one very small step for Efic but one giant leap for our SME exporters. By allowing direct lending arrangements, exporters of non-capital goods will no longer need to go through a two-step process of first obtaining a guarantee from Efic and then finding a bank willing to lend against that guarantee. These outdated arrangements double the due diligence processing time for export credits and require two sets of documentation and legal fees. Through these changes, these duplicated processes will go—a reduction, a serious reduction, in red tape and costs. Business will no longer need to pay a bank a fee of up to three per cent simply to have the bank accept a AAA-rated Efic guarantee. These changes will save businesses time and money.


We are also ensuring these changes do not bring Efic into direct competition with private sector financiers, by applying competitive neutrality principles. To achieve this, the bill provides for Efic to pay a debt neutrality charge and a tax-equivalent payment. This measure ensures competitive neutrality and reflects the recommendation on competitive neutrality in the 2012 Productivity Commission report on Australia's export credit arrangements. As stated, this bill expands Efic's powers to allow direct lending for export transactions involving all goods, not just capital goods, and provides for competitive neutrality principles to apply to Efic's operations. It is an important part of our efforts to reduce red tape. The bill helps to ensure that Australian small- and medium-sized businesses have access to the finance they need to grow their businesses overseas, which in turn supports job growth. It fits with our overarching theme of displacing big government from centre stage and replacing it with robust growth of the private sector.


I thank all of those on both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2014-11-26,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (12:29):  I rise to speak on this condolence motion as perhaps the only member of the House of Representatives and also the Senate who served contemporaneously with Reg Withers. He was born in 1924. He served in the Australian Navy. He was a former lawyer and barrister.


He entered the Senate in 1966 and served until 1987. He was a minister—Special Minister of State, Capital Territory, Media, and Tourism and Recreation, and Minister for Administrative Services. The circumstances under which he left the ministry were of some note, and I will come back to those. 


He retired from politics in 1987 and was elected Lord Mayor of Perth in 1991 and served in that role until 1994. Mr Reg Withers was a very special sort of individual. When I look back at his background, there were some similarities to the Ruddocks. He may not have recognised that himself. The Ruddock family, when it looked at its war service, found that it was primarily in the Navy. He was a lawyer. The Ruddocks are lawyers. He served in public life over 20 years, and saw that as a very significant public duty. He continued to demonstrate that in the later tasks that he undertook. 


I can remember him being a character. That would be true. Sometimes he would take the micky out of you. He did that of me. Members may not recognise the character I am about to describe but in the 1970s, when I arrived in this place, I had black hair and long sideburns, and I was often seen to be somewhat like the Beatles with the length of my hair. Reg Withers was quick to take the micky out of me in relation to that—as he did, no doubt, with many others.


Today I want to draw to your attention some comments about Reg and how he was treated in public life. He was leader of the Senate for the coalition at the time of the dismissal. He obviously had a very significant role to play at that time. However you saw those events, maintaining the discipline in the Senate was of fundamental importance. I do not say he was the architect of the dismissal. I think that many would claim that title. I think it is hard to go past people like Bob Ellicott, who gave advice, and Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, who were very much on the scene at that time. Maintaining Senate support from amongst the coalition supporters was of fundamental importance for that successful outcome. 


He became a minister, and he had responsibility for electoral matters at a time when the arrangements for redistributions of electoral boundaries were in flux—were changing. There was a major redistribution in 1977. The first was proposed, I think, in 1974 by Fred Daly. It was disallowed in the Senate, which was the procedure that was then in place, and a redistribution was undertaken again in 1977.


In the context of that redistribution some significant changes occurred. The changes where I was the member was that the seat that I held—Parramatta—fundamentally changed and the seat of Dundas was created. I can remember Reg Withers asking me whether I was happy to lose the name Parramatta—that maybe Dundas should be named Parramatta. I said that because the major commercial centre of Parramatta was no longer in the seat that the name should remain with the new seat.


He took an interest in the naming of seats in Queensland. There was some controversy about the seat of McPherson, as I recall. Yes, it was the case that members were vitally interested in the way in which the seats were named, and there was an inquiry set up by a judge. Somebody said to me later that they chose, for that inquiry, one of the most legalistic judges you could find, and that judge made some observations about a minister offering advice about the names of seats. I do not think that was of great moment—and I do not think I am alone in thinking that. I read where Fred Chaney, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time when Reg left, said at the time he was campaigning about the Dismissal that he thought Reg Withers had been treated harshly.


I was interested that, at the time Reg retired, John Button also spoke in the Senate. He remarked upon Reg's many ministerial and parliamentary roles—that he had been Chairman of Committees, Government Whip and Leader of the Government in the Senate. He said:


I suppose that I will remember Reg Withers best because he was a tough, shrewd politician—a professional politician, in a sense.


He went on to talk about the way Reg Withers was removed. He said:


… Reg Withers is a politician who was most unfairly treated when he was removed from the Fraser Ministry.


I take that point—that there seems to be a bipartisan view that that was in fact the case.


I think it is appropriate for this House to note that those views are held. He was not somebody who failed; he was somebody who contributed to public life over 20 years. He continued his interest in service of the community after he left parliament. I think we are entitled to remember him in a very positive way as somebody who contributed significantly to this nation. I extend to his widow Shirley the condolences of the Ruddock family. To his son Simon, whom I know, and his other children and grandchildren, I extend our condolences as well. I think it is appropriate that we will all remember Reg Withers positively.


Debate adjourned.
