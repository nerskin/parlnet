"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-10-19,"—Yesterday at question time I undertook to get additional information for Senator Chris Evans on the Defence child-care centre at Swanbourne. I seek leave to incorporate that information.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
The Sunny Centre at Swanbourne, a Department of Defence Child Care Centre, currently offers 47 child care places and operates at around 39 places. On average, only 23 places have been filled by Defence families' children.
Having previously administered these services directly, which placed a substantial management burden on the local parent volunteers, Defence has recently awarded the external management contract to KU children's services.
KU Children's Services is a community-based service with a long and successful history in managing child care services in Australia. They operate more than 130 different child care services, including preschool, long day care, mobile units, occasional care, before and after school care and work-based child care.
The services provided by KU Children's Services under the contract are designed to meet the needs of Defence personnel, and the contract allows Defence to alter the number of places at the centres to meet the changing demand from Defence families.
The centre intends to renew its licence at the level of 39 places from January 2000. This will allow for flexibility to extend usage by Defence families' children if demand increases from the current average.
There will therefore be flexibility to respond if there are increased demands by Defence Service's families for respite or work related care generated by matters such as the East Timor deployment.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-10-19,"—Pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting, on behalf of Senator Coonan and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I now withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 3 and 5 standing in her name for five sitting days after today.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-19,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 334.
I will read that motion to the Senate. It is:
That the Senate:
(a) notes that the Earth's population—
By the way, can I note for Hansard  here that, as far as I am concerned, the earth is spelt with a capital e and not a small e. In the English language, every other planet gets a capital letter, and so should the one we live on. Let me continue:
(a)	 notes that the Earth's population will reach six billion during October 1999;
(b)	 recognises that the 20th century began with 1.6 billion and will end with 6.1 billion;
(c)	 understands that there may be as many as 10 to 14 billion people depending on the planet's finite resources during the 21st century; and
(d)	 calls for Australia to establish a global population policy.
The world has seen, through this century, on those figures, unprecedented growth of a large and wonderful mammal, homo sapiens, which is at the end of the century taking 40 per cent of the available food stock and which is, according to modest projections from the United Nations, going to continue to grow in population numbers to an estimated 8.9 billion by the year 2050—that is, in the lifetimes of 
 most Australians now in their primary or high school years.
The problem is compounded because, as Senator Crowley said a moment ago, there is an enormous imbalance between the haves and have-nots in the consumption of resources. This is true particularly of the wealthiest people in the world—in fact, we have figures that show that some 350 individuals on this planet own as much as the world's poorest one billion or two billion people. It is an extraordinarily out of kilter human community we live in and, if we are going to put things to rights, we are going to have to extend to other people outside our country, I believe, part of the fair go that Senator Harradine was talking about that we have within our own country. It is certainly not the case at the moment. The reason for the urgency of this motion is that it is time that, at the national level, we instituted a population policy which tries to reach out to the rest of the world as well as looks at what we have in this country, in the interests of future generations everywhere, including future generations of Australians.
We are still far from achieving a goal of fairness. Let me read from the United Nations publication, noting there are six billion people in the world. It says, for example, of the health life of women in the poorer world, that more than half of the days lost in their reproductive years are related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy and reproductive disorders. Three hundred and fifty million women, nearly one-third of all women of reproductive age, in developing countries still do not have access to a range of modern, safe and acceptable methods of family planning, and 120 million more women would use family planning now if it were more widely available, better understood, supported by communities and families and backed by quality programs. In developing countries 585,000 women die each year as a result of pregnancy and many times that number of women suffer infection or injury. Seventy thousand lives are lost each year to unsafe abortions. Women are nearly two-thirds of the world's 960 million illiterates, and women and girls make up three-fifths of the world's 
 poor. Part of the response by the United Nations is not just to afford education and alternatives, including the lowly condom, to those people who would want to have that option available to them but to ensure that men also are aware of the advantages of being able to make decisions for themselves.
Our national government has instituted many of the policies we would like to see worldwide, including legislation for equality, good health and opportunity to access reproductive choices. Surely we ought to be extending that domestic largesse to the rest of the world in the interests of everybody to come, as well as living space on this planet for our 30 million fellow creatures. I seek the Senate's support to go on to debate this issue for its sheer importance.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-10-19,"—I oppose the suspension of standing orders for the very reason that we do need an extensive, informed debate, and we cannot have an extensive, informed debate by suggesting that a matter can be taken as formal and then voted upon or by a truncated debate in a situation like this, when many of our colleagues do not even know what was going on because they are in committees. Let us have it out at one particular stage in a period of time, say, general business time, when we all know what we are talking about. It is indeed essential to have the facts and be fully informed upon the subject.
Senator Brown talks about the effects of population. The figures that he gave to the Senate are somewhat wrong, but we will deal with those at some other stage. Furthermore, he calls on Australia to establish a global population policy. That suggests it would be an entirely cleaner place if there were less Indians in the world, if there were less Asians in the world, if there were less Africans in the world? Tell them to fix themselves up.
We are going out the back door in Australia, and so are large numbers of other countries. One particular speaker in the House of Representatives debate talked about Italy and how long it would take for it to double its population. Yet Italy, according to member of the French Academy Professor Pierre Chaunu, has a 0.8 fertility rate when it needs a 2.1 
 fertility rate to break even. That is how uninformed some of the debate was in the House of Representatives, although there was some other debate that was well informed.
But I want to indicate that we do need such a debate. You mentioned health. Look, the UNFPA is after your money. The problem is that the money goes there and it is not going to the real causes of maternal mortality. The vast majority of maternal deaths are directly attributed to four major causes: haemorrhage, infection, hypertension and obstructed labour. Pregnancy, in itself, continues to be blamed for the deaths rather than the disturbing lack of prenatal care, trained midwives and centres equipped for obstetric complications—and the lack of transportation to those centres.
 Furthermore, the danger is that, if you raise the fear of overpopulation, you are definitely subscribing to human rights violations. I might say that I raised the question of the violation by the BKKBN—the Indonesian family planning organisation, paid for by the UNFPA—of human rights and of women's rights in East Timor. Where were you, Senator Brown, when I raised those matters? In fact, I did so after Bishop Belo had complained, on behalf of his people, about the violations and the compulsion and so forth that were rampant in that particular area.
—That is why we need a debate—
—We do need a debate. Furthermore, we have Mr Hollis in the other house saying:
I also believe that many religions, especially the Catholic faith, have much to answer for. It is somewhat ironic that men, often elderly, in dresses are dictating to women how their bodies should be used.
Where was he when I was raising the issue of violations of human rights by the Indonesian family planning organisation in East Timor? Was he referring to Bishop Belo and priests `in drag'? They have suffered, and so have nuns and priests in that particular area. I trust that he was not, but he should think very carefully about what he says in future.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-19,"—The opposition does not support the suspension of 
 standing orders to debate this motion. I think it is important, however, to emphasise to the chamber that this is of course an issue of the utmost importance.
—Then let's debate it.
—No, but the issue itself is of the utmost importance. The problem arises in terms of the wording of the particular motion that we have before us today, Senator Brown. The opposition indicated its support for motion No. 329 on the same question, which was not given formality. That was a motion that was properly worded, well considered and able to attract the support across the chamber of a number of senators.
—So why aren't we debating that?
—We were denied formality on that matter. We do not support the suspension of standing orders in this particular matter because we believe that this motion requires a great deal more thought and consideration of the detail, in particular the reference here to the calling upon Australia `to establish a global population policy'.
I might suggest to you that it is somewhat difficult for one particular country—a country of our size and geography—to establish a global population policy. I would have thought that it would have been better for Senator Brown to present this chamber with a policy of substance that was able to attract a substantive level of support within this chamber and would provide an opportunity for serious debate on a very serious matter. I suggest to the chamber that the particular proposition we have before us does not meet those criteria.
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye and to the contrary no. I think that the noes have it.
—The ayes have it.
—I heard only one aye, so I declare the noes have it.
—You mean I have no support on this at all?
—I heard only one voice saying aye.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-19,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Trade on the AFTA-CER ministerial meetings and on a bilateral visit to Japan and I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT BY MR VAILE ON THE AFTA-CER MINISTERIAL MEETING AND HIS VISIT TO JAPAN (1-5 OCTOBER 1999)
I wish to inform the House of the outcomes of my visit at the beginning of this month to Singapore and then Japan. Singapore is Australia's eighth largest market taking around 6 per cent of our exports. As a group, the ten countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) account for over 12 per cent of Australia's exports. Japan is, of course, our largest export market taking almost 20 per cent of total exports.
Both visits allowed me to continue our Government's efforts to win greater access to regional markets for Australian exporters, and also to advance our agenda on the forthcoming WTO meeting in Seattle.
On 1 October, I attended the 4th AFTA-CER Meeting in Singapore between ASEAN Ministers and Ministers from the Closer Economic Relations (CER) countries—Australia and New Zealand. I went there with three key objectives: (i) to produce a strong, unambiguous statement of support by ASEAN for the launch of a new WTO round; (ii) to expand the useful trade facilitation work that has been done under the AFTA-CER linkage; and (iii) to accelerate the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade within our region.
Mr Speaker, despite some speculation that events in East Timor might detract from Australia's capacity to pursue our trade interests at the AFTA-CER meeting, I am pleased to report that the meeting delivered some significant breakthroughs for Australia.
Most importantly, Ministers agreed that a high-level taskforce will be established to examine the feasibility of an AFTA-CER free trade area by 
 2010. This process has the potential to achieve substantial improvements in market access for Australian exporters. The taskforce will report to Ministers in twelve months time on the benefits and costs involved in a possible free trade agreement. Independent studies suggest billions of dollars in additional income to Australia from free trade between ASEAN and the CER countries.
The Australian Industry Group has congratulated the Government on this ""ground breaking announcement"" and I look forward to pursuing our agenda when I again meet Minister Yeo from Singapore and Dr Supachai from Thailand later this month. This initiative demonstrates this Government's pragmatic approach to free trade agreements where they can deliver substantial benefits to Australia consistent with our APEC and WTO goals. Members should recall that the Labor Party in Government always liked to parade their multilateral credentials while criticising any discussion of FTAs. Now, all of a sudden, Senator Cook and the member for Fraser have discovered what they call the ""free trade agreement game"". But in Government, Labor totally neglected this policy track despite the fact that, as Senator Cook himself concedes, the Uruguay Round dragged on for far too long under Labor. This Government is pressing for a short, sharp (3 year) WTO round coming out of the Seattle WTO meeting. At the same time, we stand ready to participate in meaningful efforts for freer trade with key bilateral and regional trading partners.
Mr Speaker, there were some other important outcomes from the Singapore meeting.
.	 AFTA-CER's practical work on streamlining standards, customs procedures and quarantine cooperation provides direct benefits to Australian business. The Singapore meeting witnessed the amendment of the MOU on Standards and Conformance to include Burma, Cambodia and Laos. This agreement is already reducing production costs for Australian business by encouraging the adoption of international standards.
.	 Ministers also agreed to trial the Australian developed SANCRT electronic health certificate system for trade in agricultural products and to build closer links between the quarantine services of ASEAN and CER. These measures will reduce the costs to exporters through more timely processing of import documentation and more common approaches on standards, practices and procedures.
.	 In addition, I highlighted the useful opportunity for regional cooperation in the automotive sector presented by the ASEAN automotive study being undertaken by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council with Australian support. 

While in Singapore, I also launched a new promotion to boost the export of chilled Australian pork. The strong demand for Australian chilled pork in Singapore has already seen imports increase from 45 tonnes per day in July to 70 tonnes per day at present. And wrapping up a busy program, I presented export awards to two outstanding Australian companies at a dinner organised by the Singapore Australian Business Council. These awards to the Cox Group for its design of Stage 1 of the new Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre and to Geraldton Boat Builders for the supply of 20 vessels to the Singapore Police Coast Guard drew attention to Australia's expertise in high-value services and high-value manufactures. I want to congratulate both companies on their achievements.
Japan
The Japanese leg of my trip provided the opportunity to extend Australia's dialogue with our largest trading partner in the run-up to the Seattle WTO meeting and to have productive meetings with key business interests and Japanese importers of Australian products.
Despite the fact that my visit coincided with a major Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Obuchi, I had the opportunity to meet both the outgoing MITI Minister, Mr Yosano, and the incoming Minister, Mr Fukaya.
These very useful meetings allowed me to highlight Australia's desire to work closely with Japan in areas of common interest in the new WTO round whilst making clear that we support a three-year round focused on core market access issues. While in Japan, I left a strong message that Australia expects Japan to play a proactive role in the WTO negotiations and that further liberalisation of Japanese markets for agricultural products is central to achieving credible results.
I took the opportunity to brief my Japanese counterparts on the proposed feasibility study on an AFTA-CER free trade area. We agreed to maintain contact on how both countries see developments surrounding free trade agreements in our region and to ensure that any initiatives are fully consistent with a strong rules-based system under the WTO.
I also met with Japanese business leaders which allowed me to pursue opportunities for Australian exporters, and to obtain a detailed update on Japan's economy and reform measures. The general picture to emerge was one of cautious optimism about economic recovery in Japan. But at the same time, my meetings with Mr Takashi Imai, the Chairman of Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organisations) and other business leaders underscored the need for the Japanese Government to intensify economic reform to achieve a return to sustainable growth. 

Along with my colleague the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, I was pleased to address an Austrade-sponsored seminar to promote Australian financial services. And in Osaka I officially launched Business Club Australia in the Kansai region—an Austrade program designed to maximise Australian commercial opportunities in and around the Olympics next year.
Mr Speaker, this visit which centred on discussions with many of our key trading partners in Asia reaffirmed this Government's determination to work at all levels for Australian exporters—building support for our goals in the WTO, taking our trade ties with our ASEAN partners into a new phase, and opening doors bilaterally for Australian firms.
I came away with a clear sense that Australia's trade relations in Asia are in very good shape. East Asia accounts for 52 per cent of our export earnings and includes seven of our top ten trading partners. I encountered widespread appreciation in both Singapore and Japan of the strength of the Australian economy and of how this Government's reform measures have made Australia more competitive. There was a recognition that Australia contributes to the prosperity and security of Asia; just as Asia contributes to the prosperity and security of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>AFTA-CER Ministerial Meetings and Bilateral Visit to Japan</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-10-19,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I welcome the tabling of Minister Vaile's statement. The practice of ministers regularly informing the Senate of current issues in their portfolio is to be commended. The proper role of the Senate in such matters must be to scrutinise the statement, and that will be the basis of my remarks today. The first part of Minister Vaile's statement deals with the recent ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, CER—that is, closer economic relations—with New Zealand and a meeting on the trade pact between Australia and New Zealand. The minister sets out what his objectives were for the meeting and how he went about meeting them. They are all good objectives, I have to say, although I note that this is the first time we have heard of any of them, and it would have been a little braver if the minister had actually stated them before he left Australia rather than when he came back home.
Labor welcomes the minister's work on an AFTA-CER trade agreement, but Minister Vaile's attempt to claim credit for inventing 
 the wheel should not go unregarded. A few facts need to be made clear. The idea of an AFTA-CER trade agreement was first raised by Paul Keating in a speech in Thailand in April 1994, yet since the coalition came to power in 1996 the idea has been assigned to the backburner. So much so in fact that in a speech I made in 1997 I criticised the government for neglecting the issue and have done so on several occasions since. In a statement that has been tabled, Minister Vaile said:
Now, all of a sudden, Senator Cook and the member for Fraser have discovered what they call the ""free trade agreement game"" but in Government, Labor totally neglected this policy track despite the fact that, as Senator Cook himself concedes, the Uruguay Round dragged on for far too long under Labor.
We were one nation of about 100 in the world, and it was no fault of Australia's that the Uruguay Round dragged on too long.
To the charge, let me quote from the speech I made on 24 April 1997. Bear in mind as I do so that I have been accused of neglecting this issue. I said:
Let me give you a positive example of where the Government should be pursuing a more activist agenda in the national interest.
In 1994 the former Government proposed an initiative to bring CER and AFTA closer together. CER (Closer Economic Relations) with New Zealand is the only thing that approaches a trade bloc for Australia. AFTA covers the ASEAN Region and is a trade bloc with the objective of removing 90% of the Commonwealth External Preferential Tariff (CEPT) on industrial products by the year 2003.
In other words the ASEAN countries, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines are removing protection between themselves in order to create an internal free-trade zone.
The Keating initiative started a series of talks to bring Australia and New Zealand into this process. At Government level these talks have . . . concentrated on dealing with ""facilitation"" issues—the sorting out of Customs arrangements and simplifying the red tape associated with market access and Sanitary and Phyto Sanitary regulations.
This is an initiative whose value is underestimated or overlooked in Australia. It is rarely referred to by the Minister yet it relates to opening up relations with our neighbouring economies, the Asian Tigers who are leaders in world economic growth, and who have in place some of the higher 
 external tariffs to be found on industrial products anywhere.
What has to be acknowledged . . . 
I then go on and talk about the role of the MTIA. My purpose in quoting that is to mark the spot—that they were the words I said in 1997—and to reply to the allegation by the minister that Labor has neglected this process.
Let me go on referring to his statement. The government's decision to take up the AFTA-CER process more than five years after it was first proposed by Labor is due in large part to lobbying by the Australian Industry Group, formerly the MTIA, which has relentlessly pursued AFTA-CER on a business to business basis and through representations to Asian governments. Minister Vaile is right to thank the Australian Industry Group for their work on it for the same reason that a jockey might thank his horse after a race.
Labor welcomes the government's decision to pursue an AFTA-CER agreement. It can play an important role in further energising APEC and promoting its free-trade goals. However, we are still waiting for the phrase `Pacific 5' to fall from the minister's lips. I am referring, of course, to the mooted free-trade agreement between the United States, Singapore, Chile, New Zealand and Australia. Recent reports suggest that New Zealand has been the driving force behind this agreement, with enthusiasm from the other partners. In contrast, Australia has been dragging its heels all the way. If Minister Vaile is going to castigate me and Bob McMullan for our support of free-trade agreements, the least he can do is to tell us where he stands on P5—before it becomes P4.
To criticise Labor on this ground is hypocritical. Labor initiated the very agreement over which the minister is trying to rewrite history. Last month, during the Jiang Zemin visit, Kim Beazley proposed a China-Australia trade agreement. This would be an important bilateral trade initiative which would bring greater coherence to our flourishing relationship, push the APEC goals further and provide a means for harvesting some business and commercial benefit from our support for China's accession to the WTO. This is an important proposal. On today's performance, 
 perhaps we will hear from the government about it when they claim the credit for putting it forward some time in the future, when the opportunity now available has largely been missed.
Of course, there is the overture from the United States, floated in February 1998, and the USTR's report to the President for an Australia-US trade pact. This was dismissed out of hand by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, when Labor advocated exploring the proposal so its economic impact could be properly assessed. The pity for Minister Vaile is that the government has neglected possibilities for bilateral trade agreements and has just now discovered them. Labor has always been ahead of that game.
Minister Vaile also informed us of his recent meetings with Singaporean and Japanese government officials. He neglected to say, however, that the latest trade statistics, released just a few days before his departure, showed that, while Asian economic growth has returned, our exports to Asia remain flat. In fact, we exported less to our 10 most significant Asian trading partners in the first eight months of 1999 than we did over the first eight months of 1998. While Asian economies are going north, our trade balance with Asia is going south.
As I said at the outset, I welcome this report and look forward to hearing Minister Vaile's next report to parliament. Perhaps in that report he will not only give us a pleasant travelogue but also address some of the hard questions in his portfolio. He could start with the following. Firstly, figures just released show that in 1998 our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures fell in value by $868 million, the first fall in 20 years. Does this have anything to do with the fact that total Commonwealth expenditure on education, training and research has fallen from 2.99 per cent of GDP in Labor's last year of office to 2.53 per cent today?
Secondly, why are Australian manufacturing exports as a whole falling for the first time since 1981? Thirdly, the United States has just released a comprehensive statement on its strategy for the next round of WTO organisa 
 tions. When will Australia release a similar statement setting out our goals and objectives for the WTO round, if it is kicked off in the November-December WTO meeting in Seattle this year? Fourthly, why does Australia now have its highest trade deficit, its highest current account deficit and its highest level of foreign liabilities ever? This is a fundamental question going to the heart of the economic performance of the Australian economy and, given international scrutiny of our trade deficit, current account deficit and foreign debt, obviously will militate against Australia's domestic economic performance in the future if there is not a positive program by the government to lift our trading performance and the competitiveness of the Australian nation. I look forward with keen interest to hearing Mark Vaile's answers to those questions.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>AFTA-CER Ministerial Meetings and Bilateral Visit to Japan</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-19,"—In closing the second reading debate on the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Amendment Bill 1999 , I want to thank those senators who have contributed. I do briefly want to comment on a couple of things that Senator O'Brien raised about the bill, and I thank Senator O'Brien for his contribution to the debate. Unfortunately he was followed in the debate by Senator Mackay, who, I can at my charitable best say, gave a presentation of babble and bile—little about the bill and a lot about what Senator Mackay, regrettably, is becoming renowned for: personal attacks on me and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson.
While I do not want to delay the Senate, I do take some umbrage at some of the things that Senator Mackay said in her contribution. She suggested that some of the programs run in our department are simply, in her words, `slush funds'. As I say, I take exception to that. She obviously judges this government by the standards of the previous Labor government, which we know, of course, did have slush funds. We know about the whiteboard—in fact, we know about the very big whiteboard that the Labor government used to direct funds to marginally sensitive Labor electorates. That does not happen in this government. Perhaps she is familiar with government in her state of Tasmania. Perhaps it happens with the Labor government there. Again, it does not happen in this government.
Senator Mackay raised two particular programs that I do have responsibility for, and I just want to mention those for the record. She mentioned the Rural Transaction Centre Program and suggested that it was a slush fund. That program, as I mentioned in the chamber at question time, is a $70 million program. Communities tell us what they want. They suggest the solutions and we fund them. But I do not do what the Labor Party obviously did with their electorates and get a pin and go around picking coalition electorates. I get it looked at by an independent panel of responsible people, who go through the applications very carefully, who do their work 
 very diligently and who recommend to me certain projects to fund. Admittedly, I do have the final say. I asked Senator Mackay last night, by interjection, who she expects should make the decision—a member of the opposition, or a public servant, perhaps? Of course governments make decisions; we are elected to do that. Why shouldn't we make the decisions? That is what it is all about. Certainly, with the rural transaction centres, I am advised by an independent panel. I value their advice and I then make the final decisions. Of course, I have got to—someone has to, and that falls to my responsibility.
For Senator Mackay to suggest that this is a slush fund is just absolutely ludicrous. Of the first seven projects granted, one is in the electorate of an Independent member of the lower house. Another, up my way, is in the electorate of Capricornia, currently represented by a Labor Party member. Another electorate is in Tasmania, in St Marys, and I know that is represented by a Labor member of parliament. There are a couple in other parts of Australia that are represented by National Party members of parliament. None of these programs in this first round have gone to any electorate represented by a Liberal member of parliament. That is strange, because Liberal members represent the greatest number of rural and regional seats in this parliament. The National Party represents a great number of the rural and regional seats. Apart from Tasmania, I do not think Labor represents any, do you. And, of course, there are a couple of Independents.
You would expect from that that most of the projects in the Rural Transaction Centre Program would go into coalition electorates, but they have not. I am advised by an independent board that the allocations are made on what that board recommends, fitting within the guidelines. So I take umbrage at Senator Mackay's imputations, which she makes quite regularly. Usually I ignore them, but I just happened to be in the chamber yesterday and could not ignore them.
Senator Mackay also talked about the Rural Communities Program and the Rural Plan. Again, with the Rural Communities Program, decisions are made by me. Who else should 
 they be made by? I am advised by an independent board, which very diligently looks through all of those matters, looks through the applications, and makes representations to me. While it might have been par for the course for the previous Labor government, it certainly does not apply under our government.
Returning to the bill and the contributions that Senator O'Brien made, this bill comes about—as I said in the second reading speech—as a result of higher than expected costs and redundancies associated with the government's waterfront reform program. It has become necessary to increase the original appropriation. Originally it was put in at $250 million, and the government believes that it should go up to $350 million. We have been up-front about what that additional $100 million would go for, and Mr Anderson, the minister responsible for this area, has clearly enunciated where the additional $100 million would go. He put out a press release on 10 June—and I think Senator O'Brien referred to it—which clearly sets out where we want that money to go.
As well as additional appropriations to fund the greater than expected number of redundancies—because our program and our reforms have worked—we also wanted to fund some non-redundancy reforms. When we go into committee very shortly we will, I suspect, go through the Labor amendments. I am not sure whether or not they are supported by the Democrats, but I say to Senator O'Brien, to his colleagues and to the Democrats that the proposal we put up is a sensible one. It continues the waterfront reform but it makes the waterfront industry fund its own reform.
With the greatest respect, I understand what the Labor Party are doing and I understand why they are doing it, but I think they have missed the point. Where we do not require the industry to fund its own reform, regrettably, the taxpayers will have to do it. I cannot understand why the Labor Party are pursuing these amendments which let the industry off the hook and say to the government, `We do not think the industry should fund these reforms. We want you'—that is, the taxpayer—`to fund these reforms.' Of course, governments do not have money; we only use 
 taxpayers' money. So they are saying that they want the government, or the taxpayer, to fund these reforms in the industry, whereas the government's approach is that the industry should fund the reforms.
I want to mention very quickly a couple of matters which I know will come up in the committee. Senator O'Brien commented that the guidelines to be applied in the assessment of applications for funding for non-redundancy reforms had not been made available by Mr Anderson. Those guidelines have yet to be finalised, and that is why they have not been made available. The reason for this is that the focus to date has been on the redundancy submissions. I can say that the guidelines will limit the claims to the three areas identified in section 1B of the current legislation, and that will allow all stevedores to put forward claims for assistance.
Senator O'Brien also mentioned that whilst the government is seeking to extend the limit of funding for its maritime reform package from $250 million to $350 million, the actual additional funding required is in the order of only $50 million, not $100 million. I say to Senator O'Brien that evidence to the committee has shown that in order to effect a comprehensive program—including not only redundancy related reforms but improved technology and training—the additional funding requirement is in the order of $100 million. The department has made it clear that the cost of meeting MIFCo's borrowings would be in the order of $300 million. In addition to this, allowance must be made for the department's administrative costs associated with the levy, the payments to Western Australia, and a credible non-redundancy program. Whilst we have not gone into the proposed amendments in detail, I understand that the Labor Party are seeking to do away with those non-redundancy reforms.
The Labor Party, as I understand them, are saying that funding collected by the levy should be used only to meet the cost of redundancy packages for workers seeking to exit the industry. The government say that such an outcome will eliminate the opportunity for a wider range of reforms and will deny the opportunity for a number of stevedores— 
 most notably Sealand—to access an equitable amount of assistance in relation to the total amount of the levy that they will pay.
As I understand Senator O'Brien's speech, he was suggesting that the government should provide funding from existing programs and apply the regulations governing the administration of those programs to assist the stevedoring industry to implement non-redundancy reforms, such as the application of new technology, increased workplace safety and an increase in the level of training in the industry. I ask Senator O'Brien: what programs are you referring to? We in the government are not aware of any such programs from which we could fund that. As I understand what Senator O'Brien is saying, the opposition are recommending that the taxpayer should fund any assistance to the industry. In contrast to that, we are saying that the government's reform program should be fully funded by the industry through this stevedoring levy. I ask Senator O'Brien and also the Democrats to think about that.
At the risk of being repetitive, I again say that we want the industry to pay for those non-redundancy reforms; we do not want to throw it to the taxpayer. If you succeed with the amendments that you have foreshadowed, the effect will be that the levy will fund only the redundancy. The other reforms which have to happen, if they are to happen, will then be funded by the government, which as I say is the taxpayer. We think it is far better that the industry as a whole should do that rather than the taxpayer. Again I thank those senators who have contributed to the second reading debate. I look forward to carefully going through the amendments in the committee stage.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-19,"—I will speak to give Senator Murray the chance to have a look at the bill and just see what the removal of (b) and (c) will involve. I hope that, having had a look at the bill, he will appreciate that it is essential that these remain, even with the reduced amount, which is obviously going to happen as a result of what Senator Murray has just said. I think it argues for itself, but Senator O'Brien will argue his case and I will respond to that at the time.
At this stage I just want to say to Senator Murray that there was a suggestion that the government had not clearly made the case for the $350 million. Unfortunately I was not there, as Senator Murray was, but I understood that this was all done through the committee and done in some detail, and I did refer to it by reference to a press release in my speech. But just for the record—and I suspect that I am not going to change your mind, Senator Murray, as you have made your mind up—the original $250 million was made up of $148 million  for the redundancy package; $50 million for interest; $2 million for administration; $10 million for the Western Australian government element of the package; and $40 million for non-redundancy reforms, such as occupational health and safety, training programs et cetera.
Because of the higher than expected number of redundancies and the size of the redundancy packages, the government's best advice is that we need to increase that by $100 million. I just want to explain to you for the record, Senator Murray—although, as I say, you have made your decision and I am sure that nothing I can say will alter that—what had been provided to the committee and provided in the public domain by Mr Anderson on a number of occasions.
Of the $350 million we wanted, or the ability to levy that, there was $195 million for the redundancy packages—and that, as I say, 
 is because of the higher than expected number—and that is up almost $50 million. There is $105 million for interest because of the greater exposure; $6 million for administration because of the greater administration with the higher numbers; and $4 million for the Western Australian redundancies, which fell quite dramatically. As to why that is so, I have just been told that Western Australia has reduced the number of ports that were going to be eligible for this funding, so the Western Australian redundancies element was reduced to just $4 million. The non-redundancy reforms were reduced from $40 million in the original package to $30 million in this package, and the final $10 million of the $350 million was for contingencies in case MIFCo's interest or redundancy estimates were exceeded.
So that is how we got to that, Senator Murray. I am sorry if that was not made available to you previously. As I say, it was made available to the committee and it was in the public domain. They were not just figures plucked out of the air and put down on the back of an envelope, as you might suggest; they were calculated conscientiously by the government's advisers and were arrived at on that basis.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—Minister, those figures that you outlined were indeed in the report. Although I did not sit through the hearings or read the submissions, I have certainly read the report and the summary. I assume it is a good summary of what went on; it is a legislation committee report, and those are usually pretty good. My point simply was that it was almost impossible, first time round, for the government to get it right with the $250 million. In those circumstances, it was a rushed bill.
I do not point any fingers at the government as a result—they just needed to get on with it—but I must say that the second time round, when it neatly rounds to $100 million, it makes me suspicious. If it came to $96 million or $102 million or something like that you would think there might be a little more science in it than there is at present. However, Minister, you are quite right. We have come 
 to a view, and that will be what happens. Frankly, you will need to come back to us.
Minister, what I find difficult to work out from here is the argument between you and Senator O'Brien regarding the next two amendments, because I have now read exactly what comes out. As I understood your argument, you were saying that, if you cut the amount of money available from $350 million to $300 million, you would not have the money available to fulfil the requirements of 1(b) and 1(c) on section 18. In other words, the only amount of money available will be for interest administration and redundancies. That is as I understood the gist of your reply earlier, in which case, if that argument is correct, Senator O'Brien would need to put it to bed. It therefore renders Senator O'Brien's amendments unnecessary because those things can no longer be done. So you can see where I am going with it.
Minister, when you picked up the argument a little later, I think your answer was, `Well, there could be a few million that we might have for that, so leave it in.' I am attracted to the idea that, for employers who are not making employees redundant, it may be in the interest of those employers and employees, particularly in the small business area, for some moneys to be available from (b) and (c). That is what I really wish to hear from Senator O'Brien.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I wonder which amendments we should deal with first. Perhaps we will deal with the arguments and then vote on the amendments, if senators are happy with that. I know that there are amendments before the chair, but I suppose we can be a bit `careless' with the way we address the debate.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—My apologies, Senator O'Brien, but I suggest we knock the money out of the way and get that done because, if you have the numbers and the decision, the minister will know where he stands, and then we will have the other two to deal with.
Motion (by Senator O'Brien) agreed to:
That further consideration of opposition amendments Nos 1 and 3 be postponed. 

Amendment (by Senator O'Brien) agreed to:
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 6), omit ""$350 million"", substitute ""$300 million"".",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—In relation to the amendments, I take it that Senator Murray now appreciates exactly the effect of amendments Nos 1 and 3, particularly No. 1, which in effect repeals parts of the original bill. In the period of the discussion between Senator Murray and the minister, I obtained what I was certain was in existence: P&O's submission to the legislation committee inquiry.
So that we can put this to bed, there are a couple of matters that I did say I would return to. I am happy for this document to be tabled or incorporated in Hansard—whatever you wish; it is already on the public record as part of the Senate inquiry—or to simply get copies made and supply them. P&O, amongst other things, said:
Support for extended financial assistance did not form part of our undertaking to government in regard to absorbing the cost of the levy. Our support for the levy and undertaking not to pass it on to our customers was confined to the purpose for which MIFCo funds were initially to be raised—that is, for redundancies in the stevedoring industry. This remains our position.
In the passage of time between September last year and now—
and I interpose that that was 25 August this year—
we estimate there have been some 1,300 exits from the industry, of which P&O Ports' share was 41 per cent. Based on its market share, our company will contribute approximately 50 per cent of the levy each year. Based on our own experience, and in the absence of accurate figures on the maritime industry finance company's actual projected costs, we have made the following assumptions. We estimate that the cost of the above exits, assuming an average exit cost of $130,000 per person, is approximately $170 million—
and there I interpose that, although the government had estimated $195 million, the evidence before the committee was that it would be somewhere between $185 million and $190 million for the cost of redundancies at the time of that hearing. Nearly all of the costs were known. There was a very small package of redundancies that were yet to be 
 signed off, and that was the estimate at the time of the hearing.
The submission continues:
Assuming administrative costs for MIFCo to administer the levy collection of, say, $30 million plus the capitalised cost of interest of, say, $100 million, the cost of the program would be approximately $300 million, leaving an approximate surplus of $50 million. It would be appreciated if MIFCo could provide accurate figures so that the actual costs can be better understood.
We are not much further advanced, frankly. It goes on:
In the light of the Minister's second reading speech, we understand any surplus would be available to implement non-redundancy related reforms aimed at improving performance.
Then they come to their view, which is:
We are of the view that any surplus of funds . . . should, in order of preference, be dealt with as follows: MIFCo funds should be confined for redundancy purposes only; the loans should be reduced to the amount required to fund redundancies plus administrative costs and interest, and the loan structured accordingly; and repayment of the loan should cease immediately the cost of redundancies has been met, thus reducing the period for levy collection and its impost upon the industry . . . If there is to be further spending for non-redundancy related matters, then the parties responsible for meeting the cost of the levy—that is, the stevedores—should be charged with the role of administering the equitable distribution of such funds through an industry working group. We would propose that such distribution occur on a pro rata basis equivalent to the levy payments made.
That is P&O's position. Unfortunately, there were no substantial submissions from other stevedores. The reality is that the overwhelming majority of levy funds raised will be from the two major stevedores. There is not much doubt about that. Probably the third biggest is Sealand, where we are talking about five per cent of the levy payments being raised. So we are really talking about rats and mice—if you will excuse the term—in terms of what comes for the rest.
We are saying that, at this stage, months and months after this package has been announced, we have very little idea of what the additional moneys are to be spent on. Senator Murray, you suggested that, if the government had a real plan that required additional money, they should come back to 
 the Senate and ask for further money. One presumes that what you mean by that is that they would come with some firm ideas of money that was going to be spent, how they would cost it, what the interest administration costs would be—a whole package. Whilst you were excusing the government, I think very leniently, for coming to the parliament with legislation which is back of the envelope stuff, there is no excuse now—absolutely none.
If the government want to come up with a package on waterfront reforms, what is wrong with having the total support of the stevedoring industry for that package? You make the suggestion that we leave the bill as it stands—that is, if there is some money available leave it to the minister to distribute. What does that mean? Does that guarantee what you are suggesting ought to be some redistributed mechanism for the levy? No, it does not, because you do not know what deliberations the minister will make. What I do know is that Patrick want another million dollars, and they already have the lion's share of the levy. They have already got more than anyone out of the levy, as far as I am aware. There is absolutely no guarantee that what you will do by leaving these measures in will assist any particular small business. I suppose the government might argue that they get a better bang for their buck if they put the money into the big players.
More importantly, of course, what we do know—and it is clear from P&O that they do not consider they have given any undertaking to pass on costs—is that they are effectively arguing that 18 per cent of their contribution can be passed on. I make those calculations in a back of the envelope way, saying there is a 41 per cent return off a 50 per cent contribution. So they are saying that, if you move their half contribution to a 100 per cent figure, you double the 41 per cent. So 82 per cent of what they spend goes to pay redundancies, and they have another 18 per cent. What they are saying is: `If those are the rules, we will get it back; we will apply it to our charges. We will pass it on because we have never given an undertaking that it will not be passed on.'
Our amendments say to the government: `If you have a plan, get the industry behind it, get a definite plan and come back to the parliament with a total plan.' If you want to reintroduce mechanisms which are specific, you can do that, but why leave these provisions in place when all you are guaranteeing, in my view, is that there will be more money for Patrick? If P&O get some, they will pass on the costs. You might get an outcome for individuals, but there is no certainty that your redistributive approach will be any more equitable than what has happened to date.
You are much more assured, if the government are intent on pursuing this and they are going to go away and do their work properly, of getting a proper package if you support our amendment to take out these measures and say to the government, `Bring it back with a whole package. Don't leave it in there and then come saying you want another $50 million and here is the plan.' Let us come back with a whole package and, importantly, come back with a package that has the support of the industry and that has a guarantee from the industry that they are not then going to pass on the costs of the extended levy to the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of these programs—that is, the people who use the stevedoring services, the shipping services, through the Australian ports. At the moment we have not done that.
There is a job of work to be done by the government in this area. It is clear that they do not understand, from what the minister says, the extent of the commitment from the players. Frankly, it is very clear that they do not even have those commitments in writing, because we have got that on the Hansard as the evidence from the first legislation committee inquiry into the original bill. When the questions were asked, there were unequivocal answers that, no, there were no written commitments.
In relation to the amendment, which has the effect of deleting parts of the existing bill, I would put that to you as an argument to say, `Don't support the government's position. Amend the bill and give the government the message that if they are going to do the job they are going to do it properly. If they come 
 back with a whole package of measures they will have to convince the opposition, and more importantly the industry, that it is worth supporting.' At the end of the day, if we receive a bill and it goes through the process that this bill has followed—and, may I say, quite properly—then everyone can be convinced, and there will be a representative group of stevedores coming to us saying, `The industry supports this package as a total package.' At the moment, there are no guarantees that the outcomes you want will be achieved and there are no guarantees that the outcome the government says it wants will be achieved. We are absolutely certain that the outcomes that significant parts of the stevedoring industry want will not be achieved in the measures that are proposed here.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—I have a short question, just so I have the complete picture. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: Senator O'Brien, you did not really spell out why you want to repeal subsection 18(4). I can see why you would want to repeal part of that, because it refers to paragraph (1)(c), which you would be getting rid of. But paragraph (1)(d) actually survives, even though part of it is omitted. I do not really understand why you want to repeal subsection 18(4) completely and not just take out `(1)(c) or' in the first line.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—My understanding is that all payments in relation to (1)(a) have been made, so it is redundant.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-19,"—In response to Senator Murray: if paragraph 18(1)(b) and (c) are removed, the industry will collect only the amount required to refund the redundancies. Estimates will be made and, when the levy gets to that amount, the levy will stop. This means that we will not be able to achieve the reform program that the government originally set out to achieve on the waterfront. The whole of the efficiencies that we wanted to achieve to make the waterfront more productive will be unable to be met because the redundancy payments will be there but the additional 
 money to fund the non-redundancy reforms will not be there. All seven of the benchmarks that we hoped to achieve by our original proposals will be unable to be met.
If your position is to fund only the redundancies and nothing further, then you would support the amendment. That is of course a decision for you. If you have decided to do that, no further amount of arguing by me is going to change your mind. But if you want to go beyond just funding the redundancies and have some commitment to non-redundancy reform of the waterfront, then you will vote with us to leave those provisions of the act in place.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator O'Brien: I am interested in 18(1)(c), which is:
payments in respect of activities that are prescribed by the regulations, being activities in connection with the reform or restructuring of the stevedoring industry;
I may have missed it somewhere, but I am not sure that those regulations are disallowable. Perhaps the minister will tell me whether they are or not. Section 21(2), at page 14 of the act, states:
. . . regulations may be made on the following matters:
(a)	 providing for the manner of payment of levy and late payment penalty;
(b)	 providing for the repayment of overpayments;
(c)	 requiring persons to keep records about the loading and unloading of ships;
(d)	 requiring persons to provide information, to such persons as are prescribed, about the loading and unloading of ships;
(e)	 prescribing the form of warrant for the purposes of section 14;
(f)	 prescribing penalties for offences against the regulations by way of fines of up to 10 penalty units.
I heard the case you put, Senator O'Brien, and I thought it was put with regard to (1)(b). I am not sure it was put with regard to (1)(c) if it relates to the prescribed regulations that I have just read out. If they were disallowable—and the minister would have to confirm whether they were or not—you would have 
 the option anyway to deal with regulations about those matters if they came before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I will rely on the advice of the minister as to whether the regulations are disallowable. The advice that we have received, as I recall it, is that it is not the intention to deal with other areas of funding by way of regulation—but I am open to being contradicted in relation to that.
This provision is somewhat of a catch-all. I take your point that it appears, on the face of it, that there might be other things which might be funded which might be the subject of an alteration to the regulations. I must say that all of the focus has been on (1)(b) in terms of areas that might be funded. I know of no proposals at this time—perhaps because they are not permitted until, if you are correct, there is a regulation passed.
In terms of this activity, I return to my original point that, if there is to be further reform activity funded by the levy process, would it not be better if there were a guarantee of an equitable distribution through that process, which is not there at the moment, and all that the government would need to do to authorise funding of an activity was to promulgate a regulation in general terms about that sort of activity—not promulgate anything about the way that applications for funding would be assessed, not promulgate anything about the equity of distribution of funds under this measure? So I return to the argument I put to you that would it not be better that, if we are going to address these things, we address them in a way that maximises the equitable benefit across the industry and minimises the cost implications for the users of stevedoring?
If you are against us in relation to item (c) then I would say that we are prepared to seek to put that amendment in a different form so that 1(b) and 1(c) would be dealt with separately if you wish to vote on those matters separately. But I stress to you that it is our view that, if you are really looking for this matter to be dealt with in the future in a proper manner and if there is real support for this throughout the industry, you would excise 
 both of these provisions and require the government to bring them back with a total package with the support of industry.
I hear what you say about coming up with a proposal that might be disallowable, but I stress to you that that proposal would not require anything other than the mention of a particular activity to allow it to be funded. That is as I read the amendment—`payments in respect of activities that are prescribed by the regulations'. So promulgation of a regulation which permits payments in relation to an activity would have to be no more than that to allow the government to make decisions by whatever process to fund whomever they chose, whatever the views of the industry were.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-19,"—Senator Murray asked me whether the regulations that could be made under the act were disallowable instruments. My understanding is that regulations that the Governor-General makes are disallowable instruments. But I have sought higher advice. The advisers from the department tell me that that is the case. But, even more persuasively, I have just checked with the two clerks at the table who confirmed for me that any regulations that the Governor-General makes are disallowable instruments. Senator Murray is obviously conscious of what that means: that, if the regulations are not to the liking of the Senate or the House of Representatives, they can be disallowed. That of course provides, might I suggest, the sort of assurance that I think Senator Murray is seeking.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—Senator O'Brien, I cannot accept your amendments as presently structured. I do not know what the consequence would be of getting rid of 18(4) in view of section 21, which I think seems to deal with some very practical issues. I would suggest to you—if you would accept—that you amend amendment No. 1 by removing the bold words `and (c)' in the paragraph beginning 1A and, in paragraph 1B, you remove the words `or (c)'. Then your amendment No. 3 would fall away. I think that would leave you with the nub of 
 your argument. My concern is that you are too embracive with the amendments that are before us.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I have received, I think, impeccable advice that the regulations set out in section 21(2) of the act have nothing at all to do with 18(1)(c) and would not be affected by 18(1)(c) being excised.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I am advised that the empowerment to make those regulations is in section 21(1)(a) and not 18(1)(c).

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—Senator O'Brien, my difficulty is that, following from section 21(1), 21(2) spells out what the regulations may be made on. None of those seem items that really fall within the area of your argument. They seem to me quite practical: providing for the manner of payments; providing for the repayment of overpayments; requiring persons to keep records; requiring persons to provide information; prescribing the form of warrant; and prescribing penalties for offences. I am sorry but, in terms of the way I read this and the way I am reacting, I am very uncomfortable. I can deal with your amendment No. 1 on the basis I outlined, but I am uncomfortable with knocking out the regulations.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—Just to clarify: I think that, if I understand you correctly, you are concerned that 18(1)(c) is a section which gives permission for parts of 21—that is, the regulations—to be knocked out. That may be what you believe, but my advice is that that is not a properly held view. Section 21 sets out the power to make regulations, not regulations in themselves, and that provision is unaffected by the amendment. If we take out 18(1)(c), 21 
 remains in its entirety and is unaffected. But if we take out 18(1)(c), you prevent the making of a regulation which would specify matters in addition to those specified in 18(1)(b) as able to be funded out of the MIFCo moneys, if I can put it that way. I am not sure if that helps you or not.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—18(4) also refers to (1)(d), which is payments in respect of administrative costs. You would repeal that. I do not think that is sensible. At present you are trying to get out of the act items (1)(b) and (1)(c) and item (4) under section 18. I am suggesting to you that your amendment should really focus on item (1)(b), so that items (1)(c) and (4) would remain intact. That would deal with the matters that you are after.
—Wasn't that 1(d)?
—Let us go back through it again. In section 18 on page 12 of the act, you have 18(1)(b) and (c) and your amendment No. 1 seeks to repeal those paragraphs. Amendment No. 3 on sheet 1605 seeks to repeal subsection 18(4), but 18(4) not only refers to (1)(c), which is covered by your amendment No. 1, but also refers to (1)(d). If you look at (1)(d), it refers to payments in respect of administrative costs. I do not think you should be wiping that out.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—With respect, of course we do not take those out. What we take out of (1)(d) is reference to (b) and (c) but not (a). If you are not going to pay moneys in accordance with (b) or (c), you have no administrative costs. I think that is a logical proposition. So you do not need a provision to authorise the payment of an administrative cost of something that is no longer there.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-19,"—This comes back to your proposition: (1)(d) refers to payments in respect of administrative costs in connection with matters in respect of which payments may be authorised under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). 
 Paragraph (a) is the redundancy paragraph, and you will have administrative costs to deal with redundancies. All I am saying to you is that you are not going to get my support because of the interlocking nature of these things for anything other than repealing paragraph 18(1)(b). The consequence of that, of course, is that you must omit (b) in paragraph 18(1).",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I am quite happy to have the matters put in a way that facilitates you supporting those parts that you do and those that you do not. I think that, from what I am hearing—and perhaps I am hearing it wrong—you are under a misapprehension as to the linking of these matters. The advice I have is that the general regulatory power under 21 is unaffected. So, indeed, it is being further supported.
Focusing on section 21 is taking you away from the main game. I see the point that you are getting at: by repealing 18(4), you repeal the provision which would authorise payments under (1)(d) in respect of an activity prescribed by the regulations until after the regulations had been disallowed. What that does is not prevent the minister from paying it but remove the impediment from the minister authorising those costs. I think that is right, but we are dealing with this quickly.
That is a restriction on the minister, and we would remove that restriction because (a) the administration arrangements have already been put in place for redundancies, so he should not have to authorise them, and (b) he should not need any other mechanism which makes those provisions disallowable because those provisions are no longer in the bill if our amendments succeed. I take your point that if you did not leave (c) in there, then you would want to leave (4), and I understand that. I am debating this to be clear on where we are headed. I suggest that perhaps your concerns about the removal of (4)—if you were otherwise generally supportive of the propositions I have put—would not be a problem.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1

Therefore I would like to move an amendment to your amendment—to drop item (3) on sheet 1605 and to amend item (1) so the bold words `and (c)' following 1A are removed; and under 1B in amendment (1) we simply omit the unbolded letter `(b)'.

Repeal the paragraph.
1B Paragraph 18(1)(d)

I have a form which reflects that. If that is passed, then I would seek leave to withdraw the other amendments.
—Senator Murray was suggesting amending your amendment. Rather than you withdrawing your amendment, he would move to amend it. As I understand it, this gives the effect of what you have just called for.
—That is the same thing as what I have just read. If Senator Murray wants to move to amend it, that is a different proposition. But I thought he was asking me to move it in a different form and that was what I was proposing to do. I am happy to do either—which has the same effect. I am in the hands of the chair.
—Listening closely to the debate, as I always do, I thought I had heard Senator Murray say he would seek to amend them. I think he has signed a bit of paper which, as you say, gives the same effect. So you would then seek to withdraw your amendment No. 3. Senator

I want to correct the record regarding something I said earlier which we have passed by. I do not know that it is specifically relevant to the debate, but I would like to correct it whilst I have the opportunity. Senator O'Brien was talking about the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and unquantifiable contingencies. You convinced me that I was wrong, Senator O'Brien. I now find that I was wrong in agreeing that I was wrong and that in fact I was right all along, unbeknown to all of us. I am told that this Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee annual report was tabled only today in the parliament. The accounts of the committee mention unquantifiable contingencies, which I have not had a chance to read. Glancing through it, I see there is reference to a number of court cases and decisions. I see you have the same booklet in your hands. I am assuming you did not have it when you told me earlier I was wrong. I wish to correct the record that in fact that is what would happen to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-19,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996 to give effect to initiatives announced in the context of this year's budget. The provisions of this bill include $36.3 million in the year 2000 for increased funding under the Literacy and Numeracy Program to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes for students, particularly in the middle years of schooling. It also includes $26.4 million to extend funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Strategy for the year 2000; the continuation of previous capital funding arrangements for non-government schools; and, more importantly, contingency funding for struggling non-government schools in the transition to the new system of funding for those non-government schools.
In March 1997, the Commonwealth, state and territory education ministers agreed to a national literacy goal that every child leaving primary school should be numerate and able to read, write and spell at an appropriate level. This is a goal that not only most of us here but also those in the community would 
 agree with. The ministers also agreed to the adoption of a national literacy plan. There are two strands to the Commonwealth funding for literacy programs which give effect to the plan. These are grants to schools to foster literacy and numeracy development, targeting educationally disadvantaged students, and grants for national literacy and numeracy strategies and projects.
The proposed legislation will increase funding generally for the literacy and numeracy plan and it will specifically support new initiatives that target students in the middle years of schooling—students in upper primary and secondary school through to year 10. The additional capital grants funding for non-government schools and the additional funding for short-term emergency assistance are also for non-government schools. It is a contingency fund to assist those schools which will receive increased funding under the new system announced in the 1999-2000 budget. That outline of the bill may sound okay for those who know very little about what is happening in the primary-secondary school system, but the motion moved by Senator Carr in the Senate last week condemns this government for using the important issue of literacy in a cynical and political fashion and for failing to provide government schools with additional resources in line with its increased expenditure for the non-government sector.
Let us now turn to what is, in fact, going to be the new system of funding for non-government schools. Of course, this bill provides contingency funding for those struggling non-government schools. In Dr Kemp's statement on choice and equity in funding arrangements for non-government schools in the years 2001-04—the minister has hit the headlines this week for his most shameful and incompetent attempt to realign the higher education sector to a position where most Australians do not want it to go and would never agree to the position on which he has insisted—he claimed, at page 1, that the system will provide high levels of funding for the neediest school communities, that the government is committed to needs based funding for non-government schools and that a more equitable 
 funding mechanism was sought. At page 2 the minister said that the government had decided that funding to non-government schools serving the neediest of communities should be significantly increased.
Given this level of rhetoric, it seems reasonable to assume that the schools that are the most likely to benefit from the new arrangements—as we have been told in estimates—will be those that currently have the lowest levels of resources. It is something of a shock when you analyse the figures very carefully to find that, in fact, it is exactly the opposite. The schools which gain most from the new model will be those schools which are currently considered the most wealthy. Let me provide you with one example. One of the schools that will benefit is believed to be the School of Total Education in Warwick, Queensland. This school currently has a budget of $1 million for its 115 students, largely as a result of corporate sponsorship. This works out to be nearly $8,700 per student in a school of only 115 students, compared with about $5,200 in government schools. Under the new funding arrangements, this school is apparently set to gain in the region of an additional $3,000 per student—taking it to well over twice the resourcing level of a government school. Those on the government side may well argue this is an extreme example, and it is, but it is one example under this new funding model.
The new model, which is called the SES model—the socioeconomic status model—provides funding for the non-government school sector and was announced as part of this year's budget. The new funding arrangements are due to be introduced from 2001—hence the contingency funding in this bill—and they will be phased in over four years so that any increases will occur at 25 per cent per year from 2001 to 2004. Non-government schools are currently funded on the basis of a funding model called the education resources index. We have known for a long time that there have been inadequacies in this funding arrangement. There have been many comments about a need to actually revise and review this funding arrangement. However, we in the Labor Party believe that this is not 
 the way to deal with it; this is not the answer. It is not adequate. It also targets only a certain range of schools in the non-government sector. The education resources index measures the financial capacity of the school. The current method includes such things as fees and schools' income from bequests, reserves and so on. In effect, the current system attempts to measure the total financial resources of the school and, therefore, the remaining needs which the government should meet.
It is claimed that the current system is not working and that there are widespread discrepancies between schools with the same ERI—the education resources index. In part this is because, some would say, in the past NGSs have become very good at manipulating their figures, distorting the ERI and therefore maximising government funding. However, there has been no attempt by this government to analyse what the problems were or to find better ways of measuring school wealth. The research carried out by DETYA was, I believe, controlled by the non-government sector and driven by their concerns rather than by genuine research criteria.
The new funding model, which I do not have time to outline, in effect measures the financial resources of the student community attending a particular school. It is actually based on a random sample of 100 addresses in that area which are then coded against ABS statistics—a fairly complicated process. In fact, what you actually do is measure the financial resources of the student community attending the particular school, rather than or ignoring the financial capacity of the school.
So what are the problems with the current proposal? Firstly, only a few of the non-government sector schools were included. Catholic schools, which represent over 60 per cent of private schools, will not have their SES assessed but have been deemed to be at a certain level as part of a settlement between that sector and this government. Wealthy schools will not have their funding reduced. Even schools which are operating at twice the level, or more, of resources in government schools are guaranteed $597 per primary student and $829 per secondary student per 
 year. No school will be worse off than at present. If their SES puts them below the current funding, then the SES will be ignored.
Even DETYA admits that only about 750 of the 2,500 non-government sector schools will actually have their funding determined by their SES. All others will either be exempt or funded above the SES. This means in effect more money for the private schools. Between now and 2003, private schools will receive an increase in recurrent funding of $755.2 million; that is, about $418 million for Catholic schools and $338.2 million for other private schools. Government schools will in fact receive no increase.
When the coalition came to power in 1996, government schools got 54c of operational expenditure for every dollar spent on private schools; by 2003, they will get only 42c. Even the wealthiest primary schools will get about $72 more per student under the proposed scheme. The SES scheme is not a needs based model. It will create less equity, not more. The proposal is based upon creating equity of federal government inputs, not equity of resource provision. Schools will get the money regardless of their own financial situation. The school can then add on its own resources, whether they are accumulated reserves, bequests or even greater fundraising capacity, to advantage its students over those from similar backgrounds attending less advantaged schools.
This system is designed to undermine the public education system. Private schools will be able to lower their fees and attract even more students. It will encourage private schools to open campuses in less well off suburbs, cream off the best students from government schools and then claim a lower SES rating for all their students. Low fee private schools will get almost the same money as government schools. Wealthy private schools will be encouraged to poach the highest achieving students from government schools through scholarships. They will be able to keep expanding because they will always produce apparently better outcomes than schools that are not able to select who they teach. All this will mean that government schools will be robbed of even more by the 
 increase in the EBA—the enrolment benchmark adjustment.
This scheme is intended to ensure that public provision is basic. Any parent with aspirations that their child receive quality will be forced to pay, either through fees to private schools or through contributions to those government schools which are seeking to compete.
Let us have a look at the status of education, particularly in secondary schools, since 1996. We have had four years of hostility from the Howard government towards public education. In 1996, $350 million was cut from public education and private schooling was deregulated.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
These two reports deal with safety, rehabilitation and compensation within the Commonwealth work force. They are the three things which should be present in the workplace. There has not been enough emphasis on safety in recent times. If there is safety, then there is no need for compensation or, for that matter, for rehabilitation. There has been a 
 campaign in Victoria about safety, although unfortunately there have been more injuries down there than is desirable.
—Particularly with the Kennett government.
—Senator Quirke has mentioned the Kennett government. There is about to be a change in government in Victoria, Senator Quirke. The Premier-in-waiting, Mr Steve Bracks, has promised that emphasis will be given to safety in the workplace, to rehabilitation and to compensation, including a return to some degree at least to common law cases.
Common law, may I say, does two things: firstly, it is a dampener on employers taking risks, because the employer realises that, if somebody is injured in the workplace through his, her or its negligence, then they are going to have to pay for that negligence when it results in injury; and, secondly, it gives a reasonable return to the person who suffers injury. No doubt you will join with me, Senator Quirke and Senator Ludwig, in paying tribute to Mr Bracks and to those other members of the government-to-be of Victoria.
There are some graphs set out in the annual report from Comcare, and I would like to make some remarks about graph 15 and, on the same page, table 28. Graph 15 depicts the proportion of expenditure by injury group, 1996-97 to 1998-99, and table 28 depicts the percentage of expenditure by injury group, from the year 1991-92 to 1998-99. Both tables show that back injuries persist as the sorts of injuries that require expenditure. It is to be hoped that the Commonwealth will pay more attention than it apparently does at the moment to arranging the workplace so that people do not injure their backs and, if they do, that they are rehabilitated rapidly and compensated properly in the meantime.
The other injury that seems to have persisted from 1991-92 to 1998-99—in fact, it has grown—is stress. Stress is becoming more and more a factor. Stress is just as much an injury as a wound inflicted by some external force, and attention should be paid to it. It is an indication that the workplace is becoming a place where people are not able to live the 
 sorts of lives they ought to. This manifests itself in stress. I notice too that the occupational overuse syndrome category is one that persists. I talk to these two reports and exhort the Commonwealth to make greater efforts in terms of safety, rehabilitation and compensation for its employees.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Comcare</title>,Documents,18,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-10-19,"—I rise tonight to address an area of particular ongoing interest to me and one on which there are regular contributions by various senators in the chamber: the challenges that face people living in rural and regional Australia. Specifically, I want to look at some of the issues that confront rural families.
This government, since its election and for many decades before that, has had a longstanding commitment to families who live in rural and regional Australia, most recently developed through the launching of a National Families Strategy. That announcement, which was partly in response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, included the establishment of a new Marriage and Family Council. The strategy will focus on the different life stages of families and their different needs through those stages.
Announcements were made in the last budget of a pilot voucher scheme for marriage and relationship education services and also for men and relationship education services. These are very important developments and I think are a valuable step forward in an important policy area. I receive a huge number of constituent inquiries in relation to issues of family breakdown, domestic violence, family law and a range of the other concerns that surround this area. Those constituents of mine are members of families of every size and description, from the most traditional to the so-called unorthodox. They have concerns which impact significantly on their day-to-day lives.
Some of the strongest concerns that are expressed come from families living in rural and regional areas of New South Wales, in relation to the particular challenges they face. Recently, I addressed questions of the challenges faced by people in those areas. For example, I have touched on the challenges facing rural women in accessing new technologies and the impact of mental health difficulties on young Australians, amongst other things. But they are only some of the issues that concern many Australians, espe 
 cially those who are not in the metropolitan areas, on a daily basis. These issues challenge those who live outside metropolitan areas in particular ways that often differ from the challenges faced by their counterparts who do live in metropolitan areas.
The differences between the situation of families in regional as opposed to metropolitan New South Wales are significant. There are statistical indicators of the income and expenditure differences between families in rural and regional Australia and those in metropolitan locations which are indicative of that. For example, according to the ABS figures of 1993-94, metropolitan households earn, on average, $783.14 while those outside the metropolitan areas earn $614.71. Of those living outside metropolitan locations, a total of 16.7 per cent of their income is derived from government pensions and allowances, compared with 11.4 per cent for those living in the cities.
 On average, households in metropolitan areas spend $83.94 per week on recreation, compared with $71 in rural areas. Households in rural areas spend markedly less on personal care and less on clothing and footwear. So the picture that emerges from those figures is of two households: one in, say, suburban Sydney earning more than their regional counterpart in Albury or Armidale in New South Wales, spending more of that income on relaxing, looking after themselves and being less reliant on government for financial support. I recognise that these figures are averages, but it is not necessarily a welcome comparison that they provide.
 The challenges that families do face in non-metropolitan areas of New South Wales are not always financial. The concerns of many of my constituents who come to me relate to less tangible issues, such as their quality of life. They relate to matters like access to quality health care in rural and regional New South Wales. This is an issue that has received significant attention through the launch of a new plan to improve rural health across Australia.
As senators may be aware, this plan, Healthy Horizons, is a partnership between the Commonwealth, the states, the territories and 
 the National Rural Health Alliance. It includes commitments to improve highest health priorities, concentrating effort where health is poor; to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in rural, regional and remote Australia; to maintain a skilled and responsive health work force; to develop needs based, flexible funding arrangements for rural, regional and remote Australia; and to achieve recognition of rural, regional and remote health as an important component of the Australian health system.
 In that area, one of the particular issues raised is access to doctors. I have heard many stories of the problems faced by communities that do not have the same access to doctors as those in the cities and which are often not even able to attract a single practitioner to their towns. There are real challenges in attracting and retaining GPs in rural communities. At present, about half the general practitioners who move to rural areas remain there for less than two years. The challenge in that area is partially to do with the perception that is held by doctors themselves about living and working outside the cities.
There is now some support available to assist in addressing the problem. In the last budget there was funding in excess of $43 million over four years for retention payments to encourage doctors to stay in rural and remote areas. There has been funding directed towards medical education, including the establishment of a medical school at James Cook University and a clinical school at Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga.
The University of Southern Cross, though, has also proposed the establishment of a postgraduate medical school at their campus in Lismore, New South Wales. Their aim is to address the shortage of doctors in northern New South Wales, where the problem is especially acute. In towns like Kyogle, which is just west of Lismore, there are five local GPs, but they are all about the same age. They are all about to retire, leaving the town's population quite probably without access to a GP.
The University of Southern Cross suggests that the problem can be approached by training local people and encouraging them to stay 
 in their local community, and it is an approach of which I am particularly supportive. That, in conjunction with other initiatives, like assisting rural medical students with their studies, is one answer to the complex question of addressing this issue on a long-term basis.
There is also the significant issue of family breakdown. It is difficult in any circumstance but often, if it occurs in rural areas to farming families, the problems are exacerbated. Recently while visiting a New South Wales rural town, I met with the coordinator of the local women's refuge. We talked about some of the problems that she and her workers faced every day. It is not surprising that you would hear someone like that speak about problems associated with mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse or domestic violence. But what is really interesting is the way those problems manifest in a small town. For example, anonymity and confidentiality is one of the most important safety concerns for women who enter a refuge. But in this town, the presence and location of the refuge is very well known. She told me a story of a man who arrived in town on a train, walked to the taxi rank and asked to be taken to the refuge. It is not surprising that the taxi driver knew the location of the refuge but what is of concern is that the gentleman could simply be delivered to the front door of the refuge, and it becomes a much more significant problem than you would otherwise expect. The location of refuges in cities is not a secret, but issues of confidentiality and safety are perhaps a little easier to manage among a larger and more diverse population. There are real safety and ongoing effectiveness concerns about the operation of those organisations in rural Australia.
I have also been approached about intergenerational farming and property settlement in the case of family breakdown, particularly in relation to a husband and wife who are divorcing and have to look at a very complex property settlement. The concern particularly raised with me recently was about the property in question having been in the ownership of a family for several generations. A family breakdown or divorce is a difficult circumstance to endure at best, but when 
 compounded by the threat of losing your property, held and looked after by your parents and your grandparents before them, the problems are heightened. It is a complex property situation that many city residents may find hard to relate to. Balancing the contributions of both partners in a relationship with an eye to generational contributions is fraught with difficulty.
We have sought to address the broader issue of intergenerational farming outside of circumstances involving family breakdown, and the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, part of the Agriculture Advancing Australia initiative, allows older farmers to gift up to $500,000 of farm assets to younger generations and to access the age pension. But it is a much broader issue than that.
Earlier this year the Attorney-General announced plans to implement family law reforms to ensure greater certainty in property settlements, to allow people to make binding financial arrangements about their property before marriage, during marriage and on the dissolution of marriage. It is the hope of many of us who have paid particular attention to this issue, either through personal involvement or otherwise, that legislation introduced as a result of that announcement might improve the situation.
There are other issues of significant concern to rural families: finding jobs for their children in small towns; arresting the alarming rate of youth suicide, particularly amongst young men; and dealing with new emerging technologies and their impact. But the sentiment most often expressed to me by families in these areas is their commitment to solving these problems as a family and as a community.
Anyone who has ever spent much time in a small town or regional area will be aware of the strong sense of community. While it may have been eroded by contemporary developments, there still remains a sense of assurance which is not always visible in metropolitan areas.
