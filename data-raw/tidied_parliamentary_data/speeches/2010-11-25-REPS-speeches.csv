"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 22 November 2010, namely: External expansion to the Abacus Childcare Centre at the Treasury Building.
The National Capital Authority has received a works approval application from the Department of the Treasury for an external expansion to the Abacus Childcare Centre at the Treasury Building. The proposed extension involves extending the existing southern playground, reconfiguring the access arrangements to the playground, and associated landscape works. Approval of both houses is sought under section 5(1) of the Parliament Act 1974 for the proposed works in the Parliamentary Zone. I commend this motion to the House.

That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following items of private members’ business being reported from the Main Committee, or called on, and considered immediately in the following order:
Motion relating to a Joint Select Committee on Broadband—report from the Main Committee;
Motion relating to Special Disability Trusts—report from the Main Committee;
Order of the day No. 8—motion relating to climate change; and
Motion relating to mental health—report from the Main Committee.
For the benefit of the House, I also table a letter from the federal member for Maranoa, along the lines of the following:
Dear Minister—
addressed to me as Leader of the House—
Regarding the planned vote tomorrow on my Private Member’s Motion of 18 October 2010, I believe that the substance of the Motion has been addressed by the Health Minister’s request for the House Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to conduct an inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors. As such I do not believe a vote in the House is necessary.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I move, as an amendment to the motion of the Leader of the House:
That the following words be added to the motion:
“And (2) that the private Members’ business item No. 3, national curriculum motion standing in the name of the member for Sturt on the Notice Paper be returned from the Main Committee and considered immediately.”
The reason I move this amendment to the motion put by Leader of the House is that the issue of the national curriculum is a matter that is quite time specific. The motion, as some members may recall, seeks to delay the start date for the national curriculum from January 2011 to January 2012. I will go into the reasons for that a little bit later, although I do not intend to keep the House at great length. But I do believe that some of the reasons why the national curriculum needs to be delayed for 12 months need to be explained to the House. In moving this amendment, can I explain, particularly to the crossbenchers, the reasons why this motion is necessary. This amendment is necessary because the Selection Committee has gone through its process of asking the government to list motions and bills for voting. The Leader of the House has indicated today that there are four items that will be voted upon this morning. One is the joint select committee on broadband as proposed by the member for Wentworth, the special disability trusts as proposed by the member for Pearce, the member for Reid’s motion on climate change, and the member for Dickson’s motion on mental health.
There are a number of other motions and bills that the opposition would like to have had voted upon and the government has indicated that votes will not be scheduled in government business today. There are reasons that the government has made that decision and the opposition has some issues with that, but I will not reprise all of those as we went through them last week. But I would particularly point the crossbenches to the
Hansard
from last Thursday’s sitting, where the Leader of the House, in asking members not to support a motion from the opposition to list matters for voting last Thursday, said to the House:
This morning I spoke to the Manager of Opposition Business and we agreed that this amendment he is moving was not necessary and that these votes would occur next Wednesday—
which was yesterday; they were the votes on mental health and the National Broadband Network committee—
I agreed with him this morning that we would split the votes so that the two items he wanted this morning would be voted on next Wednesday and the other items would be voted on next Thursday.
The other items that were discussed and are in the
Hansard
record of that day were: the flying foxes bill of the member for Cowper; the PPL or pay clerk bill of the member for Dunkley; the national curriculum motion that I have moved; the asylum seekers and Inverbrackie motion, which the member for Mayo has moved; and the insulation data motion, which the member for Flinders moved. So in that debate last Thursday it was very clear that the other items that the opposition wanted to have voted upon today were a motion on insulation data, a motion on the national curriculum, a motion on Inverbrackie and the new detention facility there, the flying foxes bill of the member for Cowper and the bill to do with the pay clerk system, as proposed by the member for Dunkley. That is quite clear in black and white in
Hansard
and, I repeat, the Leader of the House said:
I agreed with him this morning that we would split the votes so that the two items he wanted this morning would be voted on next Wednesday and the other items would be voted on next Thursday.
So he has said that those two items, mental health and the National Broadband Network, would be voted on yesterday—it did not happen—and that the other five items that the opposition wanted to be voted upon would be voted upon today, and that has not happened. Instead, the government has pushed the votes from yesterday into today and is saying that the votes that were to be held today will be held next February.
The government has the power to list items on the agenda in government business time and, obviously, when the Leader of the House makes a statement in black and white in
Hansard, the opposition is entitled to believe that that is a commitment that he will keep. It has not been kept on this occasion, because those five items we discussed last Thursday are not listed for voting this morning. I accept that the government has the numbers to decide what the agenda will be, but I do on this occasion ask the crossbenches to consider this very important point: if the national curriculum motion is not voted upon today—it is supposed to have effect in January 2011, so voting on it in February 2011 will be something of a pointless exercise—it will be something of a dead letter. And I see that the Leader of the House laughs and smiles and thinks it is terribly funny.
The point is that there are very good reasons why the government should not be let off the hook on the national curriculum. And do not take just my word for it. People should listen perhaps to this extraordinary group of people: 13 representatives of educationalists around Australia who would not normally line up together, groups like the Australian Association for Research in Education, the Australian College of Educators, the Australian Council for Educational Leaders, the Australian Curriculum Studies Association and the Australian Education Union—Angelo Gavrielatos and the Australian Education Union have lined up with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia.

Mr Albanese interjecting—
—The point I am making, Leader of the House, is that this group of 13 are so concerned about the curriculum starting in January that they have banded together. The Independent Schools Association has banded together with the Australian Education Union, the Australian Primary Principals Association, the Australian Professional Teachers Association, the Australian Secondary Principals Association and the Independent Education Union of Australia. So the AEU’s competition, the Independent Education Union, has signed a letter with the AEU. You cannot get them together in a room and yet they have signed this letter about the national curriculum. The National Education Forum and the Association of Principals of Catholic Secondary Schools have lined up with the AEU and the chief executive officer of Principals Australia to sign a letter saying:
We believe the timeline for the project must be extended to ensure that the Australian curriculum is as good as it can be. The timelines for all stages of the project at present are unreasonably short and in the end this will be self defeating. The consultation timelines do not allow enough time to provide considered detailed feedback and do not allow the voices of teachers and other stakeholders to be heard. The speed of the development process is contrary to what is known about the conditions for effective professional development practices and educational change. It was noted that schools require time for both evaluation of the curriculum documents after they are provided and planning for their effective implementation. This will also require an extension of time.
So this group of 13, who would normally never join together, have asked the parliament to delay the national curriculum for 12 months. I appeal to the Greens in particular, who get a lot of support from the Australian Education Union, to recognise that, if we do not vote on this curriculum motion today, by February next year it will be a dead letter. And I remind the members for New England and Lyne that the New South Wales Board of Studies—not the government of New South Wales, which is pretty rancid—has indicated that there is no way the national curriculum can begin in January 2011. The New South Wales government is not going to sign on to it—from his own state of New South Wales. There are schools in the electorates of the members for Lyne and New England that are asking for this curriculum to be delayed so that it can be gotten right rather than be gotten in.
The Western Australia government has indicated it will not start the national curriculum. The Tasmanian government has indicated it will not start the national curriculum. The Victorian government has indicated the same thing. The only state that has indicated it will begin the national curriculum in January 2011 is South Australia—

Mr Briggs interjecting—

Mr Secker interjecting—
—our shocking government in South Australia, Member for Mayo and Member for Barker. The South Australian Labor government is the only government in Australia that has indicated it will start the national curriculum. So what the opposition are saying, and asking the crossbenchers to support, is: let the government off the hook, let the minister for schools off the hook, and pass this motion.
But we cannot vote on this motion unless we first vote on my amendment to the motion by the Leader of the House to suspend standing orders. I am asking the crossbenchers to walk across the aisle with the opposition and vote in favour of this amendment so that, once the amendment is passed, we can vote on the national curriculum. I know that there are members on the cross benches who want to vote for the national curriculum motion and I know there are members who do not want to vote for the national curriculum motion, but there is nothing to stop the crossbenchers from voting to allow the vote to occur. It is part of the democratic process.
I am sorry that the government has not listed this for voting and I am sorry that in the Selection Committee process—which in some respects is still finding its trainer wheels in a hung parliament, as the Speaker himself has indicated in this place; that is the same for all of us in this new hung parliament—it was not clear that we wanted this vote to occur on this day. But I am asking the crossbenchers on this particular occasion, because this motion is time specific, to walk across the aisle—member for New England—with the opposition and allow this vote to occur. I know you want to, member for New England, and it is a very easy thing to do. It is just two metres across the aisle.
I will not hold up the business of the House for any longer. I know there is a great deal that needs to be done. I have moved the amendment that the national curriculum be added to the list of votes that will occur this morning and I would ask the parliament to seriously consider it and then allow the vote on the national curriculum.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I rise to speak against the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business. It is important to outline to the parliament what this amendment is and what it is not. What it is not is a vote on the substance of the private member’s motion moved by the member for Sturt. That is what it is not, in spite of the fact that he spoke passionately about his views on that subject. What it is about is a vote on upholding the processes that we have established in this House to ensure the orderly running of the House of Representatives, particularly given the reforms that we have put in place to allow for voting on private members’ motions and private members’ bills.
The member for Sturt outlined—selectively—what I said on Thursday, 18 November 2010. He indicated correctly that last week there was a debate when he moved an amendment to the motion for the suspension of standing orders in this chamber. He outlined correctly the fact that I certainly considered I had an agreement with him, reached at 10 minutes to nine last week, that we would have, of the five motions that were to be voted upon today, two of them on Wednesday and three of them on Thursday. That was the offer that I made to him; that was the agreement that he made. He then walked in here and broke that agreement and moved that it be brought on immediately. That is what occurred last Thursday—he broke the understanding that was there, given at 10 minutes to nine.
During that debate I made it very clear, and the House of Representatives
Hansard
of Thursday, 18 November 2010, on page 5, records me saying this:
… the minutes of the meeting of the Selection Committee, signed by the chair, Harry Jenkins, and dated 17 November 2010, say in writing:
The committee recommended that the following items of private member’s business orders of the day be voted on:
Mental Health (resumption of debate from 25 October 2010 on motion of Mr Dutton);
Joint Select Committee on Broadband (resumption of debate from 25 October 2010 on motion of Mr Turnbull);
Overseas Trained Doctors (resumption of debate from 18 October 2010 on motion of Mr Scott);
Special Disability Trusts (resumption of debate from 18 October 2010 on motion of Ms Moylan); and
Climate change notice of motion given by Mr Murphy on 15 November 2010.
This is what I said last Thursday:
What does that tell you? It tells you that there are five items of business to be voted upon next week and that four of those five are from the opposition, none are from the crossbenchers and only one is from the government.
That is what I told the parliament last week would happen this week. So there was proper notice in accordance with the recommendation of the Selection Committee.
What we have determined and agreed upon is that the Selection Committee will meet. The Selection Committee met on Tuesday, 23 November, and determined the following items would be voted on: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010, moved by the member for Cowper; a motion on the detention facility at Inverbrackie, moved by the member for Mayo; a motion on the national curriculum, moved by the member for Sturt; and a motion on the home insulation program, moved by the member for Flinders.
Two days ago, on Tuesday, we determined there will be four votes when the parliament comes back, in the first sitting week, all of them from the coalition—100 per cent. Today, we had five items listed—one of them was withdrawn by the member for Maranoa—four of them from the coalition. The majority of the private members’ bills and motions overwhelmingly have been items from the coalition. We are scheduling the votes in an orderly way. I just moved two bills on the National Broadband Network. I moved them today, they get placed here, we have a second reading, then debate commences a week later—when we come back on the Tuesday after the caucuses meet.
This resolution by the member for Sturt attempts to not give private members’ business equal status but greater status than government bills,
even though, when this motion is debated, voted upon and carried, it will not have an effect on government policy. It is simply a motion indicating a view of the House of Representatives. That is all it is. If the member for Sturt’s motion is carried, and if we have these debates every Thursday and we divide on these motions, we will be saying as a House of Representatives that these private members’ motions are of more significance than the national legislation coming before this parliament, such as the NBN bills I moved this morning. We have to have proper processes and that is why we have motions and bills introduced at one time, determined they will be voted upon and then a time set out for them. Every one of those four items will be voted upon on Thursday, 10 February 2011. We know that will occur. The reason that has to happen is that, if we are going to take private members’ motions and bills seriously, we have to treat them with some respect. We have to be able to examine them, to have discussions about them, to consult with our constituents and with our political organisations about them.

Particularly for those who sit on the crossbenches, it will simply be untenable if members are able to come in here and move suspensions to bring forward debates at any time. It may well be that they have already settled on a view on the motion moved by the member for Sturt. That is not the point. The point is that you cannot have an orderly running of this House in this way. It is not the government’s fault, nor is it the fault of the crossbench members of the Selection Committee if the coalition members who sit on the Selection Committee did not attend the Selection Committee prior to Tuesday 23 November—two days ago—to ask that votes be held on these items. That is not the government’s responsibility. That is why the member for Sturt apologised and said he was sorry about his own political organisation’s handling of this item.
It is significant that the member for Sturt has moved only one of these items—his own. There is no amendment about the member for Mayo’s motion, no amendment about the member for Flinder’s motion and no amendment about the member for Cowper’s private member’s bill because the member for Sturt knows that this is a trial. He knows that, if the vote was to be held this week, the appropriate time would have been last week’s Selection Committee meeting, not that of two days ago. I think we should get on with the votes being held today that were foreshadowed very clearly last week. The five items were outline there. Unless we do that, we will not be able to have appropriate processes before this House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Motions,6,1
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—As always, the Leader of the House comes across quite persuasively but I point out the fallacy in his argument about the proper order of government business. When the government has the second reading debate,
the vote is immediate; whereas this government has brought in this fallacious idea that when private members’ business is debated there must be at least a week between the vote. Why is private members’ business any different from government business? It is not. The opposition have agreed to the suggestion that the debate be delayed to the next Thursday sitting of the parliament, so that we can have ordered votes on the Thursday. But this government is trying to say, ‘You have to wait another week after the debate is completed.’ This is a fallacious argument. If we have had the debate and the debate is finished, we could argue whether or not to put it to a vote.

All we are saying is that we should be able to vote on these motions when the debate has been completed in this parliament. In fact, on this occasion it has been completed for over a week. We would hope that the crossbenchers would support us in a very time-sensitive motion to have this voted on. As those on the Select Committee would know, we asked for the vote this Thursday and, just as the Prime Minister said during the week, the Selection Committee does not have the power to set a vote. However, this chamber does have the power to choose when we vote on a debate which has already been completed. I would implore those on the crossbenches to make sure that the parliament can vote on something that is so time sensitive that it would be worthless to defer it until next year.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Motions,6,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2010-11-25,"—On the substantive motion referred to by the member for Sturt on the national curriculum, if and when it comes before the House, it is something that I would be inclined to support, so I would have an interest in its coming forward. I find strange things happen when I say I agree that the member for Sturt puts forward some good reasons. I know that the Australian Education Union has raised concerns about the national curriculum, and they are real concerns that do need to be explored. But I cannot support the amendment he has moved today. There is a sense of deja vu here: I recall making a similar speech to the House last week. I accept that there will be on occasions some matters that are so critically time sensitive that we will need to consider amendments such as this, but this motion has been around for some time and there has been ample opportunity to request that it be voted on. I do not know that I can speak on behalf of all of the people on the crossbench, but speaking for myself we do have an interest in there being an orderly process to ensure that private members’ bills and motions come on and are voted on in an orderly fashion. To the extent that that system works, that is a system that I would seek to support. On that basis, I indicate that I will be supporting that motion, but I cannot support the amendment.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Motions,6,1
"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2010-11-25,"—As a procedure wonk and someone who has a fair bit of skin in the game with the reforms that have happened over the last couple of months, I do want to put on the record the short history of what we have been able to achieve as a House of Representatives collective. In the majority we have done some good work in getting up and running in a relatively short period of time a better parliament than we had before. I thank all members for that, as it is the last sitting day, and take the opportunity to encourage that to continue. In that context, the Standing Committee on Procedure is looking at the changes right now. I would strongly encourage those who might not be getting their way this week to make a submission to the Procedure Committee, because six weeks ago this was the exact reason why the argument that I was putting to the government—for private members to have control over the vote in regard to private members’ time—should have been a principle that was upheld.
If you go back to the record, what I was trying to achieve on behalf of all of us was to have a set period of time—I think the time allocated was a Monday afternoon—for what I called ‘cats and dogs’ votes, for votes to actually take place back to back in private members’ time and that the executive did not control the agenda; the parliament controlled the voting agenda. Unfortunately, though, there was not support from the opposition at that time. The position that the opposition did take was to support the government and say that, no, the executive should have control of when the votes happen. In my view, the continued and prevailing view that hopefully we are culturally changing, and somewhat slowly, is the belief of the opposition six weeks ago that you would not be able to run a government if the parliament had control of when the votes happen. I lost that vote six weeks ago.
We have established a process now, which is that the Selection Committee recommends to the Leader of the House, whoever that may be, that a certain bill or motion is ready to be voted upon. Then, at their discretion but as soon as possible, the Leader of the House and the executive make time for that vote to happen in government business time, as we are seeing this morning. If anyone goes back to when the standing orders were changed, they will see we made sure that the Leader of the House in his speech did verbalise that, and so we at least do have that on the record. To the credit of the Leader of the House, he has not broken that agreement to date, but we are watching closely. We now have a process established where, through the Selection Committee, we refer to the Leader of the House and as soon as possible, depending on the legislative agenda, we then have a vote. That is historic—we are getting votes on private members’ business. That is to everyone’s credit.
As it is the last week of sitting now, I think it would be in breach of the process we have established that we start a process of individual members seeking leave to achieve their own agenda. That would not make for a working parliament during 2011-12 in what are tight numbers. We have established that process; we should commit to that. If there is any reflection about the original suggestion of six weeks ago that we have a set time on a Monday or a Thursday for the ‘cats and dogs’ votes, I would be more than willing to support a submission that suggests that. I only wish that six weeks ago the coalition was supporting that, in which case we would not be having this debate today.

That the words proposed to be added (Mr Pyne’s) be so added.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Motions,6,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—This motion is to establish a joint select committee which will monitor and report on the construction, deployment and operation of the National Broadband Network throughout its life. This is the largest infrastructure project in our country’s history. It is being built without the benefit of a cost-benefit analysis, notwithstanding the government’s repeated claims that such analyses are absolutely vital for the proper construction and management of major infrastructure projects. Indeed, the government went so far as to establish Infrastructure Australia, a specialist body, precisely for the purpose of identifying and prioritising projects of this kind and providing cost-benefit analyses for them.
This joint standing committee is particularly vital given the government’s determination to prevent the NBN being even considered by the Public Works Committee. It is not interested in having any scrutiny of the NBN. It is not prepared to have it referred to the Productivity Commission for a cost-benefit analysis, and when after pressure from the Independents the Prime Minister backed down and produced a document yesterday described as a summary of the business case for the NBN, it did not contain any financial statements at all—no profit and loss figures, no cash flow statement, no balance sheet. There were 36 pages of warm words and a few numbers given out of context—numbers which I might say both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, seemed to completely misunderstand. We know that internet access prices have been coming down substantially year after year for the last decade but this document excludes from the promise of lower prices the basic service—which we understand to be a 12 megabit per second service—and that will inevitably be the service that the majority of households take up. The document that the Prime Minister was so proud of yesterday contradicts what she has said and what the minister has said about the NBN providing lower prices.
This committee should be supported by the crossbenches and also by the government, because the government in its deal with Senator Xenophon yesterday said it would support the establishment of a joint select committee to monitor the NBN. If it was fair dinkum about that commitment, if it really believed in ongoing scrutiny and oversight of the NBN by the parliament, it would support this motion. This motion does exactly, apparently, what the government has said to Senator Xenophon the government would do. I believe the government, having promised Senator Xenophon a joint select committee, is going to vote in this House today against this joint committee that we are seeking to establish.
The parliament is, so we read in the press, about to pass the NBN legislation in the Senate. It is going to do that without having seen a full business case, without the Prime Minister as of yesterday at least having read that business case, without the Treasurer, charged with the nation’s finances, having read the business case and without the parliament and the government having the benefit of any cost-benefit analysis. At no stage has the government asked the question: what is the most cost-effective method of delivering universal and affordable broadband? Every member of this parliament, and I believe all Australians, agree that we should have universal and affordable broadband. The question is, what is the most cost-effective way of delivering it? There can be no question, however, that the NBN is the most expensive way of delivering it—absolutely no question at all. Yet the government—having proceeded without any due diligence, without any scrutiny and without any reflection on the need to look after taxpayers’ money and bear in mind the many other claims on taxpayers’ money and the many other types of infrastructure that require support—has opted for the most expensive route and in doing so has trashed its own commitment to economic responsibility in terms of subjecting infrastructure projects to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
This committee cannot undertake a cost-benefit analysis but it can at least provide ongoing scrutiny. I commend the motion to the House and I commend it in particular to our friends on the crossbenches. If the government were serious, if the government were genuine, in its commitment to Senator Xenophon to establish a joint select committee on the NBN, it too would vote for this motion.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—by leave—I move:
That this House:
acknowledges the work of carers, and in particular ageing parents caring for profoundly disabled dependents;
recognises that ageing parent carers remain deeply concerned about the diminishing capacity to care for their dependent children;
appreciates the special challenges faced by families, and in particular ageing parents, who wish to make provision for the needs of their disabled dependents;
notes that:
disability trusts were established in September 2006 by the Coalition Government to assist families make provision for the future housing and care needs of dependents with severe disabilities;
despite the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs estimating that over four years, 5000 people with severe disability would benefit from Special Disability Trusts, as at 31 March 2010, 423 people have been assessed as eligible, and only 91 trusts have been established; and
since establishing Special Disability Trusts, it has become apparent that the conditions governing eligibility and management, as well as direct and wider taxation implications, have limited the workability and uptake of the trusts;
acknowledges that conditions diminishing the attractiveness of the trusts include the:
complex application of taxation rules;
inability for beneficiaries, through Special Disability Trusts, to claim the first home owners grant and other home saving initiatives;
high initial eligibility threshold requiring a beneficiary to be eligible for at least a Carer Allowance, the regulations of which state, inter alia, that care for a ‘significant period’ must be given, defined as at least 20 hours a week of care;
attribution of Capital Gains Tax to transferors where, in particular, houses are placed into Special Disability Trusts;
calls upon the Government to consider implementing specific eligibility criteria for mental impairment disabilities if the measures introduced in the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 do not increase uptake within 12 months; and
notes the Government’s good faith negotiations in relation to the recommendations of the October 2008 Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Report entitled: Building Trust, Supporting Families through Disability Trusts, acknowledges the commitment to further investigate outstanding issues to meet the future needs of people with profound disabilities and their carers

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2010-11-25,"—I move:
That paragraph 2 be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“(2)
requires the Government to:
expand ongoing primary health care programmes to target those in need, the vulnerable and long-term clientele working with the community and NGO sector;
provide alternatives to emergency department treatment such as multi-disciplinary community-based sub-acute services that supports ‘stepped’ (two-staged) prevention and recovery care;
establish a national network of one-stop shop community mental health centres;
provide additional training for GPs and nurses to triage mental health;
expand the number of headspace centres to a minimum of 90 nationally;
establish a national network of 20 EPPIC centres;
provide an additional 800 beds for mental health, associated with the EPPIC centres;
appropriate funds necessary to provide these critical steps to expanding mental health treatment facilities; and
immediately provide additional funds for existing headspace centres, respite treatment and primary health care programmes; and”
The Greens are strong supporters of mental health reform and increased funding to the sector. So we welcome the increased attention that has recently been given to the issue. Patrick McGorry works in my electorate a few minutes walk from my house and it was my pleasure to meet with him during the election campaign. I want to acknowledge the significant work that he and others have done to help put this issue on the national agenda.
Not only are the Greens big supporters of the headspace program, but we also want to see increased funding in a number of other important areas, including for primary healthcare programs to target those in need, the vulnerable and long-term clientele working with the community and NGO sector; providing alternatives to emergency department treatment such as multidisciplinary community-based subacute services that support ‘stepped’ prevention and recovery care; establishing a national network of one-stop shop community mental health centres; providing additional training for GPs and nurses to triage mental health; and respite treatment and primary healthcare programs.
To this end, we are seeking to amend the motion to add reference to these important areas, without deleting any words from the motion. Many people in my electorate have contacted my office and asked me to work for changes to this motion so it can receive wide support including from the Greens. These amendments have, I understand, the support of Professor McGorry and many others in the mental health sector. But, unfortunately, despite our approaches to the coalition, they have been unwilling to agree to these changes. We would have liked a more collaborative approach on this issue. This is an important issue that should stand above political partisanship and point-scoring.
The Greens have suggested increasing the level of investment in early intervention as well as putting investment into primary health care, which we know is absolutely essential, and into emergency services, which we also know is absolutely essential. We have suggested a special commission for mental health because we believe this issue is so significant that it needs it. We took to the election the suggestion of putting in place a minister responsible for mental health, and we are glad that the government has picked that up. We think that is a very good step in the right direction. What we need to do now is see the government’s commitment to mental health, and we need to see their investment. We agree with the opposition that we need to significantly increase investment in mental health, and there is absolutely no disagreement there.
So my plea to the government is: please invest in the level of resources that we need. We went to the election saying we needed an increase of at least $350 million a year. We agree with the opposition that ideally it would be more, so we have agreed with the proposition of increasing it and to call for $450 million a year—but not just on early intervention. We think ultimately you can have your cake and eat it too, which is why I ask the opposition one more time to please consider supporting our amendments.
What I am really worried about is that if we just say ‘early intervention’, the government will have a ticket to go: ‘Yes, we’ve invested in mental health; we’ve funded a few extra headspace and EPI centres. That’s it; we’ve done mental health.’ But they will not have fixed mental health. So, please, let us take a coordinated, comprehensive approach to funding mental health and invest in the services that are desperately needed, crucially including early intervention. Whilst we would have liked a more collaborative approach on this important issue, the Greens will pursue, if these amendments are not passed, a more comprehensive motion in the Senate and I hope that will gain the support of other parties and members when it is debated so that, instead of political point-scoring and a refusal to have real discussion between the parties on mental health, we can move towards a real united push towards better funding for a comprehensive plan for mental health.

"SPEAKER, The",NA,2010-11-25,"—In the consideration of private members’ business and on the motion moved by the member for Dickson on mental health, I have contributed to some confusion. I apologise, especially to the member for Melbourne, to whom for two weeks running I have caused some discomfort. I assure him that it is due to my incompetence rather than any other feeling that I might have. I note that in his contribution that he just concluded the member for Sturt indicated that after 18 years he is still learning about the way that this place works. I will make the same admission. I know that the member for Melbourne was acting in good faith on some very good advice that he had received, which he heeded but others did not. In calling the vote on the amendment by the member for Melbourne, two things happened. There is reason to believe that there was confusion in the minds of those in the House. I then contributed by not carrying out other steps of procedure that would have alerted the House to that confusion.
It is my wish, with the concurrence of the House, to proceed to put the motions again. I am in the hands of members of the House as to whether they are happy for that to occur. But I believe, on the basis there is evidence of a great deal of confusion, which I might add, a lot of us should not have had, that that is the best course of action. I propose to go back to the point that we were at, when the member for Melbourne had moved, and the member for Denison had seconded, quite a clear motion and when I had put as such: ‘That the original question’—that is, the motion moved by the member for Dickson—‘be agreed to; to this, the honourable member for Melbourne has moved, as an amendment, that paragraph 2 be omitted with a view to substituting other following words.’ According to the procedures and customs of this House I then proposed the question: ‘That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.’ It is now my intention to put that motion again and seek the wishes of the House on that motion.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
The
Native Title Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010
contains an important measure to complement and assist the government’s closing the gap agenda by facilitating the timely provision of quality public housing and associated infrastructure on land in Indigenous communities which is, or may be, subject to native title.
The government has a genuine commitment to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians and addressing Indigenous disadvantage. Housing is at the centre of this commitment.
It is vital to achieving the advances needed in health, education and employment participation outcomes for Indigenous Australians.
The government has committed an unprecedented $5.5 billion over 10 years to address historic underfunding of housing in remote Indigenous communities.
To ensure the new delivery model for Indigenous housing avoids the pitfalls of the past, secure tenure arrangements are now a requirement of all major investment in housing and other infrastructure. This makes government responsible and accountable for effective management and maintenance of these assets.
However, some state governments have indicated that uncertainty in relation to native title could be a barrier to meeting housing and service delivery targets. There is a risk this will create delays in the delivery of housing.
This bill introduces a new process specifically for public housing and a limited class of community facilities including education, health and emergency services facilities, and staff housing associated with these facilities.
It will apply primarily to acts of state, territory and local government bodies.
The new process strikes a balance between the need for these services and the need to engage meaningfully with native title parties and protect native title rights and interests.
It also contains important safeguards to ensure genuine consultation with native title parties.
The new process sets out reasonable and specific periods for comment and consultation, and provides flexibility to allow native title parties to choose the level of engagement they feel is appropriate for each individual project.
It will be subject to state and territory heritage processes.
The bill also enables the Attorney-General to prescribe how consultations with native title parties should occur, including general guidance on the issues to be included in consultation. This includes the capacity to set more detailed requirements such as face-to-face meetings and provision of interpreters.
The bill also requires that reports on consultation be provided to the Attorney-General as the responsible minister. The Commonwealth intends to make these reports public, providing for public scrutiny on the new process.
Acts covered by the new process will be invalid if there is a failure to notify, provide a consultation report or observe the minimum specified time periods. This ensures that a proper process is followed and that governments can then be certain that the investment has been validly applied.
Finally, the new process will sunset after 10 years.
The 10-year period approximates the duration of the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing under which the $5.5 billion to which I have referred has been committed.
The government is determined to continue on the course of resetting the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and to recognise and respect native title.
Alleviating poverty and improving housing and infrastructure in Indigenous communities is paramount to this effort and hence the reason for this bill, which I commend to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—The government makes big promises and therefore is responsible for epic policy failures. Indigenous housing is yet another one we can add to the list of this Labor-Greens alliance government, a government that has lost its way and failed Indigenous Australians.
I rise this morning to speak on the
Native Title Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010, the passage of which will deal with issues that could potentially delay house and infrastructure construction in Indigenous communities. The coalition will be supporting this bill. The bill is designed to overcome a range of delays associated with, and a number of uncertainties currently surrounding, land ownership in Indigenous communities, including the construction of housing and other associated infrastructure. The bill is a reintroduction of previous legislation introduced and passed by the House in November 2009, but which lapsed. As has been the case with so much of the government’s agenda, I am disappointed to note that this bill, despite being listed as non-controversial and despite being listed for debate on a number of occasions during this year, has only now been brought on, on this the last day of sitting for 2010.
The legislation creates an important new subdivision which provides for the timely construction, by the Crown, a local government authority or a statutory authority, of public housing and a limited class of public infrastructure for Indigenous people in communities on Indigenous held land. And whilst the Commonwealth will have the power to act in a timely way for the purpose of building housing, the irony is that the government’s Indigenous housing program has been anything but timely—another program riddled with delays and problems, another program that is delivering little actual benefit on the ground.
The new amendments enshrine provisions to ensure the relevant representative Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander body and any registered native title claimants in relation to the land where construction is proposed will be notified of the proposal and will have the opportunity to comment on acts that could affect native title. Importantly, this bill does not extinguish any native title and specifically provides for compensation for any impact on native title rights and interests.
Social dysfunction and poor health outcomes are directly associated with the state of disrepair of Indigenous communities and the government has undeniably failed these communities. We must tackle housing overcrowding and the state of disrepair of much of the infrastructure in remote Indigenous communities. We must address issues associated with failures in proper maintenance regimes and systems.
The new provisions in the act would operate for 10 years. This 10-year period is designed to match the 10-year funding period under the current national partnership agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on remote Indigenous housing and remote service delivery. I would remind the House that this agreement has, however, already been in place for two years—that is, since November 2008. And what have we seen in those two years? Very little. To give you an understanding of how inefficient the government has been in delivering this program, in the Northern Territory, the SHIP agreement has barely delivered 85 of the promised 750 new houses.
It seems that the government is all talk and no action on Indigenous housing. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was big on talking. He talked and talked and talked. He promised, he committed, he proclaimed. But he did not deliver. He failed. This program has been nothing short of a disgraceful failure of government administration. The most concerning thing is that we have gone from the Rudd-Gillard government—one dominated by inaction and epic program administration failures—to the Labor-Greens alliance, where the extremist Greens have an open door to setting the agenda.
The coalition reaffirms its disappointment at the failure of the government in managing and delivering Indigenous housing projects. This bill will mean that the government’s excuses will have to stop. There can be certainty that there are no inhibitors to delivering Indigenous housing projects. The coalition supports this bill and I commend it to the House.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—It could be anywhere in Australia: a young, vulnerable apprentice hairdresser nervously signs her first full-time apprenticeship contract with a hair salon. Yet after six months her boss turns to her and says: ‘You know that employment contract you signed? Well, it actually stipulates that you only work 15 hours a week, not full-time. Thanks for coming in and working for 25 hours a week, but we don’t have to pay you for those extra 10 hours. You’ve worked those in error. That’s not what’s written on the contract. Please pay me back thousands of dollars.’
This House, the media and in fact all of Australia would be appalled at a story like that. We would go into meltdown. But in fact that is what is happening on a regular basis to employers in this country, who can find themselves paying for hours of work that have not been done simply because there is an error in a contract. It does not matter what is in the letter of employment in some cases, even if it stipulates clearly that a minimum of 15 hours a week will be worked.
I would ask that Fair Work Australia take a fairer approach and appreciate that if in essence there has been an error in a contract by a third-party then employers should not be compelled to pay back thousands and thousands of dollars for hours that simply have not been worked by an employee. We should be doing the right thing. In cases where there has been reliance on a third party to complete the contract correctly there should not be a penalty on an employer. It should not drive people away from employing young workers in the future. We need a more balanced approach with the handling of these disputes.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Statements by Members,20,1

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I will begin on a more sombre note by talking about a few crucial issues facing everyday Australians and then I will perhaps join in the Christmas cheer and focus on exactly what might be under the Labor Party Christmas tree this year. During the course of question time and afterwards, I thought this parliament moved away from the concerns that everyday Australians have about meeting some of the challenges of the Christmas period.
It remains unanswered why so many Australians feel that they are doing it tough at the moment. When economic data is presented about the unemployment rate of just over five per cent and GDP growth of over three per cent, Australians are perceived to be doing extremely well, but everyday Australians feel it is getting tougher. When they look at the bills they receive at home they see that electricity prices have risen 12½ per cent this year, water and sewerage prices are up nearly 13 per cent, gas prices are up nearly 10 per cent, childcare prices are up over seven per cent, hospital and medical service prices are up seven per cent, postal service prices are up 6½ per cent, property rates and charges are up over six per cent, and education prices are up nearly six per cent.
Even though they have perhaps received a wage increase of around two to three per cent, Australians are still asking why they are worse off. It is because everyday costs are not properly factored into the inflation data. The prices of everyday things that they cannot avoid, such as gas, water, education and health, are rising by far more than the official inflation indicator suggests.
Audiovisual and computing equipment fell over 20 per cent. That is not something Australians buy every day. Pensioners do not buy a new television set once a year. I know that Gerry Harvey and others have been complaining about cheaper goods online, but I say, ‘All strength to the consumer’ if they can get cheaper goods elsewhere. Even though it is difficult for shop owners, I say to those people, ‘The consumers are the ones who are hurting at the moment and without a consumer there is no retail business.’
This government just does not get it when it comes to these key figures. It does not understand that the Australian people on a day-to-day basis feel that they are worse off. If the government did understand that it would not be so self-indulgent in focusing on its own ructions and inner debates; instead, the government would be focusing on structural tax reform and getting the budget deficit down.
As the chief economist of HSBC, someone who worked at the Reserve Bank for 12 years until recently, said this week in an op-ed in the
Financial Review, ‘If the government is serious about taking upward pressure off interest rates, it will cut its own budget and cut dramatically.’ But the government is not serious. We have laid down, as the shadow minister for finance said, $50 billion of detailed spending cuts. That is our Christmas gift to the Labor Party. We on this side of the House have the courage to say, ‘Here is a list of $50 billion of cuts that you can make to the budget that we will not oppose because we are so desperately concerned about the capacity of our nation to fund itself over the next few years.’ We are prepared to make the hard yards but the government has not got the courage to do it. Instead it is focused on its own workings.
What we know is that, in the great tradition of the Labor Party and in the great tradition of previous state Labor governments, they will have no limit on their Christmas spending this year. When they give gifts to each other they will say, ‘There are no spending limits. We’ll do whatever we can.’ So you can imagine Christmas Day at the Lodge and the Prime Minister and her spouse running to the Christmas tree wondering what is there from Santa. I thought to myself, what would the Prime Minister be looking for this Christmas? I know what the Prime Minister will be looking for. The Prime Minister will be looking for a series of electronic ankle bracelets with a GPS tracking device for Kevin Rudd and Bill Shorten so that she can keep an eye on them during the course of 2011. They will be piping the footage straight through to the Sony BRAVIA 42-inch TV set in the Lodge and she will be watching everything they are doing during 2011, and I bet she will have a data back-up service in Altona, having converted the house for servers. What would the Deputy Prime Minister want for Christmas? Well, I have brought him a present. It has nice pink wrapping. I was thinking, what would the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, be wanting this Christmas?

Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—
—Funny you should say that! I got old Swanny
Economics for Dummies. It has an Australian introduction by Lindsay Tanner which starts with the words, ‘With some frustration I welcome this authoritative guide for my Labor colleagues.’ But I would not leave it just to one book. As the Treasurer is so concerned about the Greens at the moment, I did a little search on Amazon.com and I came up with a new copy of Tom Gorman’s authoritative text,
The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Economics. It is on sale for $12.89. In fact, I am not giving it to him. It is to be for the Greens as an authoritative text on economics. And do you know what? It also has an introduction by Lindsay Tanner which says: ‘With some frustration I welcome this authoritative guide for my Greens colleagues.’
But what would you give the Minister for Foreign Affairs? I am sure that with the help of the Leader of the Opposition we could give him a signed copy of
Lazarus, because beating in the bosom of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the hope that just one day he can do what his predecessor did and come back from the dead and lead his political party. But, not to be outdone with the Christmas cheer, we have the Assistant Treasurer to consider. I was rather hoping the Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten, would be here. I thought, what would you give the Assistant Treasurer? What would Santa Claus give the Assistant Treasurer for Christmas? I thought there was only one thing you would give the Assistant Treasurer and that would be something from Peter’s of Kensington, not Ken’s of Kensington. I found a six-piece Grosvenor Bisteca steak knife set. When I looked up the sale value of it, I saw this:
Looking for the kind of cutlery that makes a statement?
Even though Grosvenor has been making beautiful, quality cutlery since 1928, they’re not stuffy and dull … far from it, actually! You’ll love the fresh, modern, funky designs Grosvenor has to offer. They’re not at all ordinary …
Our Bill’s not ordinary! It continues:
When it comes to steak, sometimes your average knife just won’t cut it.
But wait, there’s more. We cannot leave the four horsemen of the apocalypse out of it: Senator Mark Arbib, Senator David Feeney, Paul Howse—we will get to him in a minute—and Senator Don Farrell. I will start with Senator Arbib. What would you give him? Well, Senator Arbib likes knives, not just at the Golden Century in Sussex Street. He is someone who is an avid reader, particularly of polls. When it comes to Christmas cheer, Santa, my colleagues and I would like to give him a copy of Toby Young’s
How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. In fact, he could have been the co-author of that one. You can buy it on Amazon for $6. But, not to be outdone, you would ask, ‘What would you give the other faceless men: Senator Feeney, Senator Farrell and Paul Howse?’ I believe they deserve a facial from the Ella Bache College of Skin and Beauty Therapy in North Sydney. I am prepared to chip in. It says:
Radiance Intensive Eye Express Facial Treatment
A gentle massage and botanical peel-off mask make this the ultimate anti-ageing treatment for puffiness, dark circles and fine lines.
And do you know what? That is only $28 for 45 minutes. So far I have been operating within a budget, which is what the coalition does; we operate within a budget. But, hang on, there’s one more.
It has been NBN week in this place, hasn’t it? I thought to myself: what would you give Senator Stephen Conroy, the minister for communicating confusion?
—A business plan.
—A business plan was one suggestion. You can readily buy one off Amazon for a lot less than $50 billion, but there is only one thing that I would give the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy this year. It is a DVD copy of
The Cable Guy. It was a 1996 film. That was a great year, not just for the production of
The Cable Guy. On Rotten Tomatoes they describe the DVD as:
… a lonely and disturbed cable guy raised on television who just wants a new friend, but his target … rejects him.
The good thing about this gift is that you can buy it on eBay for 99c if you get in early. That could be a starting bid.
When it comes to Christmas cheer, the Labor Party will indulge. As they have done over the course of the last year, they will partake in their own indulgent dialogue where they will focus on whether Kevin was robbed or whether Julia deserved her position. Over the last 12 months it has been the coalition, under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, that has shown formidable discipline and a formidable focus on the interests of everyday Australians. Everything we have done, everything we have said, every policy we have presented has been focused on the Australian people. We have done so with an unqualified commitment to improve the lot of the people, to give them more opportunity to put more money in their pockets, to give them more certainty and stability in an uncertain time. What we have done is present to the Australian people—at the election and beyond—policies that put in place, that lay down, a sustainable future for our nation. It goes back to the fundamentals of what Australians are going to go through this Christmas when they actively consider whether they have enough money to buy their children the sorts of presents their children want. How can it be like that in a prosperous nation, a nation in the most bountiful period arguably in its history? How can it be that so many Australians will wonder whether they can afford the desires and the aspirations of their children this Christmas?
It is because Australians are not confident under Labor leadership. They are not confident that tomorrow is going to be better than today. They are not confident that they can take a risk. They are worried about tomorrow’s bills. They are worried about how they are going to pay today’s bills. It is only the coalition that is prepared to do the hard yards. It is only the coalition that is prepared to state emphatically that we are focused on the Australian people, that we are focused on the family budgets, that the rules that apply to the family budget of not spending more than you have as income should be applied to the national budget as well. If you as a government do not make hard decisions now when you have the best terms of trade in 50 years, when you have unemployment of around five per cent, when you have inflation under three per cent and when you have economic growth above trend, you will never have the courage to make the hard decisions when they will be absolutely necessary.
If you want to look at what happens when you have not got the courage to make hard decisions, pick up a newspaper and look at what is happening in Ireland today, pick up a newspaper tomorrow and have a look at Portugal or Spain or get yesterday’s newspapers and have a look at what has happened in Greece, because the only reason Australia has any confidence today is that the coalition has done the hard yards in the past and, as of today and into the future, we will do the hard yards again for the Australian people.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—As this is one of the last debates before we head off for the Christmas period, can I wish all members—colleagues on both sides of the House—a very merry Christmas and trust that they have a great new year and come back safe and sound. This is a revealing debate because the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, talked about indulgent dialogue. For people listening to this broadcast across Australia or people watching this in the public gallery, it will not have gone unnoticed that he spent the first 13 minutes of his contribution cracking jokes and talking about the other side and only spent the last two minutes of his speech talking about cost of living.
He said that Australians are doing it tough and that there are cost-of-living pressures, and he is dead right. You cannot be the member for Blaxland and not understand that and not appreciate that, because when cost-of-living pressures bite, when interest rates rise and mortgages get harder to pay it is in the electorate that I represent in Western Sydney that it is often felt harder than most. But there is also another important point to make here, and that is that you cannot pay the mortgage if you do not have a job. There would be a lot more people this Christmas sitting around the Christmas tree without the opportunity to buy presents for their children or to think about a holiday up or down the coast if it was not for the action that this government took.
It is important for us from time to time to remember the position that Australia was in two years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Who here would have expected that today we would be talking about an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent? Who here would have predicted that MYEFO would say that unemployment will go down to 4.5 per cent? At a time when unemployment in Europe is near 10 per cent and unemployment in the United States is close to 10 per cent, unemployment here in Australia is at 5.4 per cent.
In the last 12 months we have created more than 300,000 jobs. This is a remarkable figure and it is a testament to the strength of the economy and the decisions that we have made. To put this into perspective, you need to understand the challenge that Australia would have confronted if we had gone into recession and unemployment had gone up to the level it is in Europe or in the United States. I state this for members and everybody listening to this broadcast to reflect upon: if unemployment had gone to 10 per cent, like it is in the United States, it would have taken us five or maybe 10 years to get that unemployment rate back to where we are now with all the catastrophe of people losing their jobs and perhaps never going back into full-time employment again.

Our success, though, brings its own challenges and its brings us to the focus of this debate. Because we did better than any other advanced economy in the world, we now face the challenges of recovery before any other advanced economy in the world. One of those is skills shortages in a tight labour market. Another, invariably, will be interest rates. If the challenge of the last term of government was to avoid recession, then the challenge now is to manage growth. The budget update, MYEFO, makes that very clear. It shows that new engineering constructions are expected to grow by more than 16 per cent this financial year and by 21 per cent in the next financial year.
In the next financial year the mining industry is planning something like $55 billion in new investment. That is the highest it has been in over 40 years. That creates a lot of wealth and a lot of good news for people all around Australia, but it also brings a number of economic challenges. Meeting these challenges requires us to do a number of things. One of them is returning the budget to surplus as quickly as we can. You do this through a spending discipline, keeping spending at a capped growth level of two per cent. Another is making sure that election promises do not add a single dollar to the budget bottom line. We have done that. We made the promise that all the promises we made during the election campaign would be fully offset and they will be.
This is not just about spending. It is also about where and how you invest. If you want to keep inflation within the band of two to three per cent as we set for the Reserve Bank—this is a debate that will not end here today; it is a debate I am sure we are going to engage in over the course of the next 12 months and beyond—then the key to this is boosting our productivity. This means investing in things like skills and infrastructure. In short, if there is a shortage of skills in our economy, if there is a shortage of labour, if there is a shortage of infrastructure that business needs, then that economy cannot grow as fast as it wants to. An economy that cannot grow as fast as it wants to then creates price pressures. It pushes up prices, pushes up inflation and has a massive impact on interest rates.
This is an area where, quite frankly, the last coalition government failed. They did not recognise this challenge even existed before it was too late. There was nothing on skills, nothing on infrastructure and spending growth over the last term of the Howard government grew every year by four per cent. Reflect upon that. I said ‘a spending cap over the forwards of two per cent’ and that spending growth in the last coalition government was four per cent. This is what partially drove the Reserve Bank to increase the cash rate time after time after time, ending at 6.75 per cent.
It hurt a lot of people. It hurt more people in my electorate than anywhere else in the country. I had more people lose their homes because of high interest rates than any other member of this parliament. It got to the point where 60 families a month had their homes repossessed, which was three a day. So I understand what the impact of high interest rate rises is and I understand the importance of a productivity agenda. It is the importance of managing growth. In 2007, 10,000 families across Australia lost their homes. This is no small thing. We as a government and as a parliament need to focus on the productivity agenda and managing growth. It is not an easy task; it is a very hard task. It is one that the former coalition government failed to manage and one that we are focused on.
When we were talking about this in the parliament over three years ago the member for Wentworth said, after an interest rate rise, that interest rate rises were overdramatised. That is how much the Liberal Party cared about this issue three years ago and, obviously, how much they care about it now given the contribution of the member for North Sydney who gave all of two minutes to this important issue. If they really cared about this issue they would have done something when they were in government, when three families a day in my electorate were losing their homes.
Interest rates and repossession levels are lower now than they were when the coalition lost office. The RBA would have to increase the cash rate another eight times before it got back to the level it was when the Howard government lost office. The cash rate would have to go up another eight times. That does not mean that people are not doing it tough. Every member worth their salt knows that when they go out and talk to their constituents.
What this government will never do is make irresponsible promises. What this government will never do is say that we will keep interest rates at record lows. That is what happened in 2004 when the Howard government said, ‘We will keep interest rates at record lows.’ Off the back of that people trusted that promise and went out, invested and got a mortgage. Then in 2007, 10,000 Australian families had their keys taken off them and lost their homes because they trusted the Howard government when they said that they would keep interest rates at record lows. By 2007 they did not believe them anymore when they said, ‘Australians have never been better off.’
This government would never make a statement like that. We do practical things and give practical help like increasing the childcare rebate, increasing the pension—the biggest increase in the pension in over 100 years—introducing the Teen Dental Plan, expanding the education tax refund so it will now apply to school uniforms, giving more support to families of teenagers by giving them support through the family tax benefit fund and, of course, come 1 January, more help for young mums and dads through the introduction of Australia’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme.
Compare that with the opposition. This is a debate about the cost of living. What are their policies? What are their plans? We did not hear any from the member for North Sydney in his contribution but, more importantly, we did not hear any from the Leader of the Opposition either in this parliament or in the election campaign. Members might remember tuning into Sky News and listening or watching the contribution from the Leader of the Opposition in the Sky News
Courier-Mail
debate during the election campaign. A woman named Tammy asked the Leader of the Opposition: ‘What will you do to help with cost-of-living pressures?’ His answer was:
There is no magic wand, I’ve got to say. I’d like to be able to come in and tell you that I could make all of that that pain disappear.
David Speers then said:
Just on that, nothing particular that you’ll do on cost of living.
Tony Abbott then responded:
… there is no across the board bit of magic that is going to dramatically reduce our cost of living.
The question was asked twice. There were no ideas and no plans. It is no wonder that the member for Moncrieff is saying in the party room, ‘Where are the positive ideas?’ And it appears to be contagious because, only this week, when the Premier of Western Australia was asked about increasing electricity bills his response was, ‘People should turn their air conditioners off.’ That was his response to the cost of living: people should turn the air conditioner off.

Mr Keenan interjecting—
—For people living in Victoria who are contemplating their vote on the weekend, that is the Liberal Party’s policy when it comes to the cost of living: turn the air conditioner off. There are no policies except increasing taxes through their own paid parental leave scheme, refusing to support a tax cut for small business and talking about getting rid of unfair dismissal laws. No wonder it is a party that is not supported by the general public.
We also hear a return to the debate of the flat tax. The last person to come in here and talk about flat tax was Pauline Hanson. It is no wonder we talk about economic Hansonism when we have a return of the debate about a flat tax, which would mean that the average income earner would earn $500 less a year and people like us would get an extra $4,000 a year in our pocket. So, if you are a politician, if you are earning our income, the cost of living might be easier under a flat tax regime but I tell you what: it will not be for the 60 per cent of Australians that it would affect. It would mean less money in their pockets. When you are talking about the cost of living, it is not only how much things cost but how much you can pay. How much is in your pocket can be a lot less if there is a flat tax regime. It means that you get less money, less take-home pay—a lot less if we were to return to a system like WorkChoices, when more than a million Australians earned up to $4½ thousand less as a result of those changes.
Through the contribution of the member for North Sydney, the Liberal Party have shown that they have no credibility and no argument when it comes to the cost of living—more importantly, they have shown that it is the Liberal Party that have lost their way. To be frank, the Liberal Party lost their way a long time ago. If Menzies were alive today he would not recognise the modern Liberal Party. Menzies would not have voted against tax cuts for small business. Menzies would not have voted against tax cuts for the forgotten people. But the Liberal Party intend next year to vote against tax cuts for small business. Menzies would not have taxed Australian business with a paid parental leave scheme, as this Liberal Party want to do. Menzies would not have voted against the National Broadband Network. How do we know this? When the biggest nation-building project of Menzies’ era came about, the Snowy Mountains Scheme, what did Menzies do? Menzies criticised it. He argued about it, he asked lots of questions and, at the end of the day, Menzies voted for it. He acted in the national interest. The same cannot be said of his successors. The Liberal Party look more like the Australian branch of the Tea Party. You have the Tetley branch in the Liberal Party and the National Party is the Bushells faction of the Tea Party, and the Leader of the Opposition is more like Sarah Palin than he is like Robert Menzies.
As the parliament comes to an end in 2010, the Liberal Party has become a party of the extreme Right, with no ideas and no solutions when it comes to the cost of living. They just have jokes—13 minutes of jokes. Their only agenda is to attack everything and destroy. Given the great challenges that this country faces the people—(Time expired)

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—I rise to support this matter of public of importance about the cost-of-living increases being imposed upon Australians, leading up to Christmas. But I do not think we should make the mistake of thinking that this is some Johnny-come-lately thing. It took three years of hard labour to get to this point. It was not done overnight. The current Prime Minister has been gleefully forging ahead in the big-spending, throwaway way in which she acted as a minister in government, and she still seems to be ploughing on with the same reckless abandon towards what those in the Australian public have to pay—interest rates on cars, interest rates on houses and, particularly, interest rates on small business. It is right there in front of us. After three short years, the government is continuing the rhetoric without the action.
There is one thing that every Australian does, no matter their background or which state or region they come from: we all eat. The one thing that will happen is that food prices will go up. Admittedly, in the course of the three years it has taken to get to this kind of pressure, we did have GroceryWatch, which we all remember. We do not hear a lot about it now. One of the things that the former Prime Minister said in ‘07 was, ‘We are going to bring down the cost of living.’ That was three short years ago. GroceryWatch is the only thing I noticed that was ever actually aimed at it, and that was no more successful than Fuelwatch. And fuel is probably the other thing that most Australians have to use as well.
I recall that, at one stage, they did try to pass off the pink batts as a way of dropping the cost of living. I am not quite sure how successful that was. Parts of that I do not want to talk about today, but certainly it cost a lot of money. It almost cost more money to try to fix than to do, and that was a heck of a lot. At the same time we had the school halls program. There might have been schools around Australia that were glad of it, and why would they not be? No-one knocks anything back that is free. The point that was missed by the minister in question time today was that the school halls cost about three times more than they should have. The reason I lock in the batts and school halls together is that it was a lot of money, a lot of borrowed money, which, as I recall, we were criticised for voting against.
There is one thing that we have to look at with the borrowing side of this issue as we run up to Christmas. The previous speaker mentioned the previous government. The previous government left this government in the best fiscal position of any government at any time in Australia’s history. And what have they managed to do to the position we left them in three short years of hard labour? What did happen? Not only did they spend the surplus we left them, I think they might have borrowed a little too. And now we are looking at a wonderful communications network. As with the school halls, people like something they get for nothing, but in actual fact they will still have to pay for the NBN. We are talking about $55 billion. The communications industry—not John Cobb, not me, not any of us—looked at the summary for this program and said ‘Whoops!’ Mind you, they have always been a bit amazed by the whole NBN proposal. The communications industry is now talking about $55 billion. That is okay. We will borrow a bit more. But the issue of all this borrowing is that the rest of us—the constituency of Australia—have to deal with it. If you come from where I do, you do have to deal with it—that is, retail sales have gone down. Even though we are now getting into the festive season, retail sales are going down out of sight. In towns where I come from, Bathurst and Orange, retail sales are shrinking rapidly. Why? Is it because the government have run up such a debt? The previous speaker spoke about interest rates. The government have managed to bring interest rates back to a situation where they are higher than at any time in the 11½ years of the previous government—and it has not taken this government long to do it.
—Rubbish.
—The member for Monaro might not like it but it is a fact. As somebody from a so-called regional electorate, he ought to know better than to poke fun at the cost of living of people in regional areas. We all know very well that, with the issue of debt, it is the ordinary people who have to pay it. This government and their union mates believe that it does not matter how much they borrow, because big business will pay it back. Everybody knows that the people who really struggle to pay off debt under a high tax regime are the ordinary workers who pay their taxes every week—and that is a fact. That is what is occurring in the electorates of Calare and Monaro, and you had better start thinking about it.
As well as that, let us look at the fact that everybody has to eat food and that prices for food are going up and will continue to go up. Let us also look at what has gone on in the Murray-Darling Basin, where a high proportion of fresh food is being produced. The previous minister, Senator Wong, was not terribly concerned about what happened to ordinary Australians, or what they did or what they paid. She just wanted to take all the water from the basin. However, we now have a new minister, the member for Watson—the minister for water and various other things. Should he inspire confidence in us? I doubt it. In his time as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in one year he took $1 billion out of his portfolio—a portfolio that concerns the very people who produce the food, the best food in the world, and that keeps food prices down—and gave it to Treasury and various other people. He took money away from the CSIRO. He took money away from R&D. He now proposes to cut half the amount of R&D money that goes to industry to keep the costs down so that people wanting to shop in supermarkets do not go broke at the thought of walking in there, let alone paying for anything. Let me talk for a moment about where we are going with the water cuts and what effect this will have on food production. If you take 30 or 40 per cent of the water out of the basin, you are taking about 10 or 15 per cent of all the available fresh food in Australia.
One of the other huge over-costs that this government is wearing is the boat people who are coming to Australia. The government is blowing a billion dollars there. But the biggest refugees in Australia are the political refugees who have come from Sydney to Canberra, and the member for Watson, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, is one of them. Three years ago he woke up to what was going on in New South Wales and he got out. He came from the upper House there to the House of Representatives in Canberra. That man is a protege of Joe Tripodi and Eddie Obeid. It is not really a great recommendation for somebody to talk about policy and not just about politics—and that is all he is worrying about. He is a protege of the New South Wales Right. It is not something that I would want to skite about in any parliament of Australia. He got out because he knew what was going on.
There have been two federal elections since the last state election, and the Joe Tripodis and the Eddie Obeids are getting out too. People talk about having confidence in the minister for water; it is not just about his handling of the basin. He and his predecessor knew what that report was going to show before it was tabled. Do you really think the authority would not advise the minister how drastic that was going to be? Of course they did. You would sack them if they did not. Yet one did not give a damn and the other one looked at it and thought he would get away with it. The minister for water did not even care about it from the point of view of food prices or what it would do to the basin until such time as he suddenly realised that the average Australian is a fair dinkum person and believes in a fair go. Suddenly, they realised they were in trouble with the Australian media in the main cities, not just with the two million people in the Murray-Darling Basin. Now they are saying, ‘We’d better have a look at it.’ Well, he had better do that in a hurry.
This government have empowered the Greens; they are pursuing policies in agriculture, mining, forestry and transport that are being pushed by the Greens. These policies will not just lift prices on electricity and food; they will send them through the roof. It is Christmas and people have stopped buying because they know what is coming.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I am pleased to be speaking in this afternoon’s debate because I am particularly pleased to see that the opposition has finally, in this near final sitting day for 2010, determined that cost-of-living issues are a matter of some significance. I am very pleased that they have reached that conclusion. We on this side of the House have known for quite some substantial time that these are issues that are of significance to ordinary Australians, which is why we have embarked on a very significant and comprehensive series of policy initiatives and reforms and have done so from day 1 of our term in office.
Those reforms have spanned areas such as taxation, superannuation, pensions, child care, education and skills development, jobs and job security and, recently, the cost of PBS medications. In contrast to that, the opposition, as was noted by the Minister for Defence Materiel earlier this afternoon, has come up with no positive or constructive policies. They are yet to enunciate anything that would in fact address the issues that they so vehemently say are matters of concern.
The one thing I will say, however, is that the shadow Treasurer mentioned earlier in today’s debate that something they would be seeking to do was to cut spending, presumably in the areas of health and education as we saw during the years of decay of the Howard government. What he unfortunately failed to indicate to us was the margin for error in that $50 billion figure that he mentioned in spending cuts. Call me a nitpicker or a pedant, but I tend to think that a margin of error of plus or minus $11 billion is somewhat significant if one is aspiring to position oneself as a Treasurer in this country.
I am very pleased this afternoon to be able to articulate in a bit more detail the significant areas of reform that we have embarked on in those particular areas of taxation, superannuation, pensions, child care, education and skills development, jobs and job security and the cost of medications. We know that this government has delivered tax cuts for three years in a row to assist working families. These are real and practical measures that will impact upon Australians’ cost-of-living concerns. We know that this was achieved even against the backdrop of a global financial crisis, so our dedication to these issues is clear and consistent. Our tax cuts mean that a worker earning $50,000 is paying $1,750 less tax in 2010-11 than they did in 2007-08. These are fairly significant practical changes that this government has delivered. We have doubled the low-income tax offset, which has increased the tax-free threshold from $11,000 to $16,000. As many Australians know, we have also reduced the marginal tax rates faced by many workers, which means that they get to keep more from an extra dollar of income.
We know that this government has increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, which is something that has an incredibly significant impact in my electorate, which is a growing area that has a significant and growing population of young families, who will rely on and benefit from that significant policy change. Yet, again, in more than a decade of Howard decay, none of these initiatives for Australian families were delivered.
We will deliver the new family tax benefit arrangements to assist families with teenagers, who continue to bear the significant costs that come with raising teenage children. We all know that this is a very significant reform and reflects our hope that teenagers will stay at school and develop skills for their futures. Yet again, it is a practical reform that provides financial assistance to families and is targeted at ensuring that teenagers remain at school and develop skills.
We also know that this government has delivered a historic pension rise, which is something that the Howard government did not prioritise. During more than a decade in office professing to have an interest in and regard for older Australians, it gave nothing back to them. It took this government, in its first term and once again against the backdrop of a global financial crisis, to achieve a significant increase to the age pension.
Another significant issue that will be of relevance to older Australians and to pensioners in this country relates to a reform that this government has achieved in only the last week, and that is the reform to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We have made changes to the PBS which will mean that the price taxpayers pay at the pharmacy for PBS medicines will now more accurately reflect the market price instead of the current listed price, which is often much higher. The opposition did not support this measure. Tellingly, the people who profess to be concerned about the real costs to the pockets of ordinary Australians facing cost-of-living pressures were precisely the people who objected to this measure. Here is the alternative they so helpfully suggested: they proposed that we take up the proposals of the Generic Medicines Industry Association, which would have meant that pensioners would pay an extra $5 per script for their medications. To a pensioner $5 per script is a fairly significant amount of money. I am sure that most members in this place would be aware of that. So, we have increased the pension by a historic amount during our first term in government, and the opposition’s terribly constructive proposal, in the manner in which it proposes to regulate the PBS, is to take money away from those people whom we have given that increased pension to.
I say again that I am particularly glad that the opposition, in a rare moment of illumination this afternoon, has come to understand that cost-of-living pressures are something to consider. Unfortunately their rhetoric and the reality of their behaviour in relation to these matters are somewhat at odds. We on this side have been taking measures for some time to address cost-of-living pressures. It is extraordinary that the opposition, which has once again taken an opportunity to berate the very successful BER program and which let the education sector flounder without adequate funding for so very long during the Howard years of decay, should talk about the need for attention to the cost of living. Because what better way is there of assisting the long-term prosperity of our young people, and their capacity to earn a decent wage, than through investments in their education and then securing their employment? On both fronts this government has been leading the way.
We have almost doubled the education funding of the Howard government in our first term, again against the backdrop of the global financial crisis. We have created, as the Treasurer mentioned again today, an estimated 650,000 jobs during the last three years, achieving much of this through the stimulus spend and through other endeavours to sustain the Australian economy during difficult global financial circumstances.
When people have studied and worked hard to get an education, to get qualifications and to get jobs, we would really like them to keep those jobs. That is why in our first term we moved to restore fairness in workplaces around this country, something which those opposite persist in questioning today. Indeed, we have heard that the member for Moncrieff has once again raised whether industrial relations ‘reform’, as they put it, should be revived in the Liberal Party’s agenda. We showed during our first term, and we continue to show, that it is possible to work with industry and workers for the best outcomes. We implemented the Fair Work Act and we abolished Work Choices.
The only measure that the opposition have proposed in addition to their spending cuts, which again have that plus or minus threshold of a mere $11 billion—pocket change!—is tax increases which they need to support their paid parental leave scheme. I am pleased to say that on this side of the House we have been able to initiate and implement a paid parental leave scheme without needing to impose additional taxes which would have flowed on to consumers and thereby raised the cost of groceries and other everyday ordinary items, increasing cost-of-living pressures for ordinary Australians.
The final point I will make is in relation to superannuation. This government is seeking to increase the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. We all know the public position of the opposition on this. What better way to provide for the long-term quality of life and economic circumstances of our retiring Australians than to provide appropriately for superannuation.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,39,1
"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I rise to support the matter of public importance today. The government should be ashamed that it has failed to take any action to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures in the lead-up to Christmas. This is a time when family budgets are pushed to the brink, when a lack of funds means fewer Christmas presents or maybe no Christmas presents at all, fewer guests at the Christmas table or maybe no guests at all. It could mean that school holiday activities have to be significantly reduced or perhaps not take place at all simply because there are no funds or there are very limited funds.
I know the cost of living is hurting Australian people a lot. I hear it from the people in my electorate of McPherson. I receive emails and calls on a regular basis in which people talk to me about the impact that rising prices are having on their day-to-day life. People raise it with me in person. They stop me at shopping centres and in the street to tell me how difficult life is for them at the moment. I heard it before and during the campaign and I hear it more and more as the situation deteriorates.
Unfortunately, the issue is most often raised by those who are most vulnerable in our community. What I want to know is what the government is actually doing to reduce the pressure on our most vulnerable: our seniors on fixed incomes; our welfare recipients; the unemployed, who have no capacity to increase their incomes to compensate for the additional cost pressures they face. Of course it does not only affect the most vulnerable amongst us; if affects the entire community. And it affects us most dramatically during the holiday period.
At the 2007 election, the government promised to address cost-of-living pressures. They made a commitment to the Australian people to reduce the cost of everyday expenditure on items that we all rely on. They promised to do something about groceries, they promised to do something about fuel and they promised to do something about banking. But what have the government done to fulfil the promise that really was the centrepiece of their campaign? If you cannot think of anything, Mr Speaker, I can assure you that you are not on your own. Very few of us can think of anything real and tangible that the government have done. But let me point out to you a few things that they have attempted.
Firstly, there were a range of websites. Fuelwatch, which was supposed to reduce our fuel costs, was of course the ridiculous embarrassment that the coalition predicted it would be. The Royal Automobile Association of South Australia went so far as to say that it believed that Adelaide motorists would be $100 a year worse off as a result of Fuelwatch. So not only did it not help; it actually exacerbated a situation. It is easy to say that $100 is not much, but $100 here and $100 there most certainly does add up, and it becomes very significant to those in the community who are most vulnerable.
Then there was GROCERYchoice, the now abandoned white elephant that did not help retailers reduce their prices, did not help consumers get the best prices, and cost Australian taxpayers at least $7 million. A team of up to 30 people had been working around the clock to develop the site, and $7 million went out of the pockets of the Australian people and down the drain. What did this project achieve? Absolutely nothing. It was poorly planned and poorly thought through.
It is actually not unlike the government’s favourite project at the moment, the NBN—poorly planned, poorly thought out and a potential financial disaster of a magnitude not seen before in this country. It is again a project done without due diligence and with an ever-increasing bill payable by us, the Australian taxpayers. Why is this relevant to cost-of-living pressures? With a budget deficit in excess of $40 billion this year and a budget deficit next year, this government is going to deliver to all Australians a burden of debt that will put upward pressure on interest rates and have a huge impact on all Australian families, potentially for years to come. Wasting money on poor projects, including the failed home insulation project, increases the debt and deficit, and that is really only making the problem worse.
A debt-free government is one that does not compete with individuals and businesses for finance. This government is borrowing $100 million a day. It is a AAA rated borrower. This government is in competition for finance with ordinary Australians. This pushes up costs for us, the ordinary Australians. When you reduce the debt you reduce the costs on borrowings. This is certainly a simple concept but the government either does not understand it or chooses to ignore it. The seven interest rate rises in the past year have added more than $500 a month to the repayments on an average mortgage—an extra $500 a month just to keep a roof over your head.
The coalition has a plan to make banking fairer for consumers and for a better all-round financial system with our nine-point plan. This is the only proposal on the table that looks to address issues with our banking system outside the RBA’s interest rates increases. This plan will culminate in a full review of our financial system. Considering the impact financial services and lending have on household budgets, this is a necessary measure that will help address the cost-of-living pressures. The government will not consider it and they will not consider addressing their reckless spending, but families and individuals have to look at their own spending, at their own budgets. I say, if it is good enough for families, why is it not good enough for the government to manage the budget?
It is disgraceful that, because this government has shirked its own responsibilities, Australians are now paying the price and will continue to pay that price for some time in future. And of course it is not only in the form of increased prices; it is the potential for increased taxes or at least taxes that are not reduced. If your family is debt free, you are still hit with cost-of-living pressures outside the interest rate rises. Electricity is up 34 per cent. Gas is up 26 per cent. Water and sewerage are up 29 per cent. The issue here is that you just cannot decide to disconnect your electricity, gas or sewerage. You can use less, and in Australia we have a very proud history of demonstrating that we can conserve water, that we can reduce electricity use by simply switching off the power. We are already doing this but we are still faced with the rising cost pressures of those services.
Health care is not something families should be skimping on, but the cost of health care under the Labor Party has risen up to 18 per cent. Education costs are up 17 per cent and no government should want families to cut back on that and sell out our children’s future. Year over year prices generally go up. I accept that; we all accept that but we should accept that only up to a point.


We need to look at the period over which these price increases have occurred. We are constantly reminded—and the Treasurer reminded us this week in the House—of the seriousness of the global economic downturn. Australia, thanks to years of strong economic management and reforms prior to the 2007 election, was in a good position to weather the GFC. There was a reduction in inflationary pressures and this is shown in the figures, but these everyday prices kept rising despite the GFC. The value of the dollar is higher than ever. We should be able to get more for our dollar, so there is no excuse there either. There is a link between the actions of this government and the prices we all pay for our everyday expenses that the government just will not accept. They are shirking their responsibility to the Australian people in this regard and the impact of this is exacerbated as we move towards the holiday season.
They do not understand that there is a link between government expenditure—their reckless spending—and the impact interest rates and prices are having on everyday Australians, or maybe they just do not care. Not only are they not willing to be part of the solution but also they continue to be committed to being part of the problem. The government need to take responsibility for the impact they are having on ordinary Australian households. They need to take responsibility for the impact they are having on our most vulnerable and they need to understand the correlation between their actions and what is in the next household bill for families across the nation. In July, the Treasurer said:
We will do everything as we go forward to ensure we minimise those cost-of-living pressures.
I say to the Treasurer: the government has failed Australian families and must immediately change its pattern of behaviour. It must start planning properly, improve its financial management, start proper project implementation and act in the best interests of all Australians.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,39,1
"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—When I saw this MPI this afternoon, I was a bit surprised and wondered to myself where the member for North Sydney has been during the 43rd Parliament. Has he not been listening? I do not think so, because he has been so hell-bent on destroying, cutting and slashing that he cannot hear above the din of chainsaws, demolishing balls and jackhammers in his head. Had he listened, he would have learnt that Labor saved this country from recession. He would have learnt that we created 650,000 jobs. That figure makes me think about what is happening in the UK and the US at the moment, and what is happening in Europe. Just recently, I heard of 500,000 public service jobs being slashed in the UK. Compare that to 650,000 jobs being created here in Australia.
Had the member for North Sydney been listening, he would have learnt that we have an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent. Again, compare that to the UK, the US and Europe, where the unemployment rate is double that. Had he been listening, he would have learnt that we are heading for a surplus in three years time. That makes me cast my mind to the extraordinary and tragic situation in Ireland at the moment, where they are being bailed out by the EU. Where are we in Australia? We are heading towards a surplus in three years time, we have created 650,000 jobs, we have unemployment at 5.4 per cent and our workers are now working under Fair Work arrangements, enjoying good pay and conditions.
Had the member for North Sydney been listening, he would have heard about the infrastructure that we are creating in this country, that we are building after decades of neglect. He would have learnt that we have doubled the spend on roads, that the spend on rail has gone up tenfold. He would have learnt that we have invested $16.2 billion in the Building the Education Revolution for children now and for Australia’s future. He would have learnt that we are overhauling the health system and increasing the number of GPs, doctors, nurses and carers throughout the country, and he would have learnt that we want to improve productivity in this country through the National Broadband Network, that we want to ensure that this country stays up to date with what is happening in the world and continues to be innovative and productive. That is why the National Broadband Network is so crucial.
Had he been listening he would have learnt that Labor is doing an enormous amount to ease the cost-of-living pressures on families. On 1 January next year we will introduce paid parental leave, an amazing achievement after decades of fighting by women for this. It will benefit not just women and men but also all families. It is thanks to Labor that this amazing achievement has happened. Had he been listening he would have heard about the increase in childcare rebates from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and also the range of reforms we are introducing in that area to improve the delivery of standards of child care and the education, fulfilment and commitment of childcare workers. Had he been listening he would have heard that the pension had gone up. My mother is on the pension and she was greatly relieved to hear that news. It was thanks to Labor that that has been delivered for both singles and couples. Had he been listening he would have heard about the education tax refund for uniforms, the dental health system for teens and also the plans we have for super so that Australians can enjoy prosperity and decent conditions when they retire. Had he been listening he would have heard about the tax cuts—18 per cent for people who are earning $50,000 a year. That is nearly 20 per cent over three years, putting more money in families’ pockets. And had he been listening he would have also heard about the increase that we are planning in family tax benefit A.
The investment that Labor has been making in this country, and also the efforts it has been making to reduce the cost-of-living pressures, has extended to Canberra, thanks to the Gillard Labor government. We now have cranes everywhere around the city. We have not seen cranes on the horizon of this city for decades. Now we have roadworks everywhere, which I know cause some complaints amongst my constituents, but it is the first time for decades that we have had roadworks. Now, for the first time in decades, we have millions of dollars being invested in our schools. Parents, students, staff and the grandparents of Canberrans are very grateful for the investment we are making in their schools.
Had he been listening he would have realised that the Gillard government is deeply committed to the people of Canberra and deeply committed to investing in our future to ensure that we continue to grow and thrive. I contrast that with what happened under the coalition government in 1996. I contrast that with the fact that when the coalition government came to power they axed 30,000 jobs in this town.
—Rubbish.
—They axed 30,000 jobs—go back to it.
—Shocking. The whole region was affected.
—As the member for Eden Monaro can attest, 30,000 jobs that had an impact not just on this city but also on this region. As a result of the axing of those jobs, we went into a countercyclical recession for four years. The coalition does not care about Canberra; it does not care about the Public Service. It has complete disdain for it. Not only did it impact on the Public Service but also it impacted on the region as businesses closed down. It had a knock-on effect right throughout the economy, and that lasted for four years. Only now in some parts of the city are we gradually getting out of the recession that was caused by the coalition government. We still have empty shops as a result of its complete disdain for the Public Service and for Canberra.
Not only does the opposition have complete disdain for Canberra’s existence but 10 years ago it also had complete disdain for 30,000 jobs. The coalition’s promise to public servants in Canberra if it was to win office again in 2010 was 12,000 more job cuts, plus an increase in the efficiency dividend. This is what the coalition promises Canberra. It has complete disdain for this city and the Public Service.
The member for North Sydney has obviously not been listening to what has been happening in this 43rd Parliament over the last few weeks. He obviously has not been listening to the significant range of achievements that this government has delivered for the people of Australia and, most importantly, for the people of Canberra and the significant effort it has gone to to ease the cost-of-living pressures throughout Australia. He feigns concern that he is worried about the people of Australia. If he is concerned about the people of Australia, he is certainly not concerned about the people of Canberra. He and the coalition are intent on destroying this city. The coalition destroyed it in 1996 and it took 15 years for it to be rebuilt. The coalition is intent on doing it again in 2010 and onwards. Do not pretend otherwise. It should not pretend that it is interested in this city and the welfare of the people of Canberra in the guise of Christmas cheer.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I rise to speak on the
Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010.

As noted by the member for Brand, when he introduced this bill on 30 September, this is the seventh Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill since 2004. These bills have continued the coalition’s work to promote transparent and accountable government finances for Australian government departments, agencies, Commonwealth authorities and companies which are predominately contained in the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.
This bill, in particular, seeks to update the framework, improve operational efficiency and assist with the operation of interjurisdictional entities. Firstly, the bill repeals 20 redundant special appropriations, including six acts in their entirety. Secondly, the bill seeks to improve the governance framework, established by the FMA Act and the CAC Act, both of which govern the management and accountability of Commonwealth agencies, authorities and the executive arm of the government.
The bill will allow ministers to delegate certain functions under the CAC Act to departmental secretaries, relating to the oversight of Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. It also seeks to allow relevant state and territory ministers to request information about FMA Act agencies and Commonwealth authorities operating under the CAC Act.
Thirdly, the bill consolidates the Australian Institute of Criminology with the Criminology Research Council into a single agency, while also transferring them from the CAC Act to the FMA Act. It also seeks to transfer the governance of the Australian Law Reform Commission from the CAC Act to the FMA Act. Further, the National Transport Commission will be brought under the CAC Act as it currently sits outside existing frameworks, other than for its annual reporting.
The coalition broadly supports this amending legislation. However, I draw the attention of the House to page 5.2 of the Department of Finance and Deregulation’s red book, the incoming government brief, publicly released on 1 October, which stated:
Through this Bill—
the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment bill 2010—
there is also an opportunity for the Government to reconfirm its support for a strong financial framework dealing with Commonwealth resources by expanding the definition of ‘proper use’ to

include ‘economical’. While proper use already includes ‘efficient, effective and ethical’, inclusion of the word ‘economical’ will increase the focus on the level of resources the Commonwealth applies to achieve outcomes.
This was the department’s subtle way of acknowledging the government’s reckless waste and mismanagement across myriad programs over the past three years and the need for something to be done about it. Even though the language was somewhat tortuous, it was quite pointed for a department to advise its own government in such a significant way about the monumental waste and mismanagement of which we have seen endless examples, such as the $2.8 billion pink batts debacle. That program was rushed out and led to 207 house fires, 4,000 potential cases of fraud and, tragically, four deaths. It was one of the monumental policy failures in this country’s history.
We also saw the $850 million solar panel scheme blow-out. We saw the dumping of the $275 million Green Loans program. We saw $6 billion to $8 billion wasted in delivering the $16.2 billion school hall program, with state schools paying twice as much per square metre as Catholic schools for the same buildings—a disgrace to proper management in anyone’s language. We saw the embarrassing implementation of the Indigenous housing program. We saw the $1 billion blow-out in the Computers in Schools program. We saw the $1 billion blow-out due to the Labor government’s loss of control of our nation’s borders. We saw the gross waste and mismanagement of our $4 billion-a-year foreign aid budget. We saw $1.5 million spent to send 113 delegates to the Copenhagen conference. We saw the failed GroceryWatch website set up and shut down at a cost of $10 million. We saw the bungled Fuelwatch scheme and, of course, the $43 billion NBN, which we now know is $50 billion—from $4.7 billion originally. And now we see a project cost—
Mr Ripoll and Mr Husic interjecting—
—If you do not know what a project cost is, go back to accounting 101. See what the cost is to the community: $50 billion. Some in the industry are saying it is $55 billion.

(Hon. Peter Slipper)—The members for Oxley and Chifley will restrain themselves.
—So it has gone from $4.7 billion to $43 billion, and the Prime Minister stood up here today and tried to dissemble, saying, ‘Well, you only look at capex, of course; you don’t look at what the NBN has to pay to Telstra.’ This is real money. It is not like the $600 that the now Treasurer said was not real money before he got into office. It is real money. Get over it and start concentrating on how you can pay it back.
With the NBN we have seen the scope to produce the greatest level of waste this country has ever seen. This has been further highlighted by this government’s refusal to conduct a cost-benefit analysis despite the fact that it promised, before coming into office, that every significant infrastructure project would have a cost-benefit analysis. Not one significant infrastructure project in the last three years has seen a cost-benefit analysis. Nothing has been released. There has been politics writ large with every major decision, from the school halls program to the road decisions to the NBN: politics, politics, politics and spin. There has been not one cost-benefit analysis. Yet, go back and see what the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport said unambiguously and endlessly before the 2007 election: that this government, if it got into government, would undertake one and release it in a transparent way.
Such a litany of waste and mismanagement has never been seen in the history of this country. It is the most egregious and devastating waste and mismanagement, and this government stands condemned. This waste and mismanagement is one of the principal reasons the government came so close to losing the election despite the fact that, around the world and in Australia, a first-term government is hardly ever tossed out—in fact, it has only happened once in Australia’s history.
Only recently the Australian National Audit Office also revealed that taxpayers are not getting value for money in up to three-quarters of government purchases. The ANAO concluded that government agencies failed to routinely compare prices when direct sourcing goods and services worth a mere $10.2 billion a year. Again, the now retired former Minister for Finance and Deregulation said endlessly that the government had sought to improve and upgrade the sorts of processes required by government agencies. Now we see that it has failed to routinely compare prices across $10.2 billion worth of goods and services. The report stated:
For 74 per cent of the Direct Source procurements in the ANAO sample, agencies were unable to demonstrate whether the procurement gave them value for money. In the majority of cases there was a lack of evidence of any comparative analysis of the relevant costs and benefits of different procurement options to support the procurement decision.
All this waste is occurring when interest rates are going up, with the average mortgage holder paying up to $6,000 more on interest payments than they were a year ago. Cost-of-living pressures are increasing, with household bills continuing to rise and a budget built on the back of more than $40 billion worth of new taxes since 2008. The government continues to borrow $100 million a day and does not have the courage to make the tough decisions to rein in its reckless spending. This has all contributed. It is a matter of good governance, transparency and strong financial management.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand there is a need to sum up quickly. I had other comments to make on this. What I do foreshadow is that we have sought to move an amendment. We sought in the other place to move a private member’s bill, which failed to gain support, to introduce the need for the notion of value for money to be included within this act to ensure that there is a proper focus on the requirements to properly look after the nation’s finances. That was unsuccessful. We foreshadowed an amendment to introduce value for money along the lines consistent with what the Department of Finance and Deregulation have recommended. We were unable to get agreement from the government but they have agreed to an amendment, I understand, where we would include ‘economical’, instead of ‘value for money’, as recommended by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. So I will move that amendment in due course when other speakers have concluded.
In conclusion, while the amendment I will formally move today is a small amendment to the FMA Act, it will be a further step in reminding this government of the obligation it has to every Australian taxpayer. The coalition does not oppose the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. It builds on the work carried out by the Howard government between 2004 and 2007. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—in reply—I thank the member for Goldstein for his contribution to this debate. The
Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
is an omnibus bill that would affect 31 acts, involving the amendment of 25 acts and the repeal of six. The bill contains three major themes. The opposition has circulated amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Act to include ‘economical’ in section 44 of the FMA Act, which sets out the responsibilities of chief executives to promote the proper use of government resources. The government will support the opposition’s proposed amendment.
I will now turn to other aspects of the bill. The first theme is the repeal of 20 redundant special appropriations, including six acts in their entirety. This continues the government’s commitment as part of Operation Sunlight to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Commonwealth’s financial framework and budgetary process.
The second theme is improving the financial governance framework established by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the FMA Act, and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the CAC Act. In particular the bill would allow ministers to delegate their ability to obtain budget estimates and monthly financial statements under the CAC Act to departmental secretaries for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. The bill will also give state and territory ministers the ability to request information about operations of interjurisdictional agencies under the FMA Act and interjurisdictional authorities under the CAC Act. The bill would also strengthen the reporting to parliament of the Commonwealth’s involvement in companies by transferring these requirements from the CAC Act to part 5 of the FMA Act, which currently deals with investments by the Commonwealth.
The third theme is clarifying governance arrangements of several specific bodies. In particular the bill would consolidate the Australian Institute of Criminology with the Criminology Research Council into a single agency while at the same time transferring them from the CAC Act to the FMA Act. The bill would also transfer the governance of the Australian Law Reform Commission from the CAC Act to the FMA Act. Further, this bill would bring the governance of the National Transport Commission under the CAC Act, consistent with the government’s policy on governance arrangements as the commission currently operates outside existing frameworks other than for its annual reporting. Finally, the bill would repeal legislation that had established the Office of Evaluation and Audit for Indigenous Programs as this function has been successfully absorbed into the Australian National Audit Office.
Overall, the amendments in the bill reduce red tape through legislative housekeeping, improve the governance arrangements of interjurisdictional bodies and improve the financial and governance arrangements of specific bodies.
Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of those officials who assisted in the preparation of this bill from across the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House.

That this bill be now read a second time.
Introduction
The
Service and Execution of Process Amendment (Interstate Fine Enforcement) Bill 2010
implements a decision of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to establish a framework that enables states and territories to register interstate court-imposed fines that have a cross-border element.
States and territories will be able to enforce interstate fines in accordance with the laws of their own jurisdiction. They will no longer be able to enforce interstate fines by apprehending and imprisoning the fine defaulter.
The measures within this bill provide a cooperative solution to one of the challenges posed by our federal system, and are consistent with the federal government’s continuing commitment to ensuring early and appropriate intervention.
SEPA Amendments
Specifically, the bill will repeal part 7 of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992, which is commonly referred to as SEPA, which sets out the existing scheme for the recognition and enforcement of interstate court-imposed fines. The existing scheme relies exclusively on apprehension and imprisonment for the enforcement of interstate fines.
Reliance on these sanctions is no longer appropriate.
All states and territories have introduced alternative, less punitive, sanctions to enforce fines and their laws now allow for fines to be enforced by more targeted measures.
Accordingly, the bill will remove from SEPA any provisions which are inconsistent with state and territory laws that allow for alternative sanctions.
Under the new scheme, a state will be able to request the registration of a fine in the state in which a fine defaulter resides. Upon registration, that state will be able to enforce the registered fine in the same way as it would enforce a locally imposed fine. When the fine has been paid, the payment will be transferred back to the state or territory which originally imposed the fine.
I understand that, while a number of states and territories have now completely removed their courts’ authority to issue warrants of apprehension and imprisonment in relation to fine defaulters, some jurisdictions still retain these measures as a last resort.
The bill will confirm that this is no longer an option for enforcing an interstate fine, regardless of whether a state or territory still permits fines to be ‘served out’ by a penal servitude.
The amendments will also impact upon how Commonwealth fines are enforced against offenders who move between jurisdictions, because these fines will be enforced as ‘interstate’ fines in accordance with the new part 7 of SEPA.
Conclusion
Legislating to enable more targeted remedies, and allow what are essentially civil matters to continue to be treated within the civil justice system, is consistent with the Government’s Access To Justice Framework.
In particular, the bill promotes the application of proportionate responses and early intervention as the preferable approach, rather than allowing matters to be escalated to the point where someone is imprisoned and the state incurs enormous expense in so imprisoning them.
In conclusion, this bill will enable the states and territories to establish a scheme to recognise fines quickly, simply and efficiently and to enforce them in another jurisdiction using appropriate and targeted means. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS AMENDMENT (INTERSTATE FINE ENFORCEMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—It is a great pleasure to speak briefly on the
Service and Execution of Process Amendment (Interstate Fine Enforcement) Bill 2010. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 to implement a new part 7 to the act dealing with a simplified process of enforcing fines imposed by courts of summary jurisdiction. It should never be forgotten that the Service and Execution of Process Act, although never, so far as I am aware, a subject of acute political controversy, is one of the most fundamental machinery-of-government acts of the Australian parliament. It might not have been the first act but it was certainly one of the first acts passed by the parliament, to establish a machinery for the mutual recognition and enforcement of the orders and decrees of the courts of the various states.
This bill replaces the existing regime for arrest and imprisonment of interstate fine defaulters with the alternative sanctions available in the jurisdictions of the states and territories. As mentioned in the
Bills Digest, section 112 of the Service and Execution of Process Act currently enables warrants of apprehension to be issued concerning an offender against whom a fine has been imposed and the liability has not been fully discharged. An enforcement officer may apprehend the offender and must give the offender an opportunity of paying the whole fine to the enforcement officer without delay. If the offender does not pay, the enforcement officer apprehends the person and brings them before a court, together with the warrant.
Under section 115, the court, if it is satisfied that the person is the person on whom the fine was imposed and is not satisfied that the person’s liability to pay the fine has been fully discharged, must order the person to be committed to prison to serve such period of imprisonment as specified in the order or a period of six months whichever is the shorter. Part 7 of the Service and Execution of Process Act provides a scheme for the mutual recognition between states and territories of fines imposed by courts of summary jurisdiction, which allows interstate fines to be enforced through the arrest and imprisonment of fine defaulters.
The bill seeks to implement a decision of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General by replacing that scheme with a simplified mechanism which no longer relies on arrest and imprisonment and instead applies the less punitive sanctions that have been introduced in the various jurisdictions. Under the proposed scheme, a state or territory that is owed a fine may request enforcement in another jurisdiction. The fine is then registered in the jurisdiction in which the defaulter resides. Once registered, the fine can be enforced according to that jurisdiction’s own laws. Any money recovered is remitted to the state or territory that is owed the fine. The new scheme will apply to fines imposed after the bill’s commencement, and also to certain other pre-commencement fines—a measure that is principally targeted at persistent and recalcitrant defaulters.
The bill provides for a quicker, simpler and more efficient method of collecting interstate fines and is therefore entirely consistent with the historic role of the Service and Execution of Process Act to make the service and execution of process between the several states and territories easier and uniform. On behalf of the coalition I am happy to support the bill.",REPS,<title>SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS AMENDMENT (INTERSTATE FINE ENFORCEMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the
Service and Execution of Process Amendment (Interstate Fine Enforcement) Bill 2010
because the time has well and truly come to reform a number of aspects of this system as states and territories experience their own problems with the unintended consequence—if I may describe it that way—of enforcement. My mind stretches back to some of the terrible incidents that stemmed from enforcement.
Specifically, I am reminded of an incident that occurred in 1987 involving New South Wales resident Jamie Partlic, who was sent to Long Bay Prison because he had failed to pay a series of parking fines. He was sentenced to four days imprisonment. While serving his time he was assaulted. The assault was truly devastating. It left him in a coma and with permanent brain damage. All this was as a result of failing to pay parking fines. I remember at the time it triggered a wave of public and media interest in the way governments manage fine enforcement and governments were also mindful of court cases reminding prison authorities of their obligation of care.
While I wish to stress that I do not condone the failure to pay fines, we are expected to fulfil our responsibilities and obligations as citizens. However, there should be a wiser way to ensure that these obligations are fulfilled at a cost that does not exact such a heavy personal toll on people’s wellbeing. This is not an area with answers that lend themselves easily to enforcement agencies. Certainly it is a difficult matter to grapple with, especially where people refuse to pay parking or driving fines but, for example, continue to drive their vehicles illegally. In the electorate of Chifley I have experience of people placed in a position where they are unable, by virtue of their income, to pay the level of fines they owe to governments. So it is a matter of deep concern. There would be members here who have constituents in their electorates who are confronted by these problems. Obviously, there are elements of this proposed bill that will come as some relief to members of this House.
Following the matter affecting Mr Partlic, various jurisdictions re-evaluated their approach in securing fine payment without reliance upon prison sentences, limiting them to a last resort. All states and territories have now introduced alternatives, and—as the Attorney-General indicated—less punitive sanctions to enforce fines. For example, in New South Wales last year initiatives were introduced to help reduce the incidence of low-income or mentally unwell individuals finding themselves incarcerated as a result of fine default. There is also a financial imperative to reduce these instances. For example, coverage of this matter in the
Sydney Morning Herald
dating back to March 2009 indicated that in 2007, for example, 906 people were caught driving without a licence and were subsequently sent to jail compared with 424 in 1994. I am also mindful of the fact that it costs about $210 a day to incarcerate such prisoners.
Further, driving licence offences are also taking up more court time across the country as shown by Australian Bureau of Statistics research. Over the five years to 2009, the number of people convicted of driving licence offences had grown 61 per cent. Without doubt, something needed to be done and, as a result, within the New South Wales jurisdiction people were given the ability to volunteer at charities to have their traffic fines cancelled, an approach triggered by considerations and recommendations of the sentencing council in 2006 designed to give disadvantaged people and people on low incomes the chance to avoid jail. Volunteering to pay off fines will be done through charities including St Vincent de Paul, Youth Off the Streets and the Salvation Army. I also congratulate measures introduced to include partial write-off of debts and financial counselling. I merely mention these matters to help shine a light on the considerable work that has been dedicated in the states to devise means of avoiding incarceration for those people who are in exceptionally difficult situations and trying to deal with fine default.
The bill before us, as indicated by the Attorney-General, establishes a framework enabling states and territories to register interstate court imposed fines that have that cross-border element. In his remarks tonight the Attorney-General has clearly elaborated the way in which that would operate. I do not seek to repeat that in my contribution this evening. From what I understand, legislating to enable more targeted remedies and allow what are essentially civil matters to continue to be treated within the civil justice system is well in line with the government’s access to justice framework; and the bill itself promotes a much more proportionate response and early intervention as a preferred approach to ensure that we do not see matters escalating to serious and potentially harmful events.
The important other point worth making is that this bill along with some of the other bills that have been debated in this parliament this week—for example, the Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill—demonstrate the headway that this government in conjunction with states and territories is making to ensure that our federation works more wisely, smarter and more efficiently. If states and territories and the Commonwealth—who obviously take note and learn from each other what they are doing in implementing systems and processes—can harmonise their approaches, there are clearly significant benefits to be had from a compliance and regulatory perspective, from a financial perspective and in respect of the matters before us from a societal perspective.
I commend the bill to the House and I commend the cooperation and wisdom evidenced by the efforts of various levels of government to ensure the smoother functioning of our Federation and the efforts that have been championed by the Attorney-General.
With the indulgence of the Speaker I would not mind including on the record that, on a quite separate matter, I extend my congratulations to the Canberra Capitals head coach Carrie Graf, who has won her first WNBL coach of the month award for season 2010 and 2011.",REPS,<title>SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS AMENDMENT (INTERSTATE FINE ENFORCEMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—in reply—I thank the previous speakers for their contributions to the debate. The
Service and Execution of Process Amendment (Interstate Fine Enforcement) Bill 2010
implements a decision of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to replace the existing framework enabling states and territories to enforce fines imposed by a court in another jurisdiction. The new scheme facilitates a registration of court imposed fines in the jurisdiction in which the fine defaulter resides and enables them to be enforced in the same way as a locally imposed fine. Any fine payment will be transferred back to the state or territory which originally imposed the fine. When operational the new scheme will allow for quick, simple and efficient enforcement of court imposed fines across borders in the civil jurisdiction. The scheme will ensure that interstate court imposed fines are no longer enforced through the arrest and imprisonment of fine defaulters.
The SEPA Act, as I have referred to, will pick up the alternative less punitive sanctions that are now used by the states and territories to enforce their own fines. The use of more appropriate enforcement options for court imposed interstate fines accords with the government’s Access to Justice Framework. In conclusion, the measures within this bill provide a cooperative solution to one of the challenges posed by our federal system and are consistent with the federal government’s continuing commitment to resolve legal disputes using the most appropriate means. I commend the bill to the House.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition to move the following motion forthwith—That this House calls on the Prime Minister to immediately explain to the Parliament how a Government that has lost its way has suddenly found it despite the evidence to the contrary, and in particular for:
treading water when it comes to policy reform;
being forced to admit to a secret plan to introduce a carbon tax despite her election promise not to;
failing to protect Australia’s borders with the arrival of three more boats over the weekend, making it 53 boats and 2,750 people since she became Prime Minister;
being distracted by issues such as gay-marriage and euthanasia when millions of Australian households are struggling to make ends meet with soaring power bills and cost of living pressures;
continuing to borrow $100 million dollars a day putting pressure on interest rates;
a back-stabbing, in-fighting style of Government that is all about factional control and not the good Government that Australians need and deserve;
pandering to the Greens with an agenda that is more about staying in power than delivering good and competent Government; and
the wasting of taxpayer dollars typified by its refusal to submit the $50 billion NBN Network to a full and transparent cost benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission which has the support of this Opposition, business leaders and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Glenn Stevens.
Mr Speaker, 2010 is ending very badly for the Australian Labor Party. Everywhere you look, Labor—
—Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: we have reconvened today to consider some important pieces of legislation. This motion is clearly out of order. It was not on the schedule of the blue to be moved today.
—Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.
—Mr Speaker, 2010 is ending very badly for the Australian Labor Party, because everywhere you look the Labor Party is in a mess. Most recently we have seen the example of Victoria, and I say to members opposite that you might have a good day in parliament, you might occasionally even get a bit of legislation passed, but you cannot save a bad government. You cannot even save a comparatively good government, as the Victorian example illustrates, when the Labor brand is increasingly toxic. That is what we are seeing: a Labor brand which is increasingly toxic right around this country.
Government members interjecting—
—Doesn’t the shouting tell you something, Mr Speaker? The more they shout, the more embarrassed they are, the more humiliated they are, by this latest devastating rebuff to brand Labor. You have the Victorian disaster. You have the South Australian disaster, where the sitting Premier was almost rebuffed by his own conference. You have the New South Wales disaster, the train wreck that is coming. You have the Queensland situation, where the government was elected promising not to privatise and almost the very next day announced that it was privatising. What we see is one Labor disaster after another.
Government members interjecting—
—Aren’t members opposite looking very frightened indeed? As they should! Let me say to members opposite that they can shout all they like but the problem is not the Victorian Labor government, the problem is not the New South Wales Labor government and the problem is not the Queensland Labor government. The problem is Labor. That is the problem. The problem, which the Australian public is increasingly understanding, is that governments that are more talk than action, that are more announcement than delivery, that are more spin than substance, will be rejected by the Australian people.
We see today the absent Prime Minister in Sydney making the announcement that she has just discovered that the year 2011 should be all about decision and delivery. Well, that would be a change, wouldn’t it? That would be a change from 2008. That would be a change from 2009. That would be a change from 2010. But shouldn’t every year—shouldn’t every day of every week of every month—be a time when governments should be about deciding and delivering? It is precisely because this government cannot decide and cannot deliver that Labor is on the nose right around Australia right now. She said that in 2011 she is going to fix the mining tax. That was supposed to be fixed before the last election, until it became unworkable because she was not able to face down the state premiers. She said that in 2011 she is going to fix the issue of a carbon price. We see that the Prime Minister has had at least three positions on this whole question of a carbon price. First of all, she supported the former Prime Minister’s emissions trading scheme until she stabbed him in the back. She stabbed him in the back by ditching the emissions trading scheme. Then she supported a people’s assembly, but that hardly lasted until polling day. Then there was the third position: a carbon tax that she ruled out before an election has been ruled in since an election. What that means is a massive increase in the costs of Australian households.
Then there is health reform. The Prime Minister says 2011 is the year to decide on and deliver health reform. That was supposed to be done in 2009. Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, was going to deliver health and hospital reform in 2009. What a joke! What an absolutely shambolic mess this government has become that something that should have been delivered in 2009 is now on the wish list for 2011.
But let me say this about health and hospital reform: it will never work. Going from a 40-60 federal-state funding mix to a 60-40 federal-state funding mix is about more bureaucracy; it is not about more beds and better services. Let me make a prediction: when the Prime Minister’s health and hospital reform dissolves into more shambles and more chaos in the course of 2011, she will try to blame the Victorian coalition government. But it will not be the Victorian coalition government, which has refused to surrender its GST to get what it already has, that is to blame; it will be the incompetence of this Labor government that is to blame.
Here we have the Prime Minister. It is very good of the Prime Minister to turn up. She summons back the parliament but cannot bring herself to be here at the start of the parliamentary sitting day.
Let me conclude by saying that if there is one issue above all else which crystallises the ineptitude and the irresponsibility of this government it is spending some $50 billion on a national broadband network without a cost-benefit analysis. Ken Henry, the Treasury secretary, says that it needs a cost-benefit analysis. Graham Bradley of the Business Council of Australia says that it needs a cost-benefit analysis. The government’s own Future Fund chairman David Murray says that it needs a cost-benefit analysis. The Governor of the Reserve Bank says that it needs a cost-benefit analysis. Even the Prime Minister herself this morning admitted in effect that it should have a cost-benefit analysis, when she said that she wants the government to look at each decision from every angle, to hold them up to the light, to examine every possibility and every question, to make every dollar go as far is it can. Well, why not a cost-benefit analysis of the biggest decision that this government will ever make?
What we have from this Prime Minister is someone who very occasionally says the right thing but never does the right thing. That is why standing orders should be suspended. That is why this Prime Minister should explain why a government that has lost its way has suddenly found it.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—I second the motion. From south to north and from east to west Australians have lost faith in Labor governments. Labor have failed the Australian people. They do not keep their promises. They have demonstrated no capacity to govern in the interests of Australians. It is all about what the factional bosses and the union chiefs want, not what the people of Australia want. And another judgment was passed upon Labor in Victoria last weekend.
The wild promises have simply not been delivered. Yet this morning over breakfast we had the Prime Minister, in her latest speech, drawing a line in the sand and making another new beginning, saying that next year is going be the year of delivery and decisions—oddly, delivery first and decisions later. Frankly, Labor will not deliver either. Their record over the last three years makes it absolutely clear that Labor will not deliver on their decisions. They will not make the decisions in the first place. After three years of not making decisions and not delivering, why should we believe them this time? Why is it going to be different this time to what it was previously?
The Prime Minister has already admitted that Labor lost its way. No-one believes that she has found her way now. Her speech to CEDA this morning, attended by some of the leaders in the economic decision making and management of our country, no-one will find credible. This is a government that has failed to deliver. It will fail to deliver in 2011 just as it has failed to deliver in previous years.
Let us look at this three-point plan. The first point is about hospital reform. This is the reform that was supposed to be delivered by June 2009, as the Leader of the Opposition said. That was the core promise made by Kevin Rudd at the previous election and, when it was not delivered by the states, Labor did nothing. They have no reform plan, just a money-shuffling plan. Instead of a bit of the GST being spent by the states, it will be given to the Commonwealth, who will then give it back to the states. It is just bureaucracy and a money-shuffle. What did they deliver by way of hospital reform in the first three years? Eleven beds at about $20 million each. The queues are longer, not shorter. Labor has simply failed to deliver. The other big area where there is to be a decision is the mining tax.

Mr Symon interjecting—
—The member for Deakin is warned!
—What, another decision and then another piece of implementation? The reality is that this tax is a shambles, like everything this government has done. The other big decision to be made is about a carbon tax. I thought during the election that 150 people were going to be chosen from the phone book to make that decision, but now the government is going to make the decision. Why is the government going to make the decision when the Prime Minister said, two or three days before the election, that there would never be a carbon tax while she is leader? So why, Prime Minister, are you making decisions, why are you going to spend a year talking about it if you are never going to do it, if it is not going to happen? Surely the Prime Minister was telling the truth to the Australian people when she spoke to them and said not while she was leader would there be a carbon tax. So why are we to spend a year talking about something that we have been faithfully promised by an honourable Prime Minister would never happen? Yet this will be the big thing for the next year: talking about, and making a decision on, a carbon tax. Was she actually making a prediction about her own leadership? If it is not going to happen during her time as leader, does that mean that this decision is going to be made because there will be a different leader and she will have honoured her word to the Australian people, made faithfully just days before the election, that there would be no carbon tax? Yet, we are told, that is the agenda that will happen next year.
The reality is that Labor governments have failed the Australian people. Labor governments will fail Australia again in 2011, just as they have failed us over the last three years. There will be no new direction. It will be the same failed Labor.",REPS,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Motions,48,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—Labor members and members of the crossbench have come here today to deliver a nation-changing microeconomic reform. The opposition have come here today to have a temper tantrum. They are acting like two-year-olds, mired in their bitterness about defeat. In their sourness, in their destructiveness they have come to parliament to pull whatever irrelevant stunt they can in order to exhibit to all Australians how bitter they are, how sour they are and how sad they are as they limp their way out of 2010 and into 2011. We did not need this display for Australians to conclude that this is an opposition that is good at three-word slogans but completely bereft of a vision for this country.
Let’s go through the principal things about which you have to have a view and a belief if you are going to have a vision for this country. First and foremost is the need to strengthen the economy so Australians can have opportunities and have the benefits and the dignity of work. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, who cares nothing about economics and knows nothing about economics, tosses his hands up in the air at that statement ‘the benefits and the dignity of work, and a strong economy’. Of course, he throws his hands up at that statement because if it had come to him we would have a weakened economy. A strong economy requires bringing the budget to surplus in 2012-13. The Leader of the Opposition stands for an $11 billion black hole in the budget.

Mr John Cobb interjecting—
—Order! The member for Calare!
—So reckless is he, so incompetent is he and so disinterested in anything to do with the economy is he that he did not even bother to check the costings during the election campaign. He is a man who stands condemned by his own conduct during the election. He stands condemned by the words out of the mouth of the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, who said: ‘He was never interested in economics. He would come to the cabinet with yet another harebrained spending proposal with no idea about how it could be funded.’ They are not my words; they are the words of a man who served around a cabinet table with him. The Leader of the Opposition does not believe in budget surpluses, and that was shown during the election campaign.
To have a strong economy, you have to understand contemporary economic circumstances and how to balance growth. Courtesy of the economic policies of men like the Leader of the Opposition when he was a minister in the Howard government, we did not make the most we could have of the mining boom mark I. We will make the most of mining boom mark II by balancing growth with the minerals resource rent tax, by cutting company taxation, by increasing retirement incomes and by increasing national superannuation and national savings. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is now chanting at me about tax. The only leader who went into the last election campaign promising increased taxes was the Leader of the Opposition, with his great big new tax on everything. We went into the last election campaign promising a tax cut. Oh, he doesn’t like it, does he?
—Glass jaw.
—Bullies always are glass jaws.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is not within the standing orders for the Prime Minister to repeat untruths—
—Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Glass jaw.
—The member for Melbourne Ports is warned! The Prime Minister has the call.
—He is a weak man with no convictions, and it is on display for all Australians to see. Amongst his lack of convictions is his lack of conviction about budget surpluses, because he will never be able to make the money add up. He will never have a conviction about economic growth, because he will never have an economic plan. He will never have a conviction about infrastructure, because standing in this parliament today in his bitterness and in his defeat he is standing in the way of the microeconomic reform that this country has sought for 30 years. This government will deliver that microeconomic reform and we will deliver the National Broadband Network. It is not just the National Broadband Network and the challenges of the future about which the Leader of the Opposition is in denial; he thinks climate change is a political plaything—you go outside, you test where the winds are blowing that day and then you decide what your position is.

Mr John Cobb interjecting—
—Order! The member for Calare is warned!
—Climate change is not a political plaything; climate change is a challenge for our globe, for our country and profoundly for our economy. As the Leader of the Opposition, once again, sits there like a weathervane waiting for someone to tell him what to do, so profound is his lack of conviction, the government will get on with tackling climate change, with pricing carbon, with dealing with energy efficiency and with increasing solar and renewable energy efficiencies. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition talks about fairness. But how can he believe in fairness and deliver Work Choices? He talks about health reform. The biggest impediment to health reform is the Leader of the Opposition. Here he goes again: weak, weak, weak—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. She wants to refight the 2007 election. The only election that counts is—
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.

Mr Abbott interjecting—
—Order! The Leader of the Opposition is warned.
—I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is your tactic. It is not my fault that it is going so badly. We are determined to deliver health reform. They have signalled in this parliament that they will vote against it. Why is health reform so necessary? It is because of the Leader of the Opposition’s cutbacks to Australian hospitals, where a billion dollars was ripped out. It was aimed at hurting Australian families, and it did.
This is a Leader of the Opposition who sat in a cabinet that never did anything about education reform. It did not care if Australian kids were being left behind. The Leader of the Opposition now comes into this parliament and his own backbench have their jaws trailing along the ground because they know in their heart of hearts that if they are to sustain support in their electorates they need to go to their electorates with a positive plan. I make this prediction about the Leader of the Opposition: he may be here yelling and screaming this December, but it will be very interesting to see what is happening next December when his backbench, who are already restive—

Mr Baldwin interjecting—
—The member for Paterson is warned!
—realise that you cannot sustain political support in this country based on negativity, bitterness and three-word slogans. They will realise that he is a man empty of conviction and empty of ideas.

That the amendments be agreed to.
These amendments take into account reasonable suggestions put forward through the Senate inquiry. They change the term ‘incompatible development’ to ‘sensitive development’ to recognise that each proposal must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. These developments will remain prima facie prohibited unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.
Further, the amendments clarify that educational institutions which are a sensitive development in section 71A do not include facilities that provide in-house training to staff conducting operations at the airport. The amendments now also exclude routine runway maintenance such as patch repair of runways, taxiways and aprons, runway resurfacing, line marking, jet blast protection and the upgrade of navigation aids from undergoing a major development plan process. They also introduce a test so that only a runway alteration that significantly changes flight paths or patterns of aircraft noise will require a major development plan. Finally, technical amendments clarify major development plan exemption provisions and address drafting errors.
This bill is about empowering communities around airports and improving integration and coordination of on- and off-airport planning schemes whilst recognising the importance of continued investment in Australia’s airport infrastructure. This bill arises from the aviation white paper, which was the result of extensive consultation with the community, with airport owners and with airport operators. I commend the bill and the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,50,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—The opposition will not be opposing these amendments to the
Airports Amendment Bill 2010. Indeed, during the debate in the House of Representatives I said that these sorts of amendments would be necessary. Unfortunately, the government did not provide any kind of exposure draft so that there could be consultation with the industry before this legislation was brought into the House. The normal courtesy of consultation with key stakeholders in the drafting of the bill simply did not happen. Fortunately, on 30 September the bill was referred to the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 16 November.
In the debate in the House of Representatives, I suggested to the government—and indeed moved—that the debate be adjourned until after that Senate committee report, because it was quite obvious from the submissions that had already been received that there were serious deficiencies in the legislation which needed to be corrected. Unfortunately, not enough of the Independents supported us in that motion and so we are now going through this process today where this legislation has to be brought on on this special day of sitting. It could have all been dealt with through the proper processes by waiting for the Senate inquiry which identified the problems which the government has now sought to correct.
There are some 33 amendments. The embarrassment of the government in having to bring this legislation back today has been entirely brought on by themselves because they would not consult with the industry in advance and then they did not wait for the Senate inquiry before insisting that the legislation go through the House of Representatives.
Next year there will be another new paradigm. The government and the Greens will have control of the Senate. That alliance will mean that there will not be the usual scrutiny of legislation undertaken in the Senate that has occurred in the past. Labor will be able to count on the Greens whenever they require them and, as a result, the situation which has occurred in the past, where the Senate has corrected and tidied up shoddy legislation, will not be able to be counted upon. Indeed, it will be this House which will have to do much more of the work in ensuring that the legislation that is passed does in fact meet the expectations of the government in bringing it forward, and deliver good policy for the Australian people. In the past, this House has often relied upon the Senate to fix up poor legislation such as this. That will not happen so much in the future. We will need to undertake committees of inquiry in this House to make sure that poor legislation is corrected before it leaves or at least adjourn the legislation for debate in this place until after it has been considered in the Senate.
I have always been uncomfortable about governments—and I acknowledge that it happened also under the previous government—bringing in legislation where there is public controversy, where there is a public inquiry process going on, but having it voted upon in the House of Representatives before the problems are fixed. I do not believe that treats members of this House with proper respect and it is not good governance.
In the future I hope the government will have learned from this experience. If they do not consult with industry, if they do not wait for the Senate inquiry, legislation will often be defective. In this instance, 33 amendments have now had to be brought back to the House of Representatives. The government has had to include the bill in this day of special sittings to get the legislation through. If they had used proper process this could all have been done last week, after the Senate inquiry and without asking the House of Representatives to vote for legislation which even the government, surely, must have known, on the basis of the submissions that had been received from industry, was defective.
The bill establishes a framework for the regulation of Commonwealth leased airports. It comprises amendments to the Airport Act 1996, which the previous government introduced to ensure that there was an appropriate planning process for airports. The act sets out the requirements for airport master plans and sets out development plans over a 20-year period. Master plans are intended to establish the direction of use of the airport, and the act ensures that there is consultation with local communities. I think this legislation will improve that consultation. The amendments are absolutely essential; otherwise the legislation would simply have been unworkable. The process that the government has used is flawed, but we have ended up with the best possible outcome.",REPS,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,50,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—The fact is that we have had an appropriate process for this legislation. This legislation was not just carried in the 43rd Parliament; it was carried by the 42nd Parliament from the House of Representatives. It arose out of the white paper. We had a process which had a discussion paper. We then had a green paper. We then had a white paper. During that process my department consulted airport owners, airport users and, indeed, also consumers. We had a Senate inquiry which was already in place. That is appropriate. The Senate inquiry has found a number of amendments, which the government supports. The fact is that when the previous government leased the airports they did not get the planning system around the airports right. That is why we have around Australia at a number of airports non-aeronautical developments which have been prioritised above aviation activity. That has occurred at capital city airports and it has occurred at regional airports. Those airport owners have received a windfall gain from the leasing of the airports in order to engage in other commercial activity.
The fact is that this government put in place a system that has ensured that it is not brickworks that are prioritised at airports; it is aviation activity. It has put in place a process through this legislation whereby communities who live around airports will also be properly consulted. We have engaged in a process of three years of consultation to get to this point. That is why this legislation is worthy of support and worthy of support with the amendments that have been adopted by the Senate. If we had deferred this legislation, as the opposition wanted when they moved their second reading amendment, once again we would have had further delay and further uncertainty. I note that the opposition, when they moved their amendments in this House, did not put forward any constructive proposals; they just put forward what they are against. Once again it was stop and delay rather than moving forward with reform. I commend the amended bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,50,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—I want to respond to a couple of points made by the minister. It is not accurate to suggest that the old arrangements did not provide for community consultation; of course they did. There was extensive community consultation in relation to each of the airport plans. There were objection periods, which in some instances the government have actually shortened since they have been in office. We did not oppose that but they have shortened them. There was also consultation with state and local governments. I know that local governments would like to have complete control over planning of airports but that is not a course that I would recommend, and I note that that is also a view that the minister shares. But we do need to have appropriate opportunities for the public to be consulted. There are some improvements to the public consultation process in this bill and that is why we are supporting it, but it is not accurate to suggest that there was no public consultation previously.
Nor is it accurate to suggest that other developments could be given priority over aeronautical developments within an airport. The leases make it absolutely clear that the airports are there for airport purposes and that they must be used with those objectives in mind. There must also be adequate provision for future land and resources to be available for airport expansion; that is why they are there. But it is true that other developments have been allowed on airport sites, and on some of the very large sites, like Melbourne and Brisbane, that has helped to improve the efficiency of the airport and helped to focus important trade and import-export type businesses within the airport environment.
As I said earlier, the opposition will not be opposing these amendments; they are an improvement. I foreshadowed during the House of Representatives debate that these amendments would be needed, and I am pleased that at last the government has come to that realisation.

That the amendments be agreed to.
I would like to thank all the members who have contributed to the debate on the
Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Bill 2010. The bill reflects the government’s commitment to reduce the volume and complexity of the taxation law. The primary purpose of the bill is to consolidate into a single framework taxation secrecy and disclosure provisions currently found across 18 different taxation acts. In doing so, it will overcome inconsistencies and ambiguities associated with the existing provisions.
The bill affirms the importance of maintaining a high level of protection of information provided by taxpayers. As with the existing law, it will impose serious sanctions for the unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information. The government has also decided to agree to the opposition amendments to the bill. The opposition’s amendments will provide for new approval procedures for particular disclosures by taxation officers under the bill, including that senior officers approve disclosures to law enforcement agencies; to require that the Australian Taxation Office publish these procedures on its website; and create new annual reporting requirements for disclosures made to ministers and law enforcement agencies.

"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—The
Tax Laws Amendment (Confidentiality of Taxpayer Information) Bill 2010
is now much improved because the Senate accepted the amendments moved by the opposition which were foreshadowed in this House back in October and through the course of last week. As the parliamentary secretary has outlined, this bill will improve the tax laws in many important ways. In addition, the opposition wanted to ensure that there were appropriate safeguards in place. It foreshadowed amendments which were moved in the Senate and accepted finally by the government. One of those amendments, as the parliamentary secretary outlined, was that an appropriately authorised senior tax officer be the decision maker when a determination needed to be made about the public benefit of disclosing taxpayer information. This is an important amendment. As I said, it is an amendment foreshadowed by the opposition. Also, it is an amendment recommended unanimously by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I make that point here in the House because the government’s initial instinct was to ignore a unanimous recommendation of that Senate committee, which is chaired by a Labor senator with a Labor majority. Their initial instinct was to ignore that sensible recommendation. The fact that the government’s initial instinct was to do that says much about their approach to the transparency and openness that many members of this House want to see upfront. The fact that they have reluctantly agreed to these important improvements and to other improvements, in the two areas that the parliamentary secretary outlined, is welcome. This is an important bill. It is now a much improved bill thanks to those amendments. I commend the bill to the House.

That the amendments be agreed to.
The
Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010
is historic microeconomic reform and is in Australia’s long-term national interests. The measures in this bill have been subject to considerable discussion and scrutiny over more than the past year and I thank all parliamentarians for their contributions to the debate on this important piece of legislation. The bill has now been returned from the Senate with various amendments. The government supports these amendments and will be supporting this important legislation being carried with the Senate amendments.
Amendments (1) and (2) insert an object in the Telecommunications Act that makes clear the importance that parliament places on the provision of accessible and affordable telecommunications that enhance the welfare of Australians. Amendments (3) to (5) make clear that the structural separation undertaken must provide for transparency in the equivalence arrangements that will apply during the period that Telstra is engaging in its process of structural separation. Amendments (6) and (8) require the ACCC to have regard to the national interest in structural reform of the telecommunications industry and the impact on consumers in competition when deciding whether to accept a structural separation undertaking provided to it by Telstra. These amendments make it clear that the ACCC will consider how a structural separation undertaking will impact both competition and consumers. These amendments formally set out some of the considerations that the ACCC would in any case have regard to. I am glad that we have reached an agreement on the wording of these amendments.
Amendments (7), (9) to (17) and (19) require the minister to publicly consult before making certain instruments which relate to Telstra’s undertakings about structural separation, hybrid-fibre coaxial networks, subscription television broadcasting licences and functional separation. Amendment (18) adds a provision for determining the principle of equivalence for the purposes of functional separation. Amendment (20) requires the ACCC to monitor and report each financial year on breaches by Telstra of an enforced structural separation undertaking. Amendment (21) establishes that, before 30 June 2014, the minister must cause to be conducted a review of the operation of part 11C. Amendment (22) will replace the current outdated examples used in the definition of a standard telephone service in section 6 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.
The government’s supports each and every one of these amendments. I now urge all members in this chamber to support these amendments. It is in the interests of consumers, business and the economy more broadly that these historic reforms are passed and that they are passed today. We know that the structural separation of Telstra has been an issue which has been talked about by telecommunications commentators, academics and, indeed, many of the operators themselves, having knowledge that this reform is vital. I therefore commend the bill to the House as it is amended and say to the House that it is important that this be done.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I seek leave to move together an amendment to Senate amendment (2) together with two further related amendments as circulated to honourable members.
Leave not granted.
—I will then move the amendments to the Senate amendments to the bill one at a time. I move the amendment listed under my name as amendment (1):
(1)
 

Senate amendment 2, omit amendment, substitute :



       



; and


 



(c)


  



the universal availability of affordable carriage services, including broadband services, in the most cost effective manner that best combines least cost to the consumer and least cost to the public purse and as a consequence thereof, greatest increase in the public welfare of all Australians.

This amendment omits Senate amendment (2), which adds an additional object to the objects of the Telecommunications Act, and instead substitutes as an object the following words: ‘The universal availability of affordable carriage services, including broadband services, in the most cost-effective manner that best combines least cost to the consumer and least cost to the public purse and, as a consequence thereof, greatest increase in the public welfare of all Australians.’
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order under standing 160. Standing order 160 is very, very clear. Standing order 160 provides that further amendments to a bill must be relevant. It states:
The House may only amend a House bill which has been returned from the Senate if its further amendment is relevant to or consequent on the Senate amendments or requests for amendments.
What the member for Wentworth is attempting to do here is to change the very objectives of the legislation that have been agreed to by the Senate. That is not within the ambit of this House, which has already carried this legislation. The legislation has been determined by this House, it has gone to the Senate and it has been returned to this House. The reason that I objected to the amendments being dealt with together is that the member for Wentworth is attempting to move an amendment to change the objective of the act and then, consequent upon that, to change other schedules in the act, including an extraordinarily lengthy amendment to part 10 in which he suggests in his foreshadowed amendment (3) that the Productivity Commission prepare a cost-benefit analysis on the availability of the NBN. To the point of order: it is very clear that that particular item has already been rejected by this House.
—Order! I am in a position to rule on the point of order about amendment (1). Under standing order 160, the House will only discuss amendments that are relevant to the amendments being forwarded to it by the Senate. In this case, the amendment proposed by the member for Wentworth, amendment (1), is relevant to Senate amendment (2) as stated. It is an amendment to the added subsection at section 3(1)(c).
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. The most critical responsibility of this parliament and in the context of telecommunications is to ensure precisely this object, which fleshes out the amendment agreed to by the Senate. That is essentially to deliver—as Ken Henry famously said in respect of the importance of cost-benefit analyses—the most cost-effective availability of universal carriage services, in particular broadband, and to do so in a way that is at the least cost to consumers so that the internet or telecommunications access is most affordable and, at the same time, at the least cost to the public purse. Combining both of those aspects of the public welfare is a fundamental responsibility of this parliament, and it is appropriate that the objects of the act be amended in the way that we have submitted to better define that objective and ensure that we do our job as legislators in guarding the public interest and the public purse.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—Mr Speaker, I note your ruling on whether this was eligible under standing order 160. What must be clear is that the subsequent amendments foreshadowed by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, will lapse if this amendment loses. The consequences of this amendment being carried, of course, are that this important legislation for the structural separation of Telstra will be delayed. The Senate would have to be recalled. The Senate would have to reconsider the House’s views and then the House would have to be recalled again. There are no lengths to which the opposition will not go to deny this important structural separation of Telstra.
The fact is that we have had this debate. The fact is that the member for Wentworth has said he supports the structural separation of Telstra. And yet every measure possible is being put in the way of this legislation, even to the point where now, it having been properly and fully considered by the House, it having been properly and fully considered by the Senate, with amendments, and the government being prepared to accept each and every one of the Senate amendments, the member for Wentworth would seek to change the very objectives of the legislation, then send it back to the Senate to consider whether they would agree with our amendments, and then have the House sit again when it returns again.
The fact is that this structural separation of Telstra, this significant microeconomic reform, should have occurred at least years ago—many would argue decades ago. This is a debate that we have been in since the 1980s, and yet the member for Wentworth wants to further delay. The consequences of that, as the member for Wentworth would know, are severe for the future of the National Broadband Network. We know that this legislation has an impact particularly on Telstra, which has various meetings coming up. We know that in terms of the future of telecommunications reform in this country this is vital legislation.
The former government took a public monopoly and turned into a private monopoly and called it ‘reform’. They did not address what needed to be addressed in terms of structural separation to allow for a wholesale network, the National Broadband Network, with retail competition on top of it. There were real consequences for consumers as a result of the failure of former governments to not undertake the structural separation of Telstra. That is why we should reject the amendment moved by the member for Wentworth and why we should support the bill that is before the House as it has been amended by the Senate.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—The amendment proposed does no more than state the duty of this parliament, which is to ensure that the funds of the taxpayers of this nation are spent in the most cost-effective way. We have been calling for a cost-benefit analysis of this vast project. In response to that call, we have been accused by the Prime Minister of being wreckers, of being Luddites, of wanting to stand in the way of human progress, technology and all that is good for mankind. But the reality is that the people who are isolated in this cost-benefit analysis issue are the Prime Minister and her supporters on the government benches and, regrettably, on the crossbenches. We saw only last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, stating that—
—That’s a lie.
—I would ask the Treasurer to withdraw that, Mr Speaker.
—The Treasurer will withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—Glenn Stevens was asked about the general proposition of governments providing—
—That’s untrue and you know it.
—for projects of this kind and, when talking directly about the NBN—
—He was not and you know it.
—Mr Speaker, the Treasurer seems to have a difficulty with dealing with the facts.
—You have a difficulty with the truth.
—Order! The Treasurer will cease interjecting.
—What the Reserve Bank Governor said was: ‘There ought to be, of course, a proper cost-benefit analysis in those instances.’ Not only has the Reserve Bank Governor called for a cost-benefit analysis but so has the OECD—
—That’s untrue and you know it.
—The Treasurer will cease interjecting.
—in a report that the Treasurer knows was written by his own department.
—Another lie.
—Order! The Treasurer will be careful.
—And what about Ken Henry? Is he another wrecker? Is Ken Henry standing in the way of human progress? Ken Henry, the head of the Treasurer’s own department, has said, famously:
Government spending that does not pass an appropriately designed cost-benefit analysis necessarily detracts from Australia’s well-being. That is, when taxpayer funds are not put to their best use, Australia’s wellbeing is not as high as it otherwise could be.
In addition to that, we have seen leading business figures, including the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia and The Alliance for Affordable Broadband—10 of the competitive telcos—calling for a cost-benefit analysis. David Murray called for a cost-benefit analysis. Graham Bradley, president of the BCA, called for a cost-benefit analysis. The head of one of our leading ISPs, iiNet, Malcolm Malone, called for a cost-benefit analysis. What about the chairman of the ANZ Bank, John Morschel, or the chairmen of Boral and Wesfarmers or the chairmen of National Australia Bank and Woodside Petroleum? The fact is that it is difficult to find one credible business or economic leader in this country who does not support a cost-benefit analysis.
Indeed, the government’s hypocrisy on this is shown for what it is: all talk and no action. They set up Infrastructure Australia. For what purpose? For the very purpose, so they said, of identifying, prioritising and subjecting to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis major infrastructure projects. Yet when we have the biggest one in our history, the most significant one, there is no cost-benefit analysis. We do not even have a set of financials. We do not have a profit and loss; we do not have a cash flow statement; we do not have a balance sheet. Never has the parliament voted on a project so massive with so little information. What this amendment does is put right into the centre of this telecommunications debate the fundamental objectives of this parliament, which is to spend the taxpayers’ funds wisely.
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer can hoot and scorn and misrepresent the Reserve Bank governor as much as they like, but the fact is: if we, on our side, in calling for economic responsibility are Luddites then we are joined by dozens of the leading business figures and economic leaders in this country—people like Glenn Stevens, Warwick McKibbin, John Morschel; institutions like the OECD. These are all swept aside as nay-sayers and wreckers because they are not prepared to turn a blind eye, as the government expects the parliament to do, to this reckless expenditure.
Question put:

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I move:
(1)
 

Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (lines 2 to 5), omit the item.
—The member for Wentworth, having moved his amendment as circulated, has given me the ability to make a ruling about whether the motion is in order.

Mr Turnbull interjecting—
—I have not ruled yet. I would like to assist you in your submission to me. I am ruling amendment (3) out of order on the basis that it was dependent upon the member for Wentworth’s amendment (1) being successful. I have looked at the original Senate amendment (2), and I believe that his amendment to schedule 1 goes well beyond the elements of Senate amendment (2).
—As Mr Speaker knows, the definition of ‘relevance’ is something which bears upon or is connected with the matter at hand, and a consequential amendment is something which follows from the previous amendment. The amendment that is before us, relevantly, is the addition of an object which reads:
… the availability of accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of Australians.
The amendment I am submitting is relevant, in the sense that it bears upon and is connected with that new object, and following from it is the new part 10 providing for a Productivity Commission inquiry. That Productivity Commission inquiry is stated in new section 24A to have the purpose of enabling Australians to determine whether the object in subsection 3(1)(c)—the Greens amendment—is being realised. Of course, the object speaks to the welfare of all Australians.
The critical importance of a cost-benefit analysis to the issue of the welfare of all Australians was underlined by the Treasury Secretary, Ken Henry, when he said:
… government spending that does not pass an appropriately defined cost-benefit test necessarily detracts from Australia’s wellbeing—
which is another word for ‘welfare’—
that is, when taxpayer funds are not put to their best use, Australia’s wellbeing—
which has the same meaning as ‘welfare’—
is not as high as it otherwise would be.
Given that the Senate has concluded that an object of the act should be the availability of accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of all Australians, it is highly relevant for the parliament to provide in the act, relevant to that object, a mechanism to enable Australians to determine whether that object is being realised. The amendment therefore flows logically from the Senate amendment that has been passed.
This amendment (3), setting up the Productivity Commission cost-benefit analysis, does not flow from the amendment that I put a moment ago and which was defeated. It flows from the amendment that is the new object to section 3(1) of the Telecommunications Act.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—To your ruling and indeed in support of your ruling, Mr Speaker, standing order 160 is very clear that this amendment is out of order. What is more,
House of Representatives Practice, on page 434, states:
No amendment may be moved to an amendment of the Senate that is not relevant to the Senate amendment. A further amendment may not be moved to the bill unless the amendment is relevant to or consequent on the Senate amendment.
That makes it very clear that your ruling, Mr Speaker, is consistent with standing orders and with
House of Representatives Practice. That is precisely why the member for Wentworth sought to change the objects of this act—so that he could then move a consequential amendment. Indeed, the specific amendment that he is moving was rejected by the House when we debated the bill and it was rejected by the Senate. You have one shot in the House and you have one shot in the Senate. You are 2-0 down; both houses have rejected those amendments. Therefore, Mr Speaker, your ruling is absolutely correct.
This is completely an attempt to rewrite the nature of the act. It is an attempt to delay the structural separation of Telstra, which is what this bill is about. This is not directly about the establishment of the National Broadband Network. I introduced those bills in the House on Thursday of last week. I introduced two bills to the House, which had their first reading. Therefore, Mr Speaker, your ruling is absolutely correct—
—Order! The Leader of the House is straying slightly—
—and we should get on with the business—
—from the discussion.
—I am just supporting you, Mr Speaker.
—I appreciate that, but I am keen to get business moving—moving.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—Mr Speaker, on the ruling that you have made, with great respect to you, I do not think it is too late to amend that ruling. I know that you understand what section 160 of the standing orders says, but if I could just read it for the benefit of the rest of the House. Standing order 160 says:
The House may only amend a House bill which has been returned from the Senate if its further amendment is relevant to or consequent on the Senate amendments or requests for amendments.
I would then alert you to one of the amendments that the Senate passed to the House telecommunications bill, which is:
1A

At the end of subsection 3(1)
Add:

 

; and (c)
 

the availability of accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of Australians.
That is the relevant amendment to which the member for Wentworth wishes to add the words ‘for the purposes of enabling Australians to determine whether the object in subsection 3(1)(c) is being realised’—as in it refers directly to the amendment supported and passed by the Senate which was put by the Greens. He then lists a number of things that an analysis could take into account, including, at (a), ‘an analysis of the availability of accessible and affordable carriage, including broadband services across Australia’.
So, Mr Speaker, while I hear your ruling, I do respectfully put to you that what the member for Wentworth has done is fully comply with standing order 160. He has moved an amendment that is specifically relevant to an amendment that was passed by the Senate—namely, that in determining ‘the availability of accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of Australians’ this telecommunications bill include a requirement for a simple cost-benefit analysis. I therefore ask you to reverse your ruling and allow the member for Wentworth’s amendment to at least be debated.
—Whilst my learned colleague the member for Wentworth has put to me a very earnest submission, I am afraid that it has not persuaded me. Before we proceed, I just indicate that, whilst people may not be happy with the rulings, on this occasion the way in which the House has conducted itself by attempting to draft amendments I think is something that should be encouraged. But in this case I cannot find, to use the words of the member for Sturt, ‘enough specificity’ in the amendment to allow it to be in order. The question is that the Senate amendments be agreed to.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—The Senate amendments represent some very valuable, in many cases, amendments to this legislation, and there is no doubt that this legislation is a very important reform. Structural separation of Telstra is welcomed. The thing that we cannot avoid, though, is the $43 billion elephant in the room—or is it now a $50 billion elephant or a $55 billion elephant?—the National Broadband Network. While we may all agree with the ideal of enhancing greater reform in telecommunications by having a separation between the customer access network of Telstra and its retail business, this bill goes much further than that and basically sets the framework to enable the NBN to proceed and, in particular, to proceed without any rigorous or any economic analysis.
There is a lot of talk thrown around about the economic benefits of broadband, and all of us agree, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank said only on Friday, that greater connectivity is valuable. But, since the Treasurer accused me of lying only a moment ago, when I quoted the Governor of the Reserve Bank, I thought I might quote the governor in full. This man is now about to be described as a Luddite, a wrecker and an enemy to human progress and all its forms by the forces of modernity on the other side. Even the former Prime Minister is smiling now; he knows how silly their position is on this. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said:
As a general proposition, there probably are some projects that the private sector will not fund that still ought to be done. Whether this is one of them—
that is, the NBN—
would be another question. But I think you can imagine some projects that the private sector just does not feel it can take the risk on but on which the public sector—which, after all, has a stronger balance sheet than anyone else—might on some occasions be able to accept that risk. But there ought to be, of course, a proper cost-benefit analysis of that case in those instances. It is not unreasonable to expect that more interconnectivity around the country can be a benefit to productivity—that is a reasonable claim, it seems to me—but, as I have said on one or two other occasions, much hinges on how much you pay to do it and how efficiently it is done.
That is exactly our point. The issue here, the elephant in the room, is not the question of whether we should have broadband or whether we should have universal and affordable broadband or whether Telstra’s customer access network should be separated. The question is: are we spending taxpayer funds cost effectively? At this stage we have no transparency on this project—no transparency at all. We have seen overnight—
—Order! The member for Wentworth will resume his seat.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I am glad that I have not been shut down before my time has expired. One of the great claims made consistently for this project is the great economic benefit that will flow from it. It is taken almost as received wisdom that there are enormous external economic benefits coming from the provision of fibre to the home. But, as we have said for some time—and, indeed, as the Reserve Bank governor has said—there is no doubt there is a benefit in interconnectivity, but the big question is to what extent there is additional benefit in going from the interconnectivity that we have today, or the interconnectivity at speeds that we enjoy in the best-service parts of Australia, being delivered around the country to going to that enormous additional step of fibre to the home. As Robert and Charles Kenny pointed out in their paper on fibre to the home, which was released over the weekend, every other increase in internet access technology in the fixed-line environment has basically just required equipment at either end—that is, equipment at the exchange, a modem at the household or the business and upgrades at either end of the pipe, as it were—for the progression to DSL, to VDSL or, for cable networks, to DOCSIS 3, which is able to run at 100 megabytes.
Fibre to the home, however, involves a completely additional infrastructure. It requires not simply changing the electronics at either end but building a completely new infrastructure, and that is why is it is such an enormous step up in expense. So we need to be very sceptical about the claims of great economic benefits. One claim that is not correct, which the brothers Kenny pointed out in this report, is one made by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who, in 2009, said:
… innovation from information and communications technology is the single biggest driver of business productivity—it drives 78 per cent of productivity gains in service businesses and 85 per cent in manufacturing businesses.
The authors of the paper note:
… Prime Minister Rudd’s estimates of 78% of service and 85% of manufacturing productivity gains in Australia stemming from ICT seem to have been based on two papers from that country’s Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. These said that 59-78% and 65-85% of service and manufacturing productivity growth respectively was due to technological factors. What was an upper bound in the research has become a mid-point in Rudd’s speech, but more importantly the research was looking at all technological factors, not just ICT. Thus the figures cited include the benefits of everything from biotechnology to the rise of containerized transport. Finally, the research covered the period 1985-2001 for manufacturing and 1984-2002 for services, when the Internet was in its infancy and broadband was pre-natal.
I do not suggest that the Prime Minister did anything other than read a speech that was written for him by his department, but it goes to show that these claims of great productivity benefits from changes to technology need to be looked at in a very thorough and rigorous way, because the risk is that, if we just accept a sort of cornucopia of external spillover economic benefits from greater enhanced broadband services, without actually questioning them, we will be making a very poor investment of taxpayers’ funds, when those funds could be better used for other public infrastructure. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Brumby—unless there has been a change while we have been in here—no doubt regrets that more money was not spent by his government and the federal government on public transport rather than planning to spend $50 billion-plus on a national broadband network.
All of this points to the absolute necessity of rigorous financial analysis, of understanding how much we are spending and what we are going to get out of it and of ensuring that we maximise the welfare of all Australians with a thorough cost-benefit analysis.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I rise in support of the position offered by the member for Wentworth today. As he was speaking, I was reminded of a speech given by Mr Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, at a seminar run by the
Australian
that I attended at the Melbourne Institute. It was the Economic and Social Outlook Conference, the Road to Recovery, on 5 November 2009. The speech from the Chairman of the Productivity Commission is hugely instructive. At that time, in the wake of the financial crisis, there was a vigorous debate, albeit not as well reported as perhaps it should have been, about the importance of gaining the very best outcome from dollars spent by the government. Mr Banks said:
… poorly conceived or executed infrastructure investments can impose a double burden on the community, with future generations having to service higher debts from incomes that are lower than they otherwise would be.
Indeed, it could be argued that any stimulatory spending on economic or social infrastructure that did not yield a net benefit would be inferior on efficiency (national productivity) grounds, to giving the money to households for discretionary spending. At least such payments are likely to end up being directed to valued goods and services … at prices that reflect costs.
What the Chairman of the Productivity Commission was saying in 2009 was that there may well be a case for every dollar that is allocated by government to go back to individuals for the proper expenditure of that money in a productivity-enhancing manner rather than to have the government proceed with infrastructure projects that are not as productive as they would be if they had a proper cost-benefit analysis.
The speech is instructive on financial services and I refer others to it. But the interesting thing is that he says:
A second potential source of productivity gain, now that some of the pressure is off, are those larger scale ‘nation-building’ infrastructure proposals that were brought forward and selected without the opportunity to conduct adequate cost-benefit analysis (CBA). It would be desirable to delay the progression of such projects, until this can be remedied.
There is no more significant project—one that initially started as a $5-billion broadband to the nation project. Now it is revealed that it will be 10 times that amount. The Chairman of the Productivity Commission’s opinion, back in 2009—backing the sentiment expressed by the chairman of the Reserve Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury and every half-credible economist across the world—is that you should be having a cost-benefit analysis of infrastructure projects that are no longer about economic stimulation but are simply about spending taxpayers’ money. He went on to say:
There are two ‘urban myths’ about CBA—
cost-benefit analysis—
that appear to be gaining currency. One is that they need to be kept confidential because of commercially sensitive material. This conflates CBA with a competitive bidding process.
And he goes on to describe how you can have a cost-benefit analysis up-front without in any way compromising the delivery of the infrastructure. He says:
The second myth is that CBAs cannot be conducted where there are non-financial costs or benefits (like environmental impacts). Such impacts will be implicitly valued anyway. CBA merely requires that those valuation judgements be transparently tested.
I can understand the concerns of the Independents. I can understand the concerns of all Australians. We all do want to have a faster broadband in Australia. We all want that. But the fundamental point is: $50 billion later, was this the very best way that we could have spent the money? Or, even better: after $50 billion, could Australians have had $10 billion or $20 billion left, with a more appropriate spend of the money that could have delivered 10 or 15 or 20 brand new teaching hospitals with the money left over, and still have ended up with a broadband that delivered what Australians want?

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the
Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. We see a project here that is not following the traditional trajectory of projects that have been implemented by this government. There is a trajectory that these projects seem to follow. First we have the wildly inflated claims as to what a particular program will achieve and how it will be done. Next we have the bungled implementation phase of the project. The third phase is the massive cost overruns.
This project is a little bit different. We have had the first phase—we have had the madly inflated claims about what the project will deliver. But we have already jumped to stage 3—we have got the massive cost overruns—and the project has not even started. We started at $5 billion for a fibre-to-the-node project. Then we jumped up to $43 billion for the first cut at the costing. Now it is looking like $50 billion or $55 billion. We are already wildly over-budget and the project has hardly got off the ground.
Heaven knows what the final cost of this project is going to be. And the bottom line is: what are the Australian people going to forgo in order for Labor to try and complete this illusion—this con on the Australian people? We know why they do not want a cost-benefit analysis: they do not want the facts to come out. They have been fighting scrutiny every inch of the way. They have been fighting an economic analysis every inch of the way. We see a very important report—
—Mr Speaker—
—Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I remind the member for Cowper that this is not an opportunity to reopen the second reading debate.
—Mr Speaker—

Mr Albanese interjecting—
—You did not get a point of order.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Order! The member for Cowper has the call, and he is discussing the Senate amendments.
—The amendments, in part, deal with the issue of some degree of transparency. The opposition are all for transparency, but we are very concerned about a lack of transparency that has accompanied this project. There is a very informative new paper released by Robert and Charles Kenny, entitled ‘Superfast: is it really worth a subsidy?’ It raises a range of interesting concepts.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Cowper is straying nowhere near what the legislation and the amendments are about. This is a bill about the structural separation of Telstra, and we are receiving amendments that have been carried in the Senate.
—Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The question before the chair is that the Senate amendments be agreed to. The member for Cowper will relate his remarks to the Senate amendments.
—Absolutely. The Leader of the House raises the issue of the structural separation of Telstra and, effectively, the creation of a statutory monopoly which, if it is to become viable, requires the elimination of competition. It requires the HFC cable network to be switched off so that consumers cannot get cheaper broadband. It requires that the copper network be decommissioned so that you cannot get competition. This government is all about backing up its failed project. This government is all about trying to back up a $43 billion project that has become a $50 billion project and then a $55 billion project.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: again the member is now defying your ruling. This is about the Senate amendments to the bill about structural separation of Telstra.
—Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Cowper will relate his remarks to the Senate amendments.
—I am being relevant to the Senate amendments—very relevant indeed—because there are some very important points here about scrutiny. We are very focused on scrutiny. The members opposite do not want scrutiny. We want a high degree of scrutiny. We want to see that taxpayers get value for money. We want to see that taxpayers are not ripped off. We want to see that taxpayers do not fall victim to the sort of incompetence that they have had from this government on the pink batts program, on the Building the Education Revolution program—

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—I want to address the amendment which deals with the availability of accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of Australians. For two decades the bipartisan direction of policy in telecommunications in Australia, directed towards this objective of accessible and affordable carriage services, has been to enhance competition in telecommunications, and today in Australian telecommunications we have a dark day indeed, because that commitment has been comprehensively repudiated by this government. This government has turned its back on the core principle of competition in telecommunications. We have a bill which is bribing Telstra with $11 billion to shut down not just one network—not just the copper PSTN—but also the HFC network, which is already capable of delivering 100 megabits per second, the purported benefit of this bill. We have a proposal in this bill to authorise a transaction which would otherwise be anticompetitive as a breach of the Trade Practices Act. The scheme of this bill is anticompetitive to the core, and the amendment which the Senate has moved—
—Order! I remind the member for Bradfield that this is not an opportunity to do a second reading speech.
—The Senate amendment which I am addressing goes to the core question before this parliament: how do we discharge our responsibility to the people of Australia to deliver affordable and accessible carriage services? You cannot do that with a bill that is so fundamentally anticompetitive. We have heard that the minister intends to specifically limit and constrain the prices that competing networks may charge, an extraordinarily heavy-handed and centralised intervention in what has previously been a competitive market. This bill cannot achieve a competitive regime consistent with the principle stated in this Senate amendment of accessible and affordable carriage services. You cannot achieve that objective by allowing a national broadband network to put forward a proposal for a mere 14 points of interconnect nationally, centralised in five capital cities. You cannot achieve that objective with this grubby proposal that will permit a deal which would otherwise be in breach of the Trade Practices Act.
As we ask the question about how we best make available accessible and affordable carriage services that enhance the welfare of Australians and as we turn our minds in this House to that Senate amendment, we must ask: is this truly a bill about the structural separation of Telstra, as has been claimed, or is it a bill by which the government of the day is proposing to pay a large company to shut down two perfectly viable and operational networks which deliver service today? One of those networks is the HFC network—a network perfectly capable of delivering a speed of 100 megabits per second. Instead, as we consider this question of whether we are delivering accessible and affordable services, we have an extraordinary scheme under which some $50 billion is going to be spent. It is claimed a return on that money will be generated. What will the generation of that return mean? It will mean that very large amounts will have to be recovered from people who use that network. In turn, it will mean the charging of increased prices to consumers. People who may have no interest in broadband are going to have the government knocking on their doors saying: ‘We are shutting down your perfectly operational service. We are shutting down the service you are perfectly happy with. We are going to replace that with a government mandated broadband service and that may cost you more money, but this is a scheme that we in the government have decided is a good one.’ I have worked in telecommunications policy for 15 years. I am as passionately committed to an improved broadband infrastructure as anybody in this place. Drawing on all that experience, I say that this is an atrocious bill and it ought to be rejected.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,52,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-11-25,"—I rise to support the Senate amendments and to support the amended
Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. We have had some debate about the substance of the issue which goes to competition policy and the amendments that go to the consideration of that. Allan Fels, who knows something about competition, has described this legislation as a victory for the ACCC. He said:
Yes and for consumer. This had to happen. The access law was very weak and it was introduced at a time when the government wanted to privatise Telstra, so it made it weak and kept it weak. And so the true objectives of policy weren’t achieved.
If you are not convinced by Allan Fels, perhaps you will be convinced by this quote:
In fixed-line telecommunications today we have the equivalent of Qantas owning all the airports. The result: competition is weak.
That is Paul Fletcher, now the member for Bradfield, in
Wired Brown Land?. It was the former government that privatised Telstra without protecting competition, choice or service delivery and that has had devastating consequences, particularly in regional Australia, and has ensured that whilst there are relatively decent services in my electorate around Marrickville or around Wentworth those same services simply are not available in places like Mount Isa, Tamworth or Cooma.
The fact is that this process has been through a substantial amount of debate and scrutiny. We now have these amendments before the House that have been carried by the Senate. What we have had today, with the absurd motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in order to stall proceedings and by many of the measures moved by the opposition today, is an attempt once again to delay. That is why this bill as amended must be carried as is; otherwise, the consequences are the Senate being recalled then the House being recalled again to deal with what occurs in the Senate.
We have had appropriate scrutiny for all of these measures. The bill before the House is about the structural separation of Telstra. The shadow Treasurer says we are only doing that for the National Broadband Network. It is certainly the case that this bill is related to the NBN because the structural separation of Telstra is necessary to ensure that you can have a wholesale network and build retail competition on top of that. That is why this legislation is important.
Regardless of what was occurring, the structural separation of Telstra is relevant in and of itself. The fact that the shadow Treasurer does not understand that goes back to the sort of ideological position that saw a public monopoly become a private monopoly in place of reform. That is what the former government did with Telstra. That is why we are ensuring this important piece of microeconomic reform, which is about delivery for consumers rather than about maximising the sales prices which occurred at the time that Telstra was privatised as Allan Fels has indicated in his quote and as Paul Fletcher has indicated in his book,
Wired Brown Land?. I commend the amendments to the House. I commend the bill with the Senate amendments to the House.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—After seven years of the worst drought on record, northern Victorians have finally seen some abundant rains. However, one season of average rainfall does not undo the damage to the local economy or individual bank accounts. As well, right now there is growing despair as people await the outcome of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s guide to the proposed Basin Plan, fearful that there might not be a balanced result at the end of the day. So I want to put on the record what happens when you do not have enough water to sustain an agribusiness that has been a world leader in terms of efficiency and profitability in the past. A report has just been released, compiled by the Victorian Department of Primary Industries, the Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project and the HMC Property Group. It asks: ‘Where have all the dairies gone?’ From data derived from inspection of 9,500 of 11,500 properties, the report found:
While a high degree of change was anticipated, the results can only be described as startling. The most significant finding was the movement of properties out of irrigated dairy production due to the drought conditions and the low water allocation environment that has prevailed … and the extent to which that land is no longer actively farmed.
In fact, in the area long considered the food bowl of Victoria, the most common land use for the 2009-2010 irrigation season was “in transition”. The inspection program identified that the idle rural land component comprised over 45% of the nearly 800,000 hectares of rural land across the study area.
Typically the idle land was part of ex-dairy and fodder production that have been “dried off” and fallen into poor state. Weed infestation and general degradation were prevalent on these properties. Not only had these holdings been retired from irrigation, they had been retired from active agriculture.
The farms were often located within older soldier settlement districts and while they featured older style irrigation lay-out they also occupied better than average soils in areas that were once highly sought after.
The point I am making is that the consequence of lack of water security is no farming activity. In this case, nearly 45 per cent of once-dairy country is no longer being farmed. It is not being farmed for dairy or for any alternative agricultural production; it is simply land lying idle and being degraded. That is why it is critical, if we want to have food security into the centuries ahead for this country, that we must understand the significance of a balanced approach to the environment and agriculture, particularly irrigated agriculture in this part of the world that I am referring to. That in turn gives you a viable, effective community that more than contributes its share to building the economy of Australia. There are solutions to this, quite obviously, and those solutions will very much be in the hands of this government as it puts together the Murray-Darling Basin Plan for years to come.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Murray-Darling Basin</title>,Constituency Statements,55,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2010-11-25,"—It is with pleasure that I speak on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s speech. There are a number of things I would like to raise in this debate. Firstly, I would like to recognise the time of the new parliament since the election. Obviously I was involved in the process of the determination of the government. Since that determination occurred, there has been a settling-in period, which you have been a part of, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper. A number of changes have been made in procedures and processes. I am pleased to say that I think things are starting to settle down, and the nature of this particular parliament has been a positive experience so far. Some people with various political agendas may find that difficult to handle, but there have been some positive indications that some of the substantive issues that the Australian people want addressed can be addressed in this particular parliament.
One of the very attractive things about this particular parliament—and I am not speaking just as an Independent; it is not just about vested interest; I think the Australian people are looking very closely at this—is that the executive does not have total power, as is normally the case. It is quite a different parliament to previous ones. As time goes on, I think members from both sides of the parliament will recognise that there are very real opportunities in the nature of this particular parliament which will give all backbenchers, all members of parliament, a degree of freedom that they have not experienced in the past. There was a dictatorial nature of previous parliaments, where the executive, the ministry, the cabinet and the inner cabinet dictated to the backbench how they would think and how they would vote. This parliament is going to be substantively different.

I have just left the other chamber and there is a debate going on down there about the suspension of standing orders, for instance. That debate is based on the logic rather than the politics of argument. I think it is refreshing to see people arguing and putting their case before their fellow parliamentarians within the parliament and then having it adjudicated by those fellow parliamentarians. In a technical and theoretical sense that is what our House of Representatives was supposed to be about. It was supposed to be about representatives from the various electorates coming together and debating various issues on the floor of the chamber, making decisions as to whether the arguments had been cogently put, whether they had been convincing and whether they had logic, and then the decisions being made.
I think the Australian people are starting to see that this parliament is significantly different from other parliaments they have had. Some would argue that, in a hung parliament, nothing will happen. Some people in the media and some people in the political process have argued that reform will not occur in this particular parliament because of the nature of it.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 10.06 am to 10.43 am
—Before the interruption, due to a division having been called, I was talking about the reform process. Some people have suggested that, because of the nature of this particular parliament, reform of a significant nature will not occur. I would argue to the contrary. For instance, as we speak today, I think the passage of the National Broadband Network, in my view, is a very good example of a very-much needed reform, which essentially has been neglected in the politics of telecommunications for the last decade. It is no secret that I am a fan of the fibre-optic arrangements under the National Broadband Network and I am very pleased to see that reform proceeding, as I am to see the structural separation of Telstra. I think the two things are very significant in terms of the way forward, particularly for regional Australia where anybody with any sense would understand that the possibility of developing two or more wholesale networks in regional Australia is just nonsense. It may happen in some major urban areas but, obviously, not in country areas.
We had that debate some time ago when the third tranche of Telstra was sold. The then Prime Minister, John Howard, and the National Party’s Senator Joyce, who had the balance of power in the Senate, argued that competition would deliver to country communities. Obviously, that has not occurred. As part of the agreement with Senator Joyce and the then President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, on the passage of the legislation to sell the third tranche of Telstra they said they had it in writing and that it would be entrenched in legislation that there would be equity of access to broadband and telephone services, including price, for country constituents. And we all know that that did not occur. So one of the things that I am very pleased about is that, in our negotiations on the formation of this government, there was support not only for the National Broadband Network and the rollout in regional Australia but also for obtaining an equalised wholesale price. So, as I said, I am very supportive of that piece of reform.
There are other areas where I think the nature of this parliament can achieve significant reform. I am pleased to see the member for Riverina here. He has very big shoes to fill. Even though he is taller than the previous occupant, they are big shoes to fill. I pay my regards to his predecessor Kay Hull, who was an excellent member of parliament. The member for Riverina is also involved in the House of Representatives committee that is looking at the Murray-Darling issue. That is the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, and I congratulate Minister Crean for setting up that committee. Also part of the discussions we had in the formation of government was that a regional development committee should be part of the committee processes within this parliament. It has not been in the past but I think that has now been remedied.
The significant issue of the Murray-Darling system, which has been politicised and played with for many years, with very little happening, is now coming to a head and the regional Australia committee will look at that issue. As I have said on a few occasions before, the nature of this particular parliament—and it can fail, as other parliaments have—could utilise the hung parliament to obtain a solution to the ongoing problems of both the socioeconomic impacts of water reform and the environmental concerns that many people do have in parts of the system—at the top end, at the bottom end and, obviously, in the middle. So that is another area of reform where this parliament could proceed and make meaningful gains. Some people have suggested that this will be a stagnant parliament because the executive does not have control. As I said before the break, I think it is a great thing that the executive does not have control. I think that in his next book John Howard may well agree, because when the executive had total control of the parliament the wheels started to fall off that particular government. I know that, if you are into power, that is what you want, but the people do have their say as well.
There are other areas of reform. I am involved in a multiparty committee that is looking at climate change. In the previous parliament, I was on another committee that was looking at the impact of climate change on agriculture, and there are a number of issues that I will be raising in this committee as well. I think that is an area that we need to look at. That might be in terms of direct action, as the Leader of the Opposition has talked about from time to time. I have spoken about a number of issues there in terms of soil carbon and various technologies that not only assist in the sequestering of carbon but also improve drought readiness for various farming and grazing activities. That is a very significant issue that potentially will be addressed by this parliament.
There are many other issues that I think will be debated, and the Governor-General mentioned some of those in her address, but I do not think there is any that intersects and interconnects a lot of those issues that is greater in importance than broadband. Not only does it have the capacity to negate distances—a disadvantage of being a resident in the country; it has the capacity to enhance productivity in a number of ways. I note that Malcolm Turnbull has been talking about the Productivity Commission, and I have discussed that with Malcolm on a whole range of occasions.
One of the reasons that I did not agree with the arguments of the member for Wentworth about the Productivity Commission was that it is very hard for a body such as the Productivity Commission to factor in technologies and services that we do not even know exist yet. One of the things that I raised with a number of economists on that issue is: for instance, how would you design it as a benefit in, say, 10 years time if 300,000 aged people who would normally enter the aged-care institutional sector were able to be kept in their homes for an extended period with the interactive arrangements that broadband would offer? What would be the savings to the aged-care budget? What would be the capital savings in facilities that will need to be built if the baby boomer group head, as they are heading—and there is a representative of them here today, Paul Neville—into that age group where they will have to go into an aged-care facility?
—Not for a while yet!
—The member for Hinkler’s hearing is adequate, and obviously he will be able to stay in this environment for quite some time! I did mention, member for Hinkler, that in about 10 years time the technologies will quite possibly be available for interactive, real-time health care and participation in communication with relatives, and also this technology has the capacity to provide monitoring services within the home environment. What savings will be accrued from that sort of technology? No-one knows that, and the Productivity Commission can only guess at it, and there are any number of examples of that sort of thing. What will the savings be when GPs in country areas will be able to almost immediately contact specialist services, potentially in any part of the world, if they have issues? That sort of backup in providing some of those services is going to be extraordinary.
One thing I would like to speak about as well is the ongoing debate that is taking place in regional Australia, particularly in parts of the New England electorate, about the interface of coalmining methane gas extraction, groundwater systems, surface water systems and flood plain management. There have been a number of issues in Queensland recently where there are very real concerns about the lack of a policy platform to base future decisions on. And the people of the Liverpool Plains, for instance—there was another meeting held in Gunnedah only last week, and the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attended, as did others—have very real concern with some of these extractive activities and even the exploratory activities that the state governments are allowing to proceed without any real knowledge of the potential impacts on the hydraulics of various groundwater systems and the long-term impacts on some of the most productive land in Australia.
In that case I was talking about the Liverpool Plains. In Queensland, in the Haystack Plain and in places like Felton and other parts of the Darling Downs, areas which have been very, very productive over the long term, some of the more profitable extractive activities are moving in. We really do not know the long-term impact of allowing those industries to go ahead. I am not arguing against those industries, but I have argued for some time that what we really need—and I will be moving this way next year when the parliament settles down—is legislation to put in place some form of bioregional assessment prior to the granting of exploration licences and the argy-bargy that goes on between the investment sector and government. In this case it is mostly state government but, with the Murray-Darling arrangements in place between the Commonwealth and the states, there is a role for the Commonwealth to play, and part of that role may well be through amendment to the Water Act 2007. Irrespective of how we do it, we need to put in place a clear policy platform for bioregional assessment to be done. If the bioregional assessment shows that there are risks if certain activities occur in certain areas—to the groundwater systems or whatever, depending on the nature of the land—then those activities would be prohibited.
These bioregional assessments could well involve putting lines on a map to show certain areas where exploratory activity and mining activity can occur and other areas where it cannot. It is a fairly simplistic way of looking at it. Some people say that it would be very difficult to do. Well, we do it in national parks now. We have passed a law to say that in certain areas of land you do not carry out certain activities. I suggest that we do the same for some of the very productive food-producing areas, particularly where there is an interconnect between the groundwater and surface water, and particularly when we are going through this process of trying to design an intervalley water budget. If extractive activities that could impact on groundwater and surface water flow were allowed to proceed, what would it do in the Murray-Darling, for instance, in terms of the whole water budget? I do not know the answer to that and neither do the mining companies and the state governments. Before we get too many cumulative impacts of some of these extractive activities, we really need to have a handle on what that means.
Normally an extractive industry will look after its area of land, but all it has to do through the EIS process is look after the area of land it is actually mining and make sure that nothing gets off it to pollute the neighbours. But, if you are invading groundwater systems, the impact could occur 10 or 100 kilometres away—nowhere near the actual activity itself. Proving in a court that the extractive activity, when it crossed a groundwater aquifer, for instance, caused a problem 10 or 15 kilometres away will be enormously difficult for a landholder to do. The case would be beaten to death in the courts. I think government has to put in place a policy. As I said, I will be moving to put in place some sort of legislative arrangement next year that will address that. There are others who are looking at it. I know Melanie Stutsel, the environmental officer for the Minerals Council of Australia, addressed a similar issue in a Senate inquiry a few years ago. The mining industry were suggesting that they were not opposed to something similar to a bioregional assessment. The question is: who does the assessment? I think it is the role of government. The Murray-Darling system, where we have come to special agreements between the states and the Commonwealth, would be a very good place to start.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,56,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2010-11-25,"—It is a pleasure to be able to respond to the Governor-General’s speech. In doing so, let me start at the beginning. The election on 21 August was unique in our country’s history. The run-up to it was marked by the crumbling of the Rudd government. From the moment Tony Abbott took the leadership of the coalition on 1 December 2009, a new dynamic swept across Australian politics, with the polls showing a growing disenchantment with the Rudd government. In the last week of the 2010 winter session, that disenchantment in the government had developed into disillusionment and finally into panic. The execution cabal, consisting of union and ALP officials and former officials now in the parliament, was ready to strike and did so ruthlessly on Wednesday, 23 June. It was as close to a bloodless coup as we are ever likely to see in this country. Many rank-and-file members, and even senior cabinet ministers, had no idea what was afoot until the die was cast. Some of them did not know until they came back to the chamber from dinner engagements around 10 or half-past 10 at night. The party meeting was merely a formality.
Not surprisingly, there was disquiet if not outright shock in an unsuspecting electorate. This disquiet was palpable, certainly in my area, and especially amongst traditional Labor voters, many of whom were quite outspoken and said they would never vote Labor again. While the coup had many of the hallmarks of the faceless men of old, there was a troubling difference: the coup leaders were not shy about their roles. They gloated in media interviews and maintained their sense of smug self-satisfaction by indulging themselves in retrospective books on their roles, milking the previous leader’s demise for everything they could get out of it. It is little wonder then that the new Prime Minister evoked the catch cry ‘moving forward’, using it incessantly. Why the emphasis on moving forward? Because no-one dared looked back. The other mantra excusing the plotters’ duplicity was ‘Labor had lost its way.’ That too resonated in the electorate, though not in the same way Labor might have expected. The admission hangs around the Prime Minister’s neck as an albatross of constant reminder. It was certainly not a strong footing for a new government.
Against this background, we moved inevitably towards the federal election. Hinkler, which three years ago ceded Gladstone and the parts north and west of the Burnett River to Flynn and picked up Hervey Bay, has always been a volatile electorate. It has nevertheless been kind to me in its new and old manifestations over the last seven elections, and I deeply appreciate the loyalty and generosity of my constituents, especially on 21 August. Hinkler, which is now essentially the Coral Coast, Bundaberg, Childers and Hervey Bay, resisted the 8.5 per cent swing to Labor in 2007, despite which my margin was reduced to 1.7, and later by redistribution to 1.5. However, the results in 2010 not only recaptured old ground but took the LNP vote to 60.5, an increase of 8.9 per cent and two per cent above our notional recent best. I was humbled to win all 48 of the booths in Hinkler, with positive swings in 47 of them. In one the vote actually dropped from 65 to 63 per cent—my only bad mark in the campaign. Dreadful!
The rejection of Labor twice on these new boundaries deserves some attention, not for some personal self-indulgence but rather as the basis of an analysis of Labor’s contempt for the electorate. In both the 2007 and 2010 elections Labor made only meagre promises to Hinkler, two of them former promises—the Isis River Bridge and the Hervey Bay Community Centre. In 2007 we were promised $10,000 water grants for surf clubs. Why you would give water grants to surf clubs I have never been quite sure. Only half of them were ever delivered. A modest grant was also given to the Bundaberg Cricket Association. In 2010 Labor promised 50 per cent funding for an athletics track in Bundaberg and $70,000 to convert a toilet block into a sporting club canteen—hardly riveting stuff and paltry when put against the rampant ALP promises in some marginal seats where there were serious challenges, like Herbert and Flynn.
What infuriated me was the lack of collective vision on the part of the ALP when it came to local projects. You would think that both sides of politics would want to get these things for the community. These were practical, focused and, in many cases, modest proposals. It seems the ALP candidate was forbidden from matching my promises, important as they were to the community, no doubt on the basis that, if I were successful, an ALP government would not be committed to delivering them. It is a bit cynical, isn’t it?
In short, Labor’s failure to articulate a real vision for our communities or to commit to key civic infrastructure was their real undoing. Quite frankly, I was amazed that, outside those I have just spoken of, Labor did not identify one solitary key project to support or even map out a plan for the growth of the region. I think that lack of knowledge or passion for the electorate cost them dearly. The people and businesses in Hinkler are passionate about improving their future. They simply will not accept candidates who do not even engage with grassroots issues.
In contrast, the coalition made commitments to road infrastructure in Hervey Bay, a rapidly increasing city; improving local waterways; and building a performing arts centre at Urangan State High School. None of these were matched by my Labor opponent. In fact, she described the latter, almost unbelievably, as ‘unfair to other high schools’, failing to recognise the role of an integrated arts curriculum in a regional high school. Why should all these special arts faculties be only in capital cities? Why can’t we have one in regional Australia? I cannot for the life of me understand why the Labor candidate would not match the coalition’s $3 million commitment to get this project off the ground. She was once a supporter of it but backed away from it.
The projects I have been talking about have not been just plucked out of the air. They are things that have been identified by the community as local priorities and, in some instances, they are things that have been worked on for years. For instance, the performing arts centre at Urangan high school has the strong backing of the community and the school has been visited over time not only by lots of local people interested in the concept but also by former Prime Minister Rudd, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Albanese, and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. All of them have been there.
The coalition also planned $10 million for helping the Fraser Coast council upgrade key arterial roads around Hervey Bay, like the much talked about Urraween extension and River Heads Road, the access corridor to Fraser Island. This investment would have helped relieve traffic congestion in a growing city and would have been a much needed boost to business in the first instance and tourism in the second.
Hervey Bay is also lucky to be the home of the Fraser Coast youth mentoring service, which supports and guides troubled students who are having a tough time with school and need extra encouragement to stick with their education. We talk a lot about this, but we do not do much about it. Unfortunately, the program’s funding has not been renewed by this government—a situation that the coalition was ready to fix by providing around $600,000 to keep it running for a further three years. I have already met with the Attorney-General since we resumed about the continued funding for this youth mentoring service, and I am hopeful the government will take on board its importance to the local community and provide some funding to keep the doors open.
At the Bundaberg end of the electorate, I fought for commitments to clean up our local rivers with a new water weed harvester and to open up the mouth of the Elliott River by way of a groyne wall—both of which would have made a real difference to very serious environmental problems. The sense of disappointment in the electorate that Labor will not match these commitments is palpable. People are not stupid. They understand that the government holds the purse strings. So I appeal to the government to seriously look at these projects, match the coalition’s commitments and improve the prospects in my electorate of Hinkler.
I also identified some small projects like a grant of $260,000 to the Hervey Bay Hockey Association and others under coalition structured programs like revegetating the isthmus at Elliott Heads and consolidating sections of the Hervey Bay foreshore—a prime tourist area and currently a hot topic in that city at present. There is some erosion and some clumps of vegetation that need attention. We also identified, under our environmental high schools program, Bundaberg High, Isis High and Xavier College.
As I said, my opponents in 2007 and 2010 would not engage with me on these issues, not so much as a serious letter to the editor. It was as if they were ordered to be mute. During the 2010 election campaign they offered, as an offset, a contrived series of debates on health. I refused to debate these issues until the coalition’s policy was on the table. The debates went ahead without me and drew a paltry 25 and 30 people respectively. After you removed the media, organisers and ALP functionaries, the debates drew only 12 or 15 members of the public. In fact, the worst attended was for the then Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who did much of the speaking for the candidate, who was supposed to be debating, while a CFMEU devotee helpfully waved around a placard—no doubt to enhance the one-sidedness of the event.
For all that, we had a great campaign. May I acknowledge today my superb campaign team led by Rod Wilson, who has masterminded all seven of my campaigns. His meticulous attention to detail and his experience with the media is unsurpassed. Dick Bitcon was his deputy and the National Party-LNP’s ‘light on the hill’ in the Bundaberg district. Dick added even greater strength to the campaign, as did the team in the Hervey Bay office: Norma Hannant, John Rutherford and Jenny Sorensen. Steve and Trish Hoffman coordinated the Childers area in between the two cities. Ruth Gillespie also played a vital role in the finance for the campaign and I appreciate her help.
May I also acknowledge Brendon Falk, Wayne Fehlhaber, Dale Fehlhaber, Paula Harberger, Michael Nyenhuis, Ted Sorensen, Russell Green, John Rutherford, Julie Stewart, Stan Flack, John Norris and Steve Dixon for their hard work. The LNP’s Llew O’Brien, our regional vice-president, was also ready to help anywhere anytime.
It is not just the five weeks of a campaign which decides the fate of the sitting member; it is the time in between campaigns which dictates whether the seat will be held or lost, and I have been singularly blessed with excellent and experienced staff who have done the hard yards. Kate Barwick, Heather Hawkins, Janelle Geddes, Darlene Dobson and my former chief-of-staff, Leslie Smith, who returned for a short time, worked tirelessly before, during and after the campaign, doing the everyday things behind the scenes that got the right result on that day. The pivotal anchor of my campaign was my wife Margaret, without whose support and humour a tough campaign would have been made impossible.
As we look to the horizon of the next three years, or however short this term might be, I see some important targets for Hinkler. Firstly, we need to dedicate ourselves to a campaign to see pensions increased. Increasingly, I see pensioners come into my office who cannot make ends meet. This is not some whinge or annual push for more money; this is a serious cry to the government for help and to recognise how costs are impacting on vulnerable retirees.
While I acknowledge the special increase of $30 to single pensioners a year or so ago and the recent half-yearly adjustments, more has to be done to allow those who have worked all their lives to live reasonable and trouble-free existences. If members are in any doubt about what I am saying, let us look at the costs which have risen since Labor came to power. Let us look at the quarterly figures for December 2007 and September 2010: electricity prices increased by an average of 42 per cent across Australia; gas prices an average of 29 per cent; water and sewerage has increased by an average of 46 per cent; hospital and medical services by 20 per cent; education costs—school fees etc—by 17 per cent; postal costs are up 16 per cent; and property rates and charges have risen 19 per cent. Those increases do not factor in the recent pressures from a variety of influences—for example, the scarcity of properties in mining and mining service communities which has been instrumental in pushing rents up to a point where many pensioners have had to leave towns. If the cabinet leak which said that the current Prime Minister was opposed to pension increases is true I am truly staggered.
I am not a tree hugger; I am a practical environmentalist. I have demonstrated that in many ways in my electorate. But with the Great Barrier Reef and the offshore fishing grounds around my electorate of Hinkler there has to be balance. First, we had what was called the East Coast Trawl plan that took out 250 trawlers—in fact it actually took out 290. We were told the reef was then secure. Then we had the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s RAP program—its Representative Areas Program. It was originally only to take 20 per cent of the water surface of the reef, but when the maps came out it was 33 or 34 per cent. In my part of the reef, the southern end of the reef, the practical application of the government measures was 70 per cent. Now we are going to have a closure off Fraser Island. This is known as the Fraser Area for Further Assessment, which is a cute way of saying: ‘We are going to close down a bit more.’ We will come to a point where there will not be a critical mass left in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay to drive the processing works. Before all those programs I have talked about, we had about 80 trawlers each in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. Today we have about 30 in each city. Another cut could see that number reduced to 20 or fewer. Then we get to a point where we do not have critical mass, which then flows back through the community to the people who work in the processing works, to the chandlery, to the fuel, to the people who service the trawlers and, indeed, down to recreational fishing, which relies on a lot of those services as well.
The other thing I want to see is fair treatment for farmers. There is a push now to tell farmers that they are environmental vandals. That is not the case. I have never met a farmer who does not believe in looking after his property or in looking after riparian areas around properties. This is another push that is coming on to primary producers, not just fishermen but farmers. I call on the government to be fair to people when bringing these measures about, to understand that, yes, there have to be environmental measures, but you do not have to make life a misery for everyone along the chain.
Those are my views on the Governor-General’s speech. I hope that the electorate of Hinkler will continue to prosper. I will be doing everything in my power to make it so.

(Mr Murphy)—Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,56,1
"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2010-11-25,"—Several weeks ago, I hosted the inaugural Bennelong trilevel government meeting, bringing together federal, state and council leaders on a quarterly basis. These meetings will address collaboration on projects where limited resources were previously wasted due to duplication. Inevitably, the topics for discussion centre on overdevelopment and the inadequate provision of infrastructure. Bennelong faces a dire situation due to a lack of long-term planning and the impact that has on our daily lives. Not a day goes by without a different situation raising its head to add to this condition.
Last month I spoke of the state government using its part 3A powers of the New South Wales planning laws to overrule council decisions on the establishment of high-density housing. As an example, the former Channel 7 site in Mobbs Lane, Epping, will now have 800 apartments—in a lane. Where is the infrastructure to support these people? Where is the planning? Last week I met with senior managers from Energy Australia regarding an electricity substation next door to residential homes in Buffalo Road, Ryde. Despite the $40 million price tag, the costs to the community of exposure to high levels of electromagnetic fields were mostly ignored and consideration was only given to community consultation after the property was secured. We have seen Telstra and Optus towers in Ryde and North Ryde being proposed, again with insufficient community consultation, requiring multiple meetings with the management of both companies to improve their dialogue and assess alternative sites.
Yesterday I read a report by an independent think tank called Lateral Economics which described New South Wales as ‘groaning under the weight of a widely recognised infrastructure crisis’. The report went on to comment that our constituents are paying for this lack of long-term planning:
… they are paying with inflated tolls on roads … they are paying with their time as they wait at peak hour in traffic … Indeed, these problems explain no small part the below average economic growth of NSW itself since these policies took hold.
Even Labor councillor Alison McLaren was quoted as saying:
“The government can no longer justify deferring critical transport projects such as South West and the North West rail links …”
The Epping to Parramatta rail link must be added to this critical list.
Today we have the ridiculous situation regarding a road over the M2 freeway, called Murray Farm bridge. This road carries 1,000 cars an hour during peak-hour periods and connects the two parts of Beecroft split by the M2. The Murray Farm bridge is due to be closed for a period of 10 months while widening work is done on the freeway. The proposed alternative route takes locals on a roundabout journey, down back streets, through black spots and past several schools, all leading to a 30-minute drive time for a two-kilometre journey. Give me a break.
Add to this the development of the Royal Rehabilitation Centre in Ryde, which will offer some benefits to the community. But, again, I ask: where is the planning? The traffic generated from 791 apartments will funnel onto Morrison Road, which is already running at three times over the RTA operational capacity. I have been meeting with stakeholders on this matter since February. I must also declare a personal interest, as I have recently bought a house just off Morrison Road. The absolute inefficiency and the cost of this total lack of long-term planning is frightening. To quote Lateral Economics again:
… the citizens of NSW are realising that their long term interests have still fallen victim to short-termism.
The important consideration is that this is a national problem that requires a national solution. It is our job as representatives to plan for the future and make provision for the necessary infrastructure as we grow. We are suffering from the super cost and compromise of the retrofitting of infrastructure. This must be replaced in the future by serious, well-considered long-term planning. Trilevel government collaboration should be an important component of the development of planning and the implementation of that infrastructure. This cooperation is in the best interests of our constituents. These matters are of the utmost importance.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Bennelong Electorate: Infrastructure</title>,Adjournment,57,1
