"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-12-10,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade. Can the minister confirm that the single desk for wheat exports will be a negotiable item in discussions with the United States about the proposed free trade agreement? Is the government considering the option of providing a competitive domestic supply chain behind the single desk for wheat exports as a concession to the United States in these trade negotiations? What consultations have taken place with Australian grain growers about the role the single desk might play in the negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Wheat Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-12-10,"—Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Might I say I am surprised that Senator Hill does not have a brief on this very important matter. Whilst he is seeking additional information, perhaps the minister can inquire about and confirm whether the government has guaranteed single desk export marketing arrangements with AWB Ltd. If that guarantee has been given, what is the basis for using the export single desk arrangements as a bargaining chip in these negotiations?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Wheat Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-12-10,"—That question obviously calls for detail a little beyond the normal questions without notice.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-12-10,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. Can the minister confirm that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released recently shows a total $505 million cut in Commonwealth expenditure on Defence over the next three financial years since the budget in May? Given the Prime Minister's claim that Defence spending needs to be increased, why does the MYEFO show spending in the next three years being cut back since the budget? As a result of those cuts, doesn't Defence spending as a proportion of Commonwealth expenditure decline over the next three years?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-12-10,"—Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, doesn't the MYEFO document also state that a large component of the actual increase in Defence spending in the current year flows automatically from a change to the indexation? Doesn't this additional funding merely compensate for inflation and represents no real increase in Defence spending?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-12-10,"—I also noticed that figure and asked the same question. The answer was basically that there were two factors involved.
—Whom did you ask?
—I asked the accounting people in my department. The answer is that it is partly as a result of changes in accounting methodology and that it partly relates to the sale of certain assets. I was told that it does not in fact have the consequence suggested by the honourable senator.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-12-10,"—No, that is not right. As the honourable senator knows, this government is committed to a three per cent increase in real terms and is meeting its commitment, as is demonstrated in the budget figures. It is true that the department is compensated on an indexation basis for increases in contracts, according to a long-established formula. But, in terms of the extent to which the increased funding has been indicated to the public in the past, it still stands.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-10,"—On 9 December, Senator Forshaw asked me a question without notice about bushfires in the Sutherland Shire and about a competition being conducted to find a name for the replacement research reactor now under construction at the Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre. I undertook to provide additional information and I seek leave to incorporate the following response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
The Minister for Science has provided the following additional information in relation to the question asked by Senator Forshaw:
The premise of the question and the supplementary question are incorrect. ANSTO works closely with emergency services agencies. On Thursday 5 December, emergency services agencies advised that, in order to facilitate traffic management on access roads in the area, non-essential personnel should leave the site early. The Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre was not under direct threat from bushfires.
Contrary to the imputation by Opposition Senators, replacement research reactor construction contractors INVAP and the John Holland-Evans Deakin joint venture donated the prizes for the competition to name the reactor of their own volition, and were not responding to any contractual requirement.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Nuclear Energy: Lucas Heights Reactor</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-10,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SPECIAL BENEFIT ACTIVITY TEST) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
This Bill will give effect to the measure agreed to as part of the 2000-2001 Budget to introduce activity testing arrangements for special benefit recipients who hold a temporary protection visa and who are of work-force age.
Reasons for urgency
The initiative contained in this Bill is to commence on 1 January 2003. It is critical that the Bill is passed in the 2002 Spring Sittings ahead of the commencement date so as to have sufficient time to finalise supporting administration.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I present the 110th report of the Committee of Privileges, relating to persons referred to in the Senate.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This is the 41st in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to be adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identifiable, in the Senate.
On 15 November 2002, the President of the Senate received submissions from Dr Geoffrey Vaughan and Dr Peter Jonson concerning a matter raised by Senator Boswell in the Senate on 12 November 2002. The President referred the submissions to the Committee of Privileges under resolution 5. Subsequently, on 20 November, he referred a further letter from Dr Geoffrey Vaughan as a submission to the committee. Finally, on 2 December 2002, the President forwarded to the committee a submission by Professor Brian Anderson.
The committee considered the submissions at its meeting on 5 December and recommends that the responses in the terms included in the report I have just tabled be incorporated in Hansard.
The committee always reminds the Senate that, in matters of this nature, it does not judge the truth or otherwise of the statements made by honourable senators or persons who seek redress. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I notice that Senator Boswell is not here today and I presume that the normal courtesies have been extended to him. I know that Senator Ray in the past has extended that courtesy to me in advising me that a report of this nature is to be tabled in the Senate. Senator Boswell is not here—oh, here he is! Senator Boswell, are you intending to speak on this matter?
—I want to have a look at it first.
—I would have thought that Senator Boswell might take this opportunity to deliver an abject apology to the Senate for his remarks to the Senate on 12 November 2002. We have a Privileges Committee report here which indicates that three prominent scientists in Australia have been highly offended by the remarks made by Senator Boswell and have categorically denied the allegations made to the Senate by him. Dr Peter Jonson has indicated that he has had no personal relations with Professor Trounson, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan or Dr Moses. Professor Brian Anderson was described as a prominent Trounson supporter and he has indicated that he has had no contact with Professor Trounson whatsoever. 
I would like to particularly refer to the remarks that Senator Boswell made concerning Dr Geoffrey Vaughan. Dr Vaughan was the subject of a vindictive attack by Senator Boswell on 12 November. Senator Boswell claimed that there has been a pattern of research funding decisions that raise serious concerns about conflicts of interest. He further called on the government—and remember that he is a parliamentary secretary in the government—to launch an investigation into a number of recent research grants. I say this because I am the shadow minister for science and research. I take a particular interest in some of the claims that are being made by Senator Boswell. I have listened to him at estimates, where he managed to cross over from the government side to the opposition side in order to make a number of claims. 
I am particularly concerned about the remarks he made about Dr Geoffrey Vaughan, who was a former Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Monash University. I am also very concerned about the remarks made about the other two individuals named. In Senator Boswell's eyes it seems that Dr Vaughan's crime is to be a scientist concerned to ensure that the fruits of Australian scientific research are realised in Australia for the benefit of Australians. His first accusation was that Dr Vaughan misused his position as Chairman of the CRC Committee to direct research funds in such a way as to obtain a commercial benefit. I notice that a similar claim was made about Dr Peter Jonson allegedly taking commercial advantage of grants, but these were grants that were actually entered into two years prior to Dr Jonson's commencement with the CRC.
A claim was made about Dr Vaughan that, as a member of the Industry Research and Development Board, he gave a $4.9 million grant to BresaGen, a company of which he was a director. It was claimed that he had been involved in some inappropriate way in misdirecting a biotechnology innovation fund grant of some $245,000 into another company that was associated with Professor Alan Trounson. In short, what Senator Boswell implied was a serious conflict of interest, impropriety and a lack of honesty on the part of Dr Vaughan. In doing so he tried to sketch a nasty little conspiracy that explained why, in his view, the majority of the Senate was being misguided in the support of the stem cell legislation.
It seems to me that what was being done here was an attempt to actually undermine, to discredit, supporters of embryonic stem cell research. Dr Vaughan has sought, through the Senate processes, to set the record straight. I welcome the claims that he has made and I call on Senator Boswell now to make that abject apology and to explain himself before the Senate for his clear failure to address the basic questions that were raised by Dr Vaughan in his response.
With regard to the allegation of misuse of the position of Chairman of the CRC Committee, Dr Vaughan has indicated, in correcting Senator Boswell, that the CRC Committee provides advice to the Minister for Science but does not make any direct grants whatsoever to any applicant. More specifically, Dr Vaughan has also clearly stated that the CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving the company that Senator Boswell claimed that Dr Vaughan was associated with. So much for that first allegation.
The second allegation with regard to the role and operation of the CRC Committee and the CRCs in general shows the ignorance of the informers that Senator Boswell appears to have. It is very revealing. What you see here is that their interest lies not in improving the research outcome or better public policy but in character assassination. As far as I am concerned, what we have got is an accusation. It reads:
Vaughan was also appointed to the industry R&D board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million ...
It is simply a ludicrous proposition. The facts are that, while BresaGen was awarded in May 2000 the grant referred to by Senator Boswell, Dr Vaughan was not appointed to the R&D board referred to by the senator until September 2000—four months later. That shows a similar pattern to the previous allegation I have referred to. What we have got is taking retrospectivity just a bit too far.
Thirdly, Senator Boswell seeks to claim that somehow Dr Vaughan exerted his influence in relation to the Biotechnology Innovation Fund grant, BIF, to IngenKO, another company associated with Alan Trounson. What we have is seemingly a failure to understand what actually occurs within the research industry in terms of the government allocation. Full declarations of interest are required by DEST, and in fact Dr Vaughan removed himself from receiving any papers—not even agenda papers—with regard to any of these matters before the IR&D Board. Responsibility for the BIF awards was delegated to the board's biological committee, a committee of which Dr Vaughan was not a member, and he consequently played no part in its deliberations in awarding any of the grants. 
The list of those slandered by undistinguished coalition senators goes on, and Dr Vaughan joins that list. We have seen Justice Kirby, and many other eminent Australians who have committed public service, be unfairly and vindictively attacked within this chamber. I do not think the magnitude of Senator Boswell's blunder can be underestimated. As a parliamentary secretary in this government, you ought to be making an abject apology here today, Senator.
—Yes, but are you going to defend Trounson? We don't hear Trounson's name here—the worst of them all. You don't want to know him.
 (Senator Chapman)—Order, Senator McGauran!
—Even the Minister for Science, the brother of Dolly McGauran over here, the ultimate clone in the McGauran family, understands it. Even your brother has understood the heinous crime that was committed against the public interest in regard to this. The Minister for Science said:
Senator Boswell did not seek my advice before making his claims in the Senate today.
If he had, I would have disabused him of any notion that Mr Vaughan has or would ever favour Alan Trounson or any other person or company for that matter.
Senator Boswell, you have embarked upon gutless and miserable slander against these scientists. This is a matter of disgrace to all professional politicians in this chamber.
—Order! Senator Carr, it is inappropriate to direct remarks at a senator. Your remarks should be directed through the chair.
—Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will direct my remarks to you. This is a gutless, worthless assault upon prominent scientists in this country. It is a disgrace to all professional politicians in this parliament. It has rightly been condemned by both the opposition and the government in this parliament. Senator Boswell, you now have the chance: get up and apologise. You have committed a shocking thing here.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Carr seems to have completely lost control and I would ask him to withdraw the reflections upon Senator Boswell.
—There is no point of order. Senator Carr was referring to comments made by Senator Boswell. I do not believe the remarks were personally directed at Senator Boswell but I would ask Senator Carr to perhaps restrain himself in his comments. I again remind him to direct his remarks through the chair rather than at individual senators.
—Thank you very much. What I have said is that this was a miserable and gutless assault upon prominent scientists in this country. It was without foundation. There is an opportunity now for the parliamentary secretary to stand in his place and apologise for what he has done. The evidence is quite clearly not there to sustain any of the claims that he has made. He ought to now fulfil his obligations to this parliament and explain to us why he made such a vicious, vindictive and incorrect assault upon these Australians. The chance is now with you, Senator Boswell, and I would ask you to fulfil your obligations through this chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-10,"—I fulfilled my obligations to this parliament and the citizens of Australia when I raised this matter, which I thought should have been raised in the Australian parliament when I considered there was what you would call a conflict of interest. I have been given this document. It was distributed 20 minutes ago, as I was told by the Clerk's assistant. I am not going to get up and debate this now. I am going to look at it, I am going to study it and I am going to come back and respond to you. But I have evidence here that I want to put on the record. I do not know where you got your information, Senator Carr. This was distributed 20 minutes ago. I am not going to fly off the handle and respond. I make no apologies about raising a most important issue in the Senate. Courage was required. I think that I displayed that courage in raising the issue. In my opinion there was a conflict of interest. 
—You were wrong.
—No, I was not wrong. I do not concede for a minute that I was wrong, but I do concede that these people have a right to put it on record. I want to go back to my office, look at the decision of the Privileges Committee and see what those three scientists have said. Then I will respond. But I am not going to get up and respond to you off the cuff, Senator Carr. It does deserve a response. You are perfectly correct. And you will get a response. But you are not going to get one off the cuff. It is a very serious matter, and I will respond either tonight or tomorrow. When I do respond, I will invite you down to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

RESPONSES BY DR GEOFFREY VAUGHAN, DR PETER JONSON AND PROFESSOR BRIAN ANDERSON AGREED TO BY DR VAUGHAN, DR JONSON, PROFESSOR ANDERSON AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988
(A) Response by Dr Geoffrey Vaughan
I have noted from Hansard, 12 November 2002, that Senator Boswell has raised “serious questions of conflict of interest” in relation to my membership, as Chair, of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Committee and as a member of the Industry Research and Development (IR&D) Board. Senator Boswell has implied impropriety in relation to my activities on these bodies. He has linked the conflict of interest to my position as a Director of BresaGen Limited and a perceived association with Professor Alan Trounson.
I should like to bring to your attention the following matters:
·	The activities of the CRC Committee are under continuous review of a probity auditor appointed by the Commonwealth. The committee considers matters of conflict of interest as a key agenda item at every meeting of the committee.
·	I have declared my directorships, all shareholdings, and all other areas of potential conflict to the Department of Education, Science and Training (and to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources in the case of the IR&D Board) and this information is held on the appropriate departmental registers.
·	The CRC Committee is a committee of advice to the Minister for Science. The committee does not make direct grants to applicants: through its terms of reference it only gives advice to the Minister who is responsible for all funding decisions.
·	The CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving BresaGen Limited.
·	Senator Boswell has stated that “Vaughan was also appointed to the Industry R&D Board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million to find a stem cell therapy cure for Parkinson's”. The facts are that BresaGen was awarded a START Grant in May 2000 and I was appointed to the Board in September 2000.
·	Whenever any matter related to BresaGen is discussed at the IR&D Board my conflict is declared by me in advance and I remove myself from the meeting. I do not receive any related agenda papers, I do not participate in any discussion, I am not involved in any way in any decision making, and I do not receive the minutes of the particular agenda item.
·	Senator Boswell has linked me to Professor Trounson because I held the position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Monash University. I resigned from Monash more than 10 years ago. Since that time I have held Australian Government and industry appointments.
·	Senator Boswell has linked my name in the debate to other people he has identified, namely Peter Jonson, Alan Trounson, and Bob Moses. I have never had any personal commercial interests or dealings with any of these people.
·	The START grant awarded to the “Trounson company” Copyrat was made under delegation by the Biological Committee of the IR&D Board. I am not a member of that committee and played no role whatsoever in any part of the process. 
·	It is implied that I was associated with the Biotechnology Innovation Fund (BIF) award to the “Trounson company” IngenKO through my membership of the IR&D Board. Again, the Board delegated, through its legislated powers, the full operation and allocation of BIF awards to the Biological Committee of the Board. I am not a member of the Biological Committee and thus played no part in the award of any grant to IngenKO, nor indeed in any other award or grant of BIF Funds.
·	I have never been involved with the funding bodies responsible for the award of the Biotechnology Centre of Excellence, Major National Research Facilities, ARC or NHMRC grants.
The implications that I have abused a conflict of interest because of my role on the CRC Committee, as a member of the IR&D Board, as a Director of BresaGen Limited, or in my previous role of Deputy-Vice Chancellor on Monash University are without foundation and an unwarranted attack on my reputation, honesty and integrity.
Yours sincerely,

(B) Response by Dr Peter Jonson
I note from Hansard, 12 November 2002, that Senator Boswell has mentioned my name in a context that implies possible impropriety in matters of decisions about Commonwealth grants.
I wish to make the general point that in my experience the Commonwealth processes in this area are very tight. Careful and explicit attention is paid to avoiding actual or potential conflicts of interest. A probity auditor is appointed by the Commonwealth to monitor the processes and report afterwards. Certainly this was the case in the two committees I have chaired for the Commonwealth.
In regard to the matters raised by Senator Boswell, I simply say there is no way in which any conflict occurred or could have occurred.
I have had no past commercial relationships with Professor Trounson, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan or Mr Bob Moses.
The CRC [Cooperative Research Centre] which I chair won its grant in April 1999; my association with it commenced in March 2002.
I ceased to be Managing Director of ANZ Funds Management in April 1999. Even during my time in that role I would as a matter of policy have had no detailed knowledge of shares held by the portfolio managers, who were judged on results, not inputs.
My personal and family share portfolios are managed by a professional fund manager on a basis that is entirely at his discretion and with no input from me. He confirms, incidentally, that he has never invested in BresaGen on my behalf.
I had earlier written to Senator Knowles [as Chair of the Committee Affairs Legislation Committee] about the appointment of Dr Dianna deVore to the Board of MNT Innovation Pty Ltd, which was made well after the award of the Commonwealth Government and made entirely on merit.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed)

(C) Response by Professor Brian Anderson, AO, FAA, FRS, FTSE
On 12 November 2002, in the Second Reading of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, Senator Ron Boswell, Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, addressed the Senate. According to the record of Hansard, Senator Boswell stated “Another prominent Trounson supporter, also on the ARC [Australian Research Council] board, is Professor Brian Anderson from the Academy of Science—and a great believer in cloning.”
I write to object in the strongest possible terms to the implied maligning of my integrity by Senator Boswell. This statement is a clear abuse of parliamentary privilege.
First, I am not a “prominent Trounson supporter” and indeed, have no recollection of ever meeting the man, before we found ourselves placed on the same stage by conference organisers at an Innovations conference early this November. He is not a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.
Second, I am not “a great believer in cloning”. Indeed, during my Presidency of the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy published A Position Statement on Human Cloning in February 1999 that stated:
“Council considers that reproductive cloning to produce human fetuses is unethical and unsafe and should be prohibited. However human cells derived from cloning techniques, from ES cell lines, or from primordial germ cells should not be precluded from use in approved research activities in cellular and developmental biology.” 
Third, I object most strenuously to the implication that my personal relationships and personal beliefs impinge on my decision-making as a member of the board of the Australian Research Council.
For the record, I also note that to the best of my knowledge no member of my family or myself has any direct or indirect association through any investment or financial instruments with commercial activities with which Professor Trounson is associated.
The offending, and offensive, sentence should be struck from the official record of the Federal Parliament.

A claim was made about Dr Vaughan that, as a member of the Industry Research and Development Board, he gave a $4.9 million grant to BresaGen, a company of which he was a director. It was claimed that he had been involved in some inappropriate way in misdirecting a biotechnology innovation fund grant of some $245,000 into another company that was associated with Professor Alan Trounson. In short, what Senator Boswell implied was a serious conflict of interest, impropriety and a lack of honesty on the part of Dr Vaughan. In doing so he tried to sketch a nasty little conspiracy that explained why, in his view, the majority of the Senate was being misguided in the support of the stem cell legislation.
It seems to me that what was being done here was an attempt to actually undermine, to discredit, supporters of embryonic stem cell research. Dr Vaughan has sought, through the Senate processes, to set the record straight. I welcome the claims that he has made and I call on Senator Boswell now to make that abject apology and to explain himself before the Senate for his clear failure to address the basic questions that were raised by Dr Vaughan in his response.
With regard to the allegation of misuse of the position of Chairman of the CRC Committee, Dr Vaughan has indicated, in correcting Senator Boswell, that the CRC Committee provides advice to the Minister for Science but does not make any direct grants whatsoever to any applicant. More specifically, Dr Vaughan has also clearly stated that the CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving the company that Senator Boswell claimed that Dr Vaughan was associated with. So much for that first allegation.
The second allegation with regard to the role and operation of the CRC Committee and the CRCs in general shows the ignorance of the informers that Senator Boswell appears to have. It is very revealing. What you see here is that their interest lies not in improving the research outcome or better public policy but in character assassination. As far as I am concerned, what we have got is an accusation. It reads:
Vaughan was also appointed to the industry R&D board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million ...
It is simply a ludicrous proposition. The facts are that, while BresaGen was awarded in May 2000 the grant referred to by Senator Boswell, Dr Vaughan was not appointed to the R&D board referred to by the senator until September 2000—four months later. That shows a similar pattern to the previous allegation I have referred to. What we have got is taking retrospectivity just a bit too far.
Thirdly, Senator Boswell seeks to claim that somehow Dr Vaughan exerted his influence in relation to the Biotechnology Innovation Fund grant, BIF, to IngenKO, another company associated with Alan Trounson. What we have is seemingly a failure to understand what actually occurs within the research industry in terms of the government allocation. Full declarations of interest are required by DEST, and in fact Dr Vaughan removed himself from receiving any papers—not even agenda papers—with regard to any of these matters before the IR&D Board. Responsibility for the BIF awards was delegated to the board's biological committee, a committee of which Dr Vaughan was not a member, and he consequently played no part in its deliberations in awarding any of the grants. 
The list of those slandered by undistinguished coalition senators goes on, and Dr Vaughan joins that list. We have seen Justice Kirby, and many other eminent Australians who have committed public service, be unfairly and vindictively attacked within this chamber. I do not think the magnitude of Senator Boswell's blunder can be underestimated. As a parliamentary secretary in this government, you ought to be making an abject apology here today, Senator.
—Yes, but are you going to defend Trounson? We don't hear Trounson's name here—the worst of them all. You don't want to know him.
 (Senator Chapman)—Order, Senator McGauran!
—Even the Minister for Science, the brother of Dolly McGauran over here, the ultimate clone in the McGauran family, understands it. Even your brother has understood the heinous crime that was committed against the public interest in regard to this. The Minister for Science said:
Senator Boswell did not seek my advice before making his claims in the Senate today.
If he had, I would have disabused him of any notion that Mr Vaughan has or would ever favour Alan Trounson or any other person or company for that matter.
Senator Boswell, you have embarked upon gutless and miserable slander against these scientists. This is a matter of disgrace to all professional politicians in this chamber.
—Order! Senator Carr, it is inappropriate to direct remarks at a senator. Your remarks should be directed through the chair.
—Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will direct my remarks to you. This is a gutless, worthless assault upon prominent scientists in this country. It is a disgrace to all professional politicians in this parliament. It has rightly been condemned by both the opposition and the government in this parliament. Senator Boswell, you now have the chance: get up and apologise. You have committed a shocking thing here.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Carr seems to have completely lost control and I would ask him to withdraw the reflections upon Senator Boswell.
—There is no point of order. Senator Carr was referring to comments made by Senator Boswell. I do not believe the remarks were personally directed at Senator Boswell but I would ask Senator Carr to perhaps restrain himself in his comments. I again remind him to direct his remarks through the chair rather than at individual senators.
—Thank you very much. What I have said is that this was a miserable and gutless assault upon prominent scientists in this country. It was without foundation. There is an opportunity now for the parliamentary secretary to stand in his place and apologise for what he has done. The evidence is quite clearly not there to sustain any of the claims that he has made. He ought to now fulfil his obligations to this parliament and explain to us why he made such a vicious, vindictive and incorrect assault upon these Australians. The chance is now with you, Senator Boswell, and I would ask you to fulfil your obligations through this chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-10,"—I fulfilled my obligations to this parliament and the citizens of Australia when I raised this matter, which I thought should have been raised in the Australian parliament when I considered there was what you would call a conflict of interest. I have been given this document. It was distributed 20 minutes ago, as I was told by the Clerk's assistant. I am not going to get up and debate this now. I am going to look at it, I am going to study it and I am going to come back and respond to you. But I have evidence here that I want to put on the record. I do not know where you got your information, Senator Carr. This was distributed 20 minutes ago. I am not going to fly off the handle and respond. I make no apologies about raising a most important issue in the Senate. Courage was required. I think that I displayed that courage in raising the issue. In my opinion there was a conflict of interest. 
—You were wrong.
—No, I was not wrong. I do not concede for a minute that I was wrong, but I do concede that these people have a right to put it on record. I want to go back to my office, look at the decision of the Privileges Committee and see what those three scientists have said. Then I will respond. But I am not going to get up and respond to you off the cuff, Senator Carr. It does deserve a response. You are perfectly correct. And you will get a response. But you are not going to get one off the cuff. It is a very serious matter, and I will respond either tonight or tomorrow. When I do respond, I will invite you down to the chamber.

RESPONSES BY DR GEOFFREY VAUGHAN, DR PETER JONSON AND PROFESSOR BRIAN ANDERSON AGREED TO BY DR VAUGHAN, DR JONSON, PROFESSOR ANDERSON AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988
(A) Response by Dr Geoffrey Vaughan
I have noted from Hansard, 12 November 2002, that Senator Boswell has raised “serious questions of conflict of interest” in relation to my membership, as Chair, of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Committee and as a member of the Industry Research and Development (IR&D) Board. Senator Boswell has implied impropriety in relation to my activities on these bodies. He has linked the conflict of interest to my position as a Director of BresaGen Limited and a perceived association with Professor Alan Trounson.
I should like to bring to your attention the following matters:
·	The activities of the CRC Committee are under continuous review of a probity auditor appointed by the Commonwealth. The committee considers matters of conflict of interest as a key agenda item at every meeting of the committee.
·	I have declared my directorships, all shareholdings, and all other areas of potential conflict to the Department of Education, Science and Training (and to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources in the case of the IR&D Board) and this information is held on the appropriate departmental registers.
·	The CRC Committee is a committee of advice to the Minister for Science. The committee does not make direct grants to applicants: through its terms of reference it only gives advice to the Minister who is responsible for all funding decisions.
·	The CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving BresaGen Limited.
·	Senator Boswell has stated that “Vaughan was also appointed to the Industry R&D Board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million to find a stem cell therapy cure for Parkinson's”. The facts are that BresaGen was awarded a START Grant in May 2000 and I was appointed to the Board in September 2000.
·	Whenever any matter related to BresaGen is discussed at the IR&D Board my conflict is declared by me in advance and I remove myself from the meeting. I do not receive any related agenda papers, I do not participate in any discussion, I am not involved in any way in any decision making, and I do not receive the minutes of the particular agenda item.
·	Senator Boswell has linked me to Professor Trounson because I held the position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Monash University. I resigned from Monash more than 10 years ago. Since that time I have held Australian Government and industry appointments.
·	Senator Boswell has linked my name in the debate to other people he has identified, namely Peter Jonson, Alan Trounson, and Bob Moses. I have never had any personal commercial interests or dealings with any of these people.
·	The START grant awarded to the “Trounson company” Copyrat was made under delegation by the Biological Committee of the IR&D Board. I am not a member of that committee and played no role whatsoever in any part of the process. 
·	It is implied that I was associated with the Biotechnology Innovation Fund (BIF) award to the “Trounson company” IngenKO through my membership of the IR&D Board. Again, the Board delegated, through its legislated powers, the full operation and allocation of BIF awards to the Biological Committee of the Board. I am not a member of the Biological Committee and thus played no part in the award of any grant to IngenKO, nor indeed in any other award or grant of BIF Funds.
·	I have never been involved with the funding bodies responsible for the award of the Biotechnology Centre of Excellence, Major National Research Facilities, ARC or NHMRC grants.
The implications that I have abused a conflict of interest because of my role on the CRC Committee, as a member of the IR&D Board, as a Director of BresaGen Limited, or in my previous role of Deputy-Vice Chancellor on Monash University are without foundation and an unwarranted attack on my reputation, honesty and integrity.
Yours sincerely,

(B) Response by Dr Peter Jonson
I note from Hansard, 12 November 2002, that Senator Boswell has mentioned my name in a context that implies possible impropriety in matters of decisions about Commonwealth grants.
I wish to make the general point that in my experience the Commonwealth processes in this area are very tight. Careful and explicit attention is paid to avoiding actual or potential conflicts of interest. A probity auditor is appointed by the Commonwealth to monitor the processes and report afterwards. Certainly this was the case in the two committees I have chaired for the Commonwealth.
In regard to the matters raised by Senator Boswell, I simply say there is no way in which any conflict occurred or could have occurred.
I have had no past commercial relationships with Professor Trounson, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan or Mr Bob Moses.
The CRC [Cooperative Research Centre] which I chair won its grant in April 1999; my association with it commenced in March 2002.
I ceased to be Managing Director of ANZ Funds Management in April 1999. Even during my time in that role I would as a matter of policy have had no detailed knowledge of shares held by the portfolio managers, who were judged on results, not inputs.
My personal and family share portfolios are managed by a professional fund manager on a basis that is entirely at his discretion and with no input from me. He confirms, incidentally, that he has never invested in BresaGen on my behalf.
I had earlier written to Senator Knowles [as Chair of the Committee Affairs Legislation Committee] about the appointment of Dr Dianna deVore to the Board of MNT Innovation Pty Ltd, which was made well after the award of the Commonwealth Government and made entirely on merit.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed)

(C) Response by Professor Brian Anderson, AO, FAA, FRS, FTSE
On 12 November 2002, in the Second Reading of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, Senator Ron Boswell, Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, addressed the Senate. According to the record of Hansard, Senator Boswell stated “Another prominent Trounson supporter, also on the ARC [Australian Research Council] board, is Professor Brian Anderson from the Academy of Science—and a great believer in cloning.”
I write to object in the strongest possible terms to the implied maligning of my integrity by Senator Boswell. This statement is a clear abuse of parliamentary privilege.
First, I am not a “prominent Trounson supporter” and indeed, have no recollection of ever meeting the man, before we found ourselves placed on the same stage by conference organisers at an Innovations conference early this November. He is not a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.
Second, I am not “a great believer in cloning”. Indeed, during my Presidency of the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy published A Position Statement on Human Cloning in February 1999 that stated:
“Council considers that reproductive cloning to produce human fetuses is unethical and unsafe and should be prohibited. However human cells derived from cloning techniques, from ES cell lines, or from primordial germ cells should not be precluded from use in approved research activities in cellular and developmental biology.” 
Third, I object most strenuously to the implication that my personal relationships and personal beliefs impinge on my decision-making as a member of the board of the Australian Research Council.
For the record, I also note that to the best of my knowledge no member of my family or myself has any direct or indirect association through any investment or financial instruments with commercial activities with which Professor Trounson is associated.
The offending, and offensive, sentence should be struck from the official record of the Federal Parliament.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-12-10,"— On behalf of Senator George Campbell, I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee on the education of students with disabilities, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
As chair of the subcommittee that undertook this inquiry for the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, I am pleased to be able to report that the subcommittee was unanimous in its deliberations and recommendations. Senator Tierney and Senator Allison worked tirelessly with the subcommittee to produce a report which I think should provide the basis for quite serious action by government. I suspect that this is a report that neither the government nor the opposition will find comfortable in many respects. This is—I emphasise this—a genuinely unanimous report, and I commend the courage of Senator Tierney on raising some of these matters which, as I say, I hope may produce some serious debate within government.
The inquiry into the education of students with disabilities attracted considerable interest. The committee received some 247 submissions and it heard from 122 witnesses around Australia. Interest groups included parents and students with personal accounts that often highlighted a sense of frustration, stress and disappointment with practices that have failed to help students and their families. Disability groups, professionals, parents and student groups provided a comprehensive analysis of disability education and they raised a series of concerns which this report has sought to address. There are approximately 115,000 students with disabilities funded under specific Commonwealth funding around the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program—the SAISO program—in schools. However, this figure grossly underestimates the number of students requiring extra support in the classroom because of the learning problems associated with a disability. This is because eligibility for Commonwealth funding is based on a narrow definition of disability. Approximately 18,000 students enrolled in university and some 62,000 students enrolled in TAFE courses have a disability.
The committee agreed that students with disabilities pose a considerable policy challenge for all governments in Australia. The number of students with disabilities attending schools and enrolling in post-secondary education is increasing. There have been increases in the diagnosis of disabilities such as autism and learning disabilities such as ADHD. The net result, of course, is that strong competition now exists for special needs funding across the various sectors. The issue is further complicated given the substantial number of students with learning difficulties, as opposed to learning disabilities, who are also educationally disadvantaged for reasons other than the disability but who nonetheless require funding support. While all state and territory education departments have developed inclusive policies for the education of students with disabilities, differences exist in the extent to which student needs are addressed, assessed and funded. In part, this arises because nationally consistent definitions of disabilities do not exist. The result is inequities between the states and territories in relation to funding support. It also makes national comparisons about the performance of students with disabilities almost impossible. For these reasons, the committee has recommended that the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, develop nationally consistent definitions of disabilities.
One important mechanism that will give a level of consistency to the delivery of education for students with disabilities is the finalisation of nationally agreed educational standards. The Disability Discrimination Act 1992, along with similar state and territory laws, makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds of disability. Those claiming discrimination have a right to lodge a complaint with HREOC. The development of a set of nationally agreed educational standards will clarify these rights and obligations. Quite clearly, there is a series of problems with the fact that so few people are able to take claims of discrimination forward because of this inconsistency across the various states and territories, because of the expense and because of the clear level of frustration that exists with the existing complaints resolution processes that operate within the states. The committee has also found it almost beyond belief that an agreement on educational standards has eluded MCEETYA for over six years. I want to emphasise that point. For six years the states and territories and the Commonwealth have been arguing the toss about such a basic concept. Given the importance of the educational standards to the overall legislative scheme that is designed to reduce discrimination in education and the unconscionable delaying tactics of some states, the committee believes that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to bring these standards into force unilaterally. 
The basis for disagreement over the standards is, of course, the indeterminate cost of adopting them. Putting aside whatever legal mumbo jumbo is presented here, the fundamental question is the issue of costs. The committee believes that conflicting evidence about these costs needs to be resolved. Some state and territory governments argue that the introduction of the standards would impose no additional costs on governments. Others argue that the costs would be substantial. The regulation impact statement prepared by the Commonwealth for the July 2002 MCEETYA meeting estimated the implementation cost to be $328.3 million to $334.3 million for schools and $18.1 million to $24.1 million for the VET sector. The committee agrees that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should share the costs of implementing educational standards. It also agreed that MCEETYA was the appropriate forum to determine the extent to which these costs should be shared.
The committee concludes that there is a need for a much clearer and more prominent role for the Commonwealth in educating students with disabilities. In particular, the Commonwealth should be in a position to provide a legislative and policy framework for this crucial area of public policy. It must, as a matter of urgency, formulate and promulgate disability standards for education. This is a matter for the Attorney-General. The cost of implementing these standards, which could be considerable, should be shared between the Commonwealth and the states. MCEETYA is the appropriate forum in which to determine how that cost burden should be borne. Enhancing and making more proactive the role for the Commonwealth which is envisaged by this committee in this area will especially assist and support the smaller jurisdictions, where resources and staffing issues are particularly acute and problematic. The training of specialist teachers and support staff is a matter where Commonwealth support and coordination are especially required. States such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory cannot easily devote financial resources to this area. The Commonwealth has a particular role in coordination and training.
I turn to the matter of Commonwealth funding itself and the funds that are currently made available for the education of students with disabilities. The committee has a shared concern about whether Commonwealth funds reach down to the level where assistance is required. I want to emphasise that. This is a matter that goes right across the political divide within this chamber. It is hard to follow the money trail. The committee cannot be assured that Commonwealth funds are being used as parliament intended. Reporting processes need to be strengthened and we believe that the current accountability guidelines are inadequate. A number of organisations used the inquiry to seek claims for increased funding. The committee did not see its role as being the one proposed by the supposedly neglected interest groups. The committee proposes that the non-government school organisations, for instance, be given additional specific funding for students with disabilities. The committee took the view that such funding proposals need to be considered within the broader context of the State Grants Act funding, which all members of the committee describe as at least very generous. 
With regard to other issues, the committee has considerable concerns about the training of skilled and dedicated teachers to work in schools and about the extraordinary strains being placed upon teachers to fulfil the multitude of obligations now being asked of them. In regard to post-secondary education, we are particularly concerned about the failure of the vocational education system to fulfil its obligations. Frankly, my personal view is that that is a national disgrace. I am concerned that there is a need for greater work to be done in this. This inquiry has had a profound effect on me. It has allowed me to gain some insight into the difficulties faced by children with disabilities and their families. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,22,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-12-10,"—The inquiry of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee into the question of children with disabilities produced a fairly rare thing for this committee—a unanimous report. The last unanimous report that it produced was on children at the other end of the educational spectrum—gifted children. It has had two inquiries into atypical children at both ends of the spectrum: children who are gifted and children with disabilities. 
The committee received evidence from right around Australia and we spoke to parents, teachers, administrators, academics and to concerned citizens. We developed a view that has produced a report with 19 unanimous recommendations. As I mentioned before, that is a rare thing for this committee. That has occurred because of our concern that children who fall outside the normal spectrum of learning across each state in this country are disadvantaged. There need to be major changes in the approach to pre-service education, in-service education, the diagnostic procedures and to the support for these children when they are at school. 
One of the current problems in education that is exacerbating the situation for these children is the philosophy of inclusive education. Inclusive education means that the classroom teacher is expected to teach across the full range of abilities of children from those who are particularly gifted to those with educational disabilities and, in some cases, with profound disabilities. This philosophy can work if it is resourced properly, if teachers have appropriate pre-service training and if, after having got into the classroom and teaching in that situation, they have ongoing in-service education. We found uniformly around Australia that that was not the case, that the diagnostic implements used to assess these children were greatly inadequate and often applied far too late, that when these children were included in a classroom the teachers had not had proper pre-service training and, as a matter of fact, in many cases had not had any pre-service training in this area—it is not mandatory in any state with the exception of New South Wales and Western Australia—and that after teachers had begun teaching very little was done about their in-service training needs. 
There is in Australia in relation to this issue confusion not only between state and federal levels of responsibility but also across the states on the relationship and roles of health and education departments. We received considerable evidence from parents who were not experts on medical and educational conditions but who sensed at a very early age of their child that there was something seriously amiss with their learning ability. They had sought help from the state education or health departments and on many occasions they expressed their extreme frustration that they could not find assistance. 
What is particularly sad about this is that early intervention in many of these conditions can make a great difference. In particular, if a hearing disability in a child is picked up early, that can make an enormous difference to that child's education. Some states are now beginning to introduce screening of children at birth for hearing disabilities. This will make an enormous difference to children in these situations—even in very extreme conditions of disability such as autism. There is evidence that very early intervention for children with autism will make an incredible difference to their education and life outcomes. But very little work has been done not just in Australia but anywhere in the world on carrying out this identification of autism in children at a very early age and then putting in the programs to work with them.
The problems that the committee discovered in the city areas were even more profound in rural and regional areas. Because of the sparsity of populations and the geography of the country, it is often difficult to get the health needs of children with disabilities in regional and rural areas attended to within a reasonable distance and it is also more difficult to find an appropriate school for these children. The vastness of this country creates a particular problem for children who are in rural and regional areas.  
One of the trends we found disturbing is a pattern of gradual shutdown of special education schools across this country. There is a very great need for parental choice in this area. In some situations it is better for a child to be in an integrated class situation, and that might be the wish of the parents. There are other situations where the parents may wish—and even educators see it as appropriate—that they are in a special school. But if these schools increasingly shut down, the chance of parents having a choice is diminished. Then if their child goes to a school where the teachers have not had proper pre-service training and have very little in-service training in disabilities then the educational and life outcomes for these children are greatly diminished.
One of the hopeful approaches we did see in special schools—and we advocate more of this—is what are called `lighthouse schools'. This is where the special education school becomes a lighthouse for in-service training in disability education for the surrounding schools. Courses can be run and offered by people in the special schools because these people do have specialist training that the classroom teachers do not have.
One of the very important things that we must ensure is that all the money that is allocated for disabilities education is actually spent for this purpose. One of the most disturbing things we found around all states was that, with the advent of global budgeting, it was incredibly difficult to establish whether the Commonwealth money that had been allocated to a child in a school in the area of disabilities was actually spent on that. Perhaps it was; perhaps it was not. There are no accounting mechanisms that show that this is happening. The committee is calling for the state governments to put in accountable processes so that the dollars sent to the school for disability education are spent appropriately. One parent I spoke to in Nowra said that according to the standards her child should have had $6,000 a year additional funding spent because of her disability. From the evidence there was no way that was happening. We suspect this is quite widespread. One of the most effective ways to get additional money into special education and teaching children with disabilities could be to make sure that the money that is allocated is spent appropriately on the children.
The final thing I want to touch on is the issue raised earlier about agreed national standards. Through MCEETYA the state and federal ministers have been meeting on this for six years and they have not come to an agreement. We must come to an agreed position at some time. The entire Senate committee urge MCEETYA to come to a nationally agreed educational standard and then work out between the state and federal governments, both of which have funding responsibilities in the area of disabilities, how that is going to be shared.
I commend this report to the Senate. There has been a lot of good work done. I commend the work of Senator Carr and Senator Allison, who were with me on this committee, and the secretariat. We have produced an excellent report with 19 very worthwhile recommendations. We urge MCEETYA to have a very serious look at these. Let's see if we can advance the cause of education and the possible life outcomes for the most disadvantaged people in our community—those that have an educational disadvantage.

The regulation impact statement prepared by the Commonwealth for the July 2002 MCEETYA meeting estimated the implementation cost to be $328.3 million to $334.3 million for schools and $18.1 million to $24.1 million for the VET sector. The committee agrees that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should share the costs of implementing educational standards. It also agreed that MCEETYA was the appropriate forum to determine the extent to which these costs should be shared.
The committee concludes that there is a need for a much clearer and more prominent role for the Commonwealth in educating students with disabilities. In particular, the Commonwealth should be in a position to provide a legislative and policy framework for this crucial area of public policy. It must, as a matter of urgency, formulate and promulgate disability standards for education. This is a matter for the Attorney-General. The cost of implementing these standards, which could be considerable, should be shared between the Commonwealth and the states. MCEETYA is the appropriate forum in which to determine how that cost burden should be borne. Enhancing and making more proactive the role for the Commonwealth which is envisaged by this committee in this area will especially assist and support the smaller jurisdictions, where resources and staffing issues are particularly acute and problematic. The training of specialist teachers and support staff is a matter where Commonwealth support and coordination are especially required. States such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory cannot easily devote financial resources to this area. The Commonwealth has a particular role in coordination and training.
I turn to the matter of Commonwealth funding itself and the funds that are currently made available for the education of students with disabilities. The committee has a shared concern about whether Commonwealth funds reach down to the level where assistance is required. I want to emphasise that. This is a matter that goes right across the political divide within this chamber. It is hard to follow the money trail. The committee cannot be assured that Commonwealth funds are being used as parliament intended. Reporting processes need to be strengthened and we believe that the current accountability guidelines are inadequate. A number of organisations used the inquiry to seek claims for increased funding. The committee did not see its role as being the one proposed by the supposedly neglected interest groups. The committee proposes that the non-government school organisations, for instance, be given additional specific funding for students with disabilities. The committee took the view that such funding proposals need to be considered within the broader context of the State Grants Act funding, which all members of the committee describe as at least very generous. 
With regard to other issues, the committee has considerable concerns about the training of skilled and dedicated teachers to work in schools and about the extraordinary strains being placed upon teachers to fulfil the multitude of obligations now being asked of them. In regard to post-secondary education, we are particularly concerned about the failure of the vocational education system to fulfil its obligations. Frankly, my personal view is that that is a national disgrace. I am concerned that there is a need for greater work to be done in this. This inquiry has had a profound effect on me. It has allowed me to gain some insight into the difficulties faced by children with disabilities and their families. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-12-10,"—The inquiry of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee into the question of children with disabilities produced a fairly rare thing for this committee—a unanimous report. The last unanimous report that it produced was on children at the other end of the educational spectrum—gifted children. It has had two inquiries into atypical children at both ends of the spectrum: children who are gifted and children with disabilities. 
The committee received evidence from right around Australia and we spoke to parents, teachers, administrators, academics and to concerned citizens. We developed a view that has produced a report with 19 unanimous recommendations. As I mentioned before, that is a rare thing for this committee. That has occurred because of our concern that children who fall outside the normal spectrum of learning across each state in this country are disadvantaged. There need to be major changes in the approach to pre-service education, in-service education, the diagnostic procedures and to the support for these children when they are at school. 
One of the current problems in education that is exacerbating the situation for these children is the philosophy of inclusive education. Inclusive education means that the classroom teacher is expected to teach across the full range of abilities of children from those who are particularly gifted to those with educational disabilities and, in some cases, with profound disabilities. This philosophy can work if it is resourced properly, if teachers have appropriate pre-service training and if, after having got into the classroom and teaching in that situation, they have ongoing in-service education. We found uniformly around Australia that that was not the case, that the diagnostic implements used to assess these children were greatly inadequate and often applied far too late, that when these children were included in a classroom the teachers had not had proper pre-service training and, as a matter of fact, in many cases had not had any pre-service training in this area—it is not mandatory in any state with the exception of New South Wales and Western Australia—and that after teachers had begun teaching very little was done about their in-service training needs. 
There is in Australia in relation to this issue confusion not only between state and federal levels of responsibility but also across the states on the relationship and roles of health and education departments. We received considerable evidence from parents who were not experts on medical and educational conditions but who sensed at a very early age of their child that there was something seriously amiss with their learning ability. They had sought help from the state education or health departments and on many occasions they expressed their extreme frustration that they could not find assistance. 
What is particularly sad about this is that early intervention in many of these conditions can make a great difference. In particular, if a hearing disability in a child is picked up early, that can make an enormous difference to that child's education. Some states are now beginning to introduce screening of children at birth for hearing disabilities. This will make an enormous difference to children in these situations—even in very extreme conditions of disability such as autism. There is evidence that very early intervention for children with autism will make an incredible difference to their education and life outcomes. But very little work has been done not just in Australia but anywhere in the world on carrying out this identification of autism in children at a very early age and then putting in the programs to work with them.
The problems that the committee discovered in the city areas were even more profound in rural and regional areas. Because of the sparsity of populations and the geography of the country, it is often difficult to get the health needs of children with disabilities in regional and rural areas attended to within a reasonable distance and it is also more difficult to find an appropriate school for these children. The vastness of this country creates a particular problem for children who are in rural and regional areas.  
One of the trends we found disturbing is a pattern of gradual shutdown of special education schools across this country. There is a very great need for parental choice in this area. In some situations it is better for a child to be in an integrated class situation, and that might be the wish of the parents. There are other situations where the parents may wish—and even educators see it as appropriate—that they are in a special school. But if these schools increasingly shut down, the chance of parents having a choice is diminished. Then if their child goes to a school where the teachers have not had proper pre-service training and have very little in-service training in disabilities then the educational and life outcomes for these children are greatly diminished.
One of the hopeful approaches we did see in special schools—and we advocate more of this—is what are called `lighthouse schools'. This is where the special education school becomes a lighthouse for in-service training in disability education for the surrounding schools. Courses can be run and offered by people in the special schools because these people do have specialist training that the classroom teachers do not have.
One of the very important things that we must ensure is that all the money that is allocated for disabilities education is actually spent for this purpose. One of the most disturbing things we found around all states was that, with the advent of global budgeting, it was incredibly difficult to establish whether the Commonwealth money that had been allocated to a child in a school in the area of disabilities was actually spent on that. Perhaps it was; perhaps it was not. There are no accounting mechanisms that show that this is happening. The committee is calling for the state governments to put in accountable processes so that the dollars sent to the school for disability education are spent appropriately. One parent I spoke to in Nowra said that according to the standards her child should have had $6,000 a year additional funding spent because of her disability. From the evidence there was no way that was happening. We suspect this is quite widespread. One of the most effective ways to get additional money into special education and teaching children with disabilities could be to make sure that the money that is allocated is spent appropriately on the children.
The final thing I want to touch on is the issue raised earlier about agreed national standards. Through MCEETYA the state and federal ministers have been meeting on this for six years and they have not come to an agreement. We must come to an agreed position at some time. The entire Senate committee urge MCEETYA to come to a nationally agreed educational standard and then work out between the state and federal governments, both of which have funding responsibilities in the area of disabilities, how that is going to be shared.
I commend this report to the Senate. There has been a lot of good work done. I commend the work of Senator Carr and Senator Allison, who were with me on this committee, and the secretariat. We have produced an excellent report with 19 very worthwhile recommendations. We urge MCEETYA to have a very serious look at these. Let's see if we can advance the cause of education and the possible life outcomes for the most disadvantaged people in our community—those that have an educational disadvantage.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-12-10,"—I rise to speak on the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and associated bills. I want to cover three issues particularly. The first is the insurance crisis, the second is the medical indemnity insurance market and the third is the government's response to date. Liability insurance protects the insured against the consequences of being legally liable for injury or damage to third parties. There are a number of types of liability insurance, including personal liability insurance, public liability insurance, professional indemnity insurance, medical indemnity insurance and product liability insurance. In their discussions, the state and federal governments have tended to focus on tort law reform as a response to rising insurance premiums. Other cost drivers such as September 11, the HIH collapse, the cyclical nature of the insurance industry itself, the cost of reinsurance, poor management and prudential monitoring have not been properly addressed.
As a consequence of various roundtable discussions and meetings that have been held, state governments across the country have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation that in the view of the Australian Democrats severely limits an individual's right to sue and their entitlement to damages. The assumption that there is a correlation between tort law reform and the cost of insurance was proved incorrect in a recent study conducted in the United States. In the USA, there was no difference in the cost of insurance at the end of the day for states that had little or no tort reform and states where large-scale tort reform took place. In the view of the Australian Democrats, a solution to the present and very public concern about the affordability and availability of public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance requires a holistic national approach.
While the state and federal governments have tended to focus on tort law reform, this approach creates more problems and questions than it answers. Some weeks ago, when we dealt with the first in the series of bills concerning the binding agreement, I asked a number of questions. I will ask them again. I am yet to hear from the government—more particularly, the minister—what answers tort law reform provides for those who are seriously injured as a result of another's negligence. How does tort law reform ensure that the sick and injured will be cared for in the long term and that they will be appropriately compensated? How does tort law reform encourage individuals, businesses and service providers to take greater care to prevent accidents? How does tort law reform ensure that businesses and organisations can get insurance cover when no insurer will provide a policy? How does tort law reform help prevent corporate collapse of insurance providers?
According to the Bills Digest, medical defence organisations, state government funds and commercial insurers provide medical indemnity to health professionals such as doctors. The medical defence organisations are established as not-for-profit mutual organisations for the benefit of their members, rather than for the financial benefit of shareholders. MDOs do not issue insurance contracts and are not insurers themselves per se. But in exchange for subscription income from the membership of the MDO, they do provide protection to their members.
I think it is important that the Hansard record show that there are seven major medical defence organisations in Australia. These are United Medical Protection, or UMP, one I think that we all familiar with; Medical Defence Association of Victoria; Medical Indemnity Protection Society; Medical Defence Association of South Australia; Medical Defence Association of Western Australia; Medical Protection Society of Tasmania; and Queensland Doctors Mutual Ltd. Most of the MDOs rely heavily on reinsurance to protect their financial position and to provide cover to doctors and other health practitioners. MDOs can raise additional capital under their current structural arrangements by charging increased subscriptions or making a call to members for an additional amount of money. 
Since 1999, four of the main MDOs have been required to call on their members for additional funds. These were UMP, the Medical Defence Association of Victoria, the Medical Indemnity Protection Society and the Medical Defence Association of South Australia. All of them have made calls to their members for an increase because additional funds were required to operate. Given those circumstances, it is appropriate to ask the question: if the medical defence organisations are having to make extra calls upon their membership, what assurance can there be that they are operating with the required prudential precautions? Considering the sequence of events that has led to the crisis in the health industry and the availability of insurance cover or professional indemnity cover, it is important to put this in context. The medical indemnity insurance market has been in crisis for some time and will perhaps continue to be, depending upon what other responses are given by the government.
The first point to note is that a provisional liquidator was appointed to UMP and its wholly owned subsidiary Australian Medical Insurance Limited on 3 May of this year. The collapse of UMP insurance would have left 60 per cent of doctors in Australia without professional indemnity cover. There has been a large increase in the cost to medical practitioners of subscribing to medical defence organisations. Medical defence organisations have not made sufficient provision for incurred but not reported claims. One of the features of liability insurance is its long tail. This means that there can be many years between an injury occurring and an insurer receiving notice of a claim. As one of the bills in the package notes, such claims are referred to as `incurred but not reported claims', or IBNRs. For claims that have occurred and have not been notified to the MDO, the MDO is unable to assess the amount of money it will need in reserve to meet the costs of these claims.
The following is a list of the government's responses to the medical indemnity crisis. On 31 May 2002, the government announced that it would provide assistance to UMP and AMIL to cover payment of claims finalised and claims for incidents occurring between 29 April and 30 June—subsequently extended to 31 December of this year—under an existing or renewed policy. On 23 October this year, the Prime Minister announced that the government would implement an additional set of measures to address the medical indemnity crisis, including an extension of the `claims made' guarantee by the Commonwealth to UMP members from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2003. This offer is contingent upon the New South Wales Supreme Court allowing UMP and AMIL to continue in provisional liquidation and authorising the provisional liquidator to accept the extension of the guarantee.
The Prime Minister went on to say that the government would provide funding for incurred but not reported liabilities of doctors in MDOs where the IBNRs as at 30 June 2002 were unfunded. The Prime Minister also said that the government would provide reimbursement for medical indemnity providers—both MDOs and medical indemnity insurers—on a per claim basis for 50 per cent of insurance payouts over $2 million for incidents notified on or after 1 January 2003 and provision for premium subsidies to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs who undertake Medicare billable procedures. Access to the subsidy was conditional upon practitioners attending incident management and quality assurance programs. Measures were put in place for cost recovery. For the unfunded IBNRs, there will be a levy imposed on the members. Finally, measures were announced to place providers of medical indemnity insurance on an appropriate prudential and commercial footing that will involve an expanded role for APRA.
On the last response, prudential regulation is not covered by this package of bills. The Australian Democrats are disappointed that this area is not covered. We are extremely concerned about that, because these medical defence organisations would not have got into the problems that they had if APRA had had some capacity to be able to monitor them. As we put on the record regarding the Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistance—Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Bill 2002, acceptance of this legislation is something that we are forced into, given the state of the health industry and the need to provide cover for doctors and other practitioners. The medical sector is unable to function without security of indemnity, and we do not wish to be responsible for any further uncertainty in the future. That said, MDOs cannot be allowed to continue to operate in such a way that the situation with UMP is able to happen again. 
It is important to remember that UMP/AMIL was, as I have said, the largest medical insurer in Australia, with coverage of approximately 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally and providing 90 per cent of the cover in my home state of New South Wales and in Queensland. The company got into this predicament as a result of offering unsustainably low premiums as part of its strategy to try to obtain further market share. Thus, when its returns on investments became tight and the reinsurance market began to tighten, which was quickly followed by the collapse of HIH and then September 11, UMP found itself in the unenviable position of being unable to remain solvent. It is appalling that this situation was even allowed to happen in the first place. As we know, prudential regulators like APRA do not have any power over medical defence organisations. This allowed the organisation to get into dire circumstances without coming to the direct attention of the regulator. Disappointingly, the organisation retained its market growth strategy even after knowing that it had sunk into serious trouble.
Dr Ian Lumsden McVey, Chairman of the Medical Indemnity Protection Society, put it this way while giving evidence to the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry on 10 July this year:
... a more elegant way of expressing it would be: on the data that we had, if we had priced as UMP had then we would not have been in a prudent financial position.
When asked whether he agreed that UMP had historically been operating through a process of underpricing premiums to bid for market share, he responded by saying:
I not only agree; I know it was so ...
He added:
Any premium, of whatever size, if it is not enough to cover the assumed risk, is going to lead to failure of a business. I do not think there is any difference between the prudential behaviour of the governance of an insurance industry and that of anything else ... from our experience, the rates they—
`they' being UMP—
were charging in Victoria were bound to lead them into an unfunded position, and they took a particular philosophical view that IBNRs—of which you have no doubt heard huge amounts— were not to be counted. Prudent organisations said that they are to be counted, because they are a liability ... and only one is likely to default— one out of six.
Having said that, it is disappointing that the government has once again come to the chamber with a short-term, bandaid solution when it is patently obvious that prudential control is required for MDOs. Many within the industry also believe that this must happen. If the government wants to argue that it has not had time to install this control, I would argue that there has been ample time and that even a short-term measure should be in front of us today.
In a response to this package of bills by the Australian Medical Association in a recent article in Australian Doctor, Pamela Burton, legal counsel for the federal AMA, had this to say:
The package is a significant step forward in the short term but its goals are very limited in relation to the problem of escalating claims and costs.
... We have major problems still with aspects of the package. It does not achieve the long term reforms needed to put medical indemnity on a sound footing. 
... The Government's choice to subsidise certain high-risk groups within the profession does not address the increasingly unfordable premiums of other groups.
The package of legislative reforms that we are considering is designed to ease the pressure being placed upon providers of medical indemnity. Principally, it targets incurred but not reported claims, which UMP failed to include as a liability and which ultimately got it into the position in which it now finds itself. It also targets high-cost claims, with funding support being offered to medical indemnity providers who have claims that fall within two categories: unscrupulous business activities that have led to the taxpayer having to foot the bill for yet another corporate failure, and a failure that is still without the necessary safeguards to prevent it from happening again. 
The package also puts in place the arrangements for the government to provide subsidies to certain sectors of the medical profession that are seeking medical indemnity cover, but it still excludes medical professionals such as midwives and others within the medical sector that are not covered by MDOs but which are vital to the health system. These are things that I have spoken about previously. It takes little investigation to find out just how much the insurance and indemnity crisis is affecting our community.
I would like to take a moment to put on the public record the effects this insurance crisis is having on other groups and organisations that will not benefit from this package of bills. The first of those, Dharruk Aboriginal Medical Service in Western Sydney, has seen its professional indemnity premiums rise by 150 per cent. While doctors, some midwives and dentists working at the service have individual professional indemnity cover, the service does not have insurance at an organisational level for protection against vicarious liability actions where the service could be held at least partially liable for actions of those employees. The only suitable cover that could be found would have cost them $96,000, and this included a significant rise in the organisation's excess from $2,000 to $10,000. That is an extraordinary leap from previous years.
Organisations like the Dharruk Aboriginal Medical Service and countless others across the country operate on a shoestring budget. They do not have stockpiles of excess cash or moneys to meet any of these increases in operating overheads, and the type of increase is simply not sustainable. It has, and will continue to have, an impact on these services being provided to communities. Whilst at this stage the evidence of the scale and scope of the effects on services is just beginning, members within these support services have marked it as a significant and growing problem. It is not going to go away; we are going to have to come back and revisit it. We also need to consider that these organisations are at the front line in the war against medical problems by providing medical services to those in most need in our society, yet there is no publicly funded bailout package for them.
Another organisation that I want to mention is paying $28,000 for its medical malpractice-professional indemnity insurance cover. Last year it paid only $11,000. It too has been slugged with an increase of $17,000. This is on top of its separate public liability insurance, for which it is also paying almost $12,000 in premiums for this financial year. The questions that have to be asked are: where will these already stretched organisations get the extra dollars from to be able to provide a service, and what price can we put on the health of all Australians?
Given the debate that has occurred on this particular issue and the fact that there will be more to come in the future, we ought to be making sure that the system that is there to provide health cover is affordable, has the capacity to provide services, particularly to those in remote locations and, more particularly, as I have said on many occasions, recognises the vital role that midwives play in birthing processes for children being delivered. They need support and so far that has not been forthcoming from the government. We still ought to be making that call and giving them the support that they require. I move:
	At the end of the motion, add: “but the Senate:
	(a)	notes the fact that midwives have been left out of the package as were Indigenous and community medical centres that are dealing with enormous increases to their insurance bills and high excess charges, and calls on the Government to take action regarding these; 
	(b)	notes that the Government has failed to offer assistance that has made a practical differences to those others within the medical services sector, such as midwives and Indigenous and community medical centres, who remain either without indemnity or insurance cover, or who are paying unsustainably higher premiums; and
	(c)	calls on the Government to urgently take action to remedy this situation”.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and related bills in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak today on the four medical indemnity bills before us.
The rationale behind these bills is to put into place specific instruments to tackle the problems regarding the medical indemnity insurance crisis.
Over the last year or so we have seen the insurance market experience a series of blows, witnessing the collapse of HIH Insurance and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre Towers on 11 September 2002.
These collapses and catastrophes in the insurance market have largely contributed the current difficulties we are experiencing in the medical indemnity market.
Through these events, we have come to realise that the insurance arena is a fallible one and at some point there has been a serious lack of foresight on the part of the industry.
In summary, the Medical Indemnity insurance market is made up of Medical Defence Organisations (MDO's), state government funds and commercial insurers which all afford medical indemnity cover to various health professionals, such as doctors.
The ethos of MDO's is that they are a not-for-profit mutual organisations. They were specifically set up for their members rather than for the financial benefit of shareholders.
There are several major medical defence organisations in Australia, which rely heavily on reinsurance to protect their financial position.
In recent times, further capital has had to be arranged for four of these MDO's since 1999 by `making a call' to members for an additional amount of money. One would consider this as a warning sign.
Consequently with all the complexities surrounding the medical indemnity crisis, this package of legislative reforms has been designed to ease the pressure being placed upon providers of medical indemnity. It's primary goal is that incurred, but not reported claims and high cost claims with funding support being offered to medical indemnity providers who have claims that fall within these two categories.
The package also puts into place the agreements for the Government to provide subsidies to certain sectors of the medical profession seeking medical indemnity cover such as obstetricians, neurosurgeons and GP proceduralists.
However, this legislation package fails to contain measures to scrutinise the effectiveness of the Federal Government's facilitation in reducing costs of medical indemnity. It does not contain any prudential regulatory measures to address the operations of medical indemnity providers.
Currently the bills confirm the deal previously announced by the Government and gives this arrangement legislative effect. It gives effect to those elements of the government's policy announced on 23 October 2002.
The three main measures that this legislation package firstly, addresses is the IBNR scheme which assist the MDO's with unfunded IBNRs as of 30 June 2002 to pay for those claims when they arise.
The second measure deals with the effect of the High Cost Claims Scheme, which addresses the issue of high cost claims and relates to medical incidents in this package of bills.
It endeavours to lower premiums by reducing the potential cost of large claims to insurers.
Finally, the third measure in this package of bills gives effect to subsidies. This subsidy will be provided to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GP's who undertake Medicare billable procedures.
The Medical Indemnity crisis has affected many doctors and has had a greater and detrimental effect on the availability and affordability of medical services for all Australians.
It is therefore a national issue and consequently requires a national response to be provided and led by the Government.
The harsh reality is that unless Medical Indemnity insurance is available to doctors at affordable levels, doctors will no longer be able to offer bulk-billing to their patients and will no doubt also charge a co-payment. 
This scenario in the GP context will result in people who cannot afford to pay for a visit to the doctor not being able to access primary and preventative care that they need.
This in itself will lead to a greater drain on future health care budgets.
We will also see a mass departure of doctors from the profession, either seeking a safer environment in respect to insurance, or taking on an early retirement.
Further, new doctors will choose not to enter high-risk specialties.
Those that will suffer the most from this are low-income earners and those in rural and regional areas.
The Howard Government has not adequately recognised the medical indemnity insurance problem and has not acted quickly enough to address its adverse effects, including higher medical costs and reduced availability of services for Australians and their families.
They have also failed to address the effects of higher medical indemnity insurance premiums on midwives, private hospitals, family planning clinics and aboriginal medical services. The United Nation's Human Development Index released in July of this year stated that Australia's indigenous people whose poor living and health conditions meant that Australia ranked amongst the worst in the developed world for poverty. It seems we can strut the world stage and advocate justice and democracy, but we can't provide for our own less well off who have health needs.
The government needs to provide leadership in it's role to co-ordinate reforms necessary to State and Territory laws with the aim of uniformity in tort law reforms and they also need to put in place a national scheme to ensure the long term care and rehabilitation needs of catastrophically injured Australians.
The ACCC must do all it can to ensure that whatever changes occur in medical indemnity insurance, that no unfair or unreasonable costs flow to patients by way of the cost of their health care.
The ACCC must also play a more active role in bringing together medical defence organisations and representing them in negotiations with reinsurers and support APRA with appropriate resources to fulfil its greater regulatory role in medical indemnity insurance.
It must be said that the government unfortunately been unenthusiastic about taking part in addressing medical indemnity insurance and only took preliminary steps following the last federal election. In December 2001 the Prime Minister was late to announce a National Indemnity Insurance Summit, which convened on 23rd April 2002. The summits communique did no more than announce that work would begin on a range of issues that had been identified as early as the Tito report. You will recall the Tito report came from a review chaired by Fiona Tito and was established by the previous Labor Government in 1991, for a review of professional indemnity arrangements for healthcare professionals. To add to this Labor's Medical Indemnity package was released in July 2001.
There are a number of further issues that the government should be pursuing to address the medical indemnity insurance problems.
Firstly, the improvement to the quality and safety of medical practice by improving clinical outcomes and reducing clinical risk.
Little attention has been given to reducing the number of adverse events through the encouragement of safer medical practices.
It is logical then that improvements to the quality and safety of medical care will lead to better health outcomes for patients and as a consequence there will most likely be a reduction in doctors being sued for inappropriate treatment.
It is also essential that there be the establishment of a National system of long-term care for the most catastrophically injured.
Labor has advocated that a special scheme is necessary to address high-cost cases in which catastrophic injury has resulted from medical procedures—in particular, cases involving brain and spinal injury and obstetrics.
The number of people who suffer catastrophic medical injury is small but their needs are high and their costs are great.
Complex medical malpractice cases take years to resolve through the courts and waste millions of dollars in legal fees. These cases place a disproportionate burden on the costs of medical indemnity insurance. Having a catastrophic medical injury scheme would be a significant contribution to stemming exponentially increasing premiums for medical indemnity insurance.
Medical Defence organisation also requires assistance in obtaining reinsurance. This should be a significant role for the Commonwealth by assisting MDO's to secure reasonably priced reinsurance.
Australia has a multiplicity of generally State-based organisations that provide medical indemnity insurance. With a more united front, Australian medical defence organisations would be more likely to succeed in obtaining more affordable reinsurance and helping to keep the cost of medical indemnity insurance from exponentially increasing. 
The Government should be more proactive in making changes to the way in which medical indemnity insurance is regulated.
Medical indemnity insurance is provided by a small number of state-based Medical Defence Organisations, which traditionally have offered doctors “membership” rather than “insurance”. For this reason, regulation by the Australian Prudential Authority (APRA) has until recently been poor.
The Government should also be preventing price exploitation as a result of increased premiums. There should be an increased role for the ACCC.
Patients are being asked to make large upfront payments by their specialists before surgical procedures are carried out with the explicit justification that these up front fees are necessary solely to defray the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance.
At the very least, consumers should not be required to pay amounts, which bear no relationship to the increased premium costs.
The Commonwealth should act to prevent price exploitation.
Labor will support the measures outlined in these Bills. It is undesirable for there to be any delays in their passage of these bills before the Christmas break.
This is not to say that the conduct of the Government in this matter has been commendable. The lack of foresight and common sense by the government on this matter has not only hindered but also complicated a resolution.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I rise to speak on the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and related bills. There is no doubt that the crisis in medical indemnity insurance has had a serious impact upon the provision of medical services throughout Australia. Doctors around the country either have chosen early retirement to avoid the prohibitive increase in medical indemnity insurance premiums or have increased the fees they charge patients to cover the inflated premiums. The effect of medical indemnity insurance increases has had an impact on patients and doctors around the country. Capping medical indemnity insurance premiums is essential to the future of our health system. However, there are cases where individuals have been infected with serious illnesses as a result of their medical treatment. It has been estimated that there are thousands of Australians who have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions using donated blood. There are a number of cases where individuals have been infected with hepatitis C at the very time they were being treated for another ailment.
Screening of donated blood in Australia was introduced in 1990. According to the Australian National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases, between five and 10 per cent of hepatitis C cases in Australia were as a result of a blood transfusion before the introduction of screening of blood for hepatitis C. The Red Cross estimates that, since the introduction of standard hepatitis C testing, the chance of being infected with the disease as a result of receiving a blood transfusion is approximately one in a million. The odds of being infected are extremely low, but for those who are unfortunate enough to be that one person in a million, the reality is a life which is seriously hampered by what is an insidious and infectious disease. Hepatitis C, in its more serious cases, can lead to chronic liver disease.
This issue was raised in question time yesterday by Senator Harradine. Currently there is an inquiry into why patients contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions. This inquiry was commissioned by Senator Patterson in August and is being conducted by Professor Bruce Barraclough, the Chairman of the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care. The Australian Labor Party supports the inquiry and hopes that it can bring resolution to what is an issue which has diminished the quality of life of thousands of Australians. It is expected that the inquiry will report in the new year. Blood supplies in Australia are almost always at inadequate levels, and any concerns regarding the quality of donated blood can only serve to undermine the public's faith in blood supplies in the country.
One of the most concerning elements of the `tainted blood' issue is that only some of the victims of tainted blood transfusions have been compensated for their pain and suffering. The Sunday program interviewed a number of patients who have been compensated but also spoke to a number of patients who feel betrayed by the organisation which provided them with the blood. These people should be adequately compensated for the financial and emotional effects of sustaining an illness as serious as hepatitis C. 
Recently, Canadian police filed charges against a blood supplier and a pharmaceutical company for criminal negligence causing bodily harm for their part in the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C during blood transfusions. In total, 1,200 people were infected with HIV and thousands were infected with hepatitis C. While I doubt the value of suing organisations which provide a valuable service to the community, the manner in which countries such as Canada are dealing with this issue demonstrates the gravity of the situation. As yet, very few Australians have tested their cases in the courts.
We should not forget the objective of any type of insurance when considering these bills, which is to provide people with adequate compensation for any suffering they endure. While medical indemnity insurance must be brought into line so that our health system remains accessible, we must keep in mind the people who have suffered serious consequences as a result of their medical procedures. The medical indemnity insurance crisis is one which must be dealt with as quickly as possible. The integrity of our health care system must be dealt with swiftly and effectively. The bills we are debating are long overdue.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2002-12-10,"—I want to place on record my disappointment in the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and related bills, their narrow scope and what they highlight about the vested interests in our health system. They should in fact be renamed the `doctor indemnity bills', as the only section of the medical work force that they actually deal with is doctors. I do not deny that professional indemnity insurance for doctors is a very important issue, and that is why this chamber will no doubt pass these bills today. However, what concerns me is a wide range of other health professionals who simply have not been considered by the government or, if considered, the whole thing has been determined to be too difficult and has been put in the too-hard basket.
I note that on 28 March this year the government announced that it would provide a short-term guarantee of up to $35 million to United Medical Protection and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, UMP-AMIL—the insurer of about 60 per cent of Australia's doctors. Some $35 million was very quickly offered to sort out this problem. Remember that figure; I will come back to it later.
The current package of bills being debated by the chamber gives effect to the government's policy announced on 23 October this year. The announcement included an extension of the guarantee to UMP-AMIL to the end of next year. It involves subsidising the insurance premiums of obstetricians, neurosurgeons and GPs performing procedures. It is a scheme to meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims of payments greater than $2 million. It involves funding of the incurred but not reported liabilities, the IBNRs, by those medical defence organisations. It also includes a levy, over an extended period, to recoup the cost of funding these liabilities for members of the relevant MDOs.
I am pleased to note that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will now monitor medical indemnity insurance premiums to determine for us whether or not what is being charged is justified, and that is certainly positive. But what is all of this going to cost? It seems that it will cost around $246.5 million over four years. That is what the government has allocated in the mid-year review. As I stated earlier, I do not deny the need for the government to act in this area. However, I want to know why—and the midwives and parents, young mothers-to-be in particular, want to know why—this government has leapt to the aid of doctors but has not been prepared to look at the problems faced by other health professionals.
Prior to the withdrawal of insurance for midwives last year, there were about 150 midwives, all women, practising independently in this area—that is, those practising outside of hospitals. I am aware of the fact that a number of these women have continued to practise without insurance—a very risky thing indeed. But the problem has extended into our universities. While some of these issues have been dealt with, we still have problems with midwifery students and some nursing students actually getting insurance so that they can do their clinical placements and then graduate. 
For those people who argue that midwives cannot get insurance because they pose too high a risk or that we really should not worry about insurance for midwives because Australian women prefer the medical model, I want to dispel those myths. Firstly, independent midwives cannot get insurance, despite the fact that midwife assisted pregnancy and delivery for healthy women is the preferred option for many women if that choice is available and despite the fact that there has never been a successful litigation against a registered midwife in Australia. The WHO recommends the midwife as:
... the most appropriate and cost-effective type of health care provider to be assigned to the care of normal pregnancy and normal birth.
The OECD countries with the lowest peri-natal mortality rates have maternity care systems in which midwives provide primary care for up to 80 per cent of pregnant women. The truth is that maternity services primarily delivered by midwives are safer, the rates of intervention are significantly lower, the rates for breastfeeding are significantly higher and Indigenous babies in particular seem to benefit, with fewer born underweight.
Now that we have dispelled the myths, let us go back to the government's approach. The health minister's comments in this area have not been consistent. She said:
Medical indemnity, like all insurance, is facing significant issues. We have the state health ministers coming together with the medical defence organisations and leaders in that industry, with the medical profession itself, to address the medium, short and long term ... I think we need to look at the whole area, the whole field. It's very important we address the issues across the board.
Most of us took that to mean the issues across the board, and working with the states to look at a true medical indemnity insurance package—not a doctor indemnity insurance package. Addressing the issues across the board would involve a closer look at why we have this medical indemnity crisis. If the government had begun to look at why, I think it could have sorted out some of those problems, particularly in the high-risk area of obstetrics. Why are the premiums for obstetricians spiralling? I understand that some of them pay up to $60,000 a year. Why are more women suing their obstetricians? What is the problem out there?
There are a range of other issues, besides ones relating specifically back to maternity services, such as the availability of other supports if the baby is facing long-term needs. We all know the disability payment for children is very small and quite difficult to access. Let us concentrate for a moment on the actual medical issues. Recent media reports suggest that up to 70 per cent of specialists will have left this area by 2012. I do not know whether this is simply scaremongering, but it is a constant reporting back of the number of specialists who feel like just walking away from the profession. I make it clear that I am certainly not attacking those professionals who are doing a tremendous job delivering babies, particularly those facing very difficult circumstances in rural and remote areas. They definitely deserve all our support. However, I think we need to look at the way we deliver maternity services as a whole in this country, because it is a huge part of the problem. It has to be addressed if we are to make any long-term changes.
For a range of reasons, Australia is locked into a highly specialised medical model for delivering normal babies. According to recent research by the University of Newcastle, the use of surgical procedures and drugs in childbirth is now so common that many women are doubting their ability to give birth naturally. Again, I am not criticising the doctors. It is becoming an expectation. Women are actually asking to have a caesarean. If their friend had a baby delivered by caesarean they think that is the way, so they ask their obstetrician. It is very difficult, in this litigious environment, for the obstetrician to say no. 
If we look at the cost of this model, we see that it is wasting millions of dollars by treating healthy women, with normal pregnancy, as specialist cases. According to the author of some research from the University of Newcastle, Professor Kathleen Fahy:
Women under the care of obstetricians will have twice as many caesareans as those being cared for by midwives. There is an absolute correlation that the more medical intervention there is, the more complications you will have ... With less medical intervention, you'll make less mistakes.
We have an alarmingly high rate of obstetric intervention in Australia, and from the statistics it now seems that something like 80 per cent of births have some sort of medical intervention. That is a staggering figure given that the WHO suggest it should be somewhere around 15 to 20 per cent. In addition, our very high rate of caesarean births is some 15 per cent higher than the WHO target. Going with this high rate of intervention, the most recent maternal mortality report shows increased numbers of maternal deaths. Australia's high rate of intervention in childbirth is unsustainable. Each intervention increases the cost of maternity services as well as the risk of litigation.
I take this opportunity to suggest an alternative—it is only part of the solution to the professional indemnity crisis but it is something this government should consider working through with the states, because it would save an enormous amount in public health expenditure—and it is community based midwifery. We are not talking about a situation in which, when a women turns up at the hospital, the first person she sees as she is about to give birth is the midwife—until the doctor arrives. We are talking about community based midwifery, where she is supported throughout her pregnancy by the midwife. The midwife ensures that the home is ready for baby. The midwife will be there at birth, whether the woman chooses to give birth in hospital—which is what happens with the midwifery program in the northern suburbs of Adelaide—or the family chooses for the birth to happen at home. The midwife will then follow the woman through for the first few weeks of baby's life.
In New Zealand, this program of choice sees some 70 per cent of women choosing the community midwife as their primary care giver. Firstly, it delivers substantial costs. We have the potential in Australia to save an enormous amount of money for the state and federal health budgets. Secondly, it overcomes the problem of the withdrawal of obstetric specialists, by providing community midwifery services to complement them in their role in the health system. If it is right that in 10 years we will have only about 30 per cent of the current work force of obstetricians left, those who can take their place are the community midwives. The obstetricians will be there for those women who do need some surgical intervention and some specialist medical support.
Thirdly, it would improve the risk profile of Australia's maternity services by lowering intervention rates and reducing the likelihood of litigation. The experience in New Zealand has shown that the insurance problem can be largely resolved by providing women with the choice of a known midwife, by ensuring ongoing information and support throughout a pregnancy and by establishing appropriate counselling and mediation systems, where a woman's grief over a difficult birth where a healthy baby is not the end result is treated with respect. The woman is well supported to understand what happened and why rather than being treated defensively as a potential litigation risk.
Fourthly, it would bring Australia into line with international best practice. Fifthly, it would better meet the needs of Australian women. It would give them and their families a choice in terms of greater continuity and one-to-one care. Finally and sixthly, it would address the dramatic decline in regional maternity services in recent years as community midwifery services can be readily and cost-effectively established in urban and rural and regional settings.
To return to the amount of money I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, which was $35 million from the government, all the Australian College of Midwives wanted when they approached the federal government earlier this year was $1 million. At that stage that would have ensured the provision of insurance to community midwives then struggling to get insurance. And they were not struggling because of any risk. They were struggling to get insurance because insurance companies decided that they could not be bothered—there were not enough of them and they would simply write that whole area off their books to save any hassles and, indeed, any paperwork. 
My final comment about this issue and this legislation is that the decision by the federal government to provide professional indemnity insurance for only a portion of the medical profession—only for doctors—appears to contravene the spirit of the national competition policy. It also directly conflicts with the many recommendations of some 30 state, territory and Commonwealth inquiries into maternity services since 1985. They have stated the need for midwifery-led community based care to enhance the care now provided by obstetricians. I believe that the time is now well and truly overdue for this government to take some leadership on this issue, to work cooperatively with the states and to tackle the professional indemnity problems for all health professionals and not just the chosen few. I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment—it has been circulated—which specifically deals with the lack of interest this government has in supporting midwives.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-12-10,"—Like the previous two speakers, I rise to express some concern about the narrowness of the government's response to the medical indemnity crisis confronting this country. In my view, these bills underpin the government's response to the medical indemnity crisis. They illustrate the bandaid approach that it adopts on most difficult issues. This reflects a very conservative approach to governing Australia. I think it was Woodrow Wilson who once said, `A conservative is a man who sits and thinks, but mostly sits.' This solution is the best that the government can come up with for a problem that has been confronting our country for quite some time. In a shallow view of the problem, the government addresses only the immediate difficulties confronted by UMP, AMIL and their members. The government does not examine whether the entire system of professional indemnity coverage is broken and in need of major reform. Rather, it uses this opportunity to apply a bandage and hopes that the system will limp along. The government does not seem to concern itself with the problems inherent in the system; it just concerns itself with papering over the cracks.
In my view, there are two issues working within this crisis. The first relates to the need to provide medical indemnity coverage for UMP, AMIL and their members and for other organisations. The second relates to other professionals, particularly other health professionals, who are denied any form of cover at all. In the case of the members of UMP the bottom line is that this problem stems in part from one simple premise: it is not just the underfunding or the lack of fully funded policy but that, as with most medical defence organisations, their members pay the same fees for coverage regardless of their claim history. It is common practice in other forms of insurance that your claim history determines your level of risk and therefore your premium. It is incumbent on individuals and organisations, therefore, to reduce their risk—to engage in risk management as the main method of reducing premiums.
Most medical defence organisations take a different approach. Whether you have no claims, one claim or 100 claims, you get to pay basically the same premium. There is no benefit, therefore, in being a good doctor— one who has no claims made against them and one who has engaged in transparent and accountable risk management practices. You get to pay the same as the doctor down the road who has had claim after claim lodged against them. As I have mentioned before, the apologists for the current system and for the proposal to paper over the cracks will tell you that that is because this is not really an insurance scheme. We are told instead that it is a medical defence fund. It seems to me that professional indemnity coverage needs to be like any other kind of insurance fund and there needs to be a fully accountable and transparent process. When we are told that it is a medical defence fund, as I have said, we are told that if people have claims of negligence made against them then the fund steps in and either contests the action or settles the claim. Strictly speaking, that is correct. However, the general principles that hold true for other types of insurance should hold true in this case—including that if you take steps to minimise the causes of litigation then litigation is reduced. 
Insurance companies expend enormous effort in ensuring that risk is minimised to limit costs. A medical defence fund should operate on the same basis. As John Castles, the President of Professions Australia, has said recently, `Good risk management averts litigation.' So here the government has a chance to address a major failing of the system. Why did the government not insist that UMP and other like organisations look to risk management as a means of operation? Instead, from day one the government focused on using a bandaid to address this crisis. The government initially sat on its hands and then extended support to the fund to allow it to continue operating only when it looked like it was going to fall over. The government claims that the problem was that the cost of membership of UMP and other funds had reached the point where the indemnity cover was becoming unaffordable. The perceived result was that doctors would withdraw from practice or restrict their activities to low-risk procedures.
But the fact remains that this government has singularly failed to take full advantage of this opportunity to fix the entire system. A scheme should have been created that rewarded those doctors who engaged in risk management. Indeed, a scheme should have been created that covered all health professionals, not just doctors. A scheme should have been created that rewarded those doctors who did not make any claims. Instead, we get another bandaid approach, the Australian taxpayers get to foot the bill and still we have no firm commitment as to what it is going to cost in the long run.
This approach is similar to that which has been adopted with insurance generally—that is, the major reform to the system will restrict the rights of individuals to seek redress for injury as a result of negligence. But did the government fully examine all of the other options? We are told that they did, but the bottom line is that the government decided that real reform of this system was way beyond them. What we get instead is window-dressing. We get a cobbled together solution that does not address the underlying problems and solves only the immediate need of ensuring that all doctors—and, as Senator Lees has pointed out, only doctors—who are members of medical defence organisations have medical indemnity cover.
The second failure of this government is in not addressing the needs of health and other professionals. There is a crisis; there is no doubt that there is a crisis. But this crisis extends much more broadly than just to doctors. All this government has addressed so far in this debate is the specific issue confronting doctors. As Senator Ridgeway has raised in this place a number of times and as Senator Lees has spoken of more recently, the crisis of cover extends to other professionals, especially to independent midwives. I have had several meetings with independent midwives in Western Australia in relation to this problem. Without the foresight of Western Australia's own Minister for Health, Bob Kucera, and his willingness to find a solution, there would now be no independent midwives practising in my home state.
The government's short-term expedient solution only works for doctors. One has to wonder whether it is because they are running scared from the AMA. Solutions in this day and age should not be constructed in isolation; solutions should require an approach that addresses all elements of the problem. The government provide a single approach for a very complex issue. They will fix the immediate concerns of all doctors who are members of UMP, AMIL and so on, and the rest of the medical professions can look after themselves. Just like their approach in other portfolios, they shift the responsibility to others—in this case, the states. The states can go out and fix tort law and limit or extinguish individuals' rights to seek redress. Rather than look at the whole system, we get a stop-gap, short-term solution.
Why did the government not consider a system that addressed these problems for all health and other professionals? One has to wonder whether it is because it was all too hard. The key, as Professions Australia point out, is not to do with proportionate liability, because that approach is all about benefiting mainly the professions, not the community they serve. Rather than just accepting a stop-gap, bandaid approach to the problem, this group seem to be prepared to offer alternatives. The alternative offered by Professions Australia, which they recommended to COAG recently, is the adoption of a risk management strategy as it applies in New South Wales under the Professional Standards Act. As their recent correspondence to most of us in this place states: 
Professional standards schemes are designed to help protect consumers. They are legally binding arrangements which aim to improve the standards of members of professional and other occupational groups.
Whereas the government's response is about propping up, as a temporary expedient, a system that is not working, Professions Australia recommend changing the system entirely to allow it to operate more effectively in the future. Rather than simply restricting consumers' rights, surely the government should be keen to look at any change to the system that would reduce the number of cases litigated. Risk management and other reforms have a major impact on the number of cases and the way they are litigated. But, perhaps again, that is all too hard. Professions Australia go on to say:
Risk management has other benefits too. Having effective complaints and discipline arrangements means that shonky practitioners can be weeded out following customer complaints, be expelled from their association, and become ineligible for limitations on liability.
In other words, it is not just about reducing the rights of individuals to seek redress, it is not just about getting the states to engage in law reform, it is not just about propping up the existing system.
The government had an opportunity with this legislation to bring about very real reform. There was an opportunity to look at the success of the New South Wales Professional Standards Act and how it has reduced litigation. The government also had the opportunity to develop a transparent and accountable mechanism for regulating professional conduct. Instead, the government took the soft option. It refused to take on the members of what is perhaps Australia's most militant union, the AMA, and just bailed them out with little or no requirement for them to make any real changes.
In my view, this legislation fails on two grounds. Firstly, it does not fully attempt to enforce risk management or other strategies to limit litigation. There is no real attempt to identify the shonky practitioners or identify procedures that would minimise risk. Secondly, there is no attempt to address the legitimate concerns of other professionals, particularly midwives. This legislation is, of course, required because the government has taken so long to address this problem and has done nothing. Without this legislation there is a very real risk that Australians will be without adequate medical practitioner coverage. However, the fact that it is required should not exonerate the failings of the government's approach. Ad hoc, short-term, expedient approaches do not provide lasting solutions.
Senator RIDGEWAY (New South Wales) (5.44 p.m.)—On behalf of Senator Allison, I seek leave to incorporate her speech in the second reading debate on these medical indemnity bills.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows.
I rise to speak on the Medical Indemnity and Associated Bills 2002
The explanatory memorandum states that these Bills provide for
·	Commonwealth payments in relation to claims forming part of unfunded incurred but not reported (IBNR) liability of medical defence organisations as at 30th June 2002;
·	Commonwealth payments in relation to the part of the cost of large claims against MDOs or medical indemnity insurers in relation to incidents notified after 1 January 2003;
·	Subsidies to assist medical practitioners in meeting the cost of indemnity coverage;
·	Payments by members of MDOs to the Commonwealth to cover the cost to the Commonwealth of payments in relation to unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities; 
·	Payments to members of United Medical Protection Limited (UMP) to the Commonwealth to cover the cost to the Commonwealth of any payments under the deed of indemnity between the Commonwealth, UMP, Australasian Medical Insurance Limited (AMIL) and the provisional liquidator of UMP/AMIL.
The package of legislative reforms is designed to ease the pressure being placed on providers of medical indemnity. However there are grave concerns that the Bills do not prevent the situation providers have found themselves in, from happening again.
This situation is a direct result of the business practices of MDO's who have failed to ensure that their risks were covered. There has been a total failure of insurers who had a responsibility to the doctors and specialists who were paying them and to the general public who were relying on the doctors.
The general public already pay, they pay for Medicare and in many cases as is encouraged by this government pay for private health insurance. They have an expectation that the doctors and specialists will be there to treat them.
The crisis in Medical Indemnity insurance has shaken that expectation. People can no longer be confident that their doctors will be available. They certainly cannot be confident that midwives will be available for home births. This affects all areas of health provision, from specialists to GPs and midwives, from public to private hospitals.
There are essentially two options open to the Government: take no action, and let market forces determine a solution; or intervene to address the IBNR issue, reduce uncertainty around large claims, and ensure that doctors could have access to affordable indemnity cover.
Not taking action in relation to UMP would lead to large numbers of doctors covered by UMP becoming uninsured and consequently withdrawing from providing medical services. It would also result in many persons with successful claims against doctors arising from past incidents arising in the course of medical practice being unable to recover damages except from the doctor's own assets.
One of the features of liability insurance and the main cause of the current crisis, is the many years between when an injury occurs and the time an insurer receives notice of the claim.
These claims have occurred but cannot be notified to the Medical Defence Organisations. The MDO is unable to access the amount of money they will need in reserve to meet the costs of these claims.
Medical Defence Organisations chose not to calculate the costs of these IBNR's when they were charging for insurance. This failure has led to the collapse of the industry and the need for the government to help these MDO's to pay for claims, which they had not adequately provided for in the past.
The Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 puts in place a scheme to fund the incurred but not reported liabilities of medical defence organisations where they do not have adequate reserves to cover these liabilities.
It is estimated that one MDO alone; UMP which has insured over 60% of the medical workforce, has unfunded IBNR's of $460 million. Meeting the cost of unfunded IBNR's as they emerge will remove the liability in relation to these costs from the balance sheets of MDO's that have not fully provided for these liabilities and ensure that these claims will be met as they emerge.
The Government has said it will fund IBNR's of doctors that were in MDO's at 30 June 2000 where the IBNR's are unfunded. For unfunded IBNR's there will be a levy imposed on the members. A contribution, spread over a number of years, from members of medical defence organisations with unfunded IBNR's to cover the cost of Commonwealth assistance in meeting those liabilities.
Beginning in 2003-2004 financial year, the levy payment by doctors to meet the cost of IBNR payments will run over five years. Doctors who have to pay the levy, which will be limited to 50% of their 2000-2001 premium, can either pay a lump sum, pay by instalments or they can defer payments for a year.
There is no doubt that this will place our GPs under additional financial pressure, in fact the government has recognised this, that is why they are attempting to ease the pain by spreading the contribution out over a number of years.
There has already been a large increase in the cost to medical practitioners of subscribing to MDO's. In some cases doctors have been paying over a third of their income for indemnity cover, and deciding to leave the profession altogether or cease certain high-risk procedures such as obstetrics.
The second systemic issue is that the uncertainty around large claims had led to commercial insurers either deciding not to enter the market or else deciding to leave the market, thus reducing competition. 
Increased financial pressure is the last thing doctor's need. We are already seeing a crisis in bulk billing due to the costs facing doctors.
We have seen the second consecutive largest annual decline in GP bulk billing.
Australian families are paying more for a trip to the GP than ever before. Health Insurance Commission figures for the September quarter saw the average cost to see a doctor who does not bulk bill is now $12.57. Up 51 since the Howard Government came to office.
The government has made much of the argument that bulk billing is still practiced by an average of 70% of doctors. An average figure means little to those who live in rural and regional areas, little to those who live in suburbs where they have to travel to find the doctors that do bulk bill.
In rural areas the odds of seeing a bulk-billing doctor are stacked against you. There are few GP's available and those that are cannot afford to practice bulk billing.
These people don't have the luxury of making the choice many people are being forced to make; that is of travelling out of their way to visit a doctor who bulk bills. The reality is that if your area doesn't have a bulk-billing doctor you have three choices; pay the money, go to the public hospital or don't see a doctor.
Medicare was not designed to give access to a health system through the public hospital system. There is simply no way a hospital can run a medical service similar to the local doctor surgery and it should not have to, but increasingly that is what it has been forced to do.
So we have a rolling effect, the problems with medical indemnity have added to the pressure on GPs who are already under enough pressure and have already begun to cut back on bulk billing, those who can't afford to see a doctor go to the public hospital and add to the problems the public hospital is experiencing by clogging up the emergency section with ailments that should be seen to by a GP.
Whilst the debate on these bills has focussed quite rightly on catastrophic injury claims and access to specialists, I would like to draw you a simple example of the effect of the loss of bulk billing to your average family in any part of Australia.
A trip to the doctor can cost between $32-$4l. Many will send the claim straight off to Medicare for you, but many don't so that means paying upfront. Now $32 may not mean much to those of us here, but it can be quite a bit out of one's budget. Anyone who has had children will know that they often need to go back to the doctor within the same week, bringing the cost to $64. Most families will tell you that when one child is ill the others tend to follow so a family of three or more can face costs that go over $96 for doctors' visits. Add prescription medicine to that cost and you have quite a hole in your weekly expenditure.
I would like to remind the Senate that one of the first actions of this government was to close Medicare offices around Australia. This has made it almost impossible to recoup money quickly enough to assist the weekly budgeting of the average family. This has affected those with small children; it has affected the elderly, those who work and those without transport. They now have to add the stress of travel to Medicare offices to the stress of coping with an illness.
Many parents faced with this stress won't take the kids back for the second check up, they may not collect the second lot of antibiotics and they risk their children developing illnesses such as ear infections which can lead to long term levels of deafness. It can lead a parent who has two sick children already to hold off taking the third to the doctor when they need to. Or lead to three children waiting for hours at night in the public hospital emergency room to see a doctor.
Medicare was put in place to protect these people. Too often we hear of the necessary but dramatic examples of people needing doctors when we talk of Medicare but we need to stay aware of the day-to-day burdens on GP's and families. Your GP is your first line of defence in protecting you and your children. A childhood illness or illness affecting the elderly can develop into a medical emergency all to easily. A GP should be able to present an accessible determination and treatment before that stage.
Medicare was designed to be a universal system to provide access to health regardless of your ability to pay. It was built on the premise that people in a country like Australia, should not have to risk their health or their family's health because they cannot afford a doctor.
We need to be protecting this premise, and as a government working to restore the public's faith in a system designed to assist them. Our nation cannot afford to be in the situation it finds itself today.
In closing I would like to note that although the Government has undertaken to keep the medical indemnity sector under review and ask the ACCC to monitor the costs of medical indemnity cover. This package does not contain measures to monitor the effectiveness of the Governments assistance in reducing costs of medical indemnity or any prudential measures to address the operations of medical indemnity providers. 
Senator Ridgeway has carriage of this legislation for the Democrats but I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage on the subject of tobacco smoking. It may be the case that the definition of recreational services under the Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002 does not include smoking but we would like to be absolutely sure that this is the case.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-10,"—I rise to speak on the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and related legislation before the Senate. This legislation was brought on by the collapse of United Medical Protection and its subsidiary, Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, on 3 May this year. Most of my concerns relate to a bill yet to reach the Senate, but these matters are all closely related. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, will be consulting further with Tasmanian practitioners and the Tasmanian government to work through some of these concerns.
In my own state of Tasmania, the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, which covers 80 per cent of practising doctors, has not had any financial problems and has been offering coverage to doctors for over 100 years. Under the changes proposed by the government, the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania and other discretionary medical defence organisations will have to move to a new insurance model. While I support making the regulatory system stronger to protect doctors and their patients from the risk of a medical defence organisation collapsing, I am concerned that this might mean fewer benefits to members for an increased cost, especially when the Tasmanian organisation has been run without apparent difficulty under the current legislation.
I am concerned that the legislation encourages medical defence organisations to offer the more limited `claims made' cover rather than the `claims incurred' cover offered by the Tasmanian MDO. Under a `claims made' cover, a doctor must be a member of the medical defence organisation not only at the time an incident occurs but also at the time it is reported to the defence fund. `Claims incurred' cover would allow doctors to be covered whenever the claim is incurred as long as they were members when the incident occurred. This is obviously a more flexible option. The `one-size-fits-all' insurance model will benefit those medical defence organisations which have found themselves in financial trouble but will lead to increased costs for the many successful groups offering coverage to doctors.
Once again, I support minimising risks through a good regulatory regime, but I am concerned that the poor management of some MDOs is impacting negatively on the cost of coverage for Tasmanian doctors. I understand that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has agreed that the new insurance model means that doctors may have court decisions awarding damages against them that are higher than their policy cover. That is obviously something that concerns medical practitioners and is something that will need further discussion with the Minister for Health and Ageing.
The new legislation is expected to lead to a rise in premiums for many doctors who had cover with funds who were not in financial trouble—who had made provisions for liabilities arising from incurred but not reported claims and who would be able to cover claims against their members. The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania estimates that its expenses in moving to the new model will be approximately $1 million in set-up costs, extra administrative fees of $500,000 per annum and an extra $5 million in capital. This is likely to cost each member of the Tasmanian group around $1,500 per annum for four to five years—and this is of concern to patients down the track. In the end, those patients will bear some of the impact from these increased costs. It is, of course, good that there will be protection against the possibility that an MDO may collapse, but the average Tasmanian will be paying for this as costs are passed on to them. The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania is not unregulated; it is subject to Commonwealth and state corporations legislation. Perhaps a system of prudential regulation can be negotiated which can build on this regulation while having a smaller impact on costs, or the impact of the transition to the new regime can be minimised. 
I will not repeat what I have said before about midwives but, as I have also said before, I am very disappointed that midwives are not included in this medical indemnity package, and I urge the government to do so for all the reasons that have been given. I fully support the need for the government to address the problem of medical indemnity but I want to highlight the impact of these changes and the concerns of my constituents. I urge the government and, in particular, Senator Coonan to talk to the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, the state branch of the AMA, and other interested bodies so that their concerns can be taken into account in establishing this new legislative regime. I have received correspondence from Senator Coonan to say that that is her intention, and I look forward to hearing further on how the consultations are proceeding.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-10,"—I want to take a bit of time to respond to some of the issues that have been raised, because I presume that we are not going to have a long committee stage. I think it is appropriate that, in summing up, I therefore respond to some of the comments that have been made.
The Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and related bills deal with many of the issues facing medical indemnity insurance. It is probably the most difficult thing that has not been totally health related which has faced Health. It has crossed portfolios—not just Health but Treasury, Attorney-General's, and Prime Minister and Cabinet—with the Prime Minister seeing it as such an important issue that he appointed Mr Max Moore-Wilton to chair the interdepartmental committee to address this issue.
Not only was it an issue for the Commonwealth; it was also an issue for the states in addressing tort law reform, and I have to give credit to Senator Coonan for the role she has played in driving the issue of tort law reform in the states. We had a meeting here in Canberra on, I think, 23 April with about 80 people, including all the health ministers from every state and territory, all the medical defence organisations, the chairmen and presidents of all the colleges and the plaintiff lawyers. Anybody who was anybody and who had anything interesting to say about medical indemnity was gathered in that room just after Easter to try to address the issue.
Some of the comments that have been made here are very far from the truth in the sense that the government has not consulted and has acted in haste. We have done a huge amount of work. It is not normal in the chamber to pay tribute to senior public servants, but some people in both Treasury and Health have worked inordinate hours since Easter. Some of them—this issue rose just before Easter; I think the Prime Minister had a meeting with some senior medical people on Easter Thursday—worked all over Easter and have worked weekends and day in, day out since them. For anybody to come in here and say that it is a knee-jerk reaction or it is a quick and dirty fix does not understand the process that has gone on behind the scenes.
Sometimes we were hindered. For example, with the guarantee, we had to wait until the Supreme Court in New South Wales could accept the guarantee because the court had to be sure that the various creditors of UMP-AMIL were being treated equally, not just the doctors. Some doctors thought there was something untoward about our guarantee when it was a need to make sure that all creditors were dealt with. It has been a very long process. I want to put on the public record my appreciation to my colleague Senator Coonan for her cooperation, to Mr Max Moore-Wilton, who chaired the committee, to all those officers who worked on the RDC and to all the officers who supported it. It has been an inordinately difficult task to address. I remind people that the issue was of no making of any government but arose for a whole number of complex reasons.
The package of legislation deals with many of the issues facing medical indemnity insurance. It removes the burden of unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities from the industry. This means that medical defence organisations that have properly provisioned for these liabilities can make a fresh start and have their slates wiped clean. If the government had not acted in this way, in all likelihood UMP would have been placed in full liquidation by now, with an excess of liabilities over assets of $460 million. Inordinate calls would have been made on those doctors who are members. It would have left the Australian community facing enormous difficulties in getting medical services. Some 60 per cent of doctors across Australia would have been uninsured for incidents arising from their practice over many years. We would have faced the imminent prospect of these doctors withdrawing from service until they could find appropriate cover. The remaining six medical defence organisations could well have faced considerable pressures in dealing with an influx of doctors trying to buy alternative cover. 
The legislation allows UMP and any other medical defence organisation with unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities to move forward into the future in a much better financial position and ensures that they are better placed to continue to offer medical indemnity cover to their members. Some doctors have expressed concern at the prospect of having to pay for the incurred but not reported liabilities over a period of years through the contribution legislation. Frankly, without the government's action, UMP doctors would have been facing a loss of cover and considerable uncertainty. They would not have had any idea what their premiums would have been to cover those incurred but not reported liabilities. Now they are able to predict, based on what their premium was last year. For members of other medical defence organisations with some unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities, they could well have been facing a call involving a payment of an additional year's premium.
The legislation ensures that the contribution is affordable for doctors. It will be spread over a number of years and is limited to a maximum of 50 per cent of the premium that doctors paid in 2000-01—the sort of predictability that they would not have had had we not given them this guarantee. It is also important for the Senate to note that the only reason that doctors are having to make an additional contribution now is that the premiums they were paying in the past were not sufficient to cover these incurred but not reported claims. I understand that many members of one professional group withdrew from UMP several years ago because they were worried that their premiums were too low, and they looked for insurance elsewhere. It is unfortunate that the board of UMP did not share the same insight. I recently met a doctor in Queensland who had been concerned about not having had her payments taken automatically out of her bank account for two years, and she suddenly found she was not insured. She withdrew from UMP-AMIL and moved on to another insurer. So some people have looked and have decided to go elsewhere.
The legislation provides for the Commonwealth to co-fund half of all payments by medical defence organisations over $2 million in respect of claims notified after 1 January next year. This is an important measure as it will reduce the uncertainty around high-cost claims and remove one of the factors discouraging general insurers from entering the medical indemnity market. It should exert a downward pressure on premiums, as it should allow medical defence organisations to negotiate considerable reduced reinsurance premiums as their reinsurance contracts come up for renewal. This, in turn, will lead to benefits for members, with reductions in premiums that would otherwise have been payable by them.
In addition, the legislation also allows for the government to pay premium subsidies to doctors. We have already indicated that these subsidies are intended to apply to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs. Under the subsidy scheme, selected doctors will be subsidised half of the difference between the premiums they pay and the premium of a comparative group. The government's medical indemnity package is not limited to the legislation before the Senate today. Action is also occurring in other areas. Legislation to give statutory backing to the guarantee to the provisional liquidator of UMP was passed earlier in these sittings. Legislation to bring medical indemnity insurers under an improved regulatory regime will be introduced into parliament this week.
As senators will be aware, the Commonwealth continues to work with the states in support of coordinated national tort law reform. I cannot put enough emphasis on the fact that states really need to make sure they keep that commitment they made in that recent meeting—to come together and get tort law reform as coordinated as possible between the states. Some are moving a little faster than others. All senators here need to make sure that their states are pulling their weight. Senator Coonan established the Ipp review of the law of negligence, and we continue to encourage the states to implement its findings through the ministerial meetings on public liability insurance. As I said, it is being chaired by Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. I do not think she could have done any more from when we met on 23 April when we tried to make sure that the states understood the need for consistent tort law reform. Senator Coonan has pursued this relentlessly over the past year. Moreover, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to monitor medical indemnity premiums to make sure that they are soundly based. 
A number of senators have said that the government have not been active in this area. We have been very active in resolving these medical indemnity issues as they have emerged over the past year. They are complex problems to resolve and we have worked long and hard, and as quickly and as carefully as possible, to resolve them. We did not play any part in creating the problems in the medical indemnity market, but we have responded quickly from the time that problems with UMP emerged earlier this year to ensure that doctors could continue to practise and that the Australian public had continued access to services. We offered a guarantee to UMP before it placed itself into provisional liquidation. We offered a guarantee to the provisional liquidator to allow him to continue to make payments and accept renewals once UMP had gone into provisional liquidation. We have also passed legislation to give statutory backing to that guarantee. The government have not developed this package of measures in a vacuum. We have consulted widely and at length with a range of medical, insurance and other groups so that we could develop a workable solution to the problems in the medical indemnity area. The results of that process are in the legislation before us today.
A number of senators have talked about the issues of midwives and Indigenous community services. The focus of the legislation today is on ensuring that private medical services can continue to be provided to the Australian community and that medical indemnity cover is affordable for members of medical defence organisations. It is fair to say that midwives do not purchase medical indemnity insurance from medical defence organisations. When they purchase cover it is usually from a general insurer. That said, birthing services are still available in the community. Nearly all midwives can continue to provide services to pregnant women and their babies. This is because some 97 per cent of midwives are employees, so they are covered by their employers' indemnity insurance. They work either for public or private hospitals or for an agency. But, in any event, their employers ought to indemnify them.
I am aware that some self-employed midwives have had difficulty in obtaining cover. I appreciate that these midwives face issues of availability of indemnity cover rather than of its affordability. However, I do not believe that the Commonwealth should be in the business of providing cover as some sort of insurer of last resort. Indeed, not even the Midwives Association is suggesting that as an option. I was pleased to hear that the Western Australian and ACT governments have apparently extended the coverage they offer employed midwives to self-employed midwives. I would encourage other jurisdictions to consider making similar arrangements. Importantly, the legislation before the Senate does provide that the high cost indemnity arrangements extend to all health professionals required to be registered under state law. Hopefully, this will result in some downward pressure on premiums for midwives.
The Commonwealth proposes to subsidise only obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs. It has no plans to extend premium subsidies to midwives. There are a number of reasons for that. It has been suggested that it is discriminatory to treat midwives differently from obstetricians. However, the reality is that midwives, like most other non-medical health professionals, are not covered under Medicare. Consequently, there is no reason to extend premium subsidies to them and not to other non-medical groups that are facing large increases in premiums. The High Cost Claims Scheme should provide downward pressure on premiums in the short term while tort law reform measures are put in place and begin to work. There is a need for all senators to make sure that their states are keeping up their side of the bargain in tort law reform. 
With respect to comments made by Senator Ridgeway regarding Indigenous medical services, the government recognise the important role played by Aboriginal medical services. That is why we have allocated $257 million in funding to them for the year 2003-04, which is an 89 per cent increase in funding since 1996. My information is that the insurance premiums of Aboriginal medical services still represent only a small percentage of the funding we provide. My understanding is that all of these services have managed to find insurance and continue to operate. The whole community is currently experiencing the effects of the global downturn in the insurance industry in the form of higher premiums and more limited availability. Again, this is not a situation of the government's making, but we are working hard to address the broader issues of professional indemnity and public liability insurance through the joint Commonwealth-state processes chaired by my colleague Senator Coonan. In the meantime, we agree that it is regrettable that these services are suffering from increased insurance expenses, but an 89 per cent increase in funding should assist in offsetting this. 
Senator Ridgeway also talked about the lack of prudential regulation in the package. In answer to Senator Ridgeway, this issue has been addressed by the government today. A bill has been introduced which sets out a comprehensive package of reforms for the prudential regulation of defence organisations. I believe that all of the concerns raised by the Democrats have been addressed in that bill.
The government considered the issue of a long-term care scheme in detail. I am aware of the personal impact on people with catastrophic injuries and those who care for them. However, we have concurred that to try and develop a long-term care costs scheme at this stage is not the best way of dealing with the current issues around medical indemnity insurance. The real impact of long-term care costs on medical indemnity is the uncertainty that such costs create for insurers. What needs to happen right now, amongst other things, is to ensure that adequate cover is available where incidents result in a catastrophic injury to a patient. This means addressing the fact that insurance markets at present have little appetite for taking on large and uncertain risks such as medical indemnity. This legislation addresses the insurance issue by meeting 50 per cent of the cost of payouts by medical indemnity providers above $2 million. This will significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with high-cost claims in medical indemnity insurance.
In reality, the vast majority of people needing long-term care are injured at work or in motor vehicle accidents, not in medical incidents. These people are covered by workers compensation and traffic accident schemes run by the states. Even now, states such as Victoria and Tasmania, which have effective long-term care schemes for traffic accident victims, could add to their scheme people with long-term care needs arising from medical misadventure if they wished to. The Commonwealth will continue to work with the states and territories through the Heads of Treasuries Insurance Issues Working Group in exploring options around long-term care costs. But we do not see action in this area as a short-term solution to medical indemnity issues.
I hope I have been able to at least deal with some of the issues that senators have raised. Senator Harradine raised an issue about a Tasmanian medical defence organisation. 
—I was just trying to respond because you mentioned it. UMP thought that they could cover the claims that were going to be made against them, too, and it was quite obvious when they had a very large claim that that was not the case. We will most likely have another opportunity to debate this, but I did not want to ignore your raising of the issue.

4  Cessation of operation of Act
		This Act, unless sooner repealed, ceases to be in force at the end of 3 years after Royal Assent.
What we are about to consider in the committee stage of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is the outcome of three committee reports. It is also the outcome of vigorous debate in the community, and it is the outcome of consultation between the opposition and the government. 
I note that the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, has today put out a press release outlining some technical amendments that the government will be moving to this bill. The opposition welcomes the slight movement demonstrated by the government and we will be supporting most of the amendments. But it has to be said that there are still significant differences between the government and the opposition on this bill. There is a range of issues that in our view require being addressed by this committee. These include that this must be a questioning regime not a detention regime; that those being questioned must have access to a lawyer of their choice; that children under the age of 18 should not be subjected to this questioning regime; and that there must be a sunset clause. Later in this committee stage, the opposition will be moving amendments to overcome these concerns.
In the debate on the ASIO legislation the Senate will have the opportunity to give ASIO much-needed new powers to counter the enhanced terrorist threat that we face. Most importantly, we will also have the opportunity to ensure that those who are subjected to these powers will have appropriate protections. Our obligation in this parliament is to get the balance right on this legislation. We achieved that, I believe, earlier in the year on the antiterrorism bills, and it is just as important that we work towards getting the balance right on this legislation. I do not believe that such a task, such an objective, is beyond the capacity of the Senate, and I hope that at the end of this committee stage we will have achieved that important objective.
In relation to the amendment before the chair, senators would be aware that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD put, in their unanimous advisory report, a very strong case for inserting a sunset clause into this bill. We say that such a sunset clause, such an approach, is an appropriate and simple but absolutely essential accountability mechanism. It sends a very powerful message to the public that the government will need to account for, and argue the case for, the continuation of these unprecedented laws. A controversial piece of legislation which has a sunset clause has to be publicly debated, and a government is obligated to defend the continuation of such laws. Of course, a sunset clause is very simple in design but it sends, I think, a confidence boosting message to the Australian public. Such clauses in this area are not without precedent, and it is worth this committee noting the fact that a sunset provision applies in the USA PATRIOT Act. The use of a sunset clause and the review of the act by the PJC, as is proposed by the Attorney-General, should be linked to maximise the quality of the review. The timing of the committee's review will ensure that the government could, if necessary, prepare and introduce a replacement bill when the relevant part of the act expires.
The opposition strongly supports the inclusion of a three-year sunset clause. Let us be clear what it means. It means that at the end of three years the act will terminate. If such a sunset clause is agreed to, it will be up to the government of the day to argue for the continuation of these unprecedented laws— the proposed powers in this legislation. This is an absolutely essential safeguard in this legislation. I commend this amendment to the committee. It has received strong support throughout the parliamentary committees that have examined this legislation. The good sense of this approach with such unprecedented laws commends itself to the parliament, and I urge the committee to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I have a question for the minister. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD put down a report on this bill on 29 May in the House of Representatives and some two weeks later in the Senate. Is the government going to formally respond to that report? That is normally done within three months, although this is not a classic report in the sense that it is from a reference committee or a legislation committee. I am not sure whether the government is absolutely obliged in a legal sense to respond. Even if it is not, I would be interested to know whether it is going to respond to that report, given the fact that the government itself commissioned the report, given the fact that it urged the committee to get on with its report and given the fact that the committee was able to bring forward its report to assist the government. Looking at this legislation, it is apparent that 10 of the recommendations have been picked up, two have been partially picked up and three have been rejected. We do not know the specific reasons why some have been picked up and others rejected or only partially picked up. It may assist the committee in its later deliberations if you can let us know that, Minister.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I am advised that during the debate in the other place the government put forward amendments as a result of that parliamentary joint committee report. It was explained then which recommendations were accepted, which ones were not and why. The government responded in that manner rather than by a formal response tabled in this place or the other place.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to speak to the amendment. As Senator Faulkner outlined, this is an extremely controversial piece of legislation. Even if the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party and the government proceed, we are left with legislation that allows for the detention of nonsuspects—that is, it allows for the detention of people who are not even suspected of being involved in any terrorist activity. This goes far beyond the scope of legislation put forward in the United Kingdom and in the United States in response to September 11. When in the course of the committee stage we speak about the amendments put forward by the Labor Party I am sure that we will have the opportunity to look at this further. These proposals do not change the nature of this bill to make it just about a questioning regime; they continue to allow for the detention of nonsuspects. We will have the opportunity to get on to that in the course of the debate on the proposed amendments in the committee stage.
The legislation before us fundamentally undermines the basic tenet of our legal system that nobody should be detained unless they have come before a court and have been found to be reasonably suspected or guilty of committing a crime. We now have an amendment that seeks to put a sunset clause in place. The Australian Greens will be supporting this sunset clause. In the process we have been through with this bill, a phenomenal amount of evidence has been put forward about the ways in which our current criminal justice system allows for the government's and ASIO's concerns about questioning people. In the course of putting forward this legislation, the government have not put their case as to why we need to change what we already have in our criminal justice system to deal with these sorts of concerns. We welcome the proposal to put in place a sunset clause that means the government have to try again in three years time to put their case for needing these extended powers. As such, we will be supporting this opposition amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-12-10,"—Hindsight can be a wonderful thing. The insertion of a sunset clause will present an opportunity—it will make hindsight mandatory—for a parliamentary review three years hence of this controversial legislation which has caused considerable anxiety in sections of the community. A sunset clause of this nature will mean that the next federal government, be that a coalition or a Labor government, will have to completely review this legislation with a view to leaving it off the statutes altogether or reforming it in some way. If implemented, this three-year sunset clause will take us beyond the next election. In that context, I ask Senator Faulkner as the mover of the amendment if there is any historical precedent for a three-year sunset clause as opposed to, for example, two years or five years. Was the object of this amendment in part to take the legislation beyond the next federal election so that it would be a new parliament reviewing it in three years time, or is there some precedent for the specific time period of three years? We Democrats will certainly support a sunset clause, but I ask why is it a period of three years as opposed to some other time frame? ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I hope that Senator Greig is not suggesting the opposition would have opportunistic motives relating to the electoral cycle. I know Senator Greig is a very good mathematician, and of course it is true that if a three-year sunset clause were established it would take effect in a political cycle subsequent to the current one. The substantive point that the senator makes is an accurate one, and all of us who understand that we have three-year terms for the federal parliament in this country realise that a three-year sunset clause inevitably means that it would apply in a subsequent political cycle.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—We were talking before the break about the proposal that a sunset clause be added to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. Senator Greig, I think appropriately, questioned the decision of the opposition to propose a sunset clause with a time period of three years. We agreed before the dinner break that this would be likely to come into effect in the middle of the next political cycle. We can certainly say definitively that it would be after the next election. I think it is also fair to say that a period of three years does give an adequate period of time for us to see how effectively this legislation works, and three years is of course the time period that has now been recommended by three parliamentary committees. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD have made this recommendation as have the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think it is an appropriate period for a sunset clause.
It is also fair to say that it is not common for the parliament to agree to sunset clauses in legislation. It is a most unusual circumstance, particularly in legislation like this. There are times when parliament agrees to a sunset clause for legislation on superannuation or tax, or agricultural levies and the like. But it is unusual—and I do think this is a proper point to make—for the parliament to agree to a sunset clause effectively because legislation is controversial. That is, of course, a key reason why this amendment is being proposed. It will give us an opportunity to consider how effective this regime has been after a reasonable period in which to make an assessment. It will require the parliament to agree to the regime if it is to continue after a three-year period. It will give us a capacity to review its effectiveness, and it will require the government to put forward a case for the efficacy of the legislation and both houses of the parliament to agree to such a regime continuing in force.
I say quite seriously that, even though the legislation itself is absolutely unprecedented—it does give unprecedented powers to ASIO—it is almost unprecedented for parliament to agree to such a sunset clause in legislation like this. It is not proposed lightly by the opposition—which, for example, as this committee would recall, would not contemplate a sunset clause in the antiterrorism legislation that was dealt with earlier this year. Those are some of the sorts of issues that were weighed up in determining the appropriate time period. I can say to Senate Greig that committees of the parliament did receive evidence on this and I feel that the amendment I have moved on behalf of the opposition puts forward a sunset clause of an appropriate time period for very proper reasons. This is one of the most important of the safeguards that the opposition believe are essential to have in place if this legislation is to be passed.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I lay the basis for the government's amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 which we will propose in this committee stage and, in doing that, touch on the question of a sunset clause. The government have circulated a number of amendments to this bill. These amendments cover some of the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report last week. We also propose some other amendments, which include technical amendments to the bill. The government note that there have been no fewer than three parliamentary inquiries into this bill—by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee; the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD; and, more recently, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The government's position is that we do not see that such a number of inquiries by parliamentary committees was necessary, but we have nonetheless taken on board what those committees have said. We have repeatedly said that we will entertain proposals that are constructive but not those that would render this bill inoperative or unworkable. We believe that the majority of the proposals by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee would not be appropriate, for those reasons. 
This bill is the final part of our counter-terrorism legislation package, and one which is extremely important. It is designed to give ASIO a greater ability to collect information about potential terrorist attacks so that we can better prevent them before people are hurt or killed. I think that is something that all Australian people would expect of government. On top of the significant changes made in response to the earlier joint standing committee, these amendments reflect the government's commitment to consultation and to obtaining passage of this important bill. The government has demonstrated time and time again its commitment to community safety. The government believes that the time has now come for other parties opposed to this bill to do just that. We cannot afford any further delay. We certainly need to have this bill in place, particularly in the environment in which we find ourselves with the threat to our security.
The government will not be accepting the opposition's proposed amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. The opposition proposes an alternative model for a compulsory questioning regime that fundamentally changes the nature of the investigations to be conducted under the bill. The government's bill is about intelligence gathering in the extraordinary circumstance that we see now. It is designed to enhance the capacity of authorities to combat terrorism and to prevent and deter terrorist activities. We remain of the view that the opposition's proposals would not enhance the operation of the bill, would render it unworkable and would undermine the bill's effectiveness.
We believe that the opposition's amendments would change the fundamental basis of the bill. They would hamper the ability of ASIO to exercise the necessary powers to protect the community at exactly the point at which the community is likely to need it most. The opposition's proposals would take a regime dealing with warrants of last resort that allows detention for the purposes of questioning in order to protect public safety, and replace it with a weak questioning regime that simply will not deliver the goods. Therefore, we believe that accepting the opposition's proposals would frustrate the objectives of this bill. The government are committed to giving those at the front line against terrorism the tools they need to do this very important job, and we have seen in an agency such as ASIO the professionalism and responsibility and the capacity to do just that.
We have seen provisions that have been introduced in other places around Australia. A striking example is the power given to New South Wales Police to strip-search children as young as 10 years without the need to obtain a warrant or without any judicial oversight into the process. We believe that is not appropriate. However, there are people in this parliament who criticise the government, saying that our measures go too far and that there is no balance. The government have tried to adopt a flexible approach wherever possible and have proposed amendments that pick up recommendations of the references committee. Those are contained within the government amendments that we have here today.
It is interesting to note that even in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee it was acknowledged that there are a number of safeguards built into this bill, and they listed some of them. They said there were limits on the period of detention, limits on the period a person may be held incommunicado, a requirement that questioning must be videotaped and a copy provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, a requirement that the prescribed authority explain that the person has a right to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, a requirement that questioning be conducted in front of a prescribed authority and a requirement that the Director-General of ASIO satisfy the Attorney-General that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence. As the committee stated, these were some of the more important qualifications. It was by no means an exhaustive list, as even the Senate committee recognised. 
So it is that we approach this first opposition amendment, which proposes a sunset clause. It is one that we believe would render this bill ineffective. I say that for a number of reasons. We have an environment of threat, and no-one knows when it will go away. In fact, recently a respected former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew, said that, in his opinion, this threat would be in the region for at least the next 10 years. Of course, we do not know when this environment will dissipate, if ever. Therefore, it is important that we do not have a sunset clause but instead that we have a review. That accommodates the concerns that people have with legislation that is needed, such as this. We have announced that the proposed legislation be reviewed after three years by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. In fact, the Attorney has also said that the legislation would be looked at after one year of operation.
What we have in place are safeguards. We also have the mechanism of a review. A sunset clause is not the way to do it. Once passed, this bill will continue to be the subject of extensive parliamentary and community scrutiny. I have mentioned already the reviews that the government has announced. To those who are concerned, we say that we have put in place these mechanisms, these safeguards; unlike other pieces of legislation that you see in other domestic jurisdictions— and we do not seem to see the same level of criticism of those regimes. What we have here is a balance, with the required checks and accountability. We therefore oppose the opposition's sunset clause amendment. I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 10 December 2002.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-12-10,"—The opposition have approached the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 as if we were in government. That has been our philosophy: if we were in government, what would we do to deal with the particular issues? We have not approached it from an oppositionist point of view. We have approached it by saying what we would do in government. Of course, that brings critics in from civil libertarian groups et cetera that then try to push us into a different position, and we have not been pushed into a different position.
The Minister for Justice and Customs says that there have been three parliamentary inquiries into this. In reality there have been two. The original Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee barely looked at this. The minister should know that, because at the same time there was a concurrent inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. So we have had two parliamentary inquiries in reality. The first inquiry was instituted by the government, so they cannot complain about that. We were not even consulted about it. Mr Williams went into parliament at 10 past six and announced that the bill would be referred to the joint committee. The reason I know we were not consulted—well, we were told 10 minutes before at a joint committee meeting that this might be the case—is that at the same time this matter was being referred to a legislation committee in this chamber, and we do not like such a double-up. So we were not consulted on it but, nevertheless, Mr Williams's action in referring it to the joint intelligence committee was a correct one. 
The timetable for the committee was ridiculously short. The committee itself ignored the timetable and put a resolution through both houses of parliament extending the reporting date to allow reasonable time for public submissions. You cannot cut off public submissions, having advertised for them two or three days before. That was the original intention. As it was, the committee did work very hard. It received exemplary cooperation from witnesses, including Attorney-General's and ASIO. We listened to a whole range of critics and were able to bring forward our report in plenty of time for it to be considered by the government for the June sitting. So when the minister comes in here today and says, `We cannot afford any more delay,' some of the delay has been due to government procrastination about amendments and other things. But I think on that point the minister is right—it is now time to finalise these issues before we have the summer break—and I do not think many people in this chamber would necessarily disagree with that.
The fact is that the second inquiry really came about because of the government's indication as to how they would respond to the first inquiry, in which people decided to at least have a look. I must say that I was dubious about whether there is an alternative regime to all of this. There is concern in the community and in this parliament that ASIO should not be a secret police force. The opposition has attempted to create a division of powers between the Federal Police and ASIO that balances and counterbalances the powers in such a way that you will not have evolving a special branch in the Federal Police or a secret police force under ASIO, that there is a mix-and-match. I think that approach has a lot of appeal.
One of the great points in all of this is that if you go back to the original legislation you will see why there has been a need for parliamentary intervention. A whole range of things are now conceded by the government. Things that were regarded as right, correct and proper by them in April this year suddenly are no longer right, correct and proper—in other words, we are not worried about what the states can do, our responsibility is federal. Authorities could strip search a 10-year-old girl under your original legislation. You could have it that people would be detained indefinitely, without any limits at all, if authorities were able to succeed in extending the warrants every 48 hours. You could have a situation where there was no legal representation whatsoever in any part of this process. You could have had a position, because of a technical defect in the drafting of the bill, where people could be detained but the clock would not start ticking until they were questioned. Under this legislation they could have been detained for five years before the questions started. But, again, that has been remedied by way of amendment to this bill in the House of Representatives. We could go back over a whole raft of errors, misjudgments or poor principles that were in the original bill which the government have now corrected. But what we say is that the government have not yet gone far enough.
I think the minister has repeated the worst canard in this debate by basically accusing the opposition of misunderstanding the purpose of the bill. There is misunderstanding about the purpose of the bill. We have spent a lot of time explaining to people that what this bill is about is assisting in the collection of intelligence, not evidence. We understand that. There is no need to patronise us on this, Minister. We have understood that from the start, but we acknowledge that a whole range of critics have never understood that. We have had to fight on two fronts: fight the excesses of the government on the one side and the stupidity of critics on the other side that do not understand the purpose of this legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to enhance the collection of intelligence. It is to protect people's lives by doing so. And it has to be acknowledged that in the process certain traditional rights and responsibilities that citizens have will be curtailed, especially the right to silence—not for the first time but in its most dramatic form yet in legislation presented to this parliament. But we believe that that is a necessary step. It is a hard step for us to take, but we have jumped that hurdle and we have agreed with the government to do so. 
These issues should be decided on balance—not out of panic, not out of a sense of who is the most macho on an issue. There has to be a degree of balance within the legislation. The difference at the moment between the government and the opposition is where that line of balance should be. It is no longer a massively dramatic difference; it is a matter of differences over four or five key principles to get the balance right.
It should be noted that support for the sunset clause in the joint intelligence committee was unanimous. The Labor Party, in opposition, did not insist on a sunset clause in the five antiterrorist bills that were passed in the chamber, because we believe they had the correct balance and they were there for the ages. In regard to this legislation, which is more dramatic—I do not want to say `more draconian', but it is more dramatic—one wants to see how it operates. Putting a sunset clause in does not preclude a government from reintroducing this legislation and passing it again, with or without a sunset clause, in the year 2005. The committee was quite sensitive to the issue of electoral timing. That is why we recommended a three-year sunset clause. So if this legislation has to be revalidated in the parliament, it will come up in the first year of a new government, be it Labor or coalition, which in terms of the electoral cycle makes it much easier to be able to deal with these things.
If, as the minister asserts, this legislation is going to work and work well, then there will be very little difficulty in this parliament revalidating that legislation posthaste, without the sorts of committee references and the time that this has taken. It will mean that, six months before the sunset clause, the minister will probably refer it for inquiry to the joint intelligence committee and give the committee two or three months to report back on the effectiveness of it. But there are things that we do not know. We do not know how many warrants are going to be issued under this piece of legislation. It could be as low as 10 over a three-year period, yet it could be several hundred. We need to know that in order to know whether this legislation is working appropriately. I am glad that the government has agreed to pick up the recommendation that says there will be an annual disclosure of the amount of warrants that are issued. 
But, if you really want to be convinced that this legislation needs absolute scrutiny, go back to it in its original form. How could a government have introduced such wide-sweeping legislation with no protocols whatsoever as to the questioning process? Under the original bill, we did not know where people would have been detained. Were you going to reopen Boggo Road? Were you going to reopen Pentridge? Where were you going to detain these people? Were they going to be detained in prisons? Were you going to put them up at the Hyatt? Exactly how were you going to detain them, and where? How long were you going to question them for? In the original bill, there was nothing to stop you questioning someone for 48 hours in a row. There was absolutely no provision for a questioning regime. 
I prefer for the government—and I think they are now going to accept this—to develop protocols around the questioning regime that are disallowable instruments in this chamber, then we as a parliament do not have to dictate exactly what the questioning regime is. It also gives the government flexibility if they find that their tabled questioning regime is insufficient, is not working, to re-regulate in this area without having to go through new legislation. It is all there for the government to do if they want to. They should just reflect, when they categorically knock back the proposed opposition amendments now, that if they had taken that position in regard to the original bill with all its faults we would have had a terrible piece of legislation pass this place. 
I do not know why the government are not willing to further negotiate on this. It seems to me there is a lot of good faith about. I can only presume they are acting under the instructions of the Prime Minister. He has decided to dig his toes in on this issue and no longer negotiate. It seems to me we were bubbling along reasonably well, in a cordial and productive way. All of a sudden there will be no more negotiations. You will just say that this bill is pristine pure now and there can be no amendments. You will not even consider the amendments and it will be thrown out.  
Coming back to the sunset clause, this is one of the major protections to give people certainty that this adventurous piece of legislation can in fact work. If it does not work, this parliament will not revalidate it, and nor should it. But, once the legislation is in, if it does not work you do not get a second shot at the title. It sits there forever, or until there is a change of government, or a regime change, in this country. If this legislation goes off the rails, if it does not work, there is nothing this parliament can do about it. That is the exact reason you introduce a sunset clause: because you do get a second shot at the title if it is not working. It is a little inconvenient. You would rather have certainty into the future, but you have a pretty good indication from the opposition that, if over the next three years this regime works and works well, we will certainly give it a tick. We are not going to give it an automatic tick but, if you can show that it is working well, that it is being administered properly, that the safeguards put in are all there and are tuned and are going in the right direction, you will get the legislation again. You will get it pretty quickly. I doubt you will get it in non-controversial legislation time, because our colleagues from the Greens, the Democrats—I do not know about Senator Harris and a few others—would probably not allow that. But I think it would be a much more disciplined debate the second time around, much more focused, without the need for an extensive committee inquiry. The opposition will persist with our insistence on a sunset clause. I point out again that we did not do so with the five terrorism bills, because we did not think it was appropriate. We are not doing this to be narky; we are not doing this to needle the government; we are doing it because we think on this occasion that it is good public policy.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-10,"—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support the opposition amendment for a sunset clause. I will start my remarks by looking at the title of the legislation. The bill is titled the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. As Senator Ray so eloquently put the argument, we have an organisation that is primarily in place to ensure the security of Australia, through its ability to use intelligence. What the government is doing with this legislation is taking that organisation and giving it a head of power that One Nation believes it was not intended to have when it was brought into existence. We have the Australian Federal Police, which plays an exemplary role and works concurrently with ASIO. That is how the process should continue. ASIO is there to do the intelligence surveillance, and the Australian Federal Police's role, as a result of ASIO's investigations, is to carry that further. 
It saddens me to some degree that the Labor Party did not support a sunset clause in another particular piece of legislation, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000. The crossbenchers unanimously believed that that legislation should have been exposed to exactly the same process that Senator Ray has argued for in relation to this legislation. If we look at the government's bill in total, it has the ability, I believe, to achieve what the terrorists have not. The terrorists have not been able to break the spirit of the Australian people. They have not been able to break us as a nation. And yet, sadly, this government's legislation is going to place restrictions on the rights of Australians that no terrorist could ever dream of. It brings in the ability to apprehend a person and hold them without representation. It brings in punitive clauses where, if a person does not answer questions, there is the threat of a jail term. So the government is succeeding in removing the rights of Australians in a way that the terrorists have not. Very clearly, One Nation does not support the government's legislation. One Nation supports Labor's sunset clause because in actuality it will bring this legislation to a close in three years.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 2764: 
(2)	Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (after line 14), before the definition of terrorism offence, insert:
terrorist act has the same meaning as in Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code.
This is what I would describe as a minor technical amendment. I do not entirely understand why it has not been proposed by the government. Perhaps the minister can explain that to us. It is a minor amendment. Effectively, what it does is insert into the ASIO bill the definition of a terrorist act that now appears in the Criminal Code. This particular definition was included in the Criminal Code as a result of the antiterrorism legislation passed in this chamber in June of this year. I think this amendment, albeit a minor one, is an important one and it stands on its merits. I believe that the Senate has indicated its will previously in relation to the substantive terms of the definition. I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-12-10,"—My recollection is that the Democrats opposed the definitions of `terrorism' and `terrorist act' that were, as Senator Faulkner referred to, debated in the original suite of bills. We had concerns about the potential for those definitions to impinge on benign activities and benign organisations, and we had that debate at the time. While we as a party and I personally differ from the government and the opposition in terms of those adopted definitions and still oppose them in principle, I can concede the need for consistency in this legislation and the previous suite of bills, notwithstanding the difficulties we have with the definitions adopted. So, on the basis of legislative consistency, I can support this amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—The government oppose this amendment on the basis that it is related to opposition amendment (25), which purports to omit section 34F and substitute it with a new section entitled `Conduct of questioning'. We say that this amendment forms part of a wider regime—that is, that the bill should be based on a compulsory questioning regime rather than a compulsory detention regime. The term `terrorist act' is used in section 34F. Therefore this keys into that regime which is being proposed by the opposition. So it does not necessarily stand alone; it has relevance elsewhere. That is why the government oppose the opposition amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to indicate the position of the Australian Greens on this amendment. We will be able to support this amendment that mirrors the amendment put forward by the Australian Labor Party at the time of the previous antiterrorism bills, which also referred to the term `terrorist act'. We did not support those bills as they went through and we continue not to support these bills. We recognise, as do Senator Greig and the Democrats, the need for consistency with the previous legislation. With regard to the comment made by the minister that this definition relates to another amendment to be moved by the Australian Labor Party on a questioning regime, we will have more opportunity to talk about that at the appropriate time when we get to that amendment. Whilst not wholeheartedly supporting the questioning regime put forward by the opposition— and we will get onto that later—we recognise that it is an improvement on the government's compulsory detention regime. We will be in a position to support this amendment and, this amendment being consequential to an upcoming Labor Party amendment, we will also be in a position to support that amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-10,"—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support Labor's amendment. I also want to place on record that I find it quite intriguing that the government has spent an inordinate amount of the time of this chamber over the past 12 months in bringing in legislation to make them concur with the Criminal Code and here we have the opposition actually setting out to bring the same regime into place in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and we have got the government opposing it. It is almost to the point of being quite amusing that the government could, day after day, bring legislation into this place—I will add that it had the support of the Senate—to ensure that all of that legislation, in terms of definitions and function, complied with the Criminal Code. I would be interested to find out why, in this case, the government is opposing the opposition's amendment. It seems that the opposition's amendment is actually achieving what the government has been carrying out all year.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—by leave—I move government amendments (1) and (22) on sheet DT377:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 18), after item 23, insert:
23A  After section 25
Insert:
25AA  Conduct of ordinary or frisk search under search warrant
		An ordinary search or frisk search of a person that is authorised under paragraph 25(4A)(a) must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched.
(22)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 20 (after line 25), after subsection 34L(1), insert:
	(1A)	An ordinary search of the person under this section must, if practicable, be conducted by a police officer of the same sex as the person being searched.
Government amendment (1) implements recommendation No. 21 of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee's report. The amendment clarifies that an ordinary or frisk search of a person near or at premises that are the subject of a warrant granted to ASIO must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched. Government amendment (22) clarifies that an ordinary search of a person detained under a warrant must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched.
These provisions mirror the standard search procedures contained in the Crimes Act. The government has always intended the conduct of ordinary and frisk searches under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 to be consistent with accepted standards for such searches. The inclusion of these two provisions in the bill will make it clear in the legislation that this is the case. I reiterate that this follows recommendation No. 21 of the committee, which stated:
The Committee recommends that the Bill should include a requirement that ordinary searches and frisk searches, as far as practicable, should be conducted by an officer of the same gender as the person being searched.
I reiterate that the government have always been open to constructive suggestions, and we have taken those up from the various parliamentary committee inquiries. But we stress that we cannot take on board amendments which will make this bill unworkable. In this case, the recommendation by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is a reasonable one and we reflect it in these amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to speak about these amendments. It is pleasing to see that the government has taken on board the suggestion from the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in proposing these amendments.
This alteration was suggested to the committee by one of the many Islamic groups which appeared before it to talk about the impact of this legislation on their community in particular. This was one of the suggestions that they put forward. They put forward other suggestions that related to the way in which frisk searches should be carried out and to where ordinary and frisk searches could occur—that is, whether they occurred at or near a premises at which a warrant was being carried out. They also put forward other suggestions as to the way in which those searches occurred—that is, whether they occurred in view of all people present at those premises. So there were a number of amendments that the Islamic community suggested, in particular, because they were well aware of the potential use of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and the impact that it could have on their particular community.
I acknowledge that the government has taken up one of the many suggestions that were put forward by the Islamic community when discussing their concerns about the way in which the implementation of this bill could directly impact on their community and add to the level of fear that already exists within that community about them being singled out in relation to these issues.

But here is the first example—and there will be quite a number as we deal with this committee stage debate— where the government itself picks up recommendations from the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and proposes amendments in this committee stage.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-12-10,"—These are sensible amendments from the government, and they will be supported by the Democrats because they address what I would call gender sensitivities as well as cultural sensitivities. We heard from many people in various Senate committee hearings, particularly the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee hearing on this issue, and I would like to quote briefly from a submission we received from Mohammed Waleed Kadous and Agnes Hoi-Shan Chong, who made the following observation on this issue:
All of the above issues—
and they are referring to an earlier part of their submission—
apply general to the whole of the community, and any member of the community could be affected by it; although the Muslim community is likely to bear the brunt of the issues. However, one particular issue of concern to Muslim men and women is “frisking searches” by police officers.
They go on to state their case that Islam has strict regulations about the interaction of Muslim men and women. They said:
In an ideal Islamic environment, physical contact between men and women is minimised. This extends even so far as to a matter such as handshakes and so on. This applies to both men and women.
In the context of frisk searches that are deemed necessary, ideally male officers should frisk male Muslims, and female officers frisk female Muslims. The reverse would cause great offence to people of Muslim background; in particular, the idea of male police officers frisking female Muslims, is particularly offensive in all Muslim cultures.
And so it goes on; you can get the flavour of their argument. They go on to argue later in their submission that the legislation be amended further `so that male officers should frisk males and female officers frisk females'. They say that this is similar to the regulations regarding strip searches and that strip searches specifically prohibit touching of areas between the navel and the knee. That latter part is not something that I could support. I do not think we should take religious sensitivities to the extreme of not frisking people thoroughly but, in terms of gender and some religious sensitivities, these amendments make good sense and have our support.

Government amendments (2) to (8), (13) and (16) make a range of amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 to include former judges as persons who may be appointed as issuing and prescribed authorities under the bill. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee recommended that former judges should perform these roles and that a panel of former judges should be established for that purpose, as opposed to the existing provisions providing for these roles to be performed by federal judges, federal magistrates and other prescribed authorities and senior legal members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is the government's view that it is neither appropriate nor workable to limit the pool of potential issuing and prescribed authorities to former judges.
The pool of retired judges who are willing and able to do the job will be quite small. This could cause serious operational difficulties—for example, in the event of a number of warrants being executed simultaneously or in jurisdictions such as Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory where the pool of retired judges is small. However, the government amendments include former judges amongst the classes of persons who may be appointed as issuing and prescribed authorities. This will ensure that an adequate number of issuing and prescribed authorities are available to meet operational needs. The amendments provide for the Attorney-General to maintain a register of former judges who have consented to be appointed.
What we have here is an accommodation of the concerns of those people who wanted to include former judges. We do not believe a panel could consist of former judges alone due to the lack of number of those judges and the requirement that they would have to consent—we have seen that the Federal Court judges themselves do not like being involved in the issuing of warrants. It is reasonable to assume that former judges would not necessarily want to become involved in this process. I know the opposition has amendments in relation to this—and I think that they are best left to be addressed when those amendments arise—but there are further restrictions that others and the opposition would have in relation to these former judges which we believe restrict the number even further. In the case of Western Australia, of which I have some personal knowledge, the number of retired judges is not great and, when you look at the fact that you would have to have the consent of that person, it would be unworkable to rely on a pool that consisted only of former judges. In the interests of accommodating the concerns that were raised by the references committee, we are, by these amendments, increasing the pool to include that cohort of persons.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I ask the Minister for Justice and Customs whether, given that the Director-General of ASIO indicated that this regime, as proposed, would be unlikely to be used on any more than two or three occasions in a calendar year, he continues to claim that there is a concern with the lack of number of retired judges—that the pool is, to use his words, `quite small'. Can you indicate how small the pool is, Minister? Given what seems to be a very small number of occasions on which this regime is likely to be utilised, surely this does not lead to the sorts of logistical problems that you contemplate. The minister says to us that the regime that is proposed by the opposition is neither appropriate nor workable. Leaving appropriateness aside, I am trying to concentrate at the moment on its workability. Minister, are you able to provide the committee with some support for your claim in relation to a lack of workability in the areas I have raised?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—The director-general of intelligence might have said only two or three occasions. However, an occasion could involve several, if not many, warrants because you might have an operation which includes several states. We have recently seen operations carried out by ASIO across Australia simultaneously. I suppose you could call all that one occasion. In such a situation you would need to have a number of people available across Australia, even in smaller states like Western Australia. That is the problem you face. I think it is a quite reasonable scenario. You would have to issue several warrants because you could be dealing with a group of people who are conspiring, and that group of people—obviously a terrorist group—are not acting via one person alone but through several, if not many, people across Australia. You would take out your action or you would carry out your operation simultaneously, and that would involve the issuing of many warrants, albeit on one occasion.
Law enforcement has experienced this many times. I have seen it in the Australian Federal Police where, in relation to organised criminals, warrants have been issued in different states at the same time so that the operations are carried out at precisely the same time and no-one is given advance notice or can give anyone else advance notice. That is the scenario which tests the system. The environment we have been living in since September 11 and in more recent months is a different environment to what we have experienced in the past. As to the future, who knows what we might require as to the frequency of these warrants. That is why everyone regards this bill so seriously. It is a bill that we hope will never have to be used, but we are realistic. In the environment that we are living in, we cannot rule out that these provisions will not be used in the future, and therefore they must be available. If they are to be available, the system has to be workable. We cannot afford to have a situation where there is only a limited number of former judges, where we cannot locate them in a hurry and where they are not available.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—With respect, Minister, I am not suggesting or asking that the use of these provisions be ruled out at some point in the future. I do not think any sensible person would rule that matter out. As I have indicated, we do have evidence from ASIO itself of the number of occasions when such provisions may be used. Let us nail it down. I am happy to take at face value what you say, drawn from your own experience in the Western Australian bar, about the pool of eligible retired judges being small. But are you able to say to the committee, drawing on your experience in the Western Australian bar, how small that pool is, and what are the implications?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I have made inquiries as to the number of former judges, and that might assist the committee at this stage. I will come to Senator Faulkner's question in a moment. The Attorney-General's Department does not have records of potential former judges in states and territories. From a Commonwealth point of view, the number of judges who served for the last 10 years and who are still under 72 years of age is: in the New South Wales Federal Court, five; in the ACT Federal Court, one; in the New South Wales Family Court, seven; in South Australia, one; in Victoria, four; in Tasmania, two; and in Queensland, two. So, from the Commonwealth point of view, the total number across Australia would be 22. Those judges would have to consent. My office has made inquiries and we are endeavouring to ascertain further numbers.
The question was put to me from my experience in Western Australia. Looking at judges who would be under the age of 72— because that is what the opposition is proposing—and who have 10 years experience in a superior court, the problem you would run into is that most judges retire at age 70, so you do not have too many left who are under 72. You would have a handful. The Attorney-General himself is of a view that you would have only two or three who would fit that requirement in Western Australia. That is merely anecdotal evidence, and by no means is it by way of some record— but that is the question I was asked. We are endeavouring to see if we can find further numbers. When you look at that number, from a Commonwealth point of view, it is certainly not great at all. The total number for New South Wales is 12; South Australia, one; the ACT, one; Victoria, four; Tasmania, two; and Queensland, two. And, from a Commonwealth point of view, I do not think there is one in Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—If I hear you correctly in answer to my question, Minister, you say that the Attorney-General's Department does not have records.
—Not for state and territory judges; these numbers are for Commonwealth judges.
—It does have records in relation to Commonwealth judges?
—I have just read them out.
—I thought you indicated that they did not have records in the broad. I appreciate that you do not have records for those from the state jurisdictions and I am sure you also appreciate that, as far as the proposal that the opposition is putting forward is concerned, we are suggesting that the judges be drawn not only from the High Court, the Federal Court and the Family Court but also from the Supreme Court and District Court, or however judges might be described in state jurisdictions, as well. You say you do not have the statistics available. The reason I press you on this is that you confidently say that the pool is small but you seem unable to quantify it.
I wonder if you have been able to give consideration to whether the use of existing judges is constitutionally sound. I ask the minister whether the Attorney-General's Department has sought advice on that issue of constitutionality. If so, is the minister able to share with this committee what that advice might be? If the minister was so minded and was generous enough, he might even consider tabling such advice or advices in the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I think the question of constitutionality was addressed in the inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I think that was canvassed adequately there. I am aware that there has been some suggestion that some constitutional aspect of this bill causes concern. In particular, it has been suggested that the detention powers under the bill are inconsistent with chapter 3 of the Constitution, which establishes the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. It has been argued that the inconsistency arises because the power to detain a person for punitive reasons is a judicial function which cannot be conferred upon the executive. The detention provisions under this bill are not for the purpose of punishing criminal activities. There is no punitive element to detention under the bill. Our advice confirms that the bill is constitutionally valid. 
As to whether we can provide a copy of that advice to the committee—we have run into the usual chestnut of providing advice— I will have to take that on notice and seek the views of the Attorney-General. But certainly we do not believe that there is any aspect of this bill which is unconstitutional. I am not sure that the first committee report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee suggested that the bill was unconstitutional, but I will have to have a look at that report again. I thought that it did not.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-10,"—That is a very disappointing response from the Minister for Justice and Customs and one that shows enormous ignorance of some fairly critical issues here. There was not just `some suggestion'; some of the most pre-eminent lawyers in the country had some huge concerns as to the constitutionality of these provisions. I would have thought that on an issue such as this, where you deem it a serious issue, the parliament deems it a serious issue and we are making special time for it, you would have taken the time to actually brief yourself on some of those advices. People as eminent as former Australian government solicitors-general raised deep concerns about the constitutionality of this legislation. For you to dismiss them as `some concern', in your words, I think really reflects on you enormously badly in that you obviously have not briefed yourself on these issues.
You say that you will ask the Attorney-General whether it is possible for him to make the advice available to the committee. Great good that will do! He has been on notice for quite some months now in respect of that advice and all we get are these bland assurances from his officers saying, `We have been assured that this is okay.' On the one hand we have the `trust me' statement from the government, whereas lawyer after lawyer, Queen's counsel after Queen's counsel and senior counsel after senior counsel practising at bars across the country tell us that these provisions have grave constitutional doubt.
—Read your own report.
—I have read my own report. It is about time you read it. It is really good to see that finally you have discovered it. Maybe you should have read it this afternoon.
—I was right all along. Reread it.
 (Senator Knowles)—Order! Senator Ellison.
—You are out of order and you should be told that you are out of order—No.1.
—You should have rolled up to the committee more often!
—Order! Senator Ellison.
—Secondly, Minister—and Senator Faulkner was asking a few questions on this—can I ask you one question that was not addressed by either committee and could you provide an answer: is it possible for a warrant to be issued from a judge by telephone?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—As I put it correctly—and I think Senator Bolkus ought to go back and have another look at it—the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee looked at the bill and addressed three issues. One of them was whether it is constitutionally valid for the executive to authorise the detention of a person who is not a suspect. That was looked at when the parliamentary joint committee was looking at other aspects of this bill. When I said that one of the previous committees had looked at this question I was right. There may be all manner of witnesses who made submissions to that committee, but I do not recall that committee saying—and perhaps Senator Bolkus can point to it—that this bill was unconstitutional.  
We always get submissions on legal opinion which differ. In the 10 years that I have been associated with Senate committees, that is nothing unusual. The government has its own advice that this bill is constitutionally valid. For Senator Bolkus now to exaggerate the position of the legal aspect of this bill without acknowledging that matter of history does nothing to advance the rational debate of this bill which is an important one. I think that needs to be noted for the record. On the question of warrants issued by phone, the warrant has to be signed by the issuing authority and there is no provision for a telephone warrant.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-10,"—Minister, there are so many areas of federal jurisdiction. Issuing authorities and supervising authorities do have a capacity to entertain proceedings by telephone. I am asking you whether there is anything in this legislation that would bar that.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—Perhaps Senator Bolkus is angling for a telephone warrant by the way he is talking on this amendment. Clause 34C(5) states:
The Director-General may request the warrant only by giving the material described in subsection (4) to an issuing authority who is a Judge or a member of a class specified by the regulations for the purposes of section 34AB if the person could be detained for a continuous period ...
And it goes on to deal with other matters. That says that the director-general can only request the warrant by giving the material to that issuing authority, and the material very much implies that there has to be a physical transaction, that there has to be a meeting, if you like, or a situation where that material is handed over. So it is not a situation where you can do that over the telephone; it has to be done very much on a personal basis.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I think the Minister for Justice and Customs is trying to gloss over a particular problem that he might be confronted with here. The legislation does not say that there has to be physical presence. There has to be delivery but, as in so many areas of federal jurisdiction, that delivery can be by fax, by email—by delivery of one sort or another. I take Senator Faulkner's first point, particularly in the context of Mr Richardson's advice, that over the last 12 months—which you have got to say was a pretty hectic year for potential terrorist activities—these provisions would have been used only two or three times. I think that is the fundamental point. Minister, the other point is that, if you are trying to argue that there are no judges, it has never been beyond the capacity of this government or others to find retired judges to conduct work for them across the country. The clause you just read out in no way demands that there need be physical presence. Can I put it to you and to your advisers that they know it and they should be informing you to that effect.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—Senator Bolkus is talking about whether this can be done by telephone. I have indicated to him that there has to be a physical aspect to this. It is a conveyance which is personal.
—Where is that stated? That is not what you read out.
—If you have to deliver a document to someone, that is a physical aspect. If you make sure that they are standing by the fax and you send it to them and they receive it, that is a physical conveyance. It is not something that is done over a telephone whereby no signature or anything is provided. I read the proposed subsection very clearly. Senator Bolkus, by his question, is trying to imply that this bill allows a telephone warrant—it does not. The proposed subsection is there. It speaks for itself.

—I would not mind going there. If you want to go there, I will take you there on this particular point, Minister. At least I used to come to this parliament prepared for the issues, unlike you. At least I used to come in here having read the briefs of my own. And at least I used to understand the legislation, unlike you. If you are looking at experience, time and time again federal judges would issue warrants and do all sorts of proceedings by telephone, out of their chambers or wherever. There is provision in federal laws for that.

That is how it happens—because that legislation says that you can do it by telephone. Where it does not say that you can do it by telephone, you cannot. What this bill says is that it has got to be material provided by the director-general, and that is how you get the situation under other legislation that Senator Bolkus has mentioned of its being done by telephone because it says that.

Minister, as I heard it—and please correct me if I am wrong—you ruled out the possibility of warrants under this legislation being issued by telephone but not necessarily by fax. As I heard you, a signature is required—and that could be done by fax—but the conveyancing, the interpersonal interaction, is done by alerting that person to being present at the receipt of the fax. Does that mean that a warrant can be issued by fax?

I think that even courts accept documents lodged by fax. We think there is nothing untoward in that. That requires a document be signed. That is a totally different requirement to the provision under the Crimes Act which authorises a warrant by telephone. If something is signed—and it is stated there—you obviously assume that the person signing it reads it. That is a much more substantial requirement than simply a warrant by telephone.

The minister is distracted at the moment, so I will repeat the question.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to give the Australian Greens' position on the amendments put forward by the government. We will not be supporting these amendments. They are in conflict with the next amendments to be put forward by the opposition. We have had some discussion already about potential constitutional issues with regard to serving judges being a part of this regime. The amendments put forward by the government take up one suggestion of the committee about former judges. But rather than, as suggested by the committee, replacing the existing AAT members or magistrates with former judges, the government's proposal is just to extend the number of people who can be issuing or prescribed authorities to also include former judges. We have had some discussion already about the constitutional issues that could arise from the government's current model, and they are not addressed by the amendments proposed by the government.
Another issue that we have not heard talked about is AAT members being able to provide warrants under the current regime. This being the enormously controversial legislation that it is, I understand that part of the rationale for putting forward the retired judges model was to make a further separation between the government or the executive who are putting this legislation in place and the people who will actually issue the warrants. The idea is that former judges perhaps do not have as much reliance on the government and the executive for their ongoing positions, their future employment or their general relationship with the government. This government amendment does not take away those concerns that people have about government employees, through the AAT, making decisions about how this legislation should be implemented.
The responses from the Minister for Justice and Customs so far have focused on constitutional issues and the number of retired judges that would be available to serve this function. We have heard others refer to the evidence given by Dennis Richardson during the committee hearings that he believed this legislation would have been used on two to three occasions in the last 12 months. It is particularly disturbing that this government is putting forward as one of its strongest arguments against the retired judges model that it does not believe there are enough retired judges to fulfil these responsibilities. I hope that the government's expression of this as such a concern is not an indication that this legislation would be used more than the two to three times in the last year that we heard about from the Director-General of ASIO. It is deeply concerning to hear that being put forward by the government as a major argument for why they do not support purely retired judges being the prescribed and issuing authorities. Perhaps the minister can enlighten us as to whether he believes this legislation would be used a lot more frequently than Dennis Richardson's evidence to the committee suggested. ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I have to correct something that Senator Nettle said. Members of the AAT are prescribed authorities, not issuing authorities. We have separated the role of the issuing authorities from the role of the prescribed authorities. Issuing authorities issue the warrant; they are not prescribed authorities who preside over questioning. That is a separate role. To have mixed those two would be an issue; that is why we have separated them. Senior legal members of the AAT are prescribed authorities, not issuing authorities. I want to correct the record for Senator Nettle, who was under the impression that the members of the AAT were to be issuing authorities.
As I understand it, Mr Richardson's comments were in relation to the number of instances in which these provisions would have been used since September 11 and not so much how many times they would be used each year. I am glad that I have been advised of that because it brings his evidence into focus more accurately. He can look back and see two or three instances since September 11 last year where these warrants could have been used. In hindsight, he can say that with some degree of certainty.
As to the future, it is very difficult for anyone to say how many times these provisions would be used. All I can say is that we live in an environment where there is a threat to security. We have seen actions taken by ASIO in past months which in one case have resulted in charges being laid. As I said to Senator Faulkner in answer to an earlier question, it would not be beyond the realms of possibility to see these provisions being used in the future. I would hope that we had an environment where these did not have to be used, but as the government of Australia we have got to look out for the security of this country, and we have to have provisions in place in case the need arises for our agencies to use them. That is why they are there. In the current environment you could not rule out these provisions being used, and that is why they are so important.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—The only information that is available to members of the committee is the Director-General of ASIO's public evidence in relation to this matter. I accept the minister's presentation of that evidence to the committee in this debate. That is a fair reflection of what was said. In excess of a year after September 11, 2001 such provisions, if they were in place, would have been used on two or three occasions. I think the link being drawn here—the link between the number of occasions such provisions may be used and the number of retired judges from the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court, state supreme courts and state, district or county courts who are available to fulfil that particular function—is an appropriate one. When we have dealt with these government amendments, we will be dealing with the opposition's amendments which propose that the prescribed authority comprise retired judges from those superior courts. We deliberately talk about retired judges.
It is very important that this committee reflect on the crucial role of the prescribed authority under this legislation—the crucial role of the prescribed authority in a questioning regime. The prescribed authority is the person before whom questioning must take place and the one who supervises the questioning. The prescribed authority is the one who can give a wide range of directions in order to manage the process. The committee should reflect on some of the evidence that was adduced before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I remind the committee of the evidence of Mr Bret Walker SC, who appeared on behalf of the Law Council of Australia and argued that the prescribed authority `must not become engaged on anything which sees them lining up with the institution which is doing the questioning'. In his evidence he likened the role of the prescribed authority to that of a chaperone. He said: 
... as I understand the role of a chaperone, it is not to run interference on things but, by their simple presence and by the nature of the person, to perhaps instil a sense of propriety that might not otherwise happen ... The idea is that if you have got a respectable retired judge ... then the chances of the security services misbehaving are hugely reduced, I would have thought. People do tend to behave better when they are in the presence of people whom they cannot control.
Like the Law Council, Dr Stephen Donaghue argued that a judge would be most suitable in this role. He said:
The questioning is not being conducted by the prescribed authority ... it is being supervised by them. It seems to be desirable to have someone acting in that position who would ... make sure that the process takes place appropriately. It seems to me that that is why they are there, at the end of the day—to ensure that the process is conducted appropriately. I would submit that a sitting Supreme Court judge, or a retired judge of any court, is less likely to be in a position to be pressured by the executive in the way that they exercise that function than an AAT member, who is likely to have had a less distinguished legal career and is likely to be dependent on the government for their continued appointment to the AAT. If it is a safeguard, it is a better safeguard in my view. There are certainly a great many Supreme Court judges or retired judges who would exercise that function very vigorously.
I think Dr Donaghue draws an important distinction about the seniority and status of judges and retired judges. It became clear through the recent Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 that it is essential that the prescribed authority be truly independent if the prescribed authority is to fulfil the role and obligation of protecting the rights of people who are being questioned and detained. However highly esteemed magistrates may be, they do not have the status and seniority of judges.
We have had senior counsel making it absolutely clear that the role given to serving Federal Court judges and serving federal magistrates—who, as issuing authorities, are subject to the same chapter III limitations as Federal Court judges—makes the bill constitutionally suspect. Chapter III of the Constitution prevents the conferral of any function upon a federal judge, even acting in a personal capacity, if that function is incompatible with the exercise of the judicial function under chapter III. That concern has simply not been answered by the government.
The people putting this case are people of substance: Dr Gavan Griffith QC, Professor George Williams and Dr Stephen Donaghue. They represent some pretty heavyweight legal opinion on these sorts of issues. In stark contrast to the open, frank and thoughtful advice provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee by these eminent people, the government refuse to table or provide a copy of its legal advice. The minister says that the legal advice exists but will not front up with it. Given what is at stake here, it is of concern that the government have never been willing to provide that advice to parliamentary committees or to either house of the Australian parliament. They say to us, `Everything's okay,' even though we have these eminent constitutional lawyers making the strong points they have made.
I am not sure it is okay. I am one of those people in the chamber who are not lawyers, but if strong, coherent and persuasive arguments are put forward by lawyers, I like to listen to them. But what the opposition has put forward, which we will deal with in the next set of amendments, is a far more workable model for the prescribed authority, and one that has also been recommended by a Senate committee. I want to hear from the government whether there are the logistical weaknesses that the minister blithely says exist. The minister claims that the pool of retired judges is not big enough. I hoped that, by the time we were having this committee debate, the minister would be able to substantiate that claim. He cannot. He has not been able to do that today. I think that, if the minister could substantiate that claim, there would be an obligation on this committee to look carefully at any arguments like that that are presented. But all we hear is that Senator Ellison is well connected in the Western Australian bar and he does not think there are enough retired judges to go around. No-one actually has any statistics or any names to throw on the table—or, as we would say in politics, no-one has any numbers to throw on the table. 
I think that on these points the government is obligated to front up to the Senate committee. The government is obligated, if it says there are not enough retired judges, to tell us how broad the pool is. I have tried to seek advice from the legal community, who have tried to satisfy me that there are enough; but I am willing to listen to sensible, well-founded arguments, if there are any. I am more than happy to be satisfied on the point of constitutionality. But what we get from the minister and from the government is some half-baked claim that the Attorney-General's Department has had a look at it and everything is okay. Who is going to accept that throwaway line from the government on an important issue like this? The government to date has not provided any comfort on these important issues. It has provided no comfort at all on the serious constitutional issues that have been raised.
This is important, because the government—properly, in my view—argues about the national security implications of this and other counter-terrorism legislation. In my view, that is a fundamentally important imperative for this chamber and for this parliament. I hope every senator in this chamber takes account of it. If this legislation is considered as important as it is by the government, what would the government think of the blow to national security if this particular law, if it is passed in the form that the government wants, were to fall over because of constitutional problems with the warrant issuing process? That is why I think we are entitled, at this committee stage, to ask for clear and definitive answers from the government on issues of genuine and real substance.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I rise to address a couple of issues. Firstly, Senator Faulkner has raised the query of using members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as prescribed authorities. I think the question related to whether or not they are appropriate. Recommendation 1 of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—of which Senator Ray is a member and was a participant in this inquiry—into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 states:
Federal magistrates to issue all warrants;
Federal Judges to issue all warrants where detention will exceed 96 hours; and
members of the AAT, as set out in proposed subsection 34B(1), to undertake all other duties of the prescribed authority excluding the power to issue warrants.
That is where you get the division between the people who issue the warrant and the people who are the prescribed authorities who oversee the questioning. That deals with any constitutional query, and it is also a recommendation of the parliamentary joint committee, which we adopted. That is why it is in the bill.
We have had the query about the constitutionality of this framework. If you are going to ask where the authority is, let us look at a Senate committee, because we rely on this as our authority. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, as I previously advised the committee, looked into the constitutional aspect of this bill. Paragraph 1.21 of the committee's report comes under the heading, `Is the issuing of questioning warrants by magistrates an exercise of executive power that is incompatible with their role as judicial officers?' This is the nub of any concern as to constitutionality and really touches on the High Court decision of Grollo v. Palmer. Paragraph 1.21 of the committee's report states:
In summary, the Committee notes the concerns of Professor Williams and Dr Carne about some fundamental constitutional questions and the further response of the Attorney General's Department to those matters. The Committee considers that if the PJC's recommendation that warrants for detention be issued only by federal magistrates and Federal Court judges is adopted by the Government, such amendments will go a considerable way towards addressing the concerns about the validity of the current Bill. 
That is precisely what we did. We have taken on board recommendation 1 of the parliamentary joint committee, and we have federal magistrates, Federal Court judges and members of the AAT as prescribed authorities. So I think we have addressed those issues, and I cannot see what more the government can do. We have taken what the committee said and we have got our own advice. The matter really speaks for itself. Look at the committee report, look at both committee reports, and you will see what the PJC said in its first recommendation. We have followed that course of action.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—When someone who has been the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, such as is the case with Gavan Griffiths QC, says that the legislation in its current form is constitutionally suspect, I think it is very foolish of the government not to look carefully at these sorts of issues. Of course what the Minister for Justice and Customs does— and this has been raised after the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—is come in here and read one recommendation from the PJC report. Half an hour ago he was rejecting another one. In other words, what the minister is doing is cherry picking these recommendations. If a recommendation or a view of a particular committee happens to suit the government, the government picks that out, regardless of the evidence that has been forthcoming on these issues—in the case of the PJC, after the advisory report had gone to the Attorney-General.
The approach that the opposition is putting forward is in fact consistent with a unanimous Senate committee recommendation—that is, that the opposition proposes that the prescribed authority be made up of experienced retired judges. I am trying to hear from the minister, but have not heard, some support for a logistical argument, which I think people would take account of if there are not enough of them. Apart from some sort of vague indication that this is the case in Western Australia, the committee is yet to be provided with any evidentiary support for that statement.
So we say, given all the concerns and given the role of the prescribed authority, that that prescribed authority be made up of experienced retired judges—individuals whose standing cannot be questioned. We have suggested a panel of retired judges who have had very significant years of service on a superior court. What is the advantage of doing that? What is the reason for doing that? It removes serious concerns over the constitutionality of using chapter 3 judges as the issuers of warrants, as the government is proposing, but also—and I think this is very important—it will have the effect of boosting community confidence in the accountability and the integrity of this regime. I think that is absolutely essential also.
The government needs to reflect on the fact that when this proposition was developed by the Senate committee—it came forward in evidence, and the committee was able to seek evidence on this matter and develop the proposal of using retired judges as members of the prescribed authority—it was very well received by agencies, by lawyers and by community groups who were appearing before the Senate inquiry. In fact, the Director-General of Security also said in evidence before the Senate inquiry that he thought using retired judges was well aligned to the current bill. But I think it is important that we heed what the director-general was saying. It is important to remember that, right through his evidence and through a range of public statements he has made, he has been supportive of ensuring that we use a model that instils the greatest level of community confidence in this regime. I think that is the other great advantage in what the opposition propose with retired judges. If there is a logistical problem with this in terms of the numbers, in terms of the pool, tell us. Do not make some vague claims. Put it on the table so that we can have a look at it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-10,"—I wish to follow up on the minister's response concerning the documents that are used to establish a warrant and the fact that they are not available at any time to the person who is the subject of that warrant. I wish to quote from the October 2002 issue of the Public Sector Informant. The cover story is by Veronica Burgess and the heading is, `Secret Business—ASIO Intelligence Game'. I think the subheading encapsulates the concerns of the Australian people. The article states: 
Discretion and intrusion go hand-in-hand in an organisation which can and does poke its nose into secret corners of people's lives.
The article goes on to say:
ASIO is allowed to and does poke its nose into secret corners of people's lives. With the approval of the Attorney-General, it can do some pretty intrusive things, including: tracking your movements, tapping your phone or computer, sticking a microphone or a micro-camera in your bedroom wall, checking your post or taking a look around your house—but not willy-nilly. There are still strict regulations about what it is allowed to do, why, and for how long. ASIO also collects foreign intelligence within Australia at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or Defence.
I come back to the original proposal—that is, the information that is used to establish the application for a warrant is in no way available to the person who is the subject of the warrant. Proposed section 34D(5)(a)(i), which deals with warrants for questioning, refers to giving information `that is or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorist offence'. So an order for questioning can be placed on somebody for no other reason than that they `may' happen to have information. It does not have to be relevant. The only requirement is that it `may' be relevant. What an intrusion that is into the lives of average Australians.
Under this legislation, a person who owns a property in which a person may have resided—a person whom the government suspects has been involved in some terrorist activity—could find that he is the subject of an order and be taken in for questioning just because the information he has `may' be relevant. He does not even have the right to know the basis of the claim. That is the reason why I believe we should be looking at this section of the legislation relating to the prescribed authority and the issuing authority. It is extremely important that the prescribed authority ensures that the person being questioned has certain rights maintained. Sometimes we become so engrossed in the technicalities of legislation before this chamber that we do not stop and look at the effect that it is going to have on the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to talk about the difference between issuing authorities and prescribed authorities. I am well aware of the distinction, although I thank the minister for pointing it out. Making the distinction does not alleviate any concerns that I, or others who expressed concerns in the committee, have about the close relationship between employees of the government—whether they be issuing authorities or prescribed authorities. They are making a decision to pursue a warrant and then to oversee questioning. That distinction in the role of the AAT certainly does not ease any concerns that I, and the people who expressed them at the committee, have about the close relationship between those authorities and the government. 
I continue to express concern about the rationale in terms of the number of retired judges not being adequate. I understood the evidence given by Dennis Richardson at the time to mean that, since September 11, he believes this legislation would have been used on two or three occasions. That does not give us any idea of how many times it will be used per year but, as Senator Bolkus pointed out, the period since September 11, 2001 has been a period of intense activity on this front. One would anticipate that if this legislation, as the director-general said, were used on only two or three occasions, that would give us some idea about the likelihood of the ongoing use of this legislation.
I direct a question to Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner, you described evidence that had been given before the Senate committee about the distinction made in the issuing of the prescribed authority. You said that evidence had been put to the committee that we needed to ensure that there were different people who fulfilled these roles. It could be that I have not found it. Could you explain to me where that distinction exists in the model put forward by the opposition between the role of the prescribed authority and the role of the issuing authority, which was something that was put forward in the committee as a concern by some groups.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—No such distinction exists. I think I can say to Senator Nettle that, if she did not find such a distinction, that is because it does not exist. The minister could well be asked why the prescribed authority cannot also be the issuing authority. In the opposition's view there is absolutely no reason why that cannot be the case. I know of no substantive argument that can be mounted against it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I am happy to recognise that that may well be the position of the opposition, Senator Faulkner. I just found that you were arguing before to the government that people had come before the Senate committee and had made that distinction, so I was wondering whether that had been pursued in your amendments. I recognise that you have provided that information to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-12-10,"—There may be no greater illustration—although that may be yet to come— of an argument in favour of the three-year sunset clause. We are effectively involving ourselves in a debate and a discussion on which is the better model in terms of issuing warrants. There are pros and cons on both sides. I have some sympathy with the minister's argument that there are few judges. To be fair, in the statistics that he has given he has referred only to retired chapter III judges, not to state jurisdictional retired judges. There was also the argument that warrants cannot be issued by phone. However, we have heard that they can be issued by fax and that state judges are available. I could have some sympathy with the minister's position if he could further quantify it or strengthen the argument that a lack of judges was the issue, but I am not so sure that it is. If that is or is not the case then surely this is an illustration of where the sunset clause comes into play. In three years time we can, with the benefit of hindsight, look back on this and say, `That model worked,' or, `That model didn't work.' That will be an opportunity for a new parliament in a different environment to review the legislation.
I strongly pick up a point that Senator Faulkner made—and I am paraphrasing— that this is not just an issue of practicalities or indeed technicalities but also a question of perception. There was recently an article in the Australian print media resulting from questions asked in recent Senate estimates where ASIO confirmed that it had in some cases issued its own warrants—the minister may correct me on that—on the basis that the Attorney was unavailable. I think that creates an understandable perception and concern in the community around the notion of a secret police force. It is something which we as a parliament should avoid and we should ensure that the appropriate protections are in place. The proposal by the opposition better does that on the basis that there is the stronger perception that the issuing of warrants is at arm's length from the government or, at least, departments associated with the government when you are referring instead to the integrity and judicial experience of retired judges. On that basis I believe, and the Democrats believe, that these government amendments ought to be opposed. The alternative model, which we will get to shortly, offers a better opportunity to deal with this issue not just in terms of its perception but also in terms of its practicality, given that the three-year sunset clause is there to remedy the situation if it is proven to be fundamentally flawed. On the debate I have heard thus far, I am not convinced that that is the case.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-12-10,"—I want to comment on one point raised by Senator Greig. He is right that there is a provision in the ASIO legislation—but not, I think, this one—where the director-general can issue a warrant in the absence of the Attorney-General, but it is an unusual step. It is then subject to review—and this case was subject to review by the inspector-general; it was in his report. He looked at the circumstances and validated ASIO's actions on this occasion. The provision is there for that reason. But it is not an unfettered right of the director-general. It is subject to review, it was reviewed and it was validated by the inspector-general.

As the committee is aware, we have spent a considerable period of time debating two alternatives: the government's proposal in relation to prescribed authority and that of the opposition. I have canvassed at some length the reasons that I believe the opposition's proposal is a superior one. I think that we determined in the committee debate that both alternative models would effectively be on the table and canvassed. The committee has seen fit to oppose the government amendments in relation to adding former judges. We are now dealing with the substantive opposition amendment in relation to the form of the prescribed authority.
I do not want to speak at length to this, because we canvassed it at considerable length a little earlier this evening. It is important for the committee to remember that the prescribed authority plays an absolutely crucial role in the questioning regime. It is, of course, the prescribed authority which is present when questioning takes place. The prescribed authority has responsibility for supervising the questioning and for managing the whole process and has a capacity to give directions in managing the process. 
We have indicated our concerns on a range of issues in relation to the alternative proposition that is contained in the bill, and not only in terms of the need for appropriate status and seniority of the prescribed authority—in other words, judges as opposed to magistrates. There is also the question of constitutionality, which is an important one. Hence the proposal that the opposition have put forward—which was developed in the Senate references committee inquiry and report—in relation to retired judges, given the concerns that have been indicated and presented to the committee about the constitutional issues surrounding serving Federal Court judges and federal magistrates.
I put to the committee in the strongest terms I can that this particular amendment has the advantage of removing those serious concerns over the constitutionality of using chapter III judges as the issuers of warrants. It also has the very considerable advantage of ensuring maximum community support for and confidence in the regime, by ensuring the accountability and integrity of the process. That is the great advantage of using retired judges as the prescribed authority. I make the point again that this is something that not only is supported by the opposition and the Senate references committee but also was received very favourably by senior members of the legal community who appeared before the Senate references committee, by agencies and also by community groups. 
The amendment has a lot to commend it, and the only real argument that the government has been able to propose against it is that there may be an inadequate number of retired superior court judges to be able to adequately fulfil the functions of, or provide a panel for fulfilling the functions of, a prescribed authority. But we continue to face the problem that the government is unable to quantify that, thus reinforcing what Senator Greig was saying in his most recent contribution to the committee.
Mr Temporary Chairman, as you know, this particular matter has been canvassed at length this evening. I believe the proposal that the opposition is moving is the very best model available in relation to the composition of the prescribed authority, and I commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—I rise to give the Australian Greens position on these amendments. There are going to be many occasions throughout this debate where I will be rising to indicate that the Australian Greens will be supporting an amendment put forward by the Labor Party that we see as trying to improve a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation. Opposition amendment (6) is one of those amendments. We have previously had discussions about constitutionality and the relationship between prescribed and issuing authorities and the executive, and we have had arguments about whether or not there is an adequate number of judges. All of those points lead to a preference for this model as opposed to the model that is being put forward by the government.
When Senator Faulkner says that he believes this model will boost public confidence in this regime, I think he is probably being a little bit rich. I think it will boost some confidence—in what you could describe as an ambit claim in terms of the way in which this legislation was first put forward by the government—in that it does seek to ameliorate some of the worst aspects of that legislation. But it still leaves us with a detention regime for non-suspects. I go back to one of the fundamental tenets of our legal system—stated in the Magna Carta itself: people should not be detained unless they have come before a court and have been found to have been, or are suspected on reasonable grounds by the court to have been, involved in a criminal activity. This is one of those many amendments where we will be supporting the position put forward by the opposition, because we see that it does help to ameliorate the worst aspects of a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I rise to put on record that the government opposes these opposition amendments. It does so firmly on the basis that this is unworkable and for the reasons I have outlined previously. I do not want to cover the same ground again, but what you are looking at is finding a judge who is under 72, who has been 10 years in superior court jurisdiction and who is willing to take on the job. I have mentioned before the problems that the government sees with this and that it is unworkable.
There are a number of issues that the government oppose strongly in this debate. We are not dividing because of the time constraints on us. I indicate to the Senate that we would have divided in other circumstances, and I say that as an indication of the strength of the government's opposition to these amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—When the minister describes this legislation as being unworkable, what is his premise for that view? Could he describe for the chamber whether the primary premise for his argument that this legislation is unworkable is that there will not be enough retired judges to enact that section of the legislation? It is important for the chamber to know that. It is of great concern if the minister believes this legislation will be used to such an extent that the model being put forward will be unworkable because there simply will not be enough retired judges throughout the country to deal with that level of usage.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I have gone over this before. I have indicated that, from a federal point of view, there are only 22 judges across Australia, none of them being in Western Australia. I hasten to add that there are state and territory judges who would not be included in these figures. We do not have those figures from the states and territories but, as I have said earlier, on anecdotal evidence the Attorney-General and I do not believe that you would find more than two or three judges in Western Australia. That does make it unworkable when you consider that, if we had a September 11 in Australia and you had prior notice of such an event, you would want to execute a number of warrants—because there were some 19 operatives that we know of in that exercise. If you had some intelligence prior to that and you wanted to question all 19, you would want to have 19 warrants. I have indicated our own experience where ASIO actions in the last couple of months involved the issuing of a number of warrants on the one occasion, so you do need people around the country available in relation to this role.
Finally, we took on board recommendation 1 of the parliamentary joint committee. That spelt out how you would have federal magistrates and Federal Court judges for issuing the warrants, with members of the AAT as prescribed authorities. We took that recommendation on board. We have now taken on board further concerns by saying, `We'll have that as recommended by the joint committee, but as well as that we'll have former judges to increase the pool size.' We really believe that we have taken this as far as we can in meeting the concerns. In relation to those other aspects of availability of former judges who meet the criteria that are required in this amendment, we have those problems. I cannot take it any further than that.

These amendments before the committee are minor in terms of the number of words, if you like, that they affect, take out or change. It is also fair to say that their significance is far from minor. Of course, substantive amendments will be moved by the opposition later in this committee stage in relation to removing 14- to 18-year-olds from the regime, setting out appropriate questioning times and ensuring access to legal advice. The amendments that are being moved here do ensure that the character of the regime is a questioning regime as opposed to a detention regime.
All in this chamber would agree that our response to the threat of terrorism has to be strong, effective and consistent with our democratic values and freedoms. As the ASIO bill stands, our view is that the government has got that balance wrong. The opposition is persuaded that the intelligence-gathering powers of ASIO should be enhanced, but we are not persuaded that that should be done through a police-like detention regime. ASIO can do its intelligence-gathering job properly, it can gather vital intelligence, without having to detain people for extended periods. I have heard the Attorney-General and others in the government stress that what is proposed in this bill is to ensure that the capacity for ASIO to gather intelligence is maximised.
I have been assured that this bill is about an intelligence-gathering regime. We are very concerned that, as it stands, this legislation may well run foul of the prohibition against arbitrary detention in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those who have followed the hearings, the evidence and the submissions before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee would be aware that a very significant number of strong submissions were made to the Senate committee on this issue.
The opposition proposes and supports a questioning regime, not a detention regime. We also insist on a questioning regime with strong protections and safeguards. We think it is appropriate that such a regime be broadly consistent with other questioning regimes employed by Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies, such as royal commissions, the NCA and state crime commissions. You have to be able to answer the question of why ASIO should have weaker powers to interview people in relation to terrorism offences than those bodies have in relation to corruption or corporate crime. That is an absolutely crucial question that opponents of this bill need to be able to answer.
The first issue in relation to a questioning regime as opposed to a detention regime is: who should initiate the process? In this respect, the opposition believe that the current bill has got it right. We think that warrants for questioning should be initiated by the Director-General of Security, who should seek the Attorney-General's consent to apply for a warrant. The Attorney-General must be given a draft and supporting material. Before giving consent, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the warrant is absolutely necessary and that questioning the person would be more effective than other methods of collecting intelligence. As far as the opposition are concerned, it is fundamental that this questioning regime should not apply to anyone under the age of 18. Although that matter will be dealt with in later amendments, the opposition strongly believe that children should not be subjected to ongoing questioning by an intelligence agency. Further opposition amendments that deal with the specifics of the questioning regime will be moved later in the committee stage of this bill. 
I commend the significance and importance of these amendments to this committee. We believe it is essential that the character of this regime be a questioning regime, not a detention regime. The intent of these amendments is to give effect to that.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-10,"—The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments because clearly a questioning regime is better than a compulsory and coercive detention regime as was proposed by the government initially in this legislation. However, I do think that the way the opposition describe these amendments is a little inaccurate, as they have assiduously gone through the bill and removed any reference to detention, taken out the word, replaced it with `custody' and simply left in questioning as a regime.
The opposition are proposing up to 20 hours of detention for people not suspected of being involved in terrorist activities, and those 20 hours do not include the time in which that person being questioned may talk to their lawyer, get rest that they need, get food or medical attention, talk to an interpreter, wait whilst a lawyer arrives, wait whilst an interpreter arrives, be informed of their rights with regard to this legislation or wait for any intoxication that they are under the influence of to have subsided. All of this time beyond the 20 hours that the opposition are proposing is clearly not questioning time; it is detention time.
The opposition are proposing not merely a questioning regime such as in the models that Senator Faulkner put forward—those of the ACC or the former National Crime Commission. Under that legislation, a summons is issued for people to appear before the examiner—somebody in the ACC office—often for discrete periods of time, in which they will proceed with questioning. Then, if you fail, a warrant can be issued and outlined for those people to appear before the ACC and the examiner. That is not the same as that proposed in these opposition amendments—and later we will get onto government amendments about entry into premises and reasonable force being used in that process—which are about bringing people into a questioning regime of 20 hours with no time limit for any detention beyond and around that.
What was proposed by the government originally was indefinite. Then we heard seven days as a further suggestion. But that was a maximum time limit for which people could be held. What we are hearing from the opposition is a far reduced time period for questioning, but no time limit for those additional activities that fall outside the questioning regime. This turns the opposition proposal not into a questioning regime, as they purport, but indeed into a detention regime. Senator Faulkner talked about the strong and convincing evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, where arbitrary detention is clearly singled out as being in contravention of that international covenant. I suggest to Senator Faulkner that that same and compelling evidence applies to the questioning and detention regime that is being put forward by the opposition in this regime and this package of amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—The government opposes these amendments put forward by the opposition. The opposition has argued that the bill should be amended so that it is a questioning regime only and does not permit the detention of persons. The government does not accept this proposal. It believes that the fundamental purpose of the bill would be thwarted by this approach. This bill deals with those circumstances where coercive questioning and detention, subject to strict controls, are necessary in the interests of public safety. For example, it may be necessary to detain a person to allow urgent intelligence investigations to continue unimpeded and to prevent them from informing others about ASIO's investigation. In some situations, the capacity to detain will be critical.
What we are dealing with here is not a normal situation, as you have with a criminal investigation. This aspect goes to national security where people are suspected of actively planning to bring about harm to the community at large or, indeed, something much greater than that. Detention is not just about questioning. It is also about prevention—it is about acting to prevent terrorist attacks. It would be absurd not to have a power to detain a person for a limited period in a situation where there is evidence that they will tip off their terrorist associates. We need sufficient powers to prevent persons from alerting the terrorists that we are on to them. The only way to protect against this is to hold a person incommunicado, subject to strict safeguards, while questioning for the purposes of intelligence gathering. 
Those at the front line of meeting the terrorist threat tell us that, in order to protect the community, they need the power to hold a person incommunicado, subject to strict safeguards, whilst questioning them to gather intelligence. This is a need that we have to address in this bill. The opposition amendments do not do that. Warrants under the bill will only ever be used as a last resort. It is important that, when no other measures are available, our intelligence agencies have this essential tool to prevent terrorist attacks. The detention of persons is a significant power, but one that is necessary in the new environment of threat that we experience.
The government have taken active steps to ensure that the safeguards included in this bill remain consistent with our fundamental democratic values and freedoms. In the opposition's proposals we see nothing that advances what this bill needs us to do and what our security agencies need. We believe that we do that in our bill, but at the same time we have regard to those democratic values and freedoms which I mentioned. We believe that we have to make tough decisions in the interests of the safety of all Australians. A bill such as this is the sort of decision that I mention.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-12-10,"—The first group of amendments moved by the opposition would remove reference to detention. If the committee are to support that, then we should acknowledge that the removal of references to detention may influence the interpretation of the act by a judge, should it be challenged— that is, individual sections should be interpreted consistently with the spirit of the act as a whole. Opposition amendment (14) would remove the provision which enables a person to be deprived of the right to legal advice during the first 48 hours. It is very important to emphasise here that access to legal advice and, indeed, access to legal aid where warranted in those circumstances is critical. We need to emphasise that, particularly in the situation where a person would have—as is proposed—no right to silence.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-10,"—The Minister for Justice and Customs said that this ASIO legislation is designed to ensure our fundamental democratic values and freedoms. I wonder if the minister could tell the committee whether this legislation is fully consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, indeed, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international covenants to which Australia is a signatory. Could the minister say whether advice has been sought on that matter and, if so, what that advice to the government is and from whom it came?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—In resolution 1373, the United Nations Security Council recognised that acts of terrorism constitute a threat to international peace and security. The Security Council also called on states to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. This bill will help ensure that Australia meets its obligations arising from resolution 1373. The government takes Australia's human rights obligations seriously and makes conscientious efforts to ensure that they are complied with. The bill recognises the need to ensure both the security and safety of the community and respect for individual rights. Ultimately, any person claiming that his or her international human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have been violated has a right to lodge a communication with the United Nations Human Rights Committee. We believe it would be impossible for any country to say categorically that no breaches of its international human rights obligations will ever occur, because these obligations relate to the treatment of individuals and compliance will depend on the circumstances of each individual case. But one has to remember that stemming from that resolution by the United Nations Security Council is a duty on member states to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. This is what the bill is primarily aimed at. As for the safeguards in this bill, if Senator Brown will not rely on what the government says, he merely has to look at the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report at page X to see the safeguards built into this bill outlined at length.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-10,"—Chair, you may have heard the minister avoid the question, but I will put it to him again in case he did not understand it. His submission then was just read from a piece of paper—obviously prepared for the eventuality of the question which I put. But I will explore the matter a little further. Does this legislation infringe on any of our international signed obligations such as the international covenants to which we have both referred? Has the government had advice on that and, if so, what is that advice? I will now add to that: does the government read the motion of the Security Council, to which the minister has just referred, as allowing abrogation of member states from their international obligations to covenants on such things as civil and political rights?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I think that we can look at the practice of other member states. The fact is that there are international precedents for this sort of legislation. Relevant legislation from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States was considered when drafting this bill. All those states are answering their obligations under resolution 1373 of the United Nations Security Council. The similarities are there between this bill and the legislation that has been mentioned from those overseas jurisdictions. I mentioned the resolution from the United Nations Security Council. We believe that we do have the checks and balances there to ensure that human rights and civil and political rights are observed.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-10,"—I will try again. I did not ask the minister about whether he thought human rights were being observed, protected or otherwise. I asked him about the covenants to which Australia is a signatory and about Australia's obligation to those covenants and whether or not this legislation was consistent with those obligations. That is the question. I also clearly asked the minister whether the government had advice and, if so, what that advice was. It would make the process a lot faster if the minister would answer those questions. 
—I have got nothing to add.
—Indicted by his own refusal, this minister is in effect admitting that the government does know that this legislation breaches, and breaches serially, international covenants to which Australia is a signatory. The legislation effectively is attempting domestic law which breaches international law. Moreover, I take it from the minister's failure to defend the position with any information at all that he has advice which says just that. We are being asked to sign on to a piece of legislation that breaks the law—very important law at that; international law on human rights, political rights, the rights of children. The minister sits mute—
—I've answered the question.
—He says that he has answered the question. Any reasonable person looking at the Hansard will see that he ducked the question. I will ask the minister a very simple component of that question, for the third time, to see whether we can get a yes or no answer: has the government had advice on whether this legislation is or may be in breach of any international covenant?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-10,"—I cannot take this any further. I have answered the question. The government is of the view that it has not breached any international obligation—in fact, it is fulfilling international obligation by this bill, and I have mentioned why.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-10,"—Finally! I will not expand on this, because the government is indicted by its own words. We are seeing a deliberated, premeditated breach of international covenants which are fundamental to the democratic values and freedoms which this government says the legislation is to uphold. There may be a conflict here between legislation that the government says is necessary to defend us from terrorism and Australia's obligation to international law. If that is the case the minister should say so. 
We are into a process here whereby the government knows that this bill breaches serially international covenants on fundamental democratic, civil and political rights but it does not have the honesty to say so. It knows that that is the case. The minister has indicated that that is the case but this government, headed by the Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister, is not honest about this legislation. If it were we could have a much more reasonable debate here. We could say, `This is a difficult situation.' Of course, we have to attack terrorism. We have to defend ourselves against terrorism, because terrorism itself is an attack on democracy, freedom and liberty. But we are not into an open and honest debate on this matter and on how we deal with the dilemma. We are into a debate in which the government says it is defending those values but knows that, through this piece of legislation, it is in breach of international laws upholding those values but will not say so.
I think honesty is a basic component of a healthy debate in a free parliament like this. Sometimes we do get terrible contradictory problems and this is one of them. But this debate is not helped by the government failing to admit the problem it faces. Once the government says—and this is the problem— `We can do what we like in internal legislation; we can cut down civil and political rights to sections of the community,' but will not admit that, then the process has no end. We have seen it with the detained asylum seekers. We are seeing it here in this legislation. We have to ask: where does it end? The problem is that it will go a lot further if we allow the government to get away with saying that it is not breaching anything here. That is a lie. Any minister or member opposite who gets up and says that would be confronted with the compelling evidence that that is a lie.
This legislation does breach international covenants. It needs tackling from that basis. But here it is being put forward by a government which has at best its head in the sand and at worst, and more likely, is being deliberately deceptive because it will not put to this committee its own advice on the matter, let alone a mature assessment of just how far this legislation does go in breaching those covenants.
I will try with Senator Faulkner—I might get a better go here. I want to follow up on Senator Nettle's line of questioning, which was about taking the word `detention' out and putting in the word `custody'. The MacquarieDictionary says that detention means keeping in custody. What does the opposition aim to achieve by exchanging these words? What does it fear in the word `detention' but feel comfortable with in the word `custody'?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-10,"—I rise to put a question to the minister. The minister has claimed that the bill will not affect the civil rights of Australians. I believe that that is incorrect. In their submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, the Law Council of Australia make the comment:
The Law Council objects to the capacity proposed to be conferred by s.34F(4) to detain incommunicado persons not themselves suspected of any criminal offence for a period of 48 hours, and strongly opposes any capacity to seek an extension of the 48 hour period pursuant to s.34F(7). The Law Council rejects as unacceptable the test of whether or not the prescribed authority is satisfied that there are “reasonable grounds” for believing that if the person is not detained, the person “may” alert a person involved in a terrorism offence that the offence is being investigated, may not continue to appear or appear again, or may destroy, damage or alter a record or thing.
The Law Council of Australia are clearly saying that a person who is not suspected of any criminal offence can be taken into custody for 48 hours. If we look at the powers of the bill, we find some rather frightening things. A person may be detained for questioning without being suspected of having committed or having been involved in planning an offence. They do not even have to be suspected of being involved in the planning of it, yet they can be held incommunicado. That person may be held for 48 hours. The period of detention may be extended if certain grounds are satisfied, with no maximum period of detention specified. 
There is no right to silence. Well, excuse me: if the right to remain silent is not one of the fundamental civil rights that we have in Australian society, what is? The privilege of refusing to answer on the grounds of selfincrimination does not apply. How can the minister sustain the argument that it is not a gross deterioration of the civil rights of an Australian person if they can no longer claim the right not to answer, based on the fact that it may incriminate them?
It goes further. There is no right to legal representation. You lose your right to remain silent. You lose your right not to answer because you may incriminate yourself. Then you have no right to have a legal representative there to advise you. Minister, are you still maintaining that this bill does not remove or detract from the civil rights of Australians? That is absolutely preposterous, and for this reason One Nation believes this legislation should not be amended but be defeated.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-10,"—In the few short minutes I have got, I will try to respond to Senator Brown's reasonable question to the opposition. Both in the original bill and in the bill as grudgingly amended in the House, the government has very stubbornly stuck to the basic model that it proposed on day one. That model contemplates allowing children to be detained for an extended period and to be questioned by ASIO. It contemplates allowing someone not suspected of any offence to be detained for seven days, including for 48 hours without a lawyer. Even after questioning has finished, a person not suspected of any offence can be detained for seven days.
The radical model proposed by the government is still at the core of the amended bill. I say it is still a detention regime. The government says it is for gathering intelligence. If that is so, then people should be released once questioning finishes. But of course, that is not the case. The government originally wanted to detain them for an unlimited period. Now they have grudgingly wound that back to seven days. Detaining people is a police function, and that is not what this bill should be about. The opposition amendments ensure the bill is about intelligence gathering and questioning, not about detention.
The government uses the words `detention' and `detain' in many contexts, but it uses them primarily to justify detaining people after questioning has finished—that is, they are detained for some other purpose. We have chosen the word `custody' and used it sparingly to indicate the nature of the situation that a person is in when they are being questioned over a period of time. The only purpose of custody under the opposition's model—under these proposed opposition amendments—is for questioning. That is the crucial difference. The critical difference here is the purpose of the custody. The purpose is questioning, not detention. It is intelligence gathering, not detention.

"Reid, Sen Margaret",LP,2002-12-10,"—I speak briefly tonight to incorporate a press statement of the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Hon. Christopher Ellison, relating to the finalisation of a matter that had been taken against former senator Winston Crane and has now been concluded in accordance with the statement of Senator Ellison dated 13 November 2002. The matter had been going on for approximately four years. The Senate became involved with it particularly in relation to a judgment handed down by His Honour Mr Justice French in Crane v. Gething on 18 February 2000, as a result of which many documents were delivered to the Clerk of the Senate in paper and electronic form on 29 September 2000. The Senate, by resolution on 5 December 2000, appointed Mr Stephen Skehill SC to examine and report to the President as to which documents were classified as privileged and which were not. The order was varied by the Senate on 8 August 2001, and the report was made to the President and tabled on 27 August 2001 with Mr Skehill's conclusions. 
I do not wish to discuss the background of the case in detail, other than to comment on the fact that it took a very long time to resolve. There was some difference of opinion between Mr Crane and the commissioner of police as to why that was so. Mr Crane expressed the view that an administrative audit of his claims should have been held much earlier. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Keelty, was quoted in an article by Mr Mark Mallabone in the West Australian of 15 November 2002 as saying that it was claiming privilege which caused the matter to take longer than it might otherwise have done. The unfortunate thing about that article is the heading `Crane “to blame” for long travel rort probe'.
As the matter has been before the Senate by resolution and has been raised in estimates committees on several occasions, I thought it appropriate for the record to conclude with the statement of the Minister for Justice and Customs dated 13 November 2002, which ends, `Former Senator Crane has been cleared of any wrongdoing in this matter and it is now concluded.' I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
SENATOR CRANE INVESTIGATION FINALISED
The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, today announced that the Australian Federal Police had concluded its investigation into the alleged misuse of travel entitlements by former Senator Winston Crane.
Following its extensive inquiries into the matter the AFP forwarded a Brief of Evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP).
