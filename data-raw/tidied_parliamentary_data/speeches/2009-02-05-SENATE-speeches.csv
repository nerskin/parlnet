"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2009-02-05,"—by leave—At the request of Senator Ludwig, I move:
That, on Thursday, 5 February 2009:
the hours of meeting shall be 9.30 am to 6.30 pm and 7 pm to adjournment;
consideration of general business and consideration of committee reports, government responses and Auditor-General’s reports under standing order 62(1) and (2) shall not be proceeded with;
the routine of business from 12.45 pm till not later than 2 pm, and from not later than 4.30 pm shall be government business only;
divisions may take place after 4.30 pm;
the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed after the Senate has finally considered the bills listed below, including any messages from the House of Representatives:
Tax Bonus for Working Australians Bill 2009
Tax Bonus for Working Australians (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009
Household Stimulus Package Bill 2009
Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2009; and
if the Senate is sitting at midnight, the sitting of the Senate be suspended till 9 am on Friday, 6 February 2009.
I thank the Senate for its cooperation in bringing this debate on and not unduly delaying the Senate on procedural matters. In the government’s view there is an urgent need for action to stimulate the Australian economy. We have seen three times in recent months the International Monetary Fund revise down their projections for world growth and economic activity. Around the world, world leaders have agreed that governments need to take strong and decisive action to stimulate their economies and prevent the world falling into a deep recession. Projections are that this might be the most serious financial crisis confronting the world since the recession of the 1930s.
This is a very serious problem. I think some in Australia do not understand that because, quite frankly, the worst aspects of this have not yet hit us. They are only just starting to bite. Up until a few weeks ago I was much more optimistic, but then I saw redundancies starting to occur and the impact already being felt by Australian families. In my own state of Western Australia BHP closed the Ravensthorpe development, which threw hundreds of people out of work and basically destroyed the town, as they decided they could not continue with that mining activity.
These are serious issues for Australians but they are immediate issues. This is not some sort of academic debate about debt and macrofinancial issues, although those issues are also part of the debate. This is a debate about how many Australians will lose their jobs. That is what we are debating today. The revised economic forecast provided through Treasury indicates that unemployment will rise to seven per cent. I am sure that is of deep concern to all Australians and all members of the Senate. Based on Treasury advice, the government is saying that unless we act now those projections may be considered modest and we may actually see an even greater impact on the Australian economy.
It is clear that we need strong and decisive action now. The government would be remiss and failing in our duties if we did not act. So we have sought to act. We tried to get ahead of the curve with the economic package we brought in last December. Despite the commentary from those opposite, it did work. It had an affect that stimulated the economy, encouraged people to spend and encouraged people to support economic activity. That saw jobs saved and businesses maintained.
—How many jobs?
—The senator interjects: how many jobs? This is serious, Senator; this is dead serious. I expect you to take your responsibilities seriously. If you think that people in Australia are going to be sitting down today—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Comments should be addressed to the chair and there should be no interjections.
—The opposition wants to have some sort of arcane argument about whether the package created 45,000 jobs or 50,000 jobs. Australians know that there are deeply frightening economic times confronting them and that their jobs are at risk, their financial security is at risk and their small businesses are at risk. They want the government they elected to act. That is what we want to do. We are asking the Senate to respect the votes of the Australian people and allow the government to act.
What we have seen in recent days is a debate in this parliament as to process, as if we have got time to spend a lot of time arguing about how we might handle it. I am sure Australians who got up this morning and looked at what occurred in the House of Representatives last night would have been absolutely distressed to see what were hairy-chested arguments—arguments while Rome burns, if you like—about minutia when what we need is leadership. The government are trying to provide leadership. We are trying to get support across the board to provide an economic stimulus to protect jobs—
—You are so arrogant. It’s unbelievable.
—To protect jobs, Senator Macdonald. We actually think that is important. In order to give effect to the package, I met with Senate leaders and whips yesterday to try and get their support for a process that would allow the Senate to deal quickly with these bills, for two reasons. The first is to provide economic confidence in Australia, to provide certainty to Australians that we are going to implement the package and to provide confidence that there will be money flowing into the economy, that there will be money flowing to small business and that infrastructure projects will go ahead. Then businesses can plan on the basis of that stimulus package. I deliberately encouraged those Senate leaders to find the right balance between the absolute need for Senate scrutiny, which I support, and the need for the government to get its legislation passed—
—What a joke!
—Senator, you were not at the meeting, but ask Senator Minchin what I proposed. The government said we would meet Thursday and Friday to deal with those bills that contained immediate payments to families—to fast-track those bills—and we would take up the opposition’s very constructive suggestion to move estimates and meet next week to debate those bills that go to infrastructure and the more complex matters of policy. We took up that offer. We said we would sit Thursday night, Friday, Saturday—whatever it took. Why? We said that because we want to make sure that we do not miss the proposed dates to get those payments to families—to get that money into their hands—to support them and to support the economy. That is the only reason we sought to ask you to sit—to give up another day or so to stay here, debate and scrutinise those bills and to give us the chance to make sure we met the timetable to put that money into families’ hands, to provide the stimulus in March for the economy and to allow you the whole of next week to examine the legislation.
I also indicated that we would support a Senate inquiry, that we would make that happen as well, because that is not an unreasonable request. But we have to balance the need for scrutiny, the need for parliamentarians to examine the detail and be informed, with the urgency of the government to act. We have to find the balance. We offered that balance and the Liberal Party scoffed. Senator Coonan scoffed. They were not interested. They said: ‘We’ve got plenty of time. Don’t worry about families getting the money. It’ll all be okay.’ We do not accept that. We actually say it is urgent.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Constant interjection is disorderly. You will have a chance to participate in the debate as long as the debate continues.
—So tell us what—
—Senator Macdonald!
—The government says this is urgent. The reason we asked for those bills to be passed is concern—that is, serious concern and advice to us—that we might not be able to make the payment dates we have set. That is the advice I have received and that is the proposition I put to the Liberal Party and the minor parties. I said we would deal with the matters that are absolutely urgent. We will sit Thursday night, we will sit Friday and we will sit Saturday if you want to give certainty.
—What a joke! So what difference is two days going to make?
—Two days, Senator. I am prepared to stay for the two days. You want to go home for the weekend. You want to go to the beach.
—Order! Senator Evans, your comments should be directed to the chair.
—We want to do the work; you want to go home and have your weekend off. We actually say this is urgent. We actually say it is important. We say, ‘Let’s deal with what is important, let’s deal with what is urgent now and for the bills that are less urgent—while they have high priority and we absolutely need to get them through next week—let’s take up the offer and deal with those next week.’ We want to make sure the Senate gets the chance to scrutinise those bills—we are happy to cooperate—but, regarding the bills that relate to payments for families, we need them ASAP. We want you to deal with those bills. We have to get right the balance between scrutiny and the urgency of the situation.
I sought the cooperation of the coalition and I did not get it. I got scoffed at. They said: ‘It doesn’t matter. We’ve got plenty of time. Don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about trying to get payments to families to support the economy. Don’t worry about trying to allow small business the opportunity to survive. We don’t care about jobs. There’s not really a problem.’ We say there is a problem, we say there is urgency and we would like you to reconsider. In this debate we want you to come to a position which says: ‘We will allow the parliament to sit as long as it takes to pass the bills that are urgent. We will come back next week, we will have the Senate inquiry and we will deal with those more complex bills then.’ That is what we would like. We are happy to have the scrutiny, we are happy to give you the time, but we would also like you to work Friday and maybe Saturday.
—All right, let’s do it. Let’s have a full debate. You don’t want scrutiny.
—And if that is too much—
—Let’s do it. All right, that’s good.
—Well, you’re opposing it, Senator.
—Let’s do it and sit all next week.
—The motion is there—vote for it. Vote for it! But, no, you want a long weekend. You want the long weekend!

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Quite frankly, we think it is more important. We think you ought to be more constructive, Senator.

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Order! Withdraw that!
—What? That he’s dishonest? He is saying that I want a long weekend. That is dishonest.
—I have just asked you to withdraw that.
—But—
—Senator Macdonald, I am not going to argue. I have asked you to withdraw.
—Mr President, I withdraw. Can I seek leave to answer a representation made that I want a long weekend? That is clearly dishonest. I seek leave to respond to that dishonest accusation by the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
—Senator Macdonald, I have had to call you to order on a number of occasions. You are entitled to speak in the debate, as I have pointed out. I have asked you to withdraw a comment that is unparliamentary—
—Which I have done.
—which you have done. You still have the right to participate in the debate.
—And I have sought leave, Mr President.
—A speaker is in the process of speaking. You then have the right, as a member of the Senate, to participate in the debate and answer any claims or any matters that are raised in the debate. I would think that is the proper course of action for you to proceed down.
—In the meantime, Mr President, I have to put up with this joker saying something dishonest, that I want a long weekend.
—No, I am not saying that to you at all. I am saying that there is a proper course of action, in the process of this debate, to pursue through the chamber.
—Mr President, can I ask him to withdraw the accusation that I do not want to sit and I want a long weekend? Can I ask him to withdraw that imputation against me as a member of this Senate?
—Senator Macdonald, you will have your chance to participate in the debate, and I can now see that this is going to be a fairly lengthy debate. You will have your chance to participate in the debate as every other senator in this place will.
—Mr President, on a point of order: I ask that you ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to withdraw the imputation made not only against me personally but, by implication, against everyone on this side of the chamber. I ask that you ask him to withdraw.
—I did not take the comment that was made as being unparliamentary. I do not think that has been ruled so in the past. I think that is something that you can quite rightly correct in the debate itself.
—Mr President, on the point of order: it is traditional in this chamber that, if a member feels aggrieved about a comment made by another member, that member will withdraw it if the request has been made by a particular senator. There has not been any debate at all about whether it is fair, unfair, reasonable or unreasonable. Senator Macdonald has made a quite reasonable request to another senator in this chamber to withdraw a comment that he found to be a personal attack on him. If we are going to have a proper debate this morning, then surely appropriate rules should apply. Senator Macdonald feels aggrieved by the comment from Senator Evans and traditionally in this chamber that would be withdrawn.
—Mr President, on the point of order: I would not ordinarily engage on a point of order while a speaker is currently before you, but in this instance the contribution by the senator is wrong. The chair—not the opposition and not during the point of order—determines the point of order. The submission simply made just then is completely wrong. I would ask him to reflect upon what he said because it is wrong in terms of the procedures of this place.
—I have made it clear—and I do hear what you have said, Senator Ronaldson, and I have on other occasions intervened—that I do not believe that this is unparliamentary. I believe it is a debating point. I believe that if Senator Macdonald and others wish to correct the record, as they are entitled to, or change the record or give their view of the record then that can be done as part of the debating process. If I felt that it was in any way reflecting badly on an individual person’s propriety or integrity, then I would ask for that to be withdrawn. I do not believe that this has happened in this case.
I understand that the debate is going to be a fairly lively debate. I have worked that out already from the interjections from both sides and I understand that there will be robust debate in this place from time to time. But I will always apply fairness to both sides. I will not be partial in the way in which I treat either side. I will pull up the debate where there has been a transgression in the standards that have previously applied in this place. If I think that there is a direct reflection or imputation on the character of an individual in this place then, regardless of what side of politics they are on, I will defend them. I believe that if this debate is to proceed—and whilst there will be some fire in the belly, as I would call it, in the debate—I will expect people to not reflect badly on anyone in this chamber no matter what side they are on. I will ask Senator Evans to continue and those who want to participate in the debate can do so at the appropriate time.
—I think those listening to the debate will be appalled that that is the level of response we are getting from the opposition. We put a reasonable and balanced proposition, and it was scoffed at. We said we would sit as long as it took and allow as much scrutiny in the parliament—not in a committee but in the parliament—as was required to deal with those bills. We said we would sit Friday and Saturday to get those bills through so that we could meet the deadline to ensure those payments went out in March, as required. On the basis of our advice, the longer we wait the more risk there is to that. Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Human Services, will take you through what that means.
We put that in all fairness, we have been very open about it, and what we got was an opposition which said: ‘No, don’t worry about it. It can all wait. There’s no sense of urgency here. We can sit down; we can chat about it for weeks. There is no urgency.’ Well, those people getting redundancy notices have a different view. Those small businesses hanging on by the skin of their teeth have a different view. Those self-funded retirees who are waiting to see some certainty return to markets to protect their investments think it is urgent, think it is important and want the government to provide leadership. We would like the parliament to provide scrutiny but also allow the government to act—that is, allow the elected government to respond to a crisis. All we say is this. By all means have scrutiny, but do not delay to the point that you undermine the government’s capacity to act, undermine the government’s capacity to protect jobs—
—So two days is going to make a difference?
—Two days makes a lot of difference, Senator, if your job is at risk. If your job is at risk, it does make a lot of difference. If you look at the emails I am getting from small business, that is what they are saying. The opposition have taken a very political position on this. They have invested in the idea that the long-term argument about debt will work for them. What we say is this. Act responsibly and act as an alternative government. Do not get yourself into the sort of mess you got yourself into last year. Do not pretend you are a government waiting to return; act as an alternative government. Allow the government to get on and do its job.
I think when the Liberal Party take their weekend and go home and talk to some real people they will actually get a very different view of this. Go out—go down to the beach, go down to the cricket, go down to the parks—and talk to real people. Talk to real people who work in retail and who know the bonus that was paid last year saved their jobs. Talk to real people who think that the payment of the back-to-school bonus will actually help them make ends meet and help them continue to contribute to the economy. Talk to the small business people who know that the investment assistance will allow them to grow their business, maintain their business and provide jobs. Talk to real people. We often get isolated here, senators—we all do. We all go along to party meetings and convince ourselves how right we are. But go out and talk to real people. That is not their perspective. They want to know why the government is not acting.
I urge Senator Fielding—and I see he is in the chamber—to walk away from the deal he has done with Senator Minchin, to not be a patsy for the Liberal Party, to actually think about what he is doing. Senator Fielding claims to represent families and small business in this chamber. I ask him—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Is it appropriate for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to call the Leader of Family First a ‘patsy’?
—I said, ‘Don’t be a patsy.’ I did not mean to call him a patsy.
—There is no point of order.
—Mr President, rather than delay the Senate, I am happy to withdraw. My understanding of what I said was that I said, ‘Don’t be a patsy.’ Anyway, the record will correct that. The point I want to make is this. What we saw last year is that the Liberal Party on the infrastructure—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I wonder whether the Leader of the Government in the Senate could repeat what he said and then withdraw, so I can hear it to my face.
—Senator Fielding, whatever was said was withdrawn. It is expunged, Senator Fielding, as I understand it.
—Senator Fielding, as I indicated, I said, ‘Don’t be a patsy for the Liberal Party.’ There was an objection raised and I withdrew it. You were closer to me then than you are now, but I understand you were distracted. The point I make to the Senate chamber is that I urge Senator Fielding not to support the motion he has put and to actually allow the government to pay families the payments we want to pay them. You claim to represent families, but what you are doing is stopping us making those payments. You are putting at risk those payments. All I ask is that the Parliament of Australia deal with those bills over the next few days. You can have the examination, you can have the debate, but allow us to get those bills.
The irony of this whole debate is that the Liberal Party and the National Party say, ‘We want scrutiny, we want to examine these bills, but we are going to vote against them anyway.’ An uninformed observer might say: ‘What’s the point if they are going to vote against them anyway? What’s their position?’ Their position is firmly decided—that is, ‘Whatever the arguments, whatever the evidence, we are going to vote no, but it is really important that we delay for nine days.’ They want to delay the investment in the economy.
—It’s nine days now.
—Well, all you are offering to do is pass them by next Thursday. Sorry; you are offering to defeat them by next Thursday! Your position is: ‘We need to delay till next Thursday to give us a chance to examine the reasons why we are going to try and defeat it.’
I say to the Senate and particularly to Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding: look in their eyes. When they urge you in this debate to vote down the bills, remember last December when they ran out for a cup of tea and hid. When the pressure comes on, you will see fear in their eyes. They do not want you to vote down the package. Trust me. They do not want you to vote down the package. Their strategy is to vote no, to be all care and responsibility. But when it comes to the vote, Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon, if you walk across to join them, they will wet themselves. They will have fear in their eyes. They do not want you to vote the package down. They want to delay; they want to make a political point that they think will serve them in the long term. But if you, Senator Xenophon, or you, Senator Fielding, say you are going to vote for them you will be fascinated by the response. They have taken the position that they are all care and no responsibility—that they can safely say they are going to vote against it in the knowledge that Senator Fielding, Senator Xenophon and the Greens will not do that at the end. It will be interesting to see whether or not, just before the vote, when we eventually get to it, the Liberal and National parties really want you to vote for them. I suggest to you that they are dead scared you might. If you do, you might find Senator Minchin out for a cup of tea and a few of his friends stuck in the toilet, because the last thing they want to do is defeat this package.
This is about vandalism. This is about delaying our responsible plan to assist the economy. But they do not really want it beaten. This is a political point-scoring exercise. I urge the Senate to support the government’s proposition for a change to sitting hours. It will allow the right balance between scrutiny and passage of bills that provide the economic stimulus the country needs. It will ensure we are able to make the payments we want to make to families and that we are able to put in their hands the money that will allow spending and consumption to support jobs. We do not want that put at risk. We are happy for a Senate inquiry, we are happy to take up the option of sitting next week to deal with the other bills. However, I urge you in this debate to think about the bigger picture, to think about what nine days of continued uncertainty will mean for business confidence and about the threat to jobs and the economy if the government’s package is held up and maybe not passed. I urge you to follow a more sensible, balanced view, to support our procedural motion and to give some certainty— (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-02-05,"—That was an extraordinary diatribe from Senator Evans. He put before the Senate a very unconvincing case in relation to changing the sitting hours. It is important that we make very clear here that the coalition does not support the government’s arrogant supposition that the Senate will simply roll over and rubber-stamp a $42 billion spend of taxpayers’ funds virtually sight unseen. That is effectively what we are being asked to do in Senator Evans’s motion. Because of all of the fuss about this, people forget that it has been less than 48 hours since we first heard of this massive cash splash. It is quite extraordinary. The government must have had some notion that they were going to be bringing forward this package. Why was it only announced 48 hours ago? And, at the time it was announced, we were being urged to pass it without even looking critically at what it provided.
One reason why the government fear scrutiny of this package is they do not really know that it will do the job that they contend it will. They do not really know that this will work. In fact, the Prime Minister has said that he cannot guarantee that it will work. I think they fear the quality of what is in this package and they do not want it scrutinised.
We are effectively expected to approve $1 billion in spending for each hour since the bills were introduced. That is what it would amount to. And for those listening to the debate in the Senate, as Senator Evans seems to think people are, just contemplate the fact that we are expected to approve $1 billion in spending for each hour since the bills were introduced to meet this artificial deadline the government set for themselves without any consideration or hesitation. If this was so urgent, one would have thought that before agreeing to a particular date they would have at least considered how they would deal with the proper procedures of the Senate. They might have actually deigned to consult us. But that certainly is not part of Labor’s behaviour pattern. This is a deadline that, quite frankly, screams panic. The government are in panic mode and they have rushed these bills into the parliament with unrealistic time frames for their consideration. I think it really underscores Labor’s contempt for the Senate. It is stark in this respect. They do not want these measures scrutinised; they simply want them passed.
Something was not immediately clear until we eventually got the bills. Included in the bills is a very slim document. It is a bill of two pages, I think, for the borrowing of up to $200 billion. We are expected to blindly approve it. This exhumes the ghost of Rex Connor. This exhumes the ghost of the Khemlani incident of so many years ago. They want us to pass, without any scrutiny whatsoever, a package that will saddle current and future generations of Australians with a crippling debt equivalent to $9,500 for every Australian. The government have simply failed to explain how a couple of extra days, literally, would in fact defeat the objectives of this package. If the Senate does what we have suggested, all it would amount to would be a couple of days delay, and that is not going to be critical. The government have not made the case for why that will be critical, except that they have to crank up the computers at Centrelink and at the tax office. Who is Senator Evans seriously kidding? We have been on the other side of the chamber—we have been in government—and we know the kinds of programs and the kinds of constraints on introducing this kind of package. It is highly unlikely—unless we can be convinced to the contrary, and we cannot—that two days is going to make any critical difference.
In a responsible way, because that is the way we are approaching scrutiny of this package, we have suggested that it is important that we scrutinise these bills and that we scrutinise them as a package. The government have simply failed to explain how a few extra days would in fact impact on it. For example, they have failed to provide the sorts of things that we will want to look at. They have failed to provide any information to back up their claims that this massive level of expenditure will support 90,000 jobs. The splash of cash before Christmas was supposed to create 75,000 jobs—we know that that has not happened; we know that that did not do the job—and now we have heard a few weasel words about how this package will support up to 90,000 jobs. What on earth does that mean? Does it mean 90,000 jobs? Does it mean 50,000 jobs? Or is it simply a stab in the dark? We know that the earlier figure of 75,000 jobs was. We know that there is a massive looming problem with unemployment in this country and we know that before June there will be another 100,000 jobs lost.
The people of Australia deserve a parliament that will hold the government to account for this package. They have simply so far not established the case for it supporting jobs in the order to which they contend. We deserve to see the information to support the claims about this package and any modelling—if they have any—that underpins it. It really comes down to this: you really cannot trust the Labor Party. They have consistently shown us in this term of government that they are very light on detail. They do not have any long-term structural plan for the country. There is certainly no legitimate economic analysis underpinning their budget or other proposals. Just look, for example, at the continuing mess that has resulted from the unlimited guarantee on deposit-taking institutions in this country. There may be more than 250,000 Australians whose funds are frozen because they have their deposits in institutions not covered by the unlimited guarantee. This is an example of a panicked response which was not really thought through. The government has since been fixing it up all the way.
We certainly do not want to see this sort of problem with a package of this magnitude. It has a lot of components in it that need to be properly looked at. Senator Evans suggested that we had scoffed at this. That is certainly not the case. We have cooperated and we intend to cooperate further to scrutinise this package. We have indicated that we will cooperate with the government to get this package of bills through the parliament next week. That is a very clear statement that we are cooperating in the scrutiny of this package, and it should be brought to a vote by the end of next week. In fact, we came forward and suggested deferring estimates next week to allow the Senate to sit to pass this economic package. That was a responsible course. It is one that seems to have found favour with colleagues in the Senate and with the Labor Party. We think that is a very sensible way to ensure that the urgency contended for this package is addressed and that we can get on with examining it.
We simply cannot accept the demands of the government that we consider just part of the package so soon after its introduction. If this were so important, it could have been looked at perhaps even before parliament came back. But there were a couple of days of extraordinary drama and media performances from the Prime Minister and his economic team. Suddenly, the package was presented and then we were told part of it had to be passed practically yesterday morning. That is not really the way we act, unless a convincing case can be made for the need to separate the package. We believe that there should be at least a minimum level of scrutiny applied to the package and that it must be taken as a whole. It simply makes no sense. If the government has introduced it as a package, it has to be looked at as a package. Their economic story, which we think is incoherent anyway, stands only if it is part of a package. That is why we are proposing that, starting this evening, a Senate committee begin questioning officials about the detail of this package. There needs to be some forensic examination of what has gone into this package, how it is composed and what is contended for it. What are the projections and what is the modelling? If the Senate did not do that, it would simply be derelict in its duty.
Of course, we will cooperate today, as we have done so often this year, to meet the government in the full flight of panic mode by giving up opposition business time this afternoon. We will also cooperate next week to ensure that the package of bills is considered in the time frame that we have proposed. We believe that the bills must be considered as a package and that there should be an opportunity for examination through what will be a brief committee inquiry. When you look at the magnitude of this package, in normal circumstances you would have a much more detailed committee process. Various committees would be involved. We think that we have come forward with a proposal for the consideration of the package in a committee process that will enable the various strands of the package to be looked at.
Labor really must respect the role of the Senate as a house of scrutiny. It is all too easy as a government to simply try to roll right over the top of the Senate, but there is not much point in us being here if we do not do our job and hold the government to account. We will not be so irresponsible as to approve $42 billion worth of spending without a basic level of scrutiny. The government should not be so arrogant as to ask. We will not be supporting the motion put forward by Senator Evans.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-02-05,"—There are, even now, ongoing negotiations among the non-government benches to come to some form of agreement on how we progress with this monumentally important package of legislation from the government. We the Greens take it extremely seriously. We do not like the fact that such a massive amount of money has to be dealt with in such a short period of time. We do not agree with the government that these five bills, which involve $42 billion—ultimately of taxpayers’ money—should be dealt with in this place today or even tomorrow. Therefore, we are in agreement with the opposition that the Senate should fulfil its role as watchdog of the people and extend the period of review of this legislation to next Thursday—a week from today. That will involve some very serious scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We are also looking to have at least the housing component looked at by a committee to see what the public input on that huge outlay can be and to see if there are improvements or alterations that can be made.
We recognise the urgency. The government has a real point there. We want to see a finite end to this process and have flagged midnight next Thursday for an assured passage of the legislation through the Senate so that we can all have a target to work to—and hopefully raise the quality of the debate—because, through a gentleperson’s agreement, we know that that is the target. Under the prescription that is now reaching some finality on the non-government benches there would be speeches in the second reading debate today and Monday, but the Senate scrutiny—the inquiry by the committees—would take place tonight and tomorrow and extend into Monday. That would mean that by the time we get to the committee stage of looking at these packages, from Tuesday through to Thursday evening, we will be informed by that committee scrutiny of this legislation.
I just want to point out that at the doors this morning I held up the bill and pointed to what appeared, and what we were told by government yesterday, was a typo involving $2 billion. After further pressure to find out exactly what was going on there it appeared that it was not a typo at all; it is just an apparent discrepancy between what is in the bill and what is in the information being provided to senators. It is a clear example of the sorts of things that we need to clear up. We are dealing with big money here, and that money does not come out of thin air; it eventually comes out of the pockets of Australians.
I think the government may be concerned that it will face the blowtorch, as well as scrutiny, on occasion in the coming days but that is how it is meant to be. The Senate has a role, which comes to the fore at moments like this, for the nation. We are in extreme financial circumstances where we are skidding towards a recession. There is a global recession afoot and therefore it is incumbent on government to deal with that and on the Senate to make sure that in these circumstances the government gets the scrutiny the public requires of us.
I will be adding the Greens’ support to this amended motion coming from the government and Senator Fielding. It is a good outcome. It has required negotiations around the chamber, and it is an example of the Senate coming to the best possible configuration for scrutinising these bills, given the circumstances.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-02-05,"—These are serious and urgent times. The global financial crisis is very serious, and most Australians are fearful about its effect on their households and their families. Job security is at the forefront of nearly everybody’s mind. The government has the right to put forward a stimulus package. It is responsible and right for the government of the day to assess the economic climate and respond, but equally I think most Australians would find it prudent that before we go and spend $42 billion we have a look at it. The government should not wait months and years to respond but to wake up one morning and say, ‘We’re going to spend $42 billion and we want it passed the very next day,’ is negligent. It is absolutely negligent, and most Australians see through it.
We should take the politics out of this and put it in terms that we can all think about. If you are going to buy a $42 billion house do you stand outside and say: ‘That’s it. It looks good; I’m going to buy it’? I don’t think so. If you were going to throw the nation into debt—throw our future kids into debt—would you stand outside and say: ‘Listen, we’ve got it right. No-one else can comment on it. No other experts can have their say publicly,’ and just buy the house? No. When you buy a substantial house you get experts to come and have a look at it. You ask: ‘Is it sound? Is it fit and proper for my family—for Australian families?’ It really is an insult to all Australians for us to treat them in that way.
By all means the government of the day should put forward a stimulus package. We need one. Family First will vote for one. But the government is spending $42 billion and it would have you believe that no-one should have a say on it. That is an absolute joke. So Family First has put forward a proposal and I am glad that common sense will prevail. We have been able to get all the non-government parties to agree to an inquiry into that whole package. That allows the Senate to have a decent, informed debate about it and to have experts other than the government’s experts look at it.
This is absolutely serious. These are times that are very tough. There is no silver bullet. I have heard that before. I think we all agree with that, but if the government are going to fire their final bullet, surely we should make sure that it is not a rubber bullet that may bounce back and hit us all so that we lose more jobs. Family First is not saying we should not go into deficit. I think it is repulsive to think that we would say that we should not go into deficit when we have hundreds of thousands of fellow Australians who could fall off the cliff. We should be investing money to try and avert that situation. We should be aspiring to have a recession-breaking stimulus package, but there is no silver bullet. Nor do we want a rubber bullet that comes back and hits all of us.
I also do not think that we should be saying that Canberra or parliament should have their pockets full of money or not go into debt while we see fellow Australians fall off the cliff. I am not one to do that. I think that we should put our hand out. It is pity that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition cannot come together in a way that unites the nation on this issue. This is not about politics; this is about real Australians who are doing it really tough and who are fearful. I have been unemployed. It is a terrible place to be. We need to do all that we can for others.
We should put aside the politics, look at this package with other experts and make sure that the components of this package are the best ways for the money to be spent. Will we be ever sure? Maybe not. But what is wrong with including other experts to have a look at it? What is wrong with having others say, ‘We think the money should be spent here’? What about others in the community who think that they are missing out with this package? Why shouldn’t they have their say? But no, the Rudd government says: ‘Listen, this is it. Take it or leave it.’ The Senate is doing what it was elected to do, which was to prudently look at things. It is urgent. We have put off Senate estimates next week and we will have an inquiry to allow other experts to have their say. That is the proper and prudent thing to do.
Senator Evans said that we need strong and decisive action. I agree. He left one word out: we need strong, decisive and prudent action. He left that out. Why did he leave that out? I am not sure why. If Australians took his speech and replayed it, they would see that he used words like ‘patsy’. What a joke. What an insult to Australian families. We should take his speech and publish it in the papers—the whole lot. Let them judge whether the Labor Party’s view on this is right.
Surely they should be supporting a short inquiry—a couple of days—into spending $42 billion. And they are laughing at us. They are laughing at Australia. It is an insult. I cannot believe that they are even credible coming forward with this and manoeuvring last night to try and pin it back and pull it back. They have presented the whole thing as a package. Let us look at it in an inquiry as a package. So as to satisfy the crossbenches, we will have an additional committee look at the housing package. But that is in addition. We need to look at this package in its entirety. We owe it to Australians and to our kids’ kids. If we are going into debt, let us get it right.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-02-05,"—There has been a lot more heat than light shed in parts of this debate. I have never heard in any parliament that I have been in in the last 11 years anyone talking about a mass outbreak of incontinence. I do not know if that is a useful addition to the debate in terms of what Senator Evans put to us. Senator Fielding is right. Suggesting that someone may be a patsy simply because they have agreed to a process for the scrutiny of these bills is not helpful either. With respect to Senator Coonan—and I do have great regard for her—I do not know if the ghosts of Rex Connor and Tirath Khemlani are too relevant to this debate either. That was a significantly different set of circumstances.
The Senate should do its job. That is why I have been pleased to co-sign a motion with Family First, the Australian Greens and the opposition—the coalition—to ensure that these bills undergo appropriate due process. It is extraordinary for the government to expect that these bills be passed in a period of a matter of hours after a marathon session of the House of Representatives. That is not what Australians expect the Senate to do. Given that something like half a million Australians voted differently between the lower house and the upper house because they wanted that level of scrutiny and that level of accountability, we need to do what Australians want us to do. This is about scrutiny and about being a watchdog and about not being a rubber stamp.
I will not speculate on the merits or otherwise of this package. We ought to have due process to look at it. We will have a short but comprehensive inquiry into what this package will mean for Australians. We will hear from Treasury about what modelling has been done in relation to this package. We will consider the implications of this package and the implications of the debt that will follow, along with the implications of taking any action now, given the worsening global financial crisis.
I also think it sensible that we have a process that looks at the issue of housing separately. I agree with Senator Bob Brown that that is a sensible approach. It is also appropriate that there be a deadline of midnight next Thursday so that these matters are dealt with by that time. This is a very significant piece of legislation. We are in dire times. It is important that we in the Senate do our job.
I will say one more thing in relation to the government saying that it is so urgent that we should deal with the bills relating to household assistance because otherwise Centrelink will not be able to cope with making the payments in time. I have not seen the evidence from the government that chaos would ensue. We are talking about considering this legislation appropriately and properly over the next few days, not about two, three or four weeks. We just need some time to do our job. I have yet to see any firm evidence from the departments that not passing this legislation this week, but rather dealing with this legislation next week, will have dire consequences.
That is why I am very pleased to be a co-signer to a motion by all non-government senators to show that there is unanimity at least on the issue of due process and giving this issue the appropriate scrutiny which it deserves.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-02-05,"—This morning, we moved a motion that set out a timely plan for the Senate to handle the legislation that will deliver the Rudd Labor government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This plan contains three packages, together worth $42 billion. It is the government taking decisive pre-emptive action to support the Australian economy. The need for this action cannot be underestimated. The global financial crisis is an unprecedented threat to the world economy, something not seen since the Great Depression. I do not think that the opposition quite understand the seriousness of the position that we are now in.
Australia is a trading nation. It lives and dies by exporting goods and services. Have a look at our top two-way trading partners: China, rate of growth almost halved; Japan, in recession; the United States, in recession; Singapore, in recession; the United Kingdom, in recession; South Korea, in recession; New Zealand, in recession; Thailand, probably technically in recession, as stated by its Prime Minister last week; Germany, in recession; and the rest of the Eurozone, in recession.
The time to act is now. We must do whatever we can to save this country from going down the same path as our trading nations. To do any less than that would sell us out, quite frankly. The Australian people expect the government to respond to this crisis and protect the Australian economy for the benefit of all Australians. The government have taken advice on what must be done and we have set out what must be done clearly and succinctly. If you understand the seriousness of the economic circumstances we find ourselves in, I ask you to support the package. It is a sensible position to adopt.
Mr Turnbull and the Liberal Party are using their numbers in this Senate to hold this country hostage. Mr Turnbull says he is prepared, effectively, to destroy and wreck the plan. As yet, he has no plan of his own. Mr Turnbull and the Liberal Party have chosen to risk the jobs, homes and businesses of thousands of Australians.
Let us be clear about this. I do not impugn the motives of Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and the Greens in seeking to scrutinise this package. But it is plainly ludicrous for the Liberals to claim that they are seeking to scrutinise what they have already rejected. This is a complete furphy. If you have already made up your mind to reject the package, if you have already determined you are going to reject it even before you have had a look at it, why waste time pretending to want to scrutinise it? The Liberal Party do not really want scrutiny; all they want to do is to attack, harp, whinge and whine.
But just what is the Liberal Party rejecting? The household stimulus package, which enables one-off cash payments of $950 to eligible people. These people are drought-affected farmers, families and those in education and training. The Tax Bonus for Working Australians Bill provides for a tax bonus payment of up to $950 to eligible Australian taxpayers. These payments are for self-funded retirees, part-pensioners and the vast majority of working people. That is what they are putting at risk. The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill provides for an increase in the cap where special circumstances exist.
The two appropriation, nation-building and jobs bills provide for about two-thirds of the funding for the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. These appropriation bills provide funding to support jobs and set Australia up for a low-carbon future. The Rudd government is also installing free ceiling insulation in around 2.7 million Australian homes. The investment will support the jobs of tradespersons and workers employed in the manufacturing, distribution and installation of ceiling insulation during a severe global recession. This historic nation-building investment by the Rudd government not only will support jobs but is a down payment on the long-term strength of the Australian economy. Do not underestimate what the ESS payment and this payment will provide to support the economy.
By improving the quality of education received by every Australian child, this program will help deliver the stimulus today and underwrite higher productivity tomorrow. Despite the extraordinary adverse conditions in the global economy, despite the impact of this on the Australian economy, we know the opposition are opposing these bills. They have announced that they are opposing them, yet in the Senate they plan to refer the bills to a committee. Quite frankly, what is this about? Why don’t you cut to the chase if that is your position? You already know that you are opposing the bills. You have announced it. Clearly the committee hearings can only be a delaying action. You cannot be serious about looking at the content of the legislation at all. We have already said that that relating to payments can be dealt with, if you want to have scrutiny in relation to the remaining package, next week. That was a sensible position that was put forward. It should have been adopted.
I must emphasise that without urgent passage of these bills the Senate is putting the timely delivery of these payments in jeopardy. If the payments to be made through the tax system are to begin to be delivered in April, work in the ATO must start as soon as possible and the bills must be passed this week. If the payments are also to be made through Centrelink and delivered in March, work in Centrelink must start as soon as possible and the bills must be passed this week. Treasury advise that the prompt passage of the legislation is needed so the approval and ministerial processes which involve other levels of government can be established and the measures begin as soon as possible.
Families are doing it tough. Australia is on the precipice of rising unemployment and kids are sweltering in classrooms because they have no air-conditioning. These are the types of things that this package can provide support and assistance for. Instead, the coalition want to delay. The coalition are putting the payments schedule at great risk. Centrelink do a superb job, let me say, and I congratulate them for the work that they did in delivering the ESS payment. We have now asked them to continue that superb work and look at how they can then work through the next package, the $42 billion package, part of which they are responsible for delivering on behalf of the government. I thank the Centrelink staff for their efforts and a job well done, but I now have to ask them to rise up and start the work for the next strategy.
The strategy payments will support demand in the economy. The new package will do even more to meet the global recession as it continues. It will devastate retailers and jobs around the world. It will do wholesale damage to economies around the world, as we have seen. This government is trying to, as quickly as possible, insulate us from that.
When you look at Centrelink and the work that it has to do, its computer infrastructure is not like some electric motor you can stop and start at will. It is a massive payment engine that takes 16 hours to wind up and another 16 hours to load up. These are some of the payments that it has to crunch through: the $950 single income family bonus to about 1.5 million families and the $950 back-to-school bonus to support 2.8 million children. There are a range of payments that it has to make. They will start going into Australian bank accounts in the fortnight beginning 11 March, provided we can pass this legislation this week. That is if there are no hiccups. That is if there are no delays. That is if there is no spanner in the works from the coalition. If they choose to delay, choose to create problems with that system, then what we will be faced with is uncertainty. There will be no certainty that we will be able to make those payments at that time.
I note that the opposition members in the chamber have carped about wanting scrutiny. There is the ability to use this week in the chamber to undertake that process. From the opposition, in fact, all we get is scepticism—first on climate change and now on the global financial crisis. It really is a matter that they are not taking seriously, quite frankly.
—I hope you are not going to do a second reading speech as well.
—I said I would provide the sum-up from the government’s perspective. I will not take the full time. What the opposition have failed to appreciate is the urgent need to pass these bills this week to ensure that both Centrelink and the ATO can start those payment engines and to ensure that we get the payments delivered on time into people’s accounts so that they can be provided with those bonuses. Any hiccup or delay to that will necessarily put more stress and strain on the system. If these things occur, be it on the Liberals’ heads. The sooner we make the payments, the better. We need to provide the stimulus as soon as possible. We need to pass this motion so that we can consider this package of bills today. With that, I thank the Senate.
—There being no more speakers, I will outline, just briefly, the process which will be followed. I will be dealing with, firstly, government business notice of motion No. 2, which is standing in the name of Senator Ludwig. I will be putting that motion. Having dealt with that motion, if it happens to be defeated—and that may well be the case—I will deal with business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3. I understand that Senator Fielding will seek leave to move it in an amended form. If that motion happens to be successful then my advice is that government business notices of motion Nos 1 and 3 will lapse. They will not proceed. Is there anyone who is not clear as to what will happen? The question is that government business notice of motion No. 2 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-02-05,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill this morning prior to the rest of the debate. I will confine my comments to enable that debate to proceed as quickly as possible. The coalition supports the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2008 [2009]. It basically comes out of recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in, I think, 2001. The government of the day had some minor concerns and these have been addressed and are reflected in the current bill. We obviously support the role of the Auditor-General. It is extremely important in the context of proper scrutiny of the activities of government. This bill will enable that scrutiny to be further enhanced. I note that there was, in Audit Report No. 19, released by the Auditor-General yesterday, scrutiny of the CMAX Communications contract for the 2020 Summit and the activities of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If you look at that report, it indeed reflects the importance of the role of the Auditor-General and the requirement that we provide the Auditor-General with the requisite powers to address government and government activities. I also note with interest that the spin of the government last night in relation to this report on CMAX Communications and the activities of the staff of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, involving a senior member of Minister Fitzgibbon’s office, was that this report cleared those activities. As honourable senators know—


Senator Mark Bishop interjecting—

—I suspect you protesteth too much, my friend, because I have been talking about this for only about 10 seconds and you are already starting to plead the case. I will make the suggestion to Senator Bishop, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, as much as I do like him and respect him, perhaps he should read the report first and then give some commentary on it. When I am finished I am happy to send it over so he can flick through it. For his benefit I have highlighted some parts of the report so that he can refer to them as well, which I think is in the nature of the spirit of cooperation of this chamber.
The interesting part is that the spin was that there was no undue influence coming out of the Prime Minister’s office in relation to the awarding of a non-tendered contract for the 2020 Summit to a company owned at the time by a senior member of the office of the Minister for Defence, Mr Fitzgibbon. For those who might not have been following this, and it is hard to believe that anyone would not have followed this appalling act of a lack of transparency—so for those who might not have, those who have been away for some time; for about 12 months they would have had to have been if they had missed this—the Minister for Defence’s senior media adviser owned a company called CMAX Communications and CMAX Communications was providing work to the Australian government. So you have a senior member of a senior minister’s office running a company that was taking contracts and taking taxpayers’ funds at the same time as he was operating his job.
This is again for those who have been away for 12 months and are not aware of this appalling lack of transparency. How did CMAX Communications get the job? Through a tender process? No. Through an open tender process? No. Indeed, Prime Minister and Cabinet were recommended to use CMAX Communications by a senior adviser in the Prime Minister’s office. The government put out their spin yesterday about there being no undue pressure. Well, what is the definition of ‘undue pressure’? The senior adviser in charge of the 2020 Summit brings in Prime Minister and Cabinet and says, ‘You might like to consider CMAX Communications for the media role in the 2020 Summit.’ Take the mere fact that that company was recommended, given the relationships between the senior advisers in the Prime Minister’s office and the senior adviser in the Minister for Defence’s office. That mere recommendation was itself undue pressure. So you have got PM&C coming in and you have got the senior adviser saying, ‘Oh, you might like to consider CMAX Communications for this job.’ So what? Does PM&C go away and say, ‘Oh, well, no; we’re not prepared to accept that’—particularly when the senior adviser has probably said, ‘You know the urgency of this contract, don’t you?’ So how do you think PM&C might have responded to that? I might be terribly wrong but I just reckon they might have taken that as a very non-negotiable, subtle hint that CMAX Communications perhaps should get that contract. As further evidence of that, I will turn to page 14 of the report and I will read out paragraph 17:
The basis on which the PM&C delegate made the decision that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money was not clear from the departmental record that had been made. In particular, PM&C’s documentation did not accurately record the way in which CMAX Communications was identified to it as a possible provider, or the inquiries it undertook to satisfy itself that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money.
Well, Senator Bishop, game, set and match, my friend, because the departmental records did not in any way refer to that, because the departmental records could not refer to that without giving the game away as to who made the recommendation. Of course the records were not there because they were not prepared to put in writing where the recommendation came from. So not only have you—the government and the Prime Minister’s office in particular—compromised due process and compromised transparency; you have also compromised Prime Minister and Cabinet, the very body that should be providing free and uninhibited advice to the Prime Minister’s office. In the way that you have handled this, you have effectively nobbled them and compromised them severely. For that you should accept great responsibility and you should acknowledge blame.
I give the government due credit for their spin last night in relation to this. It was a masterful piece of political spin from a government that has just about got this 24-hour spin cycle down pat. I will give them their due credit: they are very good at spinning. In fact, I think this government are the masters of spin. They are indeed the masters of spin. But what we did find out from the Auditor-General’s report, which we could not find out from a couple of Senate estimates hearings and a number of other hearings, was this. We finally got confirmation that the recommendation for CMAX Communications was from the senior adviser. Why all the prevarication? Why go through two lots of Senate estimates? Why were you hiding that fact? I will tell you why the Labor Party were hiding it: they knew it did not pass the sniff test. This did not pass the political sniff test. It is another example of the gross arrogance of this government that you thought you could get away with it. You thought you could give a contract to a Labor mate and get away with it. It does not pass the sniff test and you have been caught out. It does not matter what spin you put on this; it just does not look right and you should acknowledge that.
The report went on to refer to a report to this marvellously independent group—the height of independence, the height of transparency!—affectionately known as the Government Staffing Committee! Of course, the Government Staffing Committee is made up of senior cabinet ministers. They were looking into the activities of a senior employee of another one of their fellow cabinet ministers. I am sure that the public would believe they were certainly going to have an open and transparent view of that! What they said was:
... that there was no evidence found of any involvement on the Defence Minister’s Adviser’s part of any influence exerted by him ...
That was never the issue. The Government Staffing Committee was looking at an issue that was not there because the Government Staffing Committee did not want to look at the real issue. What a lot of nonsense. This was never the allegation. The activities of the senior adviser in the Minister for Defence’s office was never the cause for concern. That was not the issue. The issue was the level of influence out of the Prime Minister’s office from a senior adviser giving taxpayers’ money to a government mate, to a personal mate, to the employee of a cabinet minister. That was the issue; it was nothing to do with what Mr Taubenschlag was or was not doing. But we got a rare admission, which I presume was pulled from them kicking and screaming. Even this outrageous group, the Government Staffing Committee, who should never, ever have been looking at this matter, actually noted in the report:
... that there was the possibility of an appearance of conflict of interest ...
There most certainly was. What a gross understatement. Indeed, evidence taken under oath by ANAO supported those conclusions.
There are a number of other matters in here which I think are cause for concern. What we found from this report was not the spin the government put on. If you look behind the report you can see what really happened on this occasion. There were, as the ANAO observed—and I refer to the report:
... a number of shortcomings with PM&C’s contract management. In particular, the contract document did not specify the name of the individual that was to deliver the contract services; and the total amount paid to CMAX Communications ($56 358 plus GST) exceeded the maximum amount specified in the contract ($52 000 plus GST),—
I can see Senator Bishop looking at me and I will get this across so he can have a look at it himself—
and there is no evidence that this issue was identified by PM&C prior to the payment being made.
So we have this cloak of secrecy surrounding the CMAX Communications contract. The government will say: ‘Oh, look, it’s only $60,000. What’s all the fuss about over $60,000?’ I don’t think it matters whether it is $6 or $6 million, quite frankly. It is the principle of this issue which is at stake. Do not think that the Auditor-General’s report in any way clears the government. I am glad that the Special Minister of State has now come in; his staff have obviously alerted him to the debate and I am pleased to see him.
If you look at the principle of this, it is not about $6 or $6 million; it is actually about the appropriateness or otherwise of a senior adviser in the Prime Minister’s office recommending one person only to Prime Minister and Cabinet for a $60,000 effective contract. That is why, as I said earlier on, this report does not exonerate the government. This does not exonerate the activities of the Government Staffing Committee. It does not exonerate the people involved in this. What it does show quite clearly is that the openness and transparency upon which this government said it would act if elected is not there. It is not there. This was not open; it was not transparent. That has been shown by the Auditor-General’s report, despite the marvellous spin of the government last night in relation to this. The Labor Party has compromised Prime Minister and Cabinet and has completely compromised the principles upon which it was allegedly elected.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-02-05,"—Part way through his contribution, Senator Ronaldson said words to the effect of ‘no matter what the spin, it does not look right’. Sometimes if you look a little bit harder and read the actual language in the report, things become manifestly clear. In terms of the contribution just made and the CMAX report tabled late yesterday or early this morning, one just needs to make a few succinct comments. There were two critical findings. Firstly, there was no undue influence by the Prime Minister’s office—that is, there was no improper behaviour and a clean bill of health in terms of process and conduct. Secondly, the costs of the contract were appropriate and compared appropriately to like contracts. The cost of the contract, coming under $80,000, did not require the contract to be let out to public tender. The only recommendation by the ANAO went to what can properly be categorised as minor matters relating to file maintenance and record keeping. So in respect of all of the persons involved in this alleged affair, none have been found at fault and all have been cleared.
Let us now turn to the substance of the bill before the chamber, and I speak in support of the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2008 [2009]. I want to address four key areas in respect of this bill: firstly, the background to the bill; secondly, the development of the ANAO; thirdly, oversight functions of the ANAO in the procurement processes within the Defence Materiel Organisation; and, finally, government initiatives that will enhance oversight and risk management within the Defence Materiel Organisation, or the DMO.
Firstly, the amendments in this bill stem from a review by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit back in 2001. They are technical in nature and received bipartisan support in that particular report. As a result, the amendments are not controversial. Madam Acting Deputy President, with your indulgence, I would like to briefly reflect on how we have arrived at this point. The Auditor-General Act 1997 has a history of bipartisan support. The act had its genesis in the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. It is true to say that the office of Auditor-General was re-established as a result of direct and lengthy deliberations and considerations by the JCPAA. Between 1989 and 1996, the JCPAA produced three substantial reports into the role and modernisation of the office of Auditor-General. The committee looked specifically at how the functions of the Auditor-General could be improved. The main criteria was to provide functional independence for the committee’s and the organisation’s deliberations from executive government. The Keating government, back in 1993-94, endorsed the work of the JCPAA, and a bill was introduced in 1994 which gave effect to this work. Regrettably, that bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued ahead of the 1996 election and it fell to the incoming government to pick up the bat. That leads me back to the present and the bill before the chair today.
The aim of this bill is to improve oversight and accountability in governance while continuing to maintain procedural fairness. To that end, the bill will, firstly, provide clarification of the distribution of performance audit reports, and amendments will mandate that the Auditor-General must provide a copy of the final report to the chief executive of a department. Secondly, the Auditor-General is empowered to provide a copy or an extract from the report to any person or company with a special interest. Thirdly, discretion will allow for the distribution of reports or extracts by the Auditor to ministers who have a special interest. And, fourthly, provision is made for the inclusion of all written comments received on a proposed report to be included in the final report. The fourth point in particular is a most useful new development.
Next it extends existing disclosure and confidentiality provisions to allow disclosure of information to assist in the conduct of a performance audit. It prohibits recipients from using or disclosing that information and it provides that an offence is not committed if the Auditor-General has consented to the use or disclosure of the information. It must be said that these formal amendments bring into line much of what is currently internal administrative practice. They also reflect the recommendations of the 2001 JCPAA report. The bill clarifies the position of certificates issued by the A-G about disclosure of information that may be contrary to public interest. Finally, it updates offences and penalty provisions in accordance with the current criminal law policy.
Ultimately, this bill is about improving transparency, accountability and oversight of government. It meets the current government’s commitment to shine a light in the dark corners of our democratic processes and institutions. We came to government with a comprehensive agenda to increase public accountability and transparency at all levels, and our vigilance necessarily must extend to accountability systems that operate within departments. The point is that the Auditor-General plays a key role in the accountability framework of government, and in that respect the ANAO is a most critical organisation. Over many years in this place, I have had extensive dealings with the ANAO, particularly in respect of my experience in defence, foreign affairs and veterans’ matters. These departments have responsibility for large sums of taxpayer dollars. They also have a responsibility for implementing policy in the areas of national security and for care of our returned service personnel. The effectiveness of the ANAO lies in its expertise in getting to the bottom of whether we get value for money from those departments in the public sector. Its role in exposing waste is valued by members of this chamber, of all persuasions, as well as the public, and ANAO performance audits are the lifeblood of a lot of work done in this particular chamber.
Also, audits inform our opinions on what works and what does not. An obvious example of waste revealed by the ANAO, of what does not work, was the previous government’s Regional Partnerships program. On the other hand, defence procurement shows the valuable work of the ANAO in bringing about sustained improvements in government spending. The DMO are responsible for the delivery of goods and services that equip and sustain our Defence Force. They supply everything and anything from boots to body armour, from tanks to jet fighters. Once a need for a defence capability has been identified, the DMO plays a pivotal role. From the early two-pass approval process, it looks at cost effectiveness of platforms and the feasibility of life extension programs or upgrades. Assessments will include the ability of Australian industry to support the new capabilities to ensure we maintain defence self-reliance. They also provide costings for through-life support of the capabilities and schedules estimates. For this reason, the DMO is the largest project management, engineering and logistics organisation in Australia. As a general rule, minor procurement items have a cost of less than $20 million and major items have a cost in excess of $20 million. Minor items represent less than two per cent of acquisition budget. That is obviously because complex platforms such as the JSF and air warfare destroyers have a price tag of several billion dollars.
In the next 10 to 15 years, it is estimated that 80 per cent of Defence’s fighting assets will be replaced or upgraded. New generation military hardware is on the cutting edge of a lot of new technologies. There is also the constant problem of integrating highly complex systems into existing platforms—all to be done within specified time frames. There is no point in continuing with the schedule slippages that result in capability delivery several years too late and out of date, which has become somewhat the norm in recent years. A classic example of that is, of course, the Seasprite helicopter project. It is an example of everything that can go wrong in the procurement process. That project involved an underestimation of the technical risks involved in integrating highly complex combat systems into 30-year-old copter shells. There were changes to specifications and protracted contract negotiations. There was also no proper schedule risk assessment. It was always a disaster waiting to happen.
That brings me to the core function of the DMO: risk management and risk pricing. There is a dollar attached to every risk. The failure to identify and mitigate risk levels significantly increases the cost of acquisitions. It can also lead to delayed delivery, which can compromise capability and operational safety. The DMO operates in a complex regulatory framework. Along with legislation, there are policies covering payments, open competition and mandatory reporting. There are internal audit services provided by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force and external audit services provided by the ANAO. Through the work of the ANAO today, we see an improvement in decision-making processes based on lessons learnt. In this regard, the ANAO’s DMO Major projects report 2007-08 provides a relevant, concrete and up-to-date example of their work. That report was tabled last November and is instructive of the utility of the ANAO.
Defence procurement is a significant area of government spending and constantly attracts a great deal of public scrutiny. In 2007-08, the DMO spent something like $4 billion on major and minor equipment acquisitions. As I said before, those acquisitions are often complex and expensive. Generally, we pay a significant amount of the cost upfront. Priority, of course, is always given to current operations and the need to properly provide for and protect our people in the field. But it is not hard to see why problems occur. In 2003, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that the Senate ask the Auditor-General to produce an annual report on the progress of major defence projects. A model for such a report could then be found in the work of the United Kingdom’s National Audit Office. A similar recommendation from the JCPAA followed in 2006, the goal being to improve transparency and accountability in major acquisition projects within both Defence and, more particularly, the DMO. It is fair to say that the recommendations of both committees followed years of reviews of procurement projects by the ANAO—reviews that highlighted a litany of schedule slippages and budget blow-outs.
The Rudd government committed to an annual report process in the lead-up to the last election. We followed through on that commitment with funding in the 2008 budget. The first annual report, as I said earlier, was tabled last November, and that has a list of some nine major acquisition projects that have been reviewed to date. It is a comprehensive cross-section of defence capabilities, major and minor, over the three services—Army, Navy and Air Force. There will be another 21 projects included in subsequent annual reports. It is a benchmark report—that is, it will provide a solid base from which to judge the effectiveness of project management by the DMO in years to come. The nature of the review and the report that was tabled last November was to develop proper processes within the DMO—processes that test and improve performance in the risk management of major acquisition projects.
The role of the ANAO has been to work collaboratively with the DMO to review that progress to date. Progress is going to be measured against cost, schedule and technical performance. It is not a combative or adversarial process. Its value lies in the aim of improving defence project management. To complement this work, the current government has announced the establishment of the Defence Systems Integration Technical Advisory, a joint venture between the DMO and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. It will further support the monitoring and assessment of project risks. The task of this new unit is to monitor and assess integration risk as well as to perform systems engineering analysis—the two critical failures of the last 10 years. They will also evaluate alternative capability solutions. Presumably, this latter process is part of the first stage approval process in line with both Kinnaird and Mortimer recommendations—that is, the new unit will contribute to risk reduction efforts primarily in the early stages of major projects. This is done in the lead-up to final government approval as part of the two-part cabinet process.
Sometimes, rather arcane and technical press releases understate the significance of a particular development. That is certainly the case with the creation of this new organisation, the Defence Systems Integration Technical Advisory body. What has been the nature of major failure over the last 15 years in this area? The failure has been both of a conceptual nature and technical application. By this I mean that there has been a lack of comprehension of the degree of risk inherent in a project or in a critical aspect of a particular project. Frigate upgrades, helicopter purchases and communication systems development were all underappreciated, as were the scope of risk, the size of risk, the length of risk and the difficulty of integration as risk factors. Because of this misunderstanding or underappreciation of risk mitigation, strategies were not considered as the norm or adopted as the norm.
In the private sector the sheer size and consequences of this risk appraisal underappreciation would have had adverse consequences. Consequences could have included the ending of careers, serious capital write-offs in companies and the loss of expertise and notoriety. In some more notable cases the consequences would have been company busters.
As it stands, in recent years in government agencies, the risk and the cost were simply transferred to taxpayers. This is because at inception there was underappreciation or no appreciation of the magnitude of risk by relevant government agencies. Over time I cannot think of a more protracted or serious failure. If there is any doubt on that score, simply look at the file on the Seasprite helicopter purchase.
In my view, this new DSI-TA has the capacity to be of major benefit to the DMO and the government in the defence area. Over time it should radically impact on procurement practices within those organisations. I shall follow its work with interest and seek regular updates on its work, role, performance and outcomes at estimates.
Australia is not an orphan in its experience of failures in defence procurement processes. The US, the UK, Canada and much of Europe have all found themselves in the same boat. However, it is the quality of our accountability and oversight process that suggests we might be set apart in the future.
The amendments in this bill will strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the office of the Auditor-General. It is an issue dear to the heart of this government. Of course other lessons will be learnt and further improvements will be made in the future. But this is a critical step in the right direction—a step toward restoring public trust in government and governance. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-02-05,"—I thank Senator Bishop for his interesting contribution on the Auditor-General Amendment Bill 2008 [2009], which implements the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, following its inquiry into the Auditor-General Act. I certainly commend this legislation to the Senate.
I must say that I was disappointed that Senator Ronaldson, the shadow special minister of state, took the opportunity to use debate on this important, and I think non-controversial, legislation to politicise the Audit Office by raising the audit report that was tabled yesterday into the CMAX issue. This was only done because, when the audit report into the CMAX Communications contract for the 2020 Summit was tabled, Senator Ronaldson did not see fit to come into the chamber, as is ordinarily the case, and debate the report at that time. There was no comment from the opposition. There was no comment, critical or otherwise, from any senator in this chamber. But, having failed in that responsibility, Senator Ronaldson tried to use the second reading debate of this important legislation to raise issues in relation to that report. I think this was a mistake by Senator Ronaldson, and I am about to outline to the chamber why.
It is not the only mistake Senator Ronaldson has made, because he also issued a press release yesterday in relation to the ANAO report, which was headed ‘ANAO report confirms Rudd’s $60,000 CMAX rort.’ I read this press release carefully as one does read a press release from a shadow minister. And, as Senator Ronaldson suggested, I read the report of the ANAO. And when I read Senator Ronaldson’s press release, which quoted the report, I thought to myself, ‘Senator Ronaldson’s had a few memory lapses.’ Let me just go through it for the benefit of the chamber. Let me quote directly from Senator Ronaldson’s press release. It said:
The ANAO report makes it clear: “... an employee of CMAX Communications ... had been recommended to them [PM&C] by a Senior Adviser within the Prime Minister’s office”.
That is the first of three quotes in Senator Ronaldson’s press release. What does paragraph 14 of the report actually say? It actually has words before those words that Senator Ronaldson quotes. It says:
In these circumstances, it was reasonable for PM&C to consider the credentials of an employee of CMAX Communications who had been recommended to them by a Senior Adviser within the Prime Minister’s Office involved with organising the Summit.
That was very misleading from shadow minister Ronaldson. It is very irresponsible of shadow minister Ronaldson not to have given the full sentence for the benefit of our friends in the fourth estate. They may not have had time to go to the report like I have; they may not have read the full sentence that commences paragraph 14 of the Auditor-General’s report. That was the first quote of three from Senator Ronaldson.
—Are there more?
—There are. You will be interested in them, too, Senator Bishop. The first paragraph of quotes begins ‘The ANAO report makes it clear’ and I have read that out. The second paragraph begins with ‘Moreover’. It reads:
... there was the possibility of an appearance of conflict arising from the Adviser’s [Taubenschlag] continued connection with CMAX Communications after he was employed as a member of Ministerial staff. Subsequent inquiries, and evidence taken under oath by ANAO, supported these conclusions.
Remember: ‘The ANAO report makes it clear’ and ‘Moreover’.
You would think, wouldn’t you, that Senator Ronaldson, in quoting that paragraph, which is 2.35 from the report, would have again quoted the full sentence? I will read it and also the preceding sentence to give context. I will also outline to the Senate for the benefit of Senator Ronaldson and any member of the fourth estate who might be interested that the report referred to is the first report provided to the government staffing committee undertaken by Mr Peter Hamburger. It was not the ANAO report. But Senator Ronaldson does not say that. He just pretends that it is from the ANAO.
This is the context. I will quote from that part of the ANAO report in full directly. I will read the sentence prior to the one that Senator Ronaldson quotes in part and then the full sentence part-quoted by Senator Ronaldson. It is from page 44 of the report, paragraph 2.35. It reads:
The report concluded that there was no actual conflict of interest arising from the Defence Minister’s Adviser’s connection with CMAX Communications and his employment as a member of ministerial staff.
It goes on to say:
Nevertheless, the report noted that—
and on we go with Senator Ronaldson’s words—
there was the possibility of an appearance of conflict of interest arising from the Adviser’s continued connection with CMAX Communications after he was employed as a member of Ministerial staff.
It goes on:
Subsequent inquiries, and evidence taken under oath by ANAO, supported this assessment.
Do not tell part of the story. Do not give us half the information. Do not put a few little dots in front of one sentence and fail to include the previous sentence. Let us have all the facts and all the information. Let us have the full report on the table. Let us have a fair dinkum debate about these issues. That was the second quote from shadow minister Ronaldson, the shadow special minister of state, about the ANAO report on the CMAX contract.
What about the third one, which is headed ‘finally’? I will read it. This is Senator Ronaldson allegedly quoting the ANAO report:

The basis on which the PM&C delegate made the decision that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money was not clear ... given the sensitivities which attest to suggestions of this kind from Minister’s offices, it will be in an agency’s interests to have made its own inquiries, explicitly consider more than one option and accurately document its decision-making process.

What are we to make of this third and final quote from Senator Ronaldson? As invited by Senator Ronaldson, I have read the report. I can identify where the first part of Senator Ronaldson’s third quote comes from. It comes from page 14 of the report, paragraph 17. The first part of Senator Ronaldson’s quote was from this part of the ANAO report, which reads:
The basis on which the PM&C delegate made the decision that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money was not clear …
The report goes on to say:
… from the departmental record that had been made.
That is in paragraph 17 on page 14 of the report. What Senator Ronaldson did not say, again, is that the report went on to say:
In particular, PM&C’s documentation did not accurately record the way in which CMAX Communications was identified to it as a possible provider, or the inquiries it undertook to satisfy itself that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money. That said, ANAO analysis indicates that the fee paid by PM&C was comparable to contracts entered into by CMAX Communications with Australian Government agencies prior to the Summit, as well as being reasonable having regard to rates charged by media and communications consultants in other contractual arrangements examined by ANAO in recent years.
So, again, it is part of the picture, part of the sentence, part of the story. But it is even worse than that, because the third quote from Senator Ronaldson—and this is complex and difficult to follow—was:
The basis on which the PM&C delegate made the decision that engaging CMAX Communications represented value for money was not clear … given the sensitivities which attest to suggestions of this kind from Minister’s offices, it will be in an agency’s interests to have made its own inquiries, explicitly consider more than one option and accurately document its decision-making process.
The second part of that quote is not even from the same paragraph as the first part. The first part of his quote is in paragraph 17 on page 14 of the report, and you will find the second part in paragraph 12 on page 13. The first part of the quote misses a critical word and a critical sentence, and the second part is a partial quote from a different paragraph of the report. This is the part of his press release that says:
… given the sensitivities which attest to suggestions of this kind from Ministers’ offices, it will be in an agency’s interests to have made its own inquiries, explicitly consider more than one option and accurately document its decision-making process.
The previous sentence to that, in paragraph 12, was not said. I will quote it in full:
Further, there is no restriction on Ministers’ offices suggesting particular consultants for consideration, providing it is clearly understood that the decision is a matter for the agency (taking into account the requirements of the CPGs). However, given the sensitivities—
and on it goes. It is part of a sentence, without the previous sentence, from the end of paragraph 12 of the report, combined with—as the first part of Senator Ronaldson’s quote—the first part of a sentence but not the second part, from paragraph 17. In Senator Ronaldson’s quote the part from paragraph 17 appears before the part from paragraph 12.
This is not a serious response from Senator Ronaldson to an Auditor-General’s report. This is an attempt to fudge the truth and I say, respectfully, that that is not on. I happen to think, given this tripe was reiterated in the chamber by Senator Ronaldson today, the Senate is owed an apology and the Auditor-General is owed an apology. I happen to think that if any suckers up there in the fourth estate swallowed Senator Ronaldson’s lines hook, line and sinker—and a few did—then they had better think again the next time a press release comes out from Senator Ronaldson about a matter so serious. That press release is a disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace, because the issues involved here are so important.
It is quite extraordinary in a situation where the opposition itself asked the Auditor-General to inquire into this matter. I am old-fashioned: I happen to think that is fair enough. It is fair enough, if they are dissatisfied about a government contract and the way that contract was administered, that the Auditor-General be asked to inquire, which he did and did thoroughly. It was the Liberal Party, Senator Ronaldson and Senator Johnston, who asked the Auditor-General to conduct this audit. Fair enough. I can say and have said in this chamber before that the government gave the Auditor-General its full cooperation, as it should. But, having sought the audit, the opposition should accept the Auditor-General’s findings. I always did in opposition. I believe the current opposition should adopt the same standards.
On this CMAX issue, the Auditor-General has found no improper conduct on the part of the Prime Minister’s office or department. The report in fact found:
… it was reasonable for PM&C to consider the credentials of … CMAX Communications …
There was no pressure on PM&C to appoint CMAX. The decision to appoint CMAX was made by PM&C alone and the fee paid was reasonable. Of course, it also says that there were deficiencies. I acknowledge that. Let us acknowledge that and make sure they are fixed up. PM&C has been frank. It has accepted that there were inadequate procedures and it has taken action, as stated in the report, to remedy them. That is the full truth, not part-truth, so let us hear no more spin from Senator Ronaldson.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-02-05,"—On 21 April 2006, Australians celebrated debt-free day. That was the first time in many, many years that Australians were able to wake up to the news that Australia was no longer in debt. The government, after 10 years of sustained, sound economic management, had delivered the nation from the burden of debt. But 3 February 2009 will go down in history as the date on which Labor reimposed a burden of debt upon our great country.
It is very instructive to look at the history and development of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. This chameleon Prime Minister went to the election saying, ‘I am an economic conservative—always have been, always will be.’ At his campaign launch he told the Australian people that the reckless spending of the Howard government must stop. That was only 18 months ago. Indeed, in the May budget, only 10 months ago, Labor said there was an economic imperative to cool down the economy because the Liberals had so deliberately and mischievously overheated the economy. They said that the inflation genie was out of the bottle and that Australia faced the devastation of an overheated economy. To deal with that problem, Labor told us that they had to introduce—and they did introduce—$20 billion worth of new taxes. They took $20 billion out of the economy to cool it down, because it was overheating. How wrong Labor and Mr Rudd have been, time and time again. Today, when we are going into debt to the tune of $200 billion to stimulate the economy, one wonders why $20 billion was taken out of the economy through increased taxation only 10 months ago.
Madam Acting Deputy President, do you remember what our slogan was at the last election?
—Whatever it takes to get elected!
—Senator Sterle, you are wrong. It was, ‘Go for growth’, and it was ridiculed by Labor. It was ridiculed by the economic commentariat. It was ridiculed by journalists. What are the government trying to do today? They are trying to go for—you have guessed it—growth, but by taking this country to huge and unprecedented debt levels. What this shows is knee-jerk, stop-start economic reactions. They have no idea. One day the economy is overheating and we have to pull out $20 billion by way of tax. Ten months later they are in this parliament saying, ‘We need an extra $200 billion by way of debt to keep the economy going.’
Who was it who predicted the economic tsunami before the last election and said tough times were ahead, that we did have to go for growth and that, whilst the economy might be slightly overheating, that would be a good buffer for us before the circumstances in which we now find ourselves would hit? That is what we said, and we were ridiculed. Senator Faulkner, in the wrong seat, is sitting there laughing. That is what he did. Like all the Labor people, during the election campaign he ridiculed the coalition government of the time. But within 18 short months we have been proven correct in our diagnosis and our remedies. All the commentators are now strangely silent. They have forgotten about the coalition warning of economic devastation, of an economic tsunami coming our way. They have forgotten about our warnings. They have gone strangely silent.
Despite Labor getting it so badly wrong, we took them on trust in relation to the first stimulus package. We were told the first stimulus package, of $10.4 billion, was needed to create 75,000 jobs—I repeat: to create 75,000 jobs. Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, as you would well know, when we asked in this chamber yesterday or the day before if Senator Conroy or the government could point to just one job that was created by this $10.4 billion stimulus package, Labor could not. We took them on trust and we allowed their $10.4 billion package to go through on the basis that it was not a rushed job or a botched job, that it was carefully thought out and that 75,000 jobs would be created. Labor no longer make that claim, and the reason they do not is that there is not a skerrick of evidence to suggest that that outrageous claim was right or that it has come to fruition. The sad fact is not that Labor cannot point to 75,000 jobs; they cannot even point to one job.
Clothed with this great success of the $10.4 billion package, Labor are saying to us and the Australian people: ‘We know the first package was a complete failure but, trust us, we will now spend four times as much—we will spend $42 billion.’ So I got out the pocket calculator and thought: ‘Right, if you spend four times as much, and it was 75,000 jobs for $10 billion, that means the creation of 300,000 jobs. You beauty!’ I then looked in the fine detail. What is Labor’s promise now? That $42 billion will not create one extra job but it will support up to 90,000 jobs. So whilst they put the ‘90,000 jobs’ out into the marketplace, the old weasel words have come in: it is no longer ‘creating’ and it is now ‘support up to 90,000 jobs’. I would like to know what the lowest parameter is. I have got a funny feeling it is a lot, lot lower than 90,000 jobs.
This package clearly is not an economic package; it is a political package. Yes, it is concerned about job protection—the protection of one man’s job, the Prime Minister’s. But the arrogance of that man—which I think would even make former Prime Ministers Whitlam and Keating blush—is such that whilst this very important package, which demanded an address to the nation, was being debated by the parliament he said: ‘I couldn’t be concerned about it. I’ll go home to the Lodge and have a good night’s sleep.’ That is how concerned he is about the economy. Whilst he was asleep he did not hear the contributions that were being made. He was not interested in the role of the parliament. Indeed, he wanted a $42 billion package to go through both houses of parliament within 48 hours. What is the urgency? Why can’t the parliament spend at least a week considering $42 billion? The Senate has now voted for that, against the wishes of the Australian Labor Party. But what was Mr Rudd’s position before the last election? I thought part of his mantra was Senate scrutiny, that it was so vital and that the Howard government had been treating the Senate with contempt. But never, never in the 11½-year history of the Howard government was there a proposal to raise $200 billion worth of debt on the back of the Australian people and then have it discussed and put through within 48 hours.
Mr Rudd does not only sleep while the parliament is debating. Clearly, he was asleep whilst the warning signs were appearing on the horizon. We warned about them before the last election, and he slept all through it as though he was not aware of it, as though nothing was happening. He seems to have slept through all the warnings that we gave. He misdiagnosed the state of the economy so badly before the election and as late as May last year at the time of the budget that I say as an aside that if he were a doctor he would be sued for medical negligence and the case would be open and shut. But having so misdiagnosed the economy he is now telling the Australian people: ‘I’ve got the prescription that you need. Have a little taste.’ And, yes, the prescription does taste sweet, but that is the sugar coating on a very, very bitter economic pill. We acknowledge that, whilst people are still sucking on the sweet sugar coating of this economic pill, they will say, ‘This is nice,’ and enjoy it. But we are concerned as to the economic consequences when the bitter part of the pill is tasted by the Australian people—and the bitter part of this pill will be when the Australian people are faced with the burden of paying back this debt. Make no mistake, it took the Australian people a full decade to pay back $96 billion. How long will it take them to pay back $200 billion? Indeed, yesterday at question time the Minister representing the Treasurer could not even tell us what the interest bill would be.
When the average homebuyer goes to a bank to borrow money, they ask, ‘Can I have a loan for so much? What will the interest repayments be and how long will it take to pay off the debt?’ It is clear that Labor have not asked any of those fundamental questions. They cannot tell us about the interest rates, they cannot tell us when the debt is going to be paid off; it is going to be into the never-never. But one thing we do know is that it took the coalition 10 years to pay off $96 billion worth of debt. It stands to reason that it will take a full generation of Australians to pay off this $200 billion worth of debt. That is why, in pursuit of the interests of the next generation and looking to the future, we are saying that at this time this is an irresponsible measure. At this time there is no evidence before us as to why it should be $62 billion, $42 billion or $22 billion, or why $200 billion is needed as the bank card limit. None of that has been put before us. We are entitled to have a look at that, we are entitled to examine it and we are entitled to ask questions.
As I said, it is always a difficult task, when people are having a good time, to remind them that there might be a hangover the next morning—so I am told. At the moment, people are looking at the package, I would imagine, and they are saying, ‘Sounds good to me.’ The farmers, for example, will get $950, but the cost to government—indeed, to every man, woman and child in this country—as debt will be $9,500. It is a pity that Labor, in their advertising and direct mail, will not tell the Australian people that. Do you actually want $950 in exchange for a $9,500 debt that your children will be paying off? That is the irresponsibility in this package and that is where we believe that further questioning needs to take place. We will be pursuing those questions in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration because we want to know how pink batts or boom gates, worthy causes though both are, are going to provide the productive stimulus to the economy to prepare us for the future. I think we might be able to spend our money in a better, more targeted and more substantial way for the future. That is why the alternative Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, has set out a blueprint for an alternative approach. I will not repeat that today because time is running short, but it is a blueprint that would in fact provide the economic stimulus that is actually needed and have a long-term ongoing benefit.
Indeed, we as an opposition have said, ‘If this is a crisis as described by the Prime Minister, it would have been good for the Prime Minister to have consulted with the opposition and discussed it with them.’ Indeed, in one of the most high-handed chapters of Australian history thus far, he has said: ‘It is my way or the highway. I want this passed within 48 hours—no discussion, no committee stage; just ram it through the parliament.’ When we say, ‘Slow down a bit and let’s discuss this; let’s see if we can get some common ground,’ he says, ‘No, it is my way or the highway.’ Yet his very own speech says there is no silver bullet—unless it is Mr Rudd’s of course. What we have is arrogance and incompetence, which makes for a very dangerous cocktail as we move into these uncharted economic times. But the Liberal Party and the coalition have a very strong record of sound economic management. We are concerned also about ensuring the future of the next generation. We are concerned that we do not spill out all the money straightaway and then scratch our heads later.
Indeed, I confess I am somewhat confused. We have been told that this situation has arisen because of the credit crisis, the credit squeeze, and that it is too difficult for the private sector to access credit. So what does the Australian government do? Hit the market for $200 billion. That is going to ease the credit squeeze, isn’t it! That is really going to make it easier for small businesses to borrow or for other people to get a home loan! It is really going to help by cutting $200 billion out of the economy! On page 6 of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement—and I look forward to meeting officers of Treasury and Finance this evening just to ask a few questions of them—we are told, interestingly, about the first stimulus package that it was designed for spending and to stimulate. It says:
To the extent that households save part of their payments and tax bonuses, this will help repair household balance sheets, provide a boost to confidence and support a return to more normal levels of consumption over time.
I have an idea: how about the government saving some of its money and getting all of those benefits it has referred to? Why does it have to go into debt and give it to people for them to save for that outcome?
Many coalition senators will speak on the flaws in this package and about our alternatives, but one thing we are sure of is that we will protect future generations from this huge $200 billion debt burden. That is why we as a coalition, every man and woman among us, concerned about the future, knowing we will take a hit in the polls and knowing it is unpopular in the short term, will stand up for our nation and oppose these measures.

",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-02-05,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and related bills. When we first took this prudent and, to be honest, courageous decision, as the fourth estate would agree—and that is a euphemism for their believing that we might be doing wrong to oppose this package—it was very interesting to hear the reports everywhere about how foolish that is and to hear people saying, ‘Don’t you understand the views of the public?’ It is interesting to see in a Herald Sun survey that, as we speak, 10,384 votes have been registered. That is a substantial sample and, surprise, surprise, 54 per cent of those people believe that this package is irresponsible. I have complete faith in the Australian people. They are not foolish. They can see through this. Pink batts, boom gates, school halls—goodness gracious me! Is this what we have descended to in this place? This is a government that in the 1930s would not have built the Sydney Harbour Bridge; instead, it would have loaded us up with millions of cans of spam. It would not have built the Snowy Mountains scheme; instead, we would have had thousands of acres of vinyl curtains.
This is a crazy, tokenistic and ridiculous appropriation of the nation’s funds for causes that are completely unrelated to the purpose they are to achieve, which is the delivery of job security. Now we have to go through these bills with the gun-to-our-heads approach of Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd said that this is like a form of economic open-heart surgery, but he has the clock on us. If we don’t do it in time he is just going to say, ‘Sew them up; that’ll do,’ regardless. There is a sense of complete arrogance in this approach. But you cannot gyp people, because they know exactly what is going on. You are spending their money.
All we can judge this package by is the last one, and the last one was a complete and utter flop. There was $10.4 billion and the promise of 75,000 jobs. Where are your 75,000 jobs? Then the government got people from the Australian Retailers Association to stand up and say, ‘It was great.’ Well, of course! That organisation is representative of the biggest owners of gaming machines and hotels in Australia, so of course they would be happy with it. They are looking forward to the government delivering some more largesse in their direction.
But is this package going to help working families? At the moment we are being overloaded with emails from people who are scratching their heads and wondering what on earth is going on. This email from Mr Tony Watts is typical—and I have rung him to confirm that I can read it out. He says, ‘Once again the ALP has seen fit to support working families earning up to $100,000 per annum whilst ignoring the plight of carers and pensioners in this latest economic bailout.’ On the justice issue, people are being left behind. People are looking through the package and they are all coming up with the same conclusion: those who are in a position of comfort get a tokenistic payment and those who need it have been left out. This is supposed to stimulate the manufacturing economy in Australia. It is not going to stimulate the manufacturing economy in Australia; it is going to stimulate the manufacturing economy in China, South Korea or somewhere else. All it is going to stimulate is the bottom line of certain retailers.
I am an accountant, and my experience in owning an accountancy practice for 10 years and before that in banking is of two expressions. One is the expression of the person who has got the loan—their sense of joy. They have got this loan; they have got their hands on this money. That is in no way matched by the sense of concern and the grimace when they are trying to pay it back, when they are faced with the reality of having to pay the money back. As this government goes forward to launch Australia into a possible $200 billion debt, I say to them: you have not fooled the Australian people. They know what this will do and the pressure it will put on interest rates. For every person who has a million-dollar facility, because of the absolute and overwhelming participation of the Australian Labor government, every one per cent increase will cost them $10,000. So a $500,000 house facility will cost people $5,000 a year for every one per cent that interest rates are pushed up because of this overwhelming engagement in the marketplace. For the sake of $950, people will be paying $5,000 per year for their $500,000 facility for as long as this debt remains. And if you force it up by two per cent that amount will be $10,000.
People are not foolish. They know this will come home to bite them; they can see that. We have to be more prudent. There is obviously scope for a stimulus package, but it must be one that can be seen to return something to the Australian people. It must be one in which we can see in its construction an income stream—an income stream from owning it and the capacity in the future to recoup some of the debt and to refloat the economy if we need to sell the asset. But the government is just launching us, full scale, into this quantum of debt without any form of idea of how we are to get out of it. This is a bad situation. People are aware of it. They look around the world and can see the problems that the United States currently has. The United States is trying to raise money by bonds, with a US$1½ trillion stimulus package. The world is asking the logical question—unfortunately, for all of us—who are we lending the money to? Do they have the capacity to repay us? I have to say to President Obama that it is not his fault. The problems started before he came to office. But we are on that path now, and the only thing that the conservative side of this chamber must do is say: ‘Stop! We do not want to get ourselves into that position.’ That position is down the track, but when we arrive there we will not be able to reverse the situation, so we must be prudent now.
I do not know whether the government will have the numbers in this chamber or not, but the Australian people are awake to them. It is not that they are against a stimulus package; they are against this stimulus package because it is so tokenistic, parochial and ridiculous. This whole idea that we have got to get it through defies belief. Why do we have to get it through? Are there parked behind a shed somewhere mountains of boom gates to be delivered to a railway crossing near you, immediately? Are there hiding in the bushes, down there behind the oval, armies of green people armed with pink batts, ready to ascend into the ceilings and insulate the nation? Would it actually matter if we were to take our time and do things prudently? No, it would not.
Why do you have this gun-to-our-heads approach? It is Australian taxpayers’ money and you are insisting that they not only spend that money but go further into debt. This brings to mind the dodgy aluminium siding salesman who goes from house to house saying: ‘You’ve gotta sign up. It’s gotta happen now.’ I can tell you, from the point of view of an accountant, when the pressure salesman turns up, the product is dodgy and the only thing you should say to them is, ‘Go away.’ If what you are offering is so self-evidently beneficial to the Australian people, leave the details of your program with us and it will scream from the paper that it should be endorsed. I do not doubt for one moment that, if the product were fiscally responsible, it would be endorsed. But this is not simply about a stimulus package; it is about the issue of your stimulus package and what it represents.
Let us look at the position that we will eventually be in if we implement this package. If we end up hocking our nation’s credit card with $200 billion worth of debt, for every per cent of interest that is $2 billion. Let us say that over the cycle of this debt we will be looking at around six or seven per cent interest per year. That is around $14 billion in interest a year. Those numbers just roll off the tongue, but what are those numbers? Those numbers could represent cancer treatment that could be provided on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those numbers could extend hospitals. Those numbers could fix the rail system in Victoria. Those numbers could provide dams so we can secure our water supply. They could seal roads. They could build an inland rail system that would deliver a corridor of economic activity in Australia. This money would just disappear, year after year.
As an accountant, one of the things that frustrated me was that hardworking families were only just able to meet their mortgage interest payments year after year and could never get ahead because they were hocked up to their eyeballs with debt. They basically sell their families and those who come after them into a form of financial servitude. That is the reason that we must stand against this package. I am not going to sell the Australian people who come after me into a form of financial servitude because of the improvidence of trying to buy our way out of the global recession with ceiling insulation and boom gates. This is something that resonates. I am receiving email after email saying: ‘What is this thing about pink batts? What are pink batts going to do to our global economy? Who devised this? What font of knowledge came up with this work of financial wisdom?’ The reason people are sceptical is that they found out about the first package. It had no modelling; it was just plucked out of the air—‘Bang. Here, spend $10.4 billion’—and half the surplus was gone. The government came up with promises and was able to deliver on none of them. That is the form and track work of the Labor Party economic horse, and it is dodgy.
This is going to be an incredibly important debate for the Australian people because it is not just about this moment; it is about from this time forward. The debate will go on for a period of time, but the debt, if it descends on us, will remain on us for goodness knows how long.
When are the Labor Party going to present information showing the efficacy of this proposal? When are they going to tell us exactly what they hope to achieve? When will we see specific details of the purpose and desired outcome of this proposal? Where does the arrogance of proposing one of the biggest packages that has ever been brought forward, without any time allowed for its consideration, come from? We had this ridiculous vigil last night in the House of Representatives till five o’clock in the morning because you insisted on being so barbarically arrogant that your leader did not even turn up to his own vote. This is really starting to show the people of Australia exactly who is running this country. If we had efficacy along with the arrogance, at least we would have something excusable, but we have arrogance and these ridiculous ideas all tied up together.
We now have people, quite rightly, going through the details of this package and realising that they have been left out. They are beginning to understand. People thought that every farmer would get $950. They will not. In fact, in the whole $41,534,000,000 package $20 million has been put aside for farmers—that is it. Of course, not every farmer will receive a payment. You have to already be deemed as being in exceptional circumstances and basically in financial trouble to receive it. And I will tell you what people in financial trouble also have: they have debt. What your package does is put the price of their debt up. What are you delivering to them? Ten thousand dollars per million per percentage point. They are not foolish; they will understand, when the interest bill turns up, where it came from. It came from the Australian Labor Party.
Then we have the state governments, which have been building up debts that Steve Hooker, the pole vaulter, could not traverse. These state Labor governments are salivating because they are going to get bailed out by the federal government. They are losing the capacity to go any further. The debts that the states now have behind them are almost insurmountable, so now we are going to have major state debts compounded with a debt-laden federal government, which in the past could always sit behind them and say: ‘No matter how much you get this wrong, state Labor governments, at least we have a parachute. Although we don’t want to use it, we have the capacity to bail you out if it all goes to clay.’
But now we are going to lose the capacity, the ability, to bail them out. We will have a compounding effect of debt upon debt with no income stream, putting immense pressures on the productive capacity of this nation to finance it. By going to the people who will have the providence to go to the markets to borrow the money to produce a form that adds to our economy, we are also going to those people who in the future will have to bail the nation out of the problem and saying, ‘We’re going to make it impossible for you, because we’re going to be in the marketplace bidding against you for the money.’ This is the reality. It is going to be a very hard debate. We have to take the Australian people on this journey to clearly spell out piece by piece why this is not any sort of statement of belligerence, obstinacy or arrogance but a deeply felt concern about where this will all end up if we get it so entirely wrong—and the track work of the Labor Party so far is that they are getting it terribly wrong.
I am deeply heartened that, no matter what poll I looked at this morning, the Australian people are waking up to the situation. They understand. The lady I spoke to last night and the calls I took all had the same message: ‘What on earth are they up to down there? Where has this manifestation of manic borrowing come from?’ At the end of the day, in the global economy we are in the same economic plane as the United States of America and China, but we are not in the cockpit; we are down the back of the plane. Where the front of the plane goes, we will go regardless. In this nation we have to be fully aware of where we are economically and have a good understanding of where we are going. Our idea is to protect our people. Australia does not have the capacity to reboot the global economy. I wish we did, but we do not. Our primary responsibility is to our people and to the realisation that we are only about 1½ per cent of world GDP.
In the past we were protected because we were provident and prudent and had money put aside, but the Labor government have started down a path and this is how the path will go: the first thing they do is spend the money you have. They have done that—it has gone. Then they spend the money you do not have—that is, they borrow it. They are flat out into that, they are $200 billion into that, and they have not been here two years. Then they try to drive whatever mechanism possible—interest rates, for example—as low as it can go but are confounded by the fact that at the same time their debts are forcing interest rates up. Then they do the big one: they print money. Around the world at this point in time are certain economies at various positions. Believe you me, you do not want to get to position 4, because then it is game, set and match. That is Zimbabwe. How do we stop ourselves getting to that position? It is by having the honesty—and losing the arrogance—to make sure that we do not get ourselves on that path. It is by being prudent at the start to save ourselves the pain of the end. This is why people are asking the National Party and the Liberal Party—I do not know about the crossbenchers—the question. It is not what is popular now; it is what is prudent in the long term.
Any person going to the pub and seeing some person who is half-cut and buying everybody beers would of course grab a beer off them, but you do not respect them. You think they are foolish. You think their whole process is obviously flawed. The Labor Party’s position is that, because people are accepting these beers off them at the bar on a Friday night, we all think they are wonderful. No, we think they are half insane. We the conservative side, the fiscally responsible side, have the capacity to try to bring some sense and balance back into this situation. Those people who have a long-term vision of where this nation is going, those people who are honest and prudent, will understand this statement. It is not about us now; it is about where our nation goes and the debt we leave behind for others to pay. The most selfish thing you can do is leave your debt behind, and that is what the government is doing. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-02-05,"—The nation faces the consequences of an extraordinary meltdown of the global economic wellbeing that has emanated from a mismanagement of the trust of people by the corporate sector based in New York and the inevitable catch-up from the spending of assets that simply could not be backed. This is not unforecast. JK Galbraith, for one—I read his book in 1995—forecast an inevitable bust because of the boom that could not be sustained, could not be justified, that even then had appeared in Western economies and was being led by the biggest finance houses on Wall Street. However, this neoliberal and rampant capitalism, based from the Reagan years on the diminution of government—government, get out of the way—now has to be fixed by government.
We are in democracies where it is the role of government ultimately to be the defender of the public good. The Prime Minister is late to this. In his recent essay—I have not read it yet—I think he has done a 180-degree turn from being a conservative economist to now saying that he understands that the role of government is to defend the public good and to work on behalf of all components of the electorate, not just the big business houses. That will take a transformation in thinking by both of the big parties in this parliament, a transformation which is contrary to their practice certainly for the last decade and more that I have been here and for years extending back beyond that. We Greens have a different approach to economic management, one which is much more responsible and which says we certainly should live within the means that there are to support ongoing economic prosperity not just at the given time but into the future.
Australia is the richest country in the world per capita in resources but has had its share of mismanagement. I watched in this place over the last years, particularly during the Howard years, as a massive amount of public money that should have gone into the public sector was poured into the private sector. As a result, we have a run-down education system in a country where everybody—from the poorest person to Rupert Murdoch, who at the turn of the century called for more spending—knows that education is the absolute staple of not just our economic wellbeing but also the general wellbeing of everybody. It provides fulfilment. It gives every individual person in society the opportunity to find their own creative genius. Through the application of that fulfilment they make a contribution to the rest of society.
However, if you look at the average spending on education of OECD nations, Australia has a spending shortfall of $6 billion per annum. We are at the back of the pack. I found it quite extraordinary that neglect of education became a hallmark of the Howard government at a time when we had massive assets and a massive ability to contribute to education. Not least here was the running down of public education stock. We have been left with schools which are way behind international norms in both infrastructure and the good teachers to deliver the education that we want for every child in Australia in 2009.
Now we are faced with this dilemma of unprecedented proportions—that is, unprecedented for those people who cannot remember back to the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Greens have a very clear difference from the big parties in our approach to the rescue of the economy from this situation—that is, short-term stimuluses are not enough. We take the long-term view. In meeting this emergency, we want to see the governments in this country and around the world looking at the long term and redirecting the economies so that we do not get ourselves into this mess again. In our communications with the government on this package and on the structuring of future economies, we want to see a very clear direction as to where they expect the economy to be not just in three years time but in 30 or 50 years time.
As far as the Greens are concerned, that means following the advice of Sir Nicholas Stern when he was here in Canberra nearly two years ago. He pointed out to the closed ears of the then Howard government—and, I suspect, the current government—that those economies which take their lead from ecological excellence will be the leading economies in the coming century. Why is that? It is because there is a greater catastrophe than this economic one which is stalking not just Australians but the whole of humanity. We are in an age of cataclysmic climate change. Sir Nicholas Stern pointed out that we should redirect one per cent of gross product into tackling climate change now, and there is no evidence of that in any of the program we have before us. In fact, the Rudd government has said that it is putting off its major legislation to deal with carbon trading until midyear, as it is a secondary matter. Sir Nicholas Stern pointed out that, if we do not urgently redirect one per cent of the global economy into fixing climate change, it will have a six to 20 per cent hit on the economies of our grandchildren. All the evidence points to us having a huge responsibility to think about not just how we fix the economy now but the direction of the economy into the future. The chamber will hear a lot more about this from my colleagues and me in the coming week.
Nevertheless, we are charged with dealing with a $42 billion stimulus package from this government to meet this exigency. The opposition has decided it will not support that package and says that half the stimulus package would be a more prudent way to go. The questions to both the big parties are these. How do you decide the parameters of a stimulus package at this stage of the economic downturn? How do you justify $42 billion or $21 billion or $84 billion or $11 billion? There is a bit of a hunch involved in the government of the day delivering even such a massive package. You listen to the economists. They simply do not know what size package is required or what sort of government intervention is required to get us out of the mess the big finance brains of the world got us into because there was not enough government scrutiny of their activities over the last several decades.
Our view is that Australians are hurting and are fearful. There are predictions that, instead of four per cent unemployment, there will be seven per cent unemployment within a year or two. These are not just statistics. These are hundreds of thousands of Australians who were doing well last year but have been suddenly confronted with dire economic circumstances which may lose them their houses, their cars, their ability to go on holidays, their ability to feel good about themselves or even their ability to inject money into their children’s wellbeing to ensure they get the good education I was just speaking about. Part of the question is this. How do we inject optimism into a nation which in economic terms is feeling pessimistic about the future? I say we do that by both dealing with the economic problem and pointing to a more optimistic and secure future for everybody.
To do that you need to be able to speak to those kids who recognise more clearly than many adults in this country the dire threats coming down the line from overpopulation, resource depletion and cataclysmic climate change—and Australia is not going to be insulated from any of those things. These are huge worries stalking our society. It is up to us, as the wealthiest resource based nation on the planet, to be leading a new direction for the whole of this planet. People are looking to Obama in the United States. We must look to our democratic system in this country to set an even better lead because we are better equipped to do that. Unfortunately, government is not there yet.
The Greens offer an alternative to the old big party thinking in this country, which is really, ‘The big end of town does have the nous and does know what is good for this country.’ There are good-hearted people in the big end of town but their ideology is not a wider one which says that we have to be aiming for quality of life, improvement of happiness and particularly optimism among us citizens, who are seeing ourselves as part of a global community which is facing gargantuan problems into the future. The Greens are prepared to look at those problems, to reset and reconfigure Australia’s role and its domestic policy, to ensure that we take a lead in giving future generations the security, the peace on earth and the stable environment which they all should be inheriting but are not going to inherit in the boom and bust capitalist age which we have just seen deliver to us this extraordinary financial problem.
What do we do with the $42 billion stimulus package? The opposition has decided to oppose it. We Greens would have said it very differently. We will go into this in the coming days of debate. The first thing we have done is to join with the opposition and other members of the crossbench to ensure the Senate gives this package at least basic scrutiny through the committee hearings which have been set up. The Greens have extended that, with the acceptance—we are in a cooperative mood—of the other non-government members of the Senate, to a second committee to ensure that we sit through, if necessary, until next Thursday at midnight to give this package due scrutiny. We will have a lot more to say in the meantime.
I flag this with you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We will run critical scrutiny over this massive amount of money, but we are not here just to criticise; we are here to bring forward positive and helpful suggestions that the government may take into account. I ask the government to accept that it is the role of the whole of parliament, not just the government, to work out what is best for the Australian community. If good ideas come out of other components of the elected parliament then the government should be flexible enough to adopt those good ideas into this package before we get to the final vote next Thursday. In the United States, the Obama administration has proposed a bigger package than this one—we know the United States is a much bigger economy. It is a US$50 billion green stimulus package to ‘create jobs with clean, efficient American energy’. President Obama has said:
To put people back to work today and reduce our dependence on foreign oil tomorrow, we will make investments aimed at doubling renewable energy production and renovate public buildings to make them more energy efficient. America’s energy shortcomings present a huge opportunity to put people to work in ways that will transform our economy.
Senator Milne has our portfolios for both education and climate change and her staff are working very assiduously, looking at the $14 billion part of this package which is for new school buildings right across the country. We would want to see not just that we are renovating buildings but that new buildings being built with this massive amount of public money are highly rated for energy efficiency and for environmental outcomes. That creates jobs and stimulates new skilling in such fields as building, plumbing, carpentry, insulation placement and the electrical trades—right across the board, that stimulates new jobs, giving people new skills which they then carry on into the future, building industry in the private and the public sectors.
In Obama’s package, there is $11 billion for research and development, including pilot products and federal matching funds for a smart grid investment program to modernise the electricity grid, making it more efficient, secure and reliable and building new powerlines to transmit clean renewable energy from sources throughout the nation. There is an $8 billion program for loans for renewable energy power generation and transmission projects. There is $6.7 billion for renovation and repairs to federal buildings, including at least $6 billion focused on increasing energy efficiency and conservation. There is $6.9 billion to help state and local governments make investments that make them more energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions. Might I add that the component of the Rudd government’s package which goes to local government is well directed. Who better than the administrators at the local level to know where best to target expenditure of money to stimulate the economy. There is $2.5 billion in the Obama program for energy efficient housing retrofits and a further $2 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy research.
There is $2 billion going into renewable energy research in America, when we in Australia, this sunny country, have starved our solar researchers of money. When you starve researchers of money, you then starve the pilot programs, the implementation of the technology, the manufacture and the science. So, after 12 Howard government years, we are in the extraordinary position where, for example, in putting a solar hot water system on our house last year, I found that the technology was Australian but it was imported from China. Well, good on the Chinese! But ought not we be manufacturing the Australian technology, which is world’s best, here in Australia? The answer to that is: of course we should. The Obama government is putting $2 billion into energy efficiency and renewable energy research. Where is that in this package?
There are also a range of other measures, and here I point to the fact that Australia is way behind the greening of the economic direction that we see in Germany, the UK, the United States and Spain. Where in this package is there refurbishment, renewal, or at least a national overview, of our public transport system? The Spaniards, with their very fast trains travelling at 350 kilometres an hour—it is now 3½ hours from Madrid to Barcelona, and the other major cities are connected—are taking thousands of people out of the air to slow down the release of greenhouse gases. The Spanish government has just allocated €50 billion to extend this fast, efficient train system, which is 99 per cent on time. What do the people of Sydney or Melbourne think of that? Where is that in this program? Where is even a thought about that in this program? That is the sort of program which, in an age of cataclysmic climate change, sets the course for an efficient transport system into the decades and the century ahead, creating jobs, stimulus for local business and world’s best expertise.
I have a lot more to say about this legislation, but my colleagues will be following me in this debate. We are excited by the opportunities that arise here. We will be talking with the government wherever we can to make this package more job rich, more environmentally cohesive and more long term, leading to the skilling of this generation so they will be assured of jobs for decades to come in this lucky country of ours.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-02-05,"—I wish to make a personal explanation. In my speech on the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and related bills this morning I used an example, which was that the package could provide support and assistance for air conditioning. I have been subsequently informed that that is incorrect, and I apologise for any misunderstanding.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-02-05,"—On 6 May 2007, the then Treasurer, the member for Higgins, Mr Peter Costello, stood up in the House of Representatives to deliver the 2007-08 budget—what would turn out to be the last budget of the Howard government. Mr Costello delivered a budget which, for the 10th consecutive year, was in surplus. In the previous 12 years, Mr Costello as Treasurer had paid down the $96 billion of debt with which the then government had been saddled by its Labor predecessor. If you look at the fiscal projections which formed part of the last Costello budget, they paint a magnificent picture of the state of the Australian economy then.
In budget statement No. 1, Fiscal strategy and budget priorities, we learn that the budget surplus for 2007-08 was projected to be $10.6 billion in the black. But, if you look at the projections in the out years, you will see that the state of the Australian economy at the time of the last Costello budget projecting into the future was that in the following year, 2008-09, the year we are now in, the budget would have been in surplus to the tune of $12.7 billion. A year beyond that, in 2009-10, the budget would have been in surplus to the tune of $13.8 billion. That was the healthy, robust, solid, solvent state of the Australian economy at the time of the Liberal Party’s last budget.
As it turned out, those budget projections were wrong, but they were wrong because they underestimated the robust health of the Australian economy in that last golden year of the Howard government, when the economic circumstances of this country were such as filled individuals, households and businesses with confidence. When it came to the time of the election on 24 November 2007—only six months after Mr Costello’s last budget—the state of the economy was so healthy that the budget surplus which the incoming Rudd government inherited had been revised upwards to $21 billion. That does not include the amount of money that had been set aside prudently in capital funds such as the Future Fund and the Higher Education Endowment Fund to make provision to relieve the debt burden from the backs of future generations—from the backs of your children and my children, Mr Acting Deputy President. Australia was $21 billion in the black—not even taking into account the Future Fund and the Higher Education Endowment Fund—and that is what the Labor Party inherited from us. Twelve and a half years earlier, we had inherited $96 billion in the red from them.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you might think that a government newly in power, even a Labor government—led by a Prime Minister who announced boldly during the election campaign in a slick television commercial that he wore the badge of an economic conservative with pride—which inherited a $21 billion surplus in a growing economy would at least have a few years before it would destroy the country’s fiscal position. We know that sooner or later Labor governments always destroy the country’s fiscal position.
—It is the lesson of history.
—Thank you, Senator Williams. That is the lesson of history and I will go back to it in a moment in these remarks—

Senator Mason interjecting—

—As Senator Mason rightly points out, we on the Liberal side of politics, we neoliberals, wear our badge with pride—don’t we, Senator Mason?
—Absolutely!
—Absolutely. We are always the ones who have to clean up the mess after Labor governments have destroyed the country’s fiscal position. But, nevertheless, what a difference a year makes! Mr Acting Deputy President, did you know that last Saturday it was 62 weeks since the change of government? It was 62 weeks since Mr Howard and his ministers—since I and Senator Mason—surrendered the seals of office and 62 weeks since the responsibility for the management of the Australian economy was placed in the hands, as it should have been as a result of a wonderful democratic process, of the Australian Labor Party.
In 62 weeks what has been the result? I can tell you, because the day before yesterday in the House of Representatives the Treasurer, Mr Swan, and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, tabled the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook projects that by 2008-09 the budget will have moved into deficit to the tune of $22.5 billion, a reversal of the nation’s fiscal position of more than $40 billion in a year. In 62 weeks there has been a reversal of the country’s fiscal position of some $43 billion—that is, not quite a billion dollars a week. It took the Hawke and Keating governments 13 years to accumulate $96 billion of debt. It has taken the Rudd government little more than a year to accumulate half that already and to reverse the nation’s fiscal position by half that much already. And the Labor Party asks, ‘Why is it that you Liberals are going to vote against this so-called economic stimulus strategy?’ The reason we are going to vote against it is to protect the national interest from a Labor government gone crazy, a Labor government gone mad with its addiction to spending and borrowing as the only tool of economic management.
We do not say that there should not be stimulation of the economy to deal with the current downturn. Mr Turnbull in his statement to the nation last night and in his interviews on The 7.30 Report and other programs indicated measures which the Liberal Party—the party that could be trusted with the prudent management of the economy were we today in power—would have implemented. It would have implemented, in particular, tax cuts so that people could project forward what their savings would be and might thereby be encouraged to change their household budgets and elevate their expenditure rather than merely pay off debt and not contribute that money into the circular flow of the currency. So we do not say there should not be a stimulus. What we say is that the magnitude of this package is reckless and the targeting of the package is wrong.
There are two fallacies—two lies—that have been put about by Labor Party politicians to try and justify this reckless expenditure, this policy decision which will cripple our children and perhaps our grandchildren with debt. The first of those fallacies, which was articulated among others by the Prime Minister when he stood up in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, pale faced, panic stricken and petulant, to announce these measures, is that the reversal of the budget position is the result of the decline in the government’s revenue because of the economic slowdown.
The Prime Minister’s claim is belied by his own government’s document, the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook, because those with a taste for drilling into the detail of these documents will find, on page 40 in table 4.2, ‘Reconciliation of Australian Government General Government Sector Underlying Cash Balance Estimates’, a disaggregation of the extent to which the deterioration of the budget position is due to policy decisions of this government and is due to a decline in the revenue. What table 4.2 tells us is that taxation receipts estimates have been revised down by $9.5 billion in 2008-09, while the effect of policy decisions in the so-called stimulus package is recorded as $18.037 billion. That is in addition to the $10 billion economic stimulus package announced in December, which many consider was largely ineffective.
So the value of the policy measures—the decisions made by the Australian government in the last 2½ months—has been the expenditure of $28 billion. The effect of the decline of the revenue has been $9 billion. Let us not let the Labor Party get away with the lie that the budget has been driven into deficit by a decline in the revenue. Overwhelmingly, by a factor of more than three to one, the budget has been driven into deficit by advertent policy decisions made by Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Mr Tanner. The second fallacy that is propagated by the Labor Party and in particular by Mr Rudd is that the reason these extreme measures are necessary is the global financial crisis—in which, so they say, Australia stands in the same position as every other Western nation. That is not so. The global financial crisis was generated by imprudent lending practices and deficient regulatory requirements within the United States of America. It was a problem that emerged from the United States of America, in particular from the so-called subprime housing market, and was propagated to other Western economies, including Australia’s.
—It was imported.
—As Senator Mason says, it was imported. Where Australia stands in relation to this crisis is not the consequence of decisions of the previous government. On the contrary, the previous Treasurer, Mr Costello, in 1997—long before the subprime housing crisis was dreamt of—anticipated and, so as to avoid the emergence of such problems in Australia, set up the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. The Australian financial system has been largely quarantined from the effects of the global financial crisis. We have had no Bear Stearns, we have had no Northern Rock and we have had no collapse of a Lehman Brothers or Bank of Scotland.
In fact, over the last weekend the Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, was able to boast at the World Economic Forum in Davos that, of the 11 strongest banks in the world, four are the four big Australian banks. Mr Acting Deputy President Trood, you and I both know that in the international financial system Australia is a relatively small player. The value of our capital markets is a fraction of the aggregate value of the world’s capital markets. A decade ago, not one of the 11 strongest banks in the world would have been Australian banks, simply because of their relatively small size in international financial affairs, but today—because of the decline in the credit base of American, British, European and some Asian banks—four of the 11 strongest banks in the world are Australian. That did not happen by accident; that happened because of the foresight, prudence and judgement of Mr Peter Costello.
But do not take it from me. Let me read you some words from an address last December to the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney, published in yesterday’s Australian newspaper. The commentator, an economist, said this:
Lax business regulation has contributed to the global financial crisis that has plunged most of the Western world into recession. But before we pronounce free markets dead and 2009 the year of reregulation, let’s analyse what went wrong.
This particular economist goes on to say:
For Australia the short answer is nothing. Australia’s financial regulation is the envy of the rest of the world. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum rank our financial system among the top four in the world.
Who was this sage, who was this Cassandra, who was this Daniel come to judgement who announced as recently as last December that for Australia the answer is that nothing went wrong—that, in a financial maelstrom, for Australia everything went right because our financial system is the envy of the world? Why, it was none other than Dr Craig Emerson, the Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation—the only professional economist who sits as a minister in the Rudd government. Dr Emerson was right.
The Australian government, the Labor government, will be judged by its response to the global financial crisis. The response so far has been panic stricken and hysterical, and no more so than in a flimsy polemic, the product of a second-rate mind, published by Mr Rudd in the Monthly journal this week. Mr Rudd, contrary to the assertions of his much better educated Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation, claimed that it was regulatory failure in Australia, in common with the other Western economies, which was to blame. It is nothing of the sort, as Dr Emerson had the understanding to point out as recently as the month before last. The Rudd government’s response to this crisis has been a panic-stricken, hysterical and wrong-headed response. We Liberals, we who proudly bear the name ‘liberal’, neo or otherwise, will not stand by to see this nation sunk in generations of debt.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-02-05,"—I rise to speak on the so-called stimulation package that the government has proposed—or could we call it the debt package? I go back to 15 September last year, when I presented my maiden speech in the Senate. I intend to quote from it. I drew an analogy between running the family farm and running the nation. I said:
The family farm cannot carry too much debt; otherwise, when the tough times strike, the farm will be in financial trouble. So too with our nation. If governments build debt, they are mortgaging our children’s future away. It pleases me that the previous government paid off our huge debt. This is something that as a nation we can be proud of. It is surely the envy of many.
Here we are today with a Labor government once again in charge of the chequebook. Let us have a good look at what they are doing. They propose to spend $42 billion—$42,000 million in borrowings—on propping up the nation’s economy. Let us have a look at another analogy. We have what greed and reckless, foolish lending by financial institutions has caused around the world, especially in America. Now we face a situation where our economy is like a tyre with a puncture, and it is losing air and going flat. On 8 December the government released $10 billion-odd to blow into that tyre to inflate it. What happened to that $10 billion? We in the coalition supported it because it was money for our pensioners, money that we had called for for weeks or even months. We thought it was a disgrace that single pensioners were trying to survive on $273 a week and said they should receive some assistance. That is why we supported the package. But even with the $10.4 billion splashed around last December the tyre went flat. Now we have a situation where Mr Rudd and Mr Swan are going to inflate the tyre with $42 billion, and we know that in the months to come the tyre will go flat. What are they going to do then? Are they going to just keep borrowing and borrowing? It amazes me that the stimulation bills before the Senate allow the government to borrow up to $200 million.
Let us have a look at Labor’s history and at this stimulation package. We have $14.7 billion for our schools. Of course I support money going into our schools. It was a coalition government that brought in the Investing in Our Schools Program to put in money because of state Labor governments neglecting our schools. I think $14.7 billion is too much. Let us look at the next item: $8.2 billion of handouts, $950 for all of those who have a gross income of less than $80,000. Going back to the package in December, I was amazed when one of the returned services clubs told me that in the week after 8 December they took an extra $46,000 through their poker machines. I was also amazed that one liquor outlet had customers ordering pallets of beer—not a carton, not a couple of slabs, but pallets of beer. This is stimulating the economy the Rudd way. It is foolish, stupid spending that will only backfire. So we have a system being introduced by those opposite where if you are on $78,000 a year you are going to be handed another $950.
Thankfully, since 3 September we have had a four per cent reduction in interest rates, which has helped many of those people in business and farming and those with home loans. Because of the world financial meltdown, we have had a reduction in fuel prices. That has also helped. But I was amazed when my chief of staff, Greg Kachel, informed me that while speaking to his 21-year-old daughter last night she had said, ‘The money would be good but who’s going to pay it back and at what interest?’ This is how a typical young person, one whom I might add is apolitical, reacts to this package.
Let us go on a bit further. Let us say you are on $95,000 a year, a huge amount of money. You will get $300. Well, that will stimulate the economy, won’t it! This is just crazy. Let us have a look at rural Australia. Let us have a look at our farmers, who have suffered drought since January 2002. They are going to get a paltry $20.4 million out of a $42 billion package. Those in exceptional circumstances are going to get $950. Now $950 will buy you a tonne of fertiliser. Those over the other side would not understand the cost of fertiliser and the cost of running a farm. One tonne of fertiliser usually goes over 15 to 20 acres, so when you are sowing 3,000 or 4,000 acres of wheat it is a drop in the ocean. However, it will help to pay the phone bill, the utilities bill and the grocery bill, and I welcome that; something is better than nothing for those who actually feed our nation.
Let us go on to the 2.7 million homes that will have batts put in their ceilings, at up to $1,600 a house. I am going to tell you a little story. A very good friend—a very close friend; there is probably no-one closer, as we plan to marry in April—has a wooden home in the little town of Bingara. A couple of years ago Nancy put batts in the ceiling of her house. It has made the house substantially worse, and I will explain why. When you have a stone or brick home, your walls are insulated pretty well, but with a timber—cypress pine—home the heat comes in during the day through the walls and, because of the batts in the ceiling, cannot escape at night through the ceiling. The house is substantially hotter at night during summer because of the batts in the ceiling. That is a fact. I know and Nancy knows. If she had it her way and we had time we would probably pull the batts out. In a wooden house it is a waste of time and a waste of money, unless you do the sides of the house as well. But, if you are going to pull the HardiePlank off cypress pine, you are going to split every panel and it is going to cost you a fortune. So do not think that the batts in the ceiling are going to be the magic wand that will save the economy, give everyone a job and save a swag of greenhouse gas and electricity, because they will not. I know it through personal experience.
Let us move on to this $42 billion package, and I will explain why I will not support it. Our hospitals in New South Wales are in disarray. It was one Kevin Rudd who promised the Australian people prior to the election that the buck would stop with him and that he would fix our hospitals. Go out to Dubbo and explain to the people of Dubbo in western New South Wales how their hospital is fixed. There is actually a rally planned for Friday the 13th—what a suitable date—for the people of Dubbo to protest the conditions of their hospital. Let me tell you about their hospital. It is in the board of Greater Western Area Health Service of NSW Health—one of those magic, great boards that Bob Carr introduced—and it is another failure. Gilgandra and Coonabarabran hospitals, remember, had the meat cut off—they could not pay the butchers’ bills. Now we find that the security companies have not been paid and have threatened to walk out. This is where the doctors borrow the bandages from the local vet so they can actually bandage their patients. This is fixing the hospitals, Rudd style! We have a doctor practising in Bingara who was in the Dubbo area previously. He is owed $50,000 for his services by the Greater Western Area Health Service and cannot get paid. He has had to move out of the area, borrowing against his home loan to keep himself afloat. This is the hospital system that Mr Rudd was going to fix. It is an absolute disgrace. What is in this $42 billion package for our hospitals? The answer is simple: there is nothing in it at all.
What about our aged-care facilities? Haven’t we got an obligation to look after our elderly? Imagine an elderly lady in an aged-care facility in a country town—her husband went to war; they battled through the hard times. These aged-care facilities are doing it so tough they have threatened closure. Surely this parliament, this nation, has a huge obligation to look after aged care. What is in it for them? There is not one cent in it for them. But for someone on $78,000 a year it is: ‘We will give you $950. Go and have a night at a restaurant, buy a heap of booze, do what you like—that will help us.’ But do not look after our elderly.
What about our pensioners? How long have we fought here in our parliament to help our pensioners? As I said, we supported the package last December because it actually helped our pensioners and our carers. What is in this package for our pensioners? Nothing. A single pensioner has got to survive on $273 a week. How can you survive on that? These elderly pensioners, who have done so much for our nation, now live on or below the poverty line. What is in this package for them? Not one red cent. But I tell you what is coming: it is the big bill on the MasterCard. It is coming because Labor is in charge of the bank.
Let us have a look at Labor’s history. Let us go back to the late 1980s and 1990s. Let us look at our states. Victoria went broke, with $60 billion of debt under Labor; South Australia went broke; Western Australia went broke; Tasmania went broke; and, had it not been for the Greiner-Murray governments in New South Wales, it would have gone broke as well. They were conservative governments that actually kept the show on the road. Queensland did not go broke because they had 30 years of National Party government and were debt free. That is what got them through the tough times. That is a fact. I know the truth might hurt some around here, but that is a fact. They were debt free. Being free of debt is something that the Labor governments in Queensland inherited. The government in this place inherited it, too. But we are no longer debt free.
Let us look at the time of the Hawke-Keating government. I remember the big blue when Mr Keating wanted to become Prime Minister. The little squabble started and grew into the big squabble. They introduced a Treasurer by the name of John Kerin. We had him in primary industries; you would be familiar with the bloke. He budgeted for a $3 billion deficit. At the end of the year it was $10 billion, three times the amount. That is not even a good guess. We have people here now saying that they are economically responsible conservatives. The Australian people know differently, because they know the past of the Labor Party managing money, and that is what it is all about. I have no doubt that we are in for a tough year—
—That is an understatement. It would be a lot tougher if you lot were in charge.
—Senator Sterle agrees with me. If you simply go and borrow and borrow, who is going to pay for it? It is easy to borrow money—I have borrowed plenty in my life—and it is darn hard to pay it back. We know that markets all around the world trade on sentiment, and we know that sentiment is very negative. I will give you an example. Just take the local cattle market. If exports are strong and there has been plenty of rain, plenty of pasture and plenty of grass and you go to buy some cattle, they are dearer. The sentiment is positive. Likewise, when the drought sets in, the cockies are out of feed, there is no pasture, there are big numbers of stock in the market—that is, there is oversupply—the market falls. The sentiment is negative. Sure, we have a lot of negative sentiment right around the world—brought about by foolish, greedy, stupid lending by those in the subprime institutions in America.
There is one problem we face in this world: with banks there is never a level of profit they are happy with. In Australia, if they make $4 billion this year, they want to make $4.4 billion next year and $4.8 billion the year after. They go on taking risks. All of a sudden the wheels fall off the cart, and what have they got? A swag of bad debts—$3.1 billion for the last six months. Sure, these are tough times, but patching that tyre or keeping it spinning around by pumping billions of dollars worth of air into it is not going to fix the problem. What will fix the problem is interest rates falling lower and growth through the private sector—the sector that actually drives our nation’s wealth. Then we can grow from the real part of the economy, not from governments borrowing and spending.
Remember the years of Keating as Treasurer and Prime Minister, when he said, ‘We are running at 3½ or four per cent growth’? Half of it was from money borrowed by the government. Then, when the coalition got into power, they inherited a huge debt. It took 10 years for the Howard government to pay off that $96 billion debt. As I said in my maiden speech, we surely were the envy of the world when we did. Now it has taken a bit more than 10 months for this government to plunge us back towards the same level of debt. If this $42 billion package does not save the nation—and I frankly say it will not; the tyre will still go flat—how much more are we going to borrow? Will it be another $60 billion or another $100 billion? ‘Just throw it on the MasterCard. She’s right; the next generation will pay for it.’ If we are looking at the $200 billion debt that this government is proposing through that bill, at five per cent interest, that is $10 billion a year in interest only. If it is a 20-year loan, it will be another $10 billion. The taxpayers of Australia are going to have to pay $20 billion in interest and principal. And it has to be paid. If we do not pay it, we will go down the road America has—that is, huge government debt and one huge financial mess.
Hence, I believe this package is reckless spending. It pays no attention to our elderly, our pensioners, our aged-care facilities or our hospitals the Prime Minister is going to fix. Well, good luck! I believe it is a package to bail out the Labor state governments that have neglected our schools, hospitals—there are no hospitals in this case, but the states are the ones who neglected them—and public housing et cetera. It is a cop-out for the financially disgraceful management of our state Labor governments. I refer to New South Wales. I think Mr Rees is still Premier. They change pretty often these days. I do not know how the factions and the warlords are getting on. But, on the way that state is managed, this package is a bailout of people like Mr Rees and shores them up for the 2011 election. He will need a lot of shoring up, that is for sure. Wouldn’t you agree, Senator Sterle? The package is too great. It will not keep the tyre inflated. The tyre will go flat and I worry what sort of borrowing will continue after that.
Finally, I will sum this up with a question. Why the rush? ‘We told the people the money would be there in early April.’ Labor expect the Senate to have a $42 billion package put forward and to rubber-stamp it. ‘Trust me,’ says Mr Rudd. ‘Trust me,’ says Mr Swan. ‘We will fix it. Just rubber-stamp it. It’ll be right.’ That is a disgraceful attitude. And now people are slinging off at us today because we want to scrutinise the package, to have a look at what is in it. We are copping flak for that, but to rush this through would be a disgrace. It would be an absolute betrayal of the Australian people. You would wonder why we even have a Senate. The government expect us to rubber-stamp this and pass it today. Thank goodness others around the chamber have the brains and the intelligence to take it easy, to have a look at it, to see what the government are actually doing. I appreciate their support on that. Let us be fearful of where this debt is going. I would imagine that, if this passes, it will be only a matter of months before we are back here discussing the next package—$60 billion, $70 billion, whatever it will be.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-02-05,"—Before I get into my comments on this package, there is one observation that I would like to make about something which I am sure has not been lost on others in this chamber. This is potentially the most significant package that has ever been put through either chamber. I looked at the speaking list and what did I see? I saw the names of coalition senators wanting to speak on this bill. Is there one member of the Australian Labor Party who has their name down on the speakers list to speak on the largest package that has ever been through this parliament?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Not one of them is prepared to stand up here and defend this package. Not one single member of the Australian Labor Party has their name down on the speakers list to debate this package.
—We all agree it’s great!
—Not one single person.
—The government is gagging you!
—I can’t wait to tell all the people in Stirling, Cowan and Swan and tell all the schools that you’re making sure they don’t—
—When the Australian people are judging the integrity of the Australian Labor Party in relation to this package, they will need to look no further than who is prepared to speak on this and who is not.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

 (Senator Parry)—Order! Senator Sterle, it is disorderly to shout across the chamber. Remarks must be addressed to the chair. If you have a point of order, please raise one.
—We have had interjections from Senator Sterle. I have had a look at the speakers list and I cannot see Senator Sterle’s name on there. So he is happy to sit in here and throw a bit across the chamber, but he does not have the intestinal fortitude to put his name down to debate it. After all the crocodile tears we have seen shed by the Australian Labor Party over the last decade about the role of the Senate and the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the actions of government, what did we see today? They tried to ram this package through without any scrutiny from the body that for 10 years they said was being stymied by the former government. It is probably the most hypocritical action I have ever seen in my life. They try to gag the debate; they will not stand up and put themselves on the line to debate it. What an extraordinary outcome and how incredibly duplicitous those people are.
—You have nothing to say about the bill, though.
—Another voice from the wilderness! Senator Marshall will love this bill because there is absolutely nothing in here which forces the government to look at the long-term ramifications. Senator Marshall is quite happy to bank-card everything. He is well known for supporting the nefarious activities of the Cain-Kirner government, which sent the state of Victoria broke. He is a member of the Australian Labor Party that was quite happy to defend that. He is not standing up here today, because debt does not worry him. It has never worried him and he is not worried about it now. He is not going to talk about it, but he sits across there with a silly grin on his face throwing some stuff across the chamber. Why doesn’t he have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and debate this?
While we are on people who are not prepared to stand up, I just wonder where Mr Darren Cheeseman, the member for Corangamite, is in relation to this bill. Mr Cheeseman, of course, has been running around saying, ‘There is money coming for the Princes Highway West duplication.’ We are talking about $42 billion, and where is Cheeseman in relation to this? Where is the member for Corangamite?
—Senator Ronaldson, you need to address members of the other house by their correct title.
—I picked two out of three. Where is the money for the Princes Highway West duplication between Waurn Ponds and Winchelsea? We are talking about $42 billion and you cannot even keep a commitment like that. I will be interested to hear what he says, although I suspect that Mr Cheeseman will not be speaking on this matter either.
The one key issue in this package is jobs, and it is the one thing that is missing from this package. It should be about jobs, yet there is nothing in this $42 billion package about jobs. You cry crocodile tears for Australian workers. There is nothing in this package for jobs. Before I go any further, we on this side of the chamber would like to know what happened to the 75,000 jobs that were lauded as the outcome of the last $10 billion cash splash. Where are they? We have not heard a word about it. We heard Senator Evans today saying, ‘People are arguing over 35,000 or 45,000 jobs.’ The reality is that he has not come into this chamber and said whether the 75,000 jobs were created. Now he is trying to play it down to 35,000. Is it 35,000? Is it 10,000? Is it 15,000? Once again, that $10 billion did not create jobs, and this $42 billion package will not either.
Where is the assistance to small business to keep employment high? There is no mention of small businesses. Very few of them will benefit from this. We need a fiscal stimulus which invests in the Australian economy in a way that makes the whole economy more productive, efficient and competitive. Of course, that is why tax cuts are so effective—because every business and household in Australia benefits from them. We believe that an element of the stimulus package should be that it lowers the cost of employing Australians so that we can both retain jobs and promote jobs growth.
— You’re a bit confused, Ronno.
—Senator Marshall is at it again. He is not prepared to talk on this matter but he is prepared to yap, yap, yap across the chamber. If you are so anxious about this, get up and make a speech. I will be looking forward to it. The reality is that the Australian Labor Party is hopelessly out of its depth. This is just the latest in a string of mistakes. Of course, we have the nonexistent inflation genie. Remember that the genie was out of the bottle. The Prime Minister and Mr Swan were out there goading the Reserve Bank to lift interest rates. They almost threatened the Reserve Bank to lift interest rates. You were told what the impact of that would be. You were told that this economy was in real strife. But, no, you had been running the inflation genie political argument for three months, and you were still doing it in the May budget. Everyone knew at that stage. Blind Freddie knew by May that if you were to put higher interest rates into this economy you would kill it dead. No, you were prepared to run the political argument because you had been on a political course for six months and nothing was going to stand in the way of cheap politics, certainly not killing the Australian economy dead. You were running this line about the inflation genie, and you killed this economy stone-cold dead. In May, you were still doing it.
Then we had the unlimited bank deposit guarantee. This is a government that is totally out of its depth. We had the cash splash before Christmas. I hope those opposite are proud of that outcome, by the way. I hope you will be similarly proud of the potential outcome of this cash splash. I would just like to read something from the Colac Herald to put all this into some sort of perspective:
Gamblers also broke the highest-ever spend on Colac poker machines for a one-month period in December with $756,000, or $24,387 a day, spent.
The December record smashed the previous record of $691,000…
If that is the outcome of a cash splash which you thought would benefit the Australian economy, then you need to have a good, long, hard think on what the outcomes of this one are going to be. If you think that an increase in problem gambling is an appropriate outcome of this cash splash, then you will stand utterly condemned for your behaviour. You have been lauding a very marginal increase in retail figures in December, which of course includes alcohol and gambling, which you are not prepared to talk about. I will finish these remarks after question time, but I just want you to think long and hard about this: are you members of a government that is prepared to put at risk the lives of people with a gambling addiction by making it easier for that addiction to grow? If that is an outcome that you think is appropriate, then say so. If you think problem gambling is not an issue, you say so. But you have to accept that one of the outcomes of this cash splash will be an increase in spending on alcohol and an increase in spending on gambling. You know that, I know that—we all know that. That is the only outcome from this.
Government senators interjecting—
—I see that this provides some mirth for those opposite. They think that problem gambling is something funny. They are all laughing and giggling over there. If they think that is an issue for mirth, then that is entirely up to them.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-02-05,"—Mr President, I have some further information from the Treasurer in answer to Senator Abetz’s questions without notice on 3 February on car dealers. I have already given him a copy. I seek leave to incorporate it.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Question:
How many car dealers facing closure as a result of the government’s bungled unlimited deposit guarantee have received new financing arrangements under the government’s special purpose vehicle announced last year?
Response:
In light of the global financial crisis, the Government’s actions in establishing the SPV were necessary to ensure the car dealers had immediate access to floor plan financing.
The announcement of two major car dealer financiers, GE Money and GMAC, exiting the Australian market reveals the challenges being faced by the industry.
The remaining finance providers—such as St George, Esanda and Capital Finance—have been quite active over recent weeks in financing a large number of former GE and GMAC dealerships.
GE and GMAC have also adopted an orderly approach in the wind down of their Australian operations. This is positive news for the Australian car industry.
The Government is continuing to work with Credit Suisse, the banks and the car industry so that when GE and GMAC depart, those viable dealers that need finance will be able to get it.
An announcement will be made in coming weeks on the actual size of the SPV once GE and GMAC close their books.
Will the minister explain to the Senate the definition of a ‘viable’ business, as outlined in the special purpose vehicle guidelines?
The SPV will support viable dealerships that are able to meet the normal credit approval processes of the financiers of the SPV.
Credit Suisse is providing the necessary technical support to develop the SPV. Treasury is also working closely with the major banks, Credit Suisse and its advisers.
Is it a fact that despite the government’s rhetoric the special purpose vehicle will not prevent dealership closures and job losses in the car retailing sector? Why won’t the government simply come clean and admit that this situation could have been avoided if it had consulted with and listened to the Reserve Bank before rushing to introduce its foolish unlimited deposit guarantee?
The Government’s actions in establishing the SPV were necessary to ensure the car dealers had immediate access to floor plan financing, as a result of ongoing global financial challenges.
The announcement by two major car dealer financiers, GE Money and GMAC, to exit the Australian market reveals the challenges being faced by the industry.
This placed great pressure on a large number of car dealerships and the Australian automotive industry more generally.
The Government’s actions in establishing the SPV supports the long-term viability of the automotive industry and forms part of the Government’s commitment to protect jobs in this vital industry and right across the Australian economy.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Automotive Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,23,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-02-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by senators today relating to the proposed economic stimulus package.
Paradoxically, in politics the truth often comes from unusual sources. This morning I was reading the Australian Financial Review and an article by a former Labor leader, Mr Mark Latham. He said this, speaking about Mr Rudd and Mr Swan:
They—
Mr Rudd and Mr Swan—
have jumped all over the financial crisis, not with a clear economic strategy in mind, but with an urgent sense of the political opportunity it presents.
This is not an economic stimulus package; this is a political stimulus package. A principal part of the package, as Senator Carr did say—and I agree with this—was the so-called second tranche of the education revolution. The government promises to provide a school hall for every primary school in our nation, at a total cost of about $15 billion. It sounds good. On the face of it, it sounds terrific. But I know of schools that already have a school hall, that do not have room for a school hall or that have even more pressing priorities. The opposition believes that schools should be able to determine how that money is spent—that school principals, school boards, parents and teachers know much more than a central government about how to spend money in primary schools. We should decentralise this back to the schools who need the money. That is why the opposition is proposing to again commence the Investing in Our Schools Program that was scrapped by the Labor government. Doing that was absolutely ridiculous. Labor have this view of a great leap forward, spending billions of dollars, and they do not even know if primary schools need it. School boards, principals and teachers know far more than the Labor government here in Canberra about how to spend billions of dollars.
The Investing in Our Schools Program would be far more efficient, because schools would set their own priorities; it would be far, far, far cheaper; and finally of course you do not have to deal with state governments. The fiasco thus far of the computers in schools program is all because it has had to go through the coffers of state governments. The great benefit of the Investing in Our Schools Program was that the money went from the government directly to the schools concerned and not through the sticky fingers of state governments—all the way to schools, principals, their boards, their teachers and their schools.
Thus far the education revolution has been a shambles. Just think of it. This is what is going to happen to the $15 billion that has been promised. The problem is the delivery of the service. What have we seen so far with the delivery of computers? One million computers were promised. At the end of the school year last year, how many computers had hit the desks of year 9 to 12 students across this country? I can tell you: about 10,000—one per cent of the computers promised. At this rate it will take 100 years for those one million computers to be distributed. So-called partnerships between state and federal governments have become an absolute shambles, with New South Wales in particular not wishing to take the computers because the federal government, until the other day, would not pay the infrastructure costs of those computers. Finally, when the federal government fessed up, they realised something—that their proposal was short-changed by $800 million. That is on Commonwealth estimates. It was short-changed, under budgeted, by $800 million. On this sort of form for the $15 billion now promised, it is not going to cost $15 billion; it is going to cost about $30 billion. It will be another shambles. What worries the opposition is not the commitment and the money; it is the fact that it has been impossible thus far for this government to deliver services to schools. Whether it is trade training centres or the Computers in Schools program, it has been an absolute fiasco. If Labor cannot put a computer on the desk of every year 9 to 12 student in this country—and they have not been able to—how the hell are they going to be able to deliver a school hall for every primary school in this country? It is absolutely impossible. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-02-05,"—When times change, when circumstances change, what reaction does a responsible, efficient, effective and caring government have? It changes its policy settings to cater to the new circumstances. We face in the forthcoming years the greatest economic challenge this country has faced—indeed, the world has faced—since the 1930s and the time of the Great Depression. That challenge facing Australia, the Australian people and the rest of the world is colloquially known as the global financial crisis. Its origins are now clearly understood. It is caused by a meltdown of net debt instruments around the world and a gross rundown of the availability of credit—credit that is usually accessed by government, by corporations, by families, by businesses to carry on the ordinary and every day part of business and private life. It is the equivalent of a national economy.
So what is the reaction of the Rudd Labor government to this acknowledged emergency, this greatest threat to our times since the Great Depression? It is to extend a hand, to work in partnership with the Australian people. We are working together, facing and fighting this challenge together so that the Australian nation can overcome this challenge and go on living the lives that they have created for themselves.
So we have this problem: a lack of credit, a lack of finance, an anticipated lack of spending by government and corporations, a decline in consumption and, in the short term, a decline in growth. That change in immediate circumstances requires a change in reaction, a changed response on the part of government. So what does the Rudd Labor government propose to do? It proposes to engage in a modest increase in spending of some $42 billion over a period of three or four years to stimulate the Australian economy. One-quarter of that increase in spending will go to families to assist them in meeting immediate demands and payments—this will immediately be reflected in consumption and spending—and three-quarters will be spent immediately, and over the next two or three or four years, on assets and asset building—otherwise known as infrastructure. So $10 billion for families and $30-odd billion for infrastructure.
And what is going to be the net result of that increase, that package of $42 billion spent over a period of three or four years, which is apparently of such concern that it has caused the opposition to say—before they have examined the bills, before there has been any inquiry—that when it comes to a second or a third reading vote in this chamber, they will oppose it? What is the net increase? The net increase in debt is going to be from zero net debt up to five per cent—a lousy five per cent.
I ask the question: what is the current average of net debt in all 24 OECD countries? It is 45 per cent of their GDP. And this modest—the proper adjective is ‘modest’—stimulatory fiscal package to be brought by the Rudd Labor government into this chamber in due course is $42 billion, which will result in a net increase in debt from zero up to five per cent—a minimal amount, a modest amount. As I said, $10 billion is going to be spent on immediate consumption to keep people in work, to keep businesses active, to keep jobs going, and another $30 billion is going to be placed, over time, into assets.
The net result is twofold. The opposition shrieks in horror, does not understand the consequence of the figure and says, ‘We will oppose this package,’ without understanding that the increase is minimal and modest—modest by the standards of any well-run country in this world. The example of that is the OECD, where their current average net debt is 45 per cent of GDP, and we want to go up to five per cent to keep tens of thousands of people in work. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-02-05,"—I would also like to take note of the answers given by Senator Carr and Senator Conroy in question time today. I must admit I concur thoroughly with Senator Conroy when he says that there will be some senators going back to their constituents this weekend to say ‘sorry’. But it will not be the coalition senators; it will be the Labor Party senators. If we are apologising at all, it will be for the indecent haste with which it has been attempted to put through this package. If you look at the number of emails that have come in, the number of phone calls that have come in, there is a small number that are saying, ‘Yes, give me the money.’ There are many saying: ‘I’m embarrassed. Why am I getting this money? I don’t need this money. There are plenty of people, like pensioners and the unemployed, who need this money more than I do.’ They are the ones who are going to be asking those opposite to apologise for spending a huge amount of money and for spending it in the areas that they are with so little notice of process as they go.
I was much amused by Senator Carr’s views on whether questions should be asked about the schools program. Why, he wondered, were we quizzing this package if we were not going to pass it? So we have the lovely double dip here from the government: do not query it, just pass it—oops, you are not going to pass it, so why query it? ‘Scrutiny? What’s that? We don’t want any.’ That is what this government is all about.
We have examples raised already by Senator Bob Brown about mistakes and errors in this package. If we are talking double dipping, let us look at some of the provisions that already involve double dipping. Parents who work part-time are quite likely to be eligible to receive the $950 twice. For students with jobs, there is also the possibility that a lot of them will be eligible to receive the $950 twice. Let us get this right. Let us look at this package with something that looks vaguely like scrutiny.
I was also quite interested to hear Senator Carr’s view about what happens in the real world. This is the same minister who boasted that he did not go to schools to find out what to do about computers; he went to the education departments. They were the ones who would know about computers. You do not have to go to a school to know what is happening in the real world, according to Senator Carr. We can see the result of that very poor research and that attitude in the very poor way, or the non-way, that the computers in schools program has been rolled out. What hope, what trust is there? That is certainly what P&Cs and schools are saying to us. What can we expect to be the reality of this program from a minister who does not understand what is really happening in the real world?
The problems go on and on. We have the suggestion that, for $14.7 billion, all 9,540 schools get a new hall or a new library. That is excellent for those that do not have one. That is excellent for those for whom this is a desperate priority. But of course they have not got a clue as to whether this is the case or not. Then we look at how this might be delivered in places like Queensland, by QBuild. This is a monopolistic government organisation described by Terry Sweetman in the Courier-Mail as ‘an organisation of monstrous inefficiency’. That comment was backed up just yesterday by talkback radio people who were quite keen on the idea of a schools package and quite keen on the idea of something that their schools actually want but who said that they do not want this delivered by an organisation universally regarded as ‘a costly, bureaucratic and inefficient monster’. This is yet another example of the poorly thought out results that you get when you try to bully legislation through the parliament.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-02-05,"—The Rudd government knows that it must do everything in its power to avoid a prolonged recession. This is about supporting jobs. We know that unemployment in this country is forecast to rise, and we are taking decisive action to contain it. Alternatively, those opposite can force families into unemployment, causing people to lose their homes, causing further deflation in housing values and, indeed, causing further collapse in the building industry, with people forced to sell their homes for less than they owe. These are the consequences of the current global economic crisis, and it is not the future that we want for Australian citizens.
The Rudd government has, on that basis, taken decisive action with its $42 billion investment to support the Australian economy and jobs. We know that there is an overwhelming and immediate case for our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. There is a global recession around us, and the outlook has deteriorated just so sharply in the past few months. We know Australia is better placed than many countries, but we cannot resist the pull of these international forces. That is why our Nation Building and Jobs Plan is so important, as highlighted by our ministers in question time today. It has been carefully designed to support jobs and bolster the economy in the short term. It has been welcomed by commentators for doing just that.
The key to this plan is laying the groundwork for having a stronger economy when we emerge from this recession. We will do that by investing in essential community infrastructure like schools, housing and local road projects. The plan is about supporting these local economies and local jobs. We are also providing support to families and individuals to ensure that we keep demand and consumption in the economy flowing in the short term. These are important economic fundamentals that clearly those opposite are blatantly ignorant of. We have a global recession that has wiped $115 billion off the government’s revenue and has brought our budget into deficit. In the face of the most serious global recession since the Great Depression, there can and should be no apology for choosing to support Australian jobs. Of course, the government remains committed to returning the budget to surplus once we are through this recession. There is going to be a debt to repay, but repaying a deficit will be much harder if the whole economy falls over on its arse.
—Senator Pratt, I suggest you withdraw that comment.
—I withdraw. We need to cushion the economy’s fall or it will fall much further. We know how hard we have been hit by this global recession. I see it in Western Australia, where we have lost hundreds of jobs already. We have lost 300 from Lennard Shelf and 180 from Cloud Break. We have 300 to 500 projected job losses at Argyle Diamonds. We have already heard about the 1,800 to 3,000 at Ravensthorpe. We have lost 300 at Mount Keith, 400 at Telfer, 190 at Koolan Island, 200 at Wicherina and 70 at Spinifex Ridge. Where are these workers going to go? We need to restimulate and create jobs, and the Rudd government is doing just that. We will create new jobs in communities throughout Australia in local construction, in our schools and through our investment in schools. It is a tragedy that so many Australians are losing their jobs, so the Rudd government needs to make no apology for pursuing these policies. When those opposite get their economics straight, they will understand that there are certain times when it is quite fine to move into deficit and support the economy and stimulate the economy so that it does not fall further.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-02-05,"—We all know when a government is in trouble, because it suspends rationality. It suspends trying to make a credible case for its policies. It suspends the capacity to make an argument. That was on display during question time this very day, as it was on display in question time towards the end of last year and earlier this week. From the government during question time, especially from Senators Conroy and Carr, we had polemic and we had rhetoric. We had a series of charges of a kind which we have heard before.
These charges are not new. They are of things like economic illiteracy and economic vandalism. These kinds of prescriptions, argued and directed at the opposition, have been made consistently over weeks, and certainly during this particular question time. And these are serious charges. Economic vandalism is a serious charge. Economic illiteracy is a serious charge, but we would be delinquent if we allowed them to stick because we are being lectured by a government whose capacity for economic vandalism knows very few bounds considering the time it has been in office.
Consider this. A few months ago the Australian people were being presented with the threat that the economy was under serious danger of increased inflation. The consequence of that was that the government spent hours, days, weeks, months trying to drive the so-called inflation genie back into the bottle. The government virtually intimidated the Reserve Bank into increasing interest rates and, having done so, caused great pain in the Australian economy and to the Australian people.
And then suddenly the government discovered that the threat was not inflation. Suddenly the government discovered that the dangers to the economy were elsewhere. So no longer were we worried about inflation. Increasingly we were unworried about saving or preserving; increasingly we were worried about the jobs which were now under threat from a deteriorating international economy. So what we got was not an injunction to save nor an injunction to increase surpluses but an injunction to spend. So towards the end of last year we had a $10 billion stimulus package, or thereabouts—the results of which were argued to be the delivery of tens of thousands of new jobs to the Australian economy, none of which have been delivered. What in fact has been delivered is a series of deteriorating job numbers. The economy is losing full-time jobs.
So, having failed with that stimulus package, what does the government do? It comes into the parliament early this week and tells us that we need yet another stimulus package. In blind panic—as the economy slows, as jobs disappear from the economy, as equity markets bounce around with no clear bottom, as companies announce decreasing profits—the government decides something has to be done. What do they do in this situation? Lemming-like, they reach for the solution that governments around the world are seeking. They reach for the stimulus package to spend money. They will spend a large amount of money. They will spend as much money as they think the Australian people will stand, in the hope that that will redress the dangers to the global economy.
This is an interesting proposition because it rests on an assumption. It rests on the assumption that stimulus packages actually make a difference. It rests on the assumption that you can spend your way out of problems. It rests on Keynesian economics. In that context I refer the Senate to an article that appeared in the Australian this morning headed ‘New Deal prolonged the Great Depression’ because all of these economic nostrums grow out of the experience of the Depression. That article by two eminent professors tells us that that is not the case. (Time expired)

Australian Government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Report:

Australia’s Public Diplomacy: Building our Image

This is the Australian Government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into Australia’s public diplomacy, Australia’s Public Diplomacy: Building our Image, as tabled on 16 August 2007.
The government welcomes the committee’s commendation of the work of Australian government departments and agencies, cultural and educational institutions and private organisations actively engaged in promoting Australia’s reputation overseas. The committee’s report highlighted the intense competition that Australia faces from other countries also seeking to be heard on matters of importance to them.
The attached response to the committee’s recommendations reflects the government’s commitment to continue to pursue Australia’s public diplomacy programs designed to positively influence the perceptions, opinions and attitudes of people overseas on Australia’s identity, values and ideas in a way that directly serves the advancement of Australia’s foreign and trade policy interests.

   

Recommendation
Position
Comment

Recommendation 1


The committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) give a higher priority to tracking opinions of Australia in countries of greatest significance to Australia as a means of obtaining better insights into the attitudes of others toward Australia. To this end, DFAT should devote appropriate resources to develop a capacity to conduct and evaluate regular assessments of attitudes towards Australia and its foreign policy.


Noted.


DFAT will continue to closely track overseas opinions of Australia to inform the development and implementation of public diplomacy strategies and activities.


DFAT posts report any significant media coverage of contentious or breaking issues, particularly those that may require a media response strategy.


The government acknowledges the role of opinion surveys in helping to shape public diplomacy strategies. DFAT commissions targeted research and opinion surveys in key countries and regions on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate and as resources allow.


DFAT will continue to commission opinion surveys, as necessary and often with other agencies, to evaluate overseas attitudes to Australia. DFAT and other agencies subscribe jointly to the Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index, a unique survey assessing attitudes in 20 countries towards 50 countries, including Australia, on a wide range of issues from exports, investment, education and science to immigration, governance and culture. Members of the Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy share the results of relevant opinion surveys on attitudes towards Australia in priority countries.


It is widely recognised that national reputations must be earned; they cannot simply be constructed. Image change is an incremental process that usually occurs, not in months or years, but over decades.


Recommendation 2


The committee recommends that the government’s public diplomacy policy attach greater importance to creating an awareness of public diplomacy domestically. It recommends that the government formulate a public communication strategy and put in place explicit programs designed:


to inform more Australians about Australia’s public diplomacy; and


to encourage and facilitate the many and varied organisations and groups involved in international activities to take a constructive role in actively supporting Australia’s public diplomacy objectives.


Noted.


Issues-based public advocacy, including on trade, counter-terrorism, arms control, the environment, migration, international development, agriculture and human rights, is vigorously pursued domestically and internationally.


Government departments’ communications units proactively explain foreign and trade policy objectives to domestic audiences as well as promoting informed and positive international media coverage and countering inaccurate information.


Public diplomacy products are used to reach out to domestic as well as international audiences. For example, the Australia Now Factsheets series on the DFAT website registers a total of almost 26,000 pageviews in an average week: approximately 35 percent of these relate to Australian domains and 65 percent to international domains.


Officials regularly participate in domestic conferences, seminars and consultations to advocate Australia’s strategies and policies on a range of foreign and trade policy issues with academics, NGOs, media and business.


The government supports a range of domestic organisations involved in creating awareness of Australia’s international activities, including through DFAT’s financial support to the Australia Institute of International Affairs which aims to raise the level of understanding of the role of foreign and trade policy in Australia and to provide a forum for debate on Australia’s place in the world.


Recommendation 3


The committee recommends that the government take a more active role in working with Australian educational institutions to develop stronger and more effective alumni programs for overseas students who have studied in Australia.


Noted.


The Endeavour Awards program offers educational, research and professional development Awards to citizens of the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and the Americas. The Awards aim to build enduring links at the individual, organisational and country levels.


The establishment of the Endeavour Awards Alumni Network is an important component of the Endeavour Awards program. The Endeavour Awards Alumni Network will promote bilateral and multilateral engagement between Australia and participating countries through the ongoing interaction of Endeavour Alumni, their host organisations in Australia and the government. The Network will also be a valuable tool in measuring the long-term impact and success of the Endeavour Awards.


Australian diplomatic missions abroad recognise the contribution that alumni can make to our public diplomacy efforts and are working with them to project a positive image of Australia. Similarly, missions draw upon the network of Australian studies programs in their countries of accreditation and look to those involved in these programs for support with the mission’s public diplomacy events and activities.


Recommendation 4


The committee recommends that:


all visitors’ or training programs sponsored or funded by the government have clearly identified public diplomacy objectives;


DFAT ensure that all government sponsored or funded visitors’ or training programs adopt a longer-term perspective and include measures or plans that are intended to consolidate and build on the immediate public diplomacy benefits that accrue from such activities; and


as an accountability measure, the organisers or sponsors of a visitors’ or training program report on how the program has contributed to Australia’s public diplomacy.



Noted.


All DFAT-funded visits programs have clearly identified public diplomacy objectives, consistent with the government’s trade and foreign policy priorities. They also require the results of the visit to be reported on against these objectives, outlining outcomes.


Performance indicators include:


the specific messages that the event conveyed;


how the event was used as a platform to promote broader aspects of contemporary Australia or Australian policies;


the number, level and influence of special guests attending;


the extent of the media coverage generated;


positive feedback from audiences/stakeholders;


levels of awareness achieved for the image being promoted;


feedback from touring groups on the level of support provided;


analysis of media coverage generated and the extent to which it reflects DFAT’s messages;


the extent to which perceptions have been changed or moderated in Australia’s favour; and


feedback from the target audience on the success of the advocacy efforts.


The Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy will continue to underline to all government departments and agencies the importance of incorporating public diplomacy objectives, consistent with the government’s medium to long-term international priorities, into their visitors’ and/or training programs.


Recommendation 5


Consistent with the findings of previous parliamentary reports, the committee recommends that the government consider introducing additional incentives for Australian students not only to study an Asian language but to combine their studies with cultural studies.


Noted.


The Australian Government places great value on Australia’s relationships with its Asian neighbours and recognises that one of the most important ways to strengthen these relationships is to provide the best opportunities for young Australians to become familiar with the languages and cultures of these neighbours, including China, Japan, Korea and Indonesia.


Three of the top six languages studied at Year 12 level are now Asian languages, with Japanese and Chinese the most studied languages.


The government is implementing the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program (NALSSP), which will commence in January 2009. Program funding of $62.4 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 will provide additional Asian language classes in high schools; teacher training and support; and the development of specialist curriculum for students who display advanced abilities in Asian languages and studies programs.


In addition to NALSSP, the government is providing $112 million funding through the School Languages Program (2005-2008) to support languages education generally, including Asian languages. The government also provides funding support to the Asian Education Foundation ($6.279 million from 2008-09 to 2011-12) to promote and support the embedding of the studies of Asia in the curriculum.


The Australian Government provides $2 million per annum for the Endeavour Language Teacher Fellowships Programme, which provides opportunities for intensive language and cultural study for practising teachers and trainee teachers, including teachers of Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian.


At the post-secondary level, the Australian Government is providing $789,000 to the Australian Council of the Deans of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities to undertake a study of innovative approaches to the provision of languages other than English through trialling selected collaborative models over 2006-2008.


Funding of $369,006 is also being provided to enable a consortium of four universities (the University of New England, the University of the Sunshine Coast, the University of Tasmania and Charles Darwin University) to pool Indonesian teaching and curriculum development resources; to undertake collaborative provision of Indonesian at the four core institutions; to offer “blended model” delivery at other regional universities; and to run a short in-country program at Universitas Mataram, Nusa Tenggara Barat.


Many of the bilateral foundations, councils and institutes offer a range of programs and support to encourage Australians to improve their foreign language skills and their awareness of other cultures. For example, the Australia-China Council (ACC) is a sponsor of the National Chinese Speech (Hanyuqiao) Competition for Years 10 and 11 Chinese language students. The ACC is also funding a national forum on Chinese language pedagogy in Australian schools in late October 2008 and part-funding a Chinese language curriculum project with the Australian National University’s China Institute. The Australia-Indonesia Institute funds an Australia-Indonesia Youth Exchange Program; partnered with the Myer Foundation and AusAID to fund a major program of school e-twinning and teacher training (2008-11); and funds a Schools Exchange Small Grants Program which enables Australian schools to arrange a placement for an Indonesian teacher.


Recommendation 6


The committee recommends that the government restructure the interdepartmental committee on public diplomacy (IDC) so that its functions extend beyond sharing information between departments and agencies to include coordinating and monitoring Australia’s public diplomacy activities. It recommends:


(a)
          
 more senior representation on the IDC than is currently the case - Departments should be represented at the Deputy Secretary level;


(b)
          
 expanding the functions of the IDC to ensure that it has a central role in planning and overseeing a whole-of-government long-term strategic plan for Australia’s public diplomacy;


(c)
          
 the IDC have responsibility for ensuring that the synergies among government departments and agencies are identified and exploited in pursuit of the government’s foreign policy objectives;


(d)
          
 the IDC produce a coherent public diplomacy strategy that outlines priority objectives for public diplomacy along the lines of the UK Public Diplomacy Board;


(e)
          
 the government’s public diplomacy strategic framework acknowledge the potential of local governments, particularly the major city councils, to engage in Australia’s public diplomacy;


(f)
           
 the government’s strategic framework take account of non-state stakeholders and adopt as one of its key operating principles in its public diplomacy strategy “work with others, including business, NGOs and Australian expatriates”;


(g)
          
 some cross membership on the IDC and the Australia International Cultural Council;


(h)
          
 the IDC produce a report on discussions and decisions taken at its meetings to be published on its website;


(i)
           
 establishing a sub-committee of the IDC with responsibility for ensuring that non-state organisations involved in international activities, including diaspora communities, are incorporated into an overarching public diplomacy framework;


(j)
           
 establishing a sub-committee of the IDC that would be responsible for ensuring that Australia’s public diplomacy stays at the forefront of developments in technology.


Noted.


The government will continue to ensure the appropriate level of involvement required for the effectiveness of the Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy (IDC on PD), noting that the appropriate level of involvement will depend on the issues to be discussed and the decisions to be taken.


The IDC will continue to take a strategic, coherent approach and will look at engaging other non-government entities and other levels of government. As the global environment changes and Australia’s public diplomacy objectives shift in response, we expect that the composition and role of the IDC will similarly evolve. DFAT, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and Austrade are already members of both the IDC on PD and the Australia International Cultural Council (AICC).


Recommendation 7


The committee recommends that if, after considering the above recommendation, the government is of the view that the IDC cannot or should not be the body to take on this leadership and whole-of-government coordinating and advisory function, the government establish an appropriate separate and permanent body that would do so.


Noted.


The government will continue to review closely the role and effectiveness of the IDC.


Recommendation 8


The committee recommends that the Australian Government explore opportunities for greater and more effective collaboration and coordination with Australian capital city councils in promoting Australia’s public diplomacy.


Accepted.


DFAT has written to capital city councils to draw their attention to the Committee’s report; to identify the Images of Australia Branch as a point of contact for overseas public diplomacy initiatives; and to invite them to explore opportunities for further collaboration.


The government currently collaborates with capital city councils in promoting Australia overseas on a case-by-case basis. By working together, we are able to ensure that Australia delivers consistent and well conceived messages to achieve mutually beneficial results overseas. For example, the Australian Embassy in Rome supported the City of Melbourne’s Melbourne in Milan Week in 2007. DFAT supported the visit to Melbourne by three Milan journalists to help publicise the event and supported the European tour of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, which included a performance as part of Melbourne in Milan Week.


Recommendation 9


The committee recommends that the Australia International Cultural Council (AICC) take note of the evidence relating to the coordination and planning of international cultural activities with a view to addressing the concerns raised in evidence. Close consultation with the relevant sections in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, DFAT and Australia’s cultural institutions would be central to AICC’s consideration. The committee suggests that a report of the Council’s deliberations and decisions be made available to the committee and also made public by publishing them on DFAT’s and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts’ websites (also see recommendation 6).


Noted.


DFAT, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) and their portfolio organisations, work closely with Australian cultural institutions through the AICC and will continue to do so. DFAT, DEWHA, the Australia Council and a representative of a major cultural institution serve on the committee which assesses AICC grant applications.


DFAT has established a distinct website for the AICC where information concerning the Council and its decisions will be published.


Recommendation 10


The committee recommends further that the government consider that the AICC be co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Arts and Sport. The committee suggests that this would contribute significantly to greater coordination and cooperation in the area of cultural diplomacy.


Accepted.


The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts will co-chair the AICC.


Recommendation 11


The committee recommends that the government establish a small but specifically tasked cultural and public diplomacy unit in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In liaison with DFAT, the unit would provide the necessary institutional framework, to ensure that Australia’s cultural institutions are well placed and encouraged to take full advantage of opportunities to contribute to Australia’s public diplomacy.


Not supported.


The government does not consider it necessary at this stage for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) to establish a separate cultural and public diplomacy unit because of the potential for duplication of role and function with existing Australia International Cultural Council support structures within DFAT. DEWHA will continue to maintain its current good working relationships with DFAT, the cultural sector and arts portfolio agencies in relation to cultural diplomacy activities.


Recommendation 12


The committee recommends that DFAT ensure that its public diplomacy framework accommodates the concerns of the educational institutions especially with regard to industry engagement by formulating with the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) and the Vice Chancellors of Australian Universities appropriate strategies to facilitate a more productive engagement by these institutions in Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


The government notes the role played by educational institutions in promoting Australia abroad. DFAT is exploring possible strategies with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and Universities Australia (formerly the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee) to further engage these institutions. DEEWR will continue to work with the Business, Industry, and Higher Education Collaboration Council (BIHECC) to increase collaboration between the higher education sector and other public and private business, industry, community and educational organisations.


Recommendation 13


The committee also recommends that DFAT initiate and sponsor a public debate on measures that could be taken to promote a more productive partnership between government departments and educational institutions in promoting Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


The government notes DEEWR’s Australian Education International (AEI) currently liaises with all sectors of the education and training industry and all levels of government to develop and implement targeted promotional and communication strategies to profile Australian education, science and training internationally. As well, AEI works with Australian and locally-engaged staff around the world to increase their understanding of the role of education and to build collaboration between agencies on public diplomacy matters.


Recommendation 14


The committee recommends that DFAT review the findings of the Lowy report, Diaspora, reconsider the relevant recommendations made in March 2005 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on Australian Expatriates and consider the evidence set out in this report with regard to Australian expatriates and Australia’s public diplomacy. The committee urges DFAT to formulate and implement strategies that would enable DFAT to take advantage of the significant resource of the diaspora and encourage Australian expatriates to engage more constructively in Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


DFAT acknowledges the significant contribution of expatriates in promoting Australian economic, social and cultural interests abroad. Australian missions are active in Australian expatriate communities and organisations, maintaining positive and productive links with the full range of expatriate Australians including professionals, business representatives, advisers, volunteers, consultants, artists, musicians and students.


Many Australian missions work closely with resident Australian companies and social groups to promote Australian goods and services as well as information and cultural activities. They frequently draw on business leaders, other prominent expatriates and informal networks in major networking and public diplomacy events, often using sponsorship from Australian businesses. Resident Australian artists and musicians are also engaged at post functions and exhibitions to promote Australian art and culture.


Recommendation 15


The committee recommends that DFAT conduct an independent survey of its overseas posts to assess their capacity to conduct effective public diplomacy programs. The survey would seek views on the effectiveness of the post’s efforts in promoting Australia’s interests, and how they could be improved, the adequacy of resources available to conduct public diplomacy activities, the training and skills of staff with public diplomacy responsibilities, the coordination between agencies in public diplomacy activities; and the level of support provided by the Images of Australia Branch (IAB) and how it could be improved.


The survey would also seek a response from the overseas posts on observations made by the educational and cultural organisations, noted by the committee in this report, levelled at the delivery of Australia’s public diplomacy programs. Such matters would include suggestions made to the committee that public diplomacy opportunities are being lost in the absence of an effective mechanism for the coordination of activities. See paragraphs 7.24–7.34 (alumni associations); 9.22–9.30 (cultural organisations); 9.41–9.44 (educational institutions); 10.23–10.39 (Australia’s diaspora).


Noted.


DFAT has in place a rigorous process for evaluating its public diplomacy programs to assess the implementation of activities and events and their impact. (See also performance indicators outlined in comments on Recommendation 4). DFAT’s public diplomacy programs are also reviewed annually as part of the departmental planning and review process to ensure they are: closely aligned with current national interest priorities; are appropriately funded; take advantage of developments in technology; and are well coordinated across target countries. These evaluations incorporate the views of other departments and agencies on posts’ performance.


Posts play a critical role in advocating Australia’s interests internationally. DFAT provides public diplomacy training to both Australia-based and locally-engaged staff at posts. The department also provides a range of public diplomacy resources and tools to all overseas posts.


The government has drawn the Senate Committee’s report to the attention of all posts.


Recommendation 16


The committee recommends that DFAT explore the application of innovative technologies to enhance the delivery of its public diplomacy programs.


Accepted.


DFAT will continue to explore the application of innovative technologies to enhance the delivery of its public diplomacy programs.


DFAT has undertaken a comprehensive review of its website and is making improvements to ensure it is a more focused and effective tool for public diplomacy both in terms of design and the timeliness and relevance of content. The website was used very effectively to communicate the National Apology to the Stolen Generations which attracted significant international attention.


Media releases, speeches, background documents and video are placed on the site and used by our posts in their own public diplomacy programs as well as by visitors to the DFAT website more broadly.


Recommendation 17


The committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, DFAT put in place specific performance indicators that would allow it to both monitor and assess the effectiveness of its public diplomacy programs.


Noted.


DFAT attaches high importance to evaluating and monitoring its public diplomacy programs and has in place rigorous mechanisms to evaluate performance, including a broad range of performance indicators (outlined in comment on Recommendation 4).


Recommendation 18


The committee recommends that, two years after the tabling of this report, DFAT provide the committee with a report on developments in, and reforms to, Australia’s public diplomacy programs giving particular attention to the role and functions of the IDC and the way DFAT evaluates the effectiveness of its public diplomacy activities.


Accepted.


Recommendation 19


The committee recommends that DFAT undertake a review of the nine bilateral foundations, councils and institutes (FCIs) with a view to assessing their effectiveness in contributing to the conduct of Australia’s public diplomacy. The review should consider, among other matters, whether the FCIs should receive an increase in funding.



Noted.


Over the past three years, DFAT has conducted a series of specific reviews of its Foundations, Councils and Institutes (FCIs), both administered and departmental, to establish their effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency in achieving the government’s foreign and trade policy objectives and to determine their ongoing viability.


Until 2006, funding for the International Relations Grant Programme (IRGP), which provides funding to the administered FCIs, was allocated as a four-year lapsing measure. In October 2006, at the conclusion of that four-year period, DFAT conducted, in consultation with the Department of Finance, an extensive review of the IRGP covering the period 2002-06.


This review, which was required to determine future funding for the IRGP, critically assessed each grant recipient against performance indicators measuring effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency. The review concluded that “the IRGP supports Australia’s objectives in international security, trade and economic performance, global cooperation and public diplomacy” and that the “IRGP is an effective and efficient mechanism for using resources and it is recommended that it be extended as an ongoing measure at its current level to achieve the Government’s foreign and trade policy”.


This recommendation was accepted and it was agreed that the IRGP funding be adjusted to be a program funded on an ongoing basis.


The following FCIs were included in the review:


the Australia-Korea Foundation (AKF);


the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII);


the Australia-China Council (ACC); and


the Australia-India Council (AIC).


The following DFAT-funded Councils were established permanently following DFAT reviews of their effectiveness: Council for Australian-Arab Relations (2006); Council on Australia Latin America Relations (2007); Australia Thailand Institute (2008); and Australia Malaysia Institute (2008).


Further, following review, the statutory Australia-Japan Foundation (AJF) was constituted on 1 December 2006 by Executive Council Orders as a bilateral body within DFAT on the same footing as other FCIs. The new arrangements have ensured a more appropriate governance structure for the Foundation and significantly improved its administrative efficiency and program delivery. With the repeal of the AJF’s enabling legislation, the Foundation’s program funding was transferred to DFAT’s International Relations Grant Program Administered item. The Foundation is subject to the same departmental performance reviews as other FCIs.


In addition to these specific reviews, as part of good governance arrangements, DFAT’s Senior Executive conducts biannual performance reviews of all the FCIs, both administered and departmental, against the department’s objectives, including public diplomacy. The results of these reviews are reported to the Ministers and are taken into account when determining funding allocations for the FCIs in the following year.


Recommendation 20


The committee recommends that each FCI produce an annual report to be tabled in Parliament.


Noted.


Eight of the nine FCIs currently produce annual reports, which are available on the DFAT website:


Australia-China Council


Australia-Indonesia Institute


Australia-Japan Foundation


Australia-Korea Foundation


Australia-Malaysia Institute


Australia-Thailand Institute


Council on Australia Latin America Relations


Council for Australian-Arab Relations


From 1 July 2008, all FCIs are required to produce an annual report for publication on the DFAT website. FCI financial statements and performance summaries are also included in DFAT’s Annual Report.

The document read as follows—
Australian Government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Report:

Australia’s Public Diplomacy: Building our Image

This is the Australian Government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into Australia’s public diplomacy, Australia’s Public Diplomacy: Building our Image, as tabled on 16 August 2007.
The government welcomes the committee’s commendation of the work of Australian government departments and agencies, cultural and educational institutions and private organisations actively engaged in promoting Australia’s reputation overseas. The committee’s report highlighted the intense competition that Australia faces from other countries also seeking to be heard on matters of importance to them.
The attached response to the committee’s recommendations reflects the government’s commitment to continue to pursue Australia’s public diplomacy programs designed to positively influence the perceptions, opinions and attitudes of people overseas on Australia’s identity, values and ideas in a way that directly serves the advancement of Australia’s foreign and trade policy interests.

   

Recommendation
Position
Comment

Recommendation 1


The committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) give a higher priority to tracking opinions of Australia in countries of greatest significance to Australia as a means of obtaining better insights into the attitudes of others toward Australia. To this end, DFAT should devote appropriate resources to develop a capacity to conduct and evaluate regular assessments of attitudes towards Australia and its foreign policy.


Noted.


DFAT will continue to closely track overseas opinions of Australia to inform the development and implementation of public diplomacy strategies and activities.


DFAT posts report any significant media coverage of contentious or breaking issues, particularly those that may require a media response strategy.


The government acknowledges the role of opinion surveys in helping to shape public diplomacy strategies. DFAT commissions targeted research and opinion surveys in key countries and regions on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate and as resources allow.


DFAT will continue to commission opinion surveys, as necessary and often with other agencies, to evaluate overseas attitudes to Australia. DFAT and other agencies subscribe jointly to the Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index, a unique survey assessing attitudes in 20 countries towards 50 countries, including Australia, on a wide range of issues from exports, investment, education and science to immigration, governance and culture. Members of the Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy share the results of relevant opinion surveys on attitudes towards Australia in priority countries.


It is widely recognised that national reputations must be earned; they cannot simply be constructed. Image change is an incremental process that usually occurs, not in months or years, but over decades.


Recommendation 2


The committee recommends that the government’s public diplomacy policy attach greater importance to creating an awareness of public diplomacy domestically. It recommends that the government formulate a public communication strategy and put in place explicit programs designed:


to inform more Australians about Australia’s public diplomacy; and


to encourage and facilitate the many and varied organisations and groups involved in international activities to take a constructive role in actively supporting Australia’s public diplomacy objectives.


Noted.


Issues-based public advocacy, including on trade, counter-terrorism, arms control, the environment, migration, international development, agriculture and human rights, is vigorously pursued domestically and internationally.


Government departments’ communications units proactively explain foreign and trade policy objectives to domestic audiences as well as promoting informed and positive international media coverage and countering inaccurate information.


Public diplomacy products are used to reach out to domestic as well as international audiences. For example, the Australia Now Factsheets series on the DFAT website registers a total of almost 26,000 pageviews in an average week: approximately 35 percent of these relate to Australian domains and 65 percent to international domains.


Officials regularly participate in domestic conferences, seminars and consultations to advocate Australia’s strategies and policies on a range of foreign and trade policy issues with academics, NGOs, media and business.


The government supports a range of domestic organisations involved in creating awareness of Australia’s international activities, including through DFAT’s financial support to the Australia Institute of International Affairs which aims to raise the level of understanding of the role of foreign and trade policy in Australia and to provide a forum for debate on Australia’s place in the world.


Recommendation 3


The committee recommends that the government take a more active role in working with Australian educational institutions to develop stronger and more effective alumni programs for overseas students who have studied in Australia.


Noted.


The Endeavour Awards program offers educational, research and professional development Awards to citizens of the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and the Americas. The Awards aim to build enduring links at the individual, organisational and country levels.


The establishment of the Endeavour Awards Alumni Network is an important component of the Endeavour Awards program. The Endeavour Awards Alumni Network will promote bilateral and multilateral engagement between Australia and participating countries through the ongoing interaction of Endeavour Alumni, their host organisations in Australia and the government. The Network will also be a valuable tool in measuring the long-term impact and success of the Endeavour Awards.


Australian diplomatic missions abroad recognise the contribution that alumni can make to our public diplomacy efforts and are working with them to project a positive image of Australia. Similarly, missions draw upon the network of Australian studies programs in their countries of accreditation and look to those involved in these programs for support with the mission’s public diplomacy events and activities.


Recommendation 4


The committee recommends that:


all visitors’ or training programs sponsored or funded by the government have clearly identified public diplomacy objectives;


DFAT ensure that all government sponsored or funded visitors’ or training programs adopt a longer-term perspective and include measures or plans that are intended to consolidate and build on the immediate public diplomacy benefits that accrue from such activities; and


as an accountability measure, the organisers or sponsors of a visitors’ or training program report on how the program has contributed to Australia’s public diplomacy.



Noted.


All DFAT-funded visits programs have clearly identified public diplomacy objectives, consistent with the government’s trade and foreign policy priorities. They also require the results of the visit to be reported on against these objectives, outlining outcomes.


Performance indicators include:


the specific messages that the event conveyed;


how the event was used as a platform to promote broader aspects of contemporary Australia or Australian policies;


the number, level and influence of special guests attending;


the extent of the media coverage generated;


positive feedback from audiences/stakeholders;


levels of awareness achieved for the image being promoted;


feedback from touring groups on the level of support provided;


analysis of media coverage generated and the extent to which it reflects DFAT’s messages;


the extent to which perceptions have been changed or moderated in Australia’s favour; and


feedback from the target audience on the success of the advocacy efforts.


The Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy will continue to underline to all government departments and agencies the importance of incorporating public diplomacy objectives, consistent with the government’s medium to long-term international priorities, into their visitors’ and/or training programs.


Recommendation 5


Consistent with the findings of previous parliamentary reports, the committee recommends that the government consider introducing additional incentives for Australian students not only to study an Asian language but to combine their studies with cultural studies.


Noted.


The Australian Government places great value on Australia’s relationships with its Asian neighbours and recognises that one of the most important ways to strengthen these relationships is to provide the best opportunities for young Australians to become familiar with the languages and cultures of these neighbours, including China, Japan, Korea and Indonesia.


Three of the top six languages studied at Year 12 level are now Asian languages, with Japanese and Chinese the most studied languages.

Program funding of $62.4 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 will provide additional Asian language classes in high schools; teacher training and support; and the development of specialist curriculum for students who display advanced abilities in Asian languages and studies programs.


In addition to NALSSP, the government is providing $112 million funding through the School Languages Program (2005-2008) to support languages education generally, including Asian languages. The government also provides funding support to the Asian Education Foundation ($6.279 million from 2008-09 to 2011-12) to promote and support the embedding of the studies of Asia in the curriculum.


The Australian Government provides $2 million per annum for the Endeavour Language Teacher Fellowships Programme, which provides opportunities for intensive language and cultural study for practising teachers and trainee teachers, including teachers of Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian.


At the post-secondary level, the Australian Government is providing $789,000 to the Australian Council of the Deans of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities to undertake a study of innovative approaches to the provision of languages other than English through trialling selected collaborative models over 2006-2008.


Funding of $369,006 is also being provided to enable a consortium of four universities (the University of New England, the University of the Sunshine Coast, the University of Tasmania and Charles Darwin University) to pool Indonesian teaching and curriculum development resources; to undertake collaborative provision of Indonesian at the four core institutions; to offer “blended model” delivery at other regional universities; and to run a short in-country program at Universitas Mataram, Nusa Tenggara Barat.


Many of the bilateral foundations, councils and institutes offer a range of programs and support to encourage Australians to improve their foreign language skills and their awareness of other cultures. For example, the Australia-China Council (ACC) is a sponsor of the National Chinese Speech (Hanyuqiao) Competition for Years 10 and 11 Chinese language students. The ACC is also funding a national forum on Chinese language pedagogy in Australian schools in late October 2008 and part-funding a Chinese language curriculum project with the Australian National University’s China Institute. The Australia-Indonesia Institute funds an Australia-Indonesia Youth Exchange Program; partnered with the Myer Foundation and AusAID to fund a major program of school e-twinning and teacher training (2008-11); and funds a Schools Exchange Small Grants Program which enables Australian schools to arrange a placement for an Indonesian teacher.


Recommendation 6


The committee recommends that the government restructure the interdepartmental committee on public diplomacy (IDC) so that its functions extend beyond sharing information between departments and agencies to include coordinating and monitoring Australia’s public diplomacy activities. It recommends:


(a)
          
 more senior representation on the IDC than is currently the case - Departments should be represented at the Deputy Secretary level;

 the government’s public diplomacy strategic framework acknowledge the potential of local governments, particularly the major city councils, to engage in Australia’s public diplomacy;


(f)
           
 the government’s strategic framework take account of non-state stakeholders and adopt as one of its key operating principles in its public diplomacy strategy “work with others, including business, NGOs and Australian expatriates”;


(g)
          
 some cross membership on the IDC and the Australia International Cultural Council;


(h)
          
 the IDC produce a report on discussions and decisions taken at its meetings to be published on its website;


(i)
           
 establishing a sub-committee of the IDC with responsibility for ensuring that non-state organisations involved in international activities, including diaspora communities, are incorporated into an overarching public diplomacy framework;


(j)
           
 establishing a sub-committee of the IDC that would be responsible for ensuring that Australia’s public diplomacy stays at the forefront of developments in technology.


Noted.


The government will continue to ensure the appropriate level of involvement required for the effectiveness of the Interdepartmental Committee on Public Diplomacy (IDC on PD), noting that the appropriate level of involvement will depend on the issues to be discussed and the decisions to be taken.


The IDC will continue to take a strategic, coherent approach and will look at engaging other non-government entities and other levels of government. As the global environment changes and Australia’s public diplomacy objectives shift in response, we expect that the composition and role of the IDC will similarly evolve. DFAT, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and Austrade are already members of both the IDC on PD and the Australia International Cultural Council (AICC).


Recommendation 7


The committee recommends that if, after considering the above recommendation, the government is of the view that the IDC cannot or should not be the body to take on this leadership and whole-of-government coordinating and advisory function, the government establish an appropriate separate and permanent body that would do so.


Noted.


The government will continue to review closely the role and effectiveness of the IDC.


Recommendation 8


The committee recommends that the Australian Government explore opportunities for greater and more effective collaboration and coordination with Australian capital city councils in promoting Australia’s public diplomacy.


Accepted.


DFAT has written to capital city councils to draw their attention to the Committee’s report; to identify the Images of Australia Branch as a point of contact for overseas public diplomacy initiatives; and to invite them to explore opportunities for further collaboration.


The government currently collaborates with capital city councils in promoting Australia overseas on a case-by-case basis. By working together, we are able to ensure that Australia delivers consistent and well conceived messages to achieve mutually beneficial results overseas. For example, the Australian Embassy in Rome supported the City of Melbourne’s Melbourne in Milan Week in 2007. DFAT supported the visit to Melbourne by three Milan journalists to help publicise the event and supported the European tour of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, which included a performance as part of Melbourne in Milan Week.


Recommendation 9


The committee recommends that the Australia International Cultural Council (AICC) take note of the evidence relating to the coordination and planning of international cultural activities with a view to addressing the concerns raised in evidence. Close consultation with the relevant sections in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, DFAT and Australia’s cultural institutions would be central to AICC’s consideration. The committee suggests that a report of the Council’s deliberations and decisions be made available to the committee and also made public by publishing them on DFAT’s and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts’ websites (also see recommendation 6).


Noted.


DFAT, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) and their portfolio organisations, work closely with Australian cultural institutions through the AICC and will continue to do so. DFAT, DEWHA, the Australia Council and a representative of a major cultural institution serve on the committee which assesses AICC grant applications.


DFAT has established a distinct website for the AICC where information concerning the Council and its decisions will be published.


Recommendation 10


The committee recommends further that the government consider that the AICC be co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Arts and Sport. The committee suggests that this would contribute significantly to greater coordination and cooperation in the area of cultural diplomacy.


Accepted.


The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts will co-chair the AICC.


Recommendation 11


The committee recommends that the government establish a small but specifically tasked cultural and public diplomacy unit in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In liaison with DFAT, the unit would provide the necessary institutional framework, to ensure that Australia’s cultural institutions are well placed and encouraged to take full advantage of opportunities to contribute to Australia’s public diplomacy.


Not supported.


The government does not consider it necessary at this stage for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) to establish a separate cultural and public diplomacy unit because of the potential for duplication of role and function with existing Australia International Cultural Council support structures within DFAT. DEWHA will continue to maintain its current good working relationships with DFAT, the cultural sector and arts portfolio agencies in relation to cultural diplomacy activities.


Recommendation 12


The committee recommends that DFAT ensure that its public diplomacy framework accommodates the concerns of the educational institutions especially with regard to industry engagement by formulating with the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) and the Vice Chancellors of Australian Universities appropriate strategies to facilitate a more productive engagement by these institutions in Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


The government notes the role played by educational institutions in promoting Australia abroad. DFAT is exploring possible strategies with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and Universities Australia (formerly the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee) to further engage these institutions. DEEWR will continue to work with the Business, Industry, and Higher Education Collaboration Council (BIHECC) to increase collaboration between the higher education sector and other public and private business, industry, community and educational organisations.


Recommendation 13


The committee also recommends that DFAT initiate and sponsor a public debate on measures that could be taken to promote a more productive partnership between government departments and educational institutions in promoting Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


The government notes DEEWR’s Australian Education International (AEI) currently liaises with all sectors of the education and training industry and all levels of government to develop and implement targeted promotional and communication strategies to profile Australian education, science and training internationally. As well, AEI works with Australian and locally-engaged staff around the world to increase their understanding of the role of education and to build collaboration between agencies on public diplomacy matters.


Recommendation 14


The committee recommends that DFAT review the findings of the Lowy report, Diaspora, reconsider the relevant recommendations made in March 2005 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on Australian Expatriates and consider the evidence set out in this report with regard to Australian expatriates and Australia’s public diplomacy. The committee urges DFAT to formulate and implement strategies that would enable DFAT to take advantage of the significant resource of the diaspora and encourage Australian expatriates to engage more constructively in Australia’s public diplomacy.


Noted.


DFAT acknowledges the significant contribution of expatriates in promoting Australian economic, social and cultural interests abroad. Australian missions are active in Australian expatriate communities and organisations, maintaining positive and productive links with the full range of expatriate Australians including professionals, business representatives, advisers, volunteers, consultants, artists, musicians and students.


Many Australian missions work closely with resident Australian companies and social groups to promote Australian goods and services as well as information and cultural activities. They frequently draw on business leaders, other prominent expatriates and informal networks in major networking and public diplomacy events, often using sponsorship from Australian businesses. Resident Australian artists and musicians are also engaged at post functions and exhibitions to promote Australian art and culture.


Recommendation 15


The committee recommends that DFAT conduct an independent survey of its overseas posts to assess their capacity to conduct effective public diplomacy programs. The survey would seek views on the effectiveness of the post’s efforts in promoting Australia’s interests, and how they could be improved, the adequacy of resources available to conduct public diplomacy activities, the training and skills of staff with public diplomacy responsibilities, the coordination between agencies in public diplomacy activities; and the level of support provided by the Images of Australia Branch (IAB) and how it could be improved.


The survey would also seek a response from the overseas posts on observations made by the educational and cultural organisations, noted by the committee in this report, levelled at the delivery of Australia’s public diplomacy programs. Such matters would include suggestions made to the committee that public diplomacy opportunities are being lost in the absence of an effective mechanism for the coordination of activities. See paragraphs 7.24–7.34 (alumni associations); 9.22–9.30 (cultural organisations); 9.41–9.44 (educational institutions); 10.23–10.39 (Australia’s diaspora).


Noted.


DFAT has in place a rigorous process for evaluating its public diplomacy programs to assess the implementation of activities and events and their impact. (See also performance indicators outlined in comments on Recommendation 4). DFAT’s public diplomacy programs are also reviewed annually as part of the departmental planning and review process to ensure they are: closely aligned with current national interest priorities; are appropriately funded; take advantage of developments in technology; and are well coordinated across target countries. These evaluations incorporate the views of other departments and agencies on posts’ performance.


Posts play a critical role in advocating Australia’s interests internationally. DFAT provides public diplomacy training to both Australia-based and locally-engaged staff at posts. The department also provides a range of public diplomacy resources and tools to all overseas posts.


The government has drawn the Senate Committee’s report to the attention of all posts.


Recommendation 16


The committee recommends that DFAT explore the application of innovative technologies to enhance the delivery of its public diplomacy programs.


Accepted.


DFAT will continue to explore the application of innovative technologies to enhance the delivery of its public diplomacy programs.


DFAT has undertaken a comprehensive review of its website and is making improvements to ensure it is a more focused and effective tool for public diplomacy both in terms of design and the timeliness and relevance of content. The website was used very effectively to communicate the National Apology to the Stolen Generations which attracted significant international attention.


Media releases, speeches, background documents and video are placed on the site and used by our posts in their own public diplomacy programs as well as by visitors to the DFAT website more broadly.


Recommendation 17


The committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, DFAT put in place specific performance indicators that would allow it to both monitor and assess the effectiveness of its public diplomacy programs.


Noted.


DFAT attaches high importance to evaluating and monitoring its public diplomacy programs and has in place rigorous mechanisms to evaluate performance, including a broad range of performance indicators (outlined in comment on Recommendation 4).


Recommendation 18


The committee recommends that, two years after the tabling of this report, DFAT provide the committee with a report on developments in, and reforms to, Australia’s public diplomacy programs giving particular attention to the role and functions of the IDC and the way DFAT evaluates the effectiveness of its public diplomacy activities.


Accepted.


Recommendation 19


The committee recommends that DFAT undertake a review of the nine bilateral foundations, councils and institutes (FCIs) with a view to assessing their effectiveness in contributing to the conduct of Australia’s public diplomacy. The review should consider, among other matters, whether the FCIs should receive an increase in funding.



Noted.


Over the past three years, DFAT has conducted a series of specific reviews of its Foundations, Councils and Institutes (FCIs), both administered and departmental, to establish their effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency in achieving the government’s foreign and trade policy objectives and to determine their ongoing viability.


Until 2006, funding for the International Relations Grant Programme (IRGP), which provides funding to the administered FCIs, was allocated as a four-year lapsing measure. In October 2006, at the conclusion of that four-year period, DFAT conducted, in consultation with the Department of Finance, an extensive review of the IRGP covering the period 2002-06.


This review, which was required to determine future funding for the IRGP, critically assessed each grant recipient against performance indicators measuring effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency. The review concluded that “the IRGP supports Australia’s objectives in international security, trade and economic performance, global cooperation and public diplomacy” and that the “IRGP is an effective and efficient mechanism for using resources and it is recommended that it be extended as an ongoing measure at its current level to achieve the Government’s foreign and trade policy”.


This recommendation was accepted and it was agreed that the IRGP funding be adjusted to be a program funded on an ongoing basis.


The following FCIs were included in the review:


the Australia-Korea Foundation (AKF);


the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII);


the Australia-China Council (ACC); and


the Australia-India Council (AIC).


The following DFAT-funded Councils were established permanently following DFAT reviews of their effectiveness: Council for Australian-Arab Relations (2006); Council on Australia Latin America Relations (2007); Australia Thailand Institute (2008); and Australia Malaysia Institute (2008).


Further, following review, the statutory Australia-Japan Foundation (AJF) was constituted on 1 December 2006 by Executive Council Orders as a bilateral body within DFAT on the same footing as other FCIs. The new arrangements have ensured a more appropriate governance structure for the Foundation and significantly improved its administrative efficiency and program delivery. With the repeal of the AJF’s enabling legislation, the Foundation’s program funding was transferred to DFAT’s International Relations Grant Program Administered item. The Foundation is subject to the same departmental performance reviews as other FCIs.


In addition to these specific reviews, as part of good governance arrangements, DFAT’s Senior Executive conducts biannual performance reviews of all the FCIs, both administered and departmental, against the department’s objectives, including public diplomacy. The results of these reviews are reported to the Ministers and are taken into account when determining funding allocations for the FCIs in the following year.


Recommendation 20


The committee recommends that each FCI produce an annual report to be tabled in Parliament.


Noted.


Eight of the nine FCIs currently produce annual reports, which are available on the DFAT website:


Australia-China Council


Australia-Indonesia Institute


Australia-Japan Foundation


Australia-Korea Foundation


Australia-Malaysia Institute


Australia-Thailand Institute


Council on Australia Latin America Relations


Council for Australian-Arab Relations


From 1 July 2008, all FCIs are required to produce an annual report for publication on the DFAT website. FCI financial statements and performance summaries are also included in DFAT’s Annual Report.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-02-05,"—Prior to question time, I was talking about the large amount of money that appeared to have flowed into poker machine venues and into alcohol as a result of that last so-called stimulus package. The Geelong Independent of Friday 19 September reported that pokies venue operators also reported an increase in business since the government bonuses began arriving. I was talking about the cash splash before also. The retail figures from December show that sales were only 1.24 per cent higher than expected. To put that in dollar figures, in spite of blowing $10.4 billion, retail sales were only about $325 million higher than they would have been without the package. So $10.4 billion was spent to get $300 million worth of effect, which is completely and utterly farcical.
The effectiveness of that $10.4 billion stimulus package is very much in question and the government are asking the Australian people to take them on trust in relation to $42 billion. We think that that is outrageous. There is nothing to substantiate the positive outcome of the $10.4 billion and $42 billion is obviously going to make that matter far worse. It is for that reason that we cannot in good conscience support a further round of cash handouts. While that might be unpopular in some quarters and it might be unpopular with some Australians, I think that most Australians know that it is the right thing to do.
I noticed with interest that Senator Conroy’s justification during question time for the $42 billion was that it would support 90,000 jobs. That is $466,000 per job. There might be some who are prepared to say that that is a penalty that we should be paying or that it is right for us to pay that amount. But the trouble is that we have had no evidence at all from the government that the so-called 75,000 jobs that were meant to be created by the last package—‘created’; the language has changed; it was ‘created’ and it is now ‘supporting’—were ever created. We have insisted, demanded and requested that they provide that information, but that has not been done.
For every billion dollars that we spend, every dollar of debt that we incur will have to be repaid by someone. It will be repaid by our children. In four years, net debt will be $70 billion, which is around $3,300 for every man, woman and child. The government wants to borrow up to $200 billion—something unprecedented in this country’s history. That is approximately $9,500 for every man, woman and child in Australia. We will vote against the package because we are not prepared to leave our kids with a massive debt legacy such as that.
Someone has got to stand up for the taxpayers of Australia to ensure that we are not imposing staggering levels of debt on future generations. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that we do not leave such a legacy when we have not been provided with any evidence at all that there was any outcome from the $10.4 billion stimulus with the way that the government spent it. There is no evidence at all that this provided a stimulus to the economy, but we have been asked to take on trust $42 billion. We are, quite frankly, not prepared to let the Australian people be saddled with that sort of debt without any evidence whatsoever that there will be a positive outcome. If you cannot substantiate 75,000 jobs for $10.4 billion, why should you be taken on trust in relation to $42 billion?
The coalition are unapologetic about the way we reduced debt during our last period in government. We did that through proper economic management. It was not achieved overnight, but we put in place a number of policies which eventually reduced the Labor Party’s $96 billion debt, left to us in 1996. We were paying approximately $8 billion a year servicing that debt, and that was just in interest payments. That was not repaying any capital. That was about $800 per Australian adult each and every year. When you compare that with the one-off payment of $950 being offered by Labor today, the comparison is clearly obvious. For a very short-term gain we are going to saddle our kids with a massive debt legacy.
The Labor Party have said that when the economy improves this debt will be paid off. Well, there was absolutely no evidence at all after the economy improved in 1991-92 that debt was reduced. In fact, my understanding is that, when the Labor Party were last in government, debt increased during a period of economic upturn. So why would we believe that this debt will be miraculously paid off when we come out of recession?
Look at how we survived the Asian financial meltdown in the 1990s and survived the tech wreck—it was because we had policies that strengthened the Australian economy and provided a buffer from the effects of those world crises. We lowered taxes and ran consistent budget surpluses. We reformed the waterfront and promoted direct negotiations between employers and employees. We put in the hard yards and the policy development that made the Australian economy the envy of the Western world.
In our view, Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, is not proposing a package that will deliver a stimulus to this economy. We do not believe that Mr Rudd will provide jobs as a result of this stimulus package. The only way this package can be judged is by way of jobs. That is the only reasonable measure with which to judge this package. We are not prepared to sit back and let the Australian Labor Party prevaricate about what happened with the 75,000 jobs for $10.4 billion and take them on trust on the apparent protection of 90,000 jobs. This is bad policy: it is bad for the country, bad for our children and bad for those who are saving. What the Australian Labor Party do not realise is that having this huge national debt will actually put upward pressure on interest rates. Even someone with basic economic knowledge knows that that is going to be the outcome of a massive debt. I plead with the government to withdraw this package and put in place a real stimulus.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-02-05,"—The world faces an unprecedented economic crisis, perhaps even greater than that of 1929. What began with the subprime mortgage scandal has now been internationalised and has undermined the economies of many countries around the world. Over 200 banks have collapsed, including some of the biggest and most prestigious in the world. It had been thought that Australia would be immune to this crisis because of the strength of mineral exports in our economy. However, it now seems now that most of our partner countries who buy our minerals are in recession, including South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, and we now hear that the Chinese economy is slowing.
While the consensus view seems to be that we in Australia will be relatively better off than those in many other parts of the world, Australia is facing growing unemployment as industry slows down, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. I suppose, to give them their due, the Rudd government have responded to the world economic crisis quickly, but the question is whether their response has been focused or effective. The pre-Christmas package was designed to stimulate retail spending, which it did to some extent. However, much of the money given to individuals has been saved, put back into mortgages, sent overseas to expats who will spend none of it in Australia or, sadly, wasted on alcohol, as we hear has happened in the Kimberley. The Rudd government’s prediction was that the package would create 75,000 jobs, but there is no evidence that any jobs were created, let alone 75,000.
The rationale behind the dramatic $42 billion package we are examining today is not clear. I believe the Rudd government has an obligation to the Australian people and to this parliament to provide details of the Treasury advice which prompted this unprecedented package—unprecedented in size and unprecedented in the urgency with which the government wishes to put it through.
From first principles, one would have thought that the objective of any stimulus package should be to create new jobs, reduce unemployment and ensure that money is spent on projects which will provide lasting benefits and ongoing employment opportunities for the Australian people. The question which has to be asked here today is: does the Rudd government package meet those objectives? Unfortunately, the answer is no, it does not. Of the $42 billion total cost, only $890 million—less than $1 billion—is to be spent on regional and local government infrastructure. That sum is supposed to cover regional roads and black spots and to install railway boom gates—not exactly a big infrastructure project, even if worthy in itself. There is then a $6.6 billion allocation to increase the stock of public and defence housing by building 20,000 new homes, which will be a great boost to the construction industry and no doubt create some employment, but there are no great projects or proposals for nation building which will create ongoing jobs in the remainder of the package. There are no Snowy Mountains schemes. There is no plan to build a national grid of six-lane highways to connect the capitals of this country. There are no plans to build a high-speed rail network between Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne.
In short, as I said, there are no great and visionary infrastructure projects which would leave a lasting legacy to this nation and create employment. Instead, we are given a $42 billion salad of minor measures. Some of these measures are useful, such as the $3.9 billion to provide free insulation to houses and solar hot water system rebates. But how many ongoing jobs will those particular proposals create? The answer, of course, is very few. After the Great Depression of 1929 and the election of President Roosevelt, the New Deal committed large amounts of funds to infrastructure projects such as the Hoover Dam, which successfully created employment and helped the great United States economy recover. This package does not match that kind of approach in any way.
We are told that the future of the world economy is uncertain. It is anticipated that the unemployment rate in Australia will reach seven per cent in 2009-10 and that Australia’s growth will slow to just one per cent in 2008-09 and reach only 0.75 per cent in 2009-10. In these circumstances, it is correct and proper for the federal government to be introducing an economic stimulus package. However, I repeat: this feeble package put forward by the Rudd government is not going to do much to provide ongoing stimulation to the Australian economy; nor is it going to provide sufficient ongoing jobs for our citizens to ensure that unemployment is kept at low levels. Instead, this package is a jumble of fairly minor and in some cases tokenistic gestures, the lasting legacy of which will be the creation of a huge budget deficit which will be a burden on future generations of Australians. It reeks of a panicked reaction.
Surely the Rudd government could have taken a more considered approach, with a smaller package and a greater focus on the need to provide funding for projects which would create much-needed jobs to head off the projected growth of unemployment to seven per cent. But, sadly, the record of ALP governments in doing that sort of thing is not good. From Whitlam in the 1970s, with the Khemlani affair, to Keating and Hawke in the 1980s and 1990s, who ran up a record $96 billion federal government deficit, Labor governments have not had much of a record in stimulating the economy and creating employment. Why should we have expected the Rudd government to be any different? Of course, they are not.
Let us consider the Rudd government’s record so far. Less than 15 months since their election, the government have taken Australia from having a fiscal position which was the envy of most countries in the world, with a strong surplus on top of money set aside for the future, to being faced with four consecutive budget deficits projected to total almost $120 billion. The Rudd government also put to this parliament only yesterday that it be allowed to take the Australian people $200 billion into deficit. I am sure that while most people would be quite happy to receive their $950, many of them would have no idea that the deficit that money has contributed to will leave every single Australian with a debt of $9,500 for a very long time. This debt will be the legacy of the Rudd government to the people of Australia in the future, when it must ultimately be paid back, with interest, through either more government cuts or higher taxes.
Compare that legacy with the legacy of the Howard government. It left Australia with one of the highest standards of living in the world, with a government budget strongly in surplus, with one of the best financial sectors in the world and with a record of growth which was the envy of the world—to the extent that the OECD said that Australia under the Howard government had one of the best managed economies in the world.
My final point on the Rudd government’s record so far is that we are being told that all this new money will create more than 90,000 jobs, yet there is no evidence at all to support this. That is not surprising, considering that we are yet to see any evidence that the last stimulus package created even one of the 75,000 jobs that it was claimed it would create.
In conclusion, all I can say is that this proposal does not address the very real need for the federal government to provide stimulus to the Australian economy, nor does it do anything to protect the jobs that so many Australians trustingly put into the hands of the Rudd government at the last election. This package is a terrible indictment of the incompetence of the Rudd government and their approach to dealing with the real problems that we will face in the future.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-02-05,"—Prior to the November 2007 election, Mr Rudd assured Australians he was an economic conservative and that he had a plan for Australia’s future. He also told the Australian public that being an economic conservative meant a fundamental belief in budget surpluses. It is February 2009, and it is now very clear to the Australian public that there was no plan, certainly not for budget surpluses. There were, however, political slogans and media stunts. It was all spin over substance, which we have become used to from those opposite. What we did not have from Labor was the hard work needed to develop an economic strategy to keep Australia strong, resilient and secure.
Actions speak louder than words. Those opposite have, in just over one year, presided over one of the greatest U-turns in the Australian economy—the strong, resilient, secure Australian economy that they inherited from the previous Liberal government. And all we hear from those opposite is blame shifting. It is always someone else’s fault. It is the fault of the global financial crisis. Never, ever, is it Labor’s fault. Of course there is the global financial crisis, and this has had an impact on the Australian economy. However, it is the gross mismanagement by the Labor government in its policy approach to the global financial crisis that has resulted in the unprecedented downturn in the Australian economy.
In the face of growing concern about the downturn in Australia’s economy—and on that point let us lay the blame squarely where it deserves to be: at the feet of the Rudd Labor government—the government has unveiled its ‘latest’ economic stimulus plan, a $42 billion package. Any rational analysis of the latest economic stimulus plan—and let us remember this is an analysis which Labor did not want us to undertake—will clearly show that it is an economic plan which has been developed out of sheer panic. This so-called economic stimulus plan is more evidence of Labor’s mishandling of the global financial crisis.
The coalition will not support a poorly thought out economic response which has all the hallmarks of a quick-fix solution cobbled together by an inexperienced Labor government. Despite the claims from those opposite, we on this side of the chamber recognise that, given the global financial crisis, there is a need to stimulate the Australian economy and to provide both short- and long-term strategies to help protect Australia’s future. However, the package proposed by the Rudd Labor government will not do this. What is being proposed is not a responsible or sustainable way to manage the Australian economy.
The difference between the approaches from this side of the chamber and from those opposite is that we on this side believe in protecting the long-term interests of the Australian people. We on this side of the chamber are keen to implement economic policies that are in the long-term interests of future generations of Australians. What we as Liberals do not believe in is a short-term gain that will deliver to Australians long-term pain. Political quick fixes and panic responses, which are a hallmark of the package now before the Senate, are not a responsible way to govern Australia. We on this side of the chamber are proud that we do not believe in saddling the Australian people with crippling debt that future generations will have to pay off. That is the legacy of successive financially incompetent Labor governments, and it is not a legacy to be proud of.
A key difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party is that we seek to unburden Australians whilst the Labor Party has no qualms at all with imposing crippling financial burdens on the Australian people. That is not responsible government; that is irresponsible government. With Mr Rudd’s attitude towards the passing of the bills before us, you would think that he was spending $42 billion of his own money, but he is not. This is not your money, Mr Rudd. It is not government money; this money belongs to the Australian taxpayers. It is their money, and if you incur debt with this money then you do not have to pay it back but mums do, dads do, their kids do and the bad news for Australians is their kids’ kids will also be paying back the debt that is going to be incurred.
The measures contained within the government’s proposal are not economically responsible. They are not in the long-term interest of Australians; they are short-term fixes. They are ill-conceived, inconsistent measures which are designed to provide short-term gain but which will end up creating long-term pain. They are not appropriate measures and will not engender confidence in the Australian public. That is why we on this side of the chamber made the very tough decision to oppose this poorly thought out package. Unlike Labor, we know that you do not make decisions because they are easy, you do not make them because they are cheap and you certainly do not make them because they are popular; you make them because they are right, and we made the right decision.
What Australia requires is a stimulus package that will actually stimulate the economy in the most effective way to deliver long-term gains. The objective of any economic package must be to generate confidence across the nation, not only to protect and support jobs, which is the script now coming from the other side, but also to create jobs, to support small business and—my goodness!—to actually strengthen the economy. The package that we have before us will not do this. We on this side of the chamber have stated time and time again that the most important issue facing Australians is jobs, jobs, jobs. When we look at this current package, there is very little evidence that it will generate or create new jobs for Australians. Let us face it: there is no evidence that the government’s $10.4 billion pre-Christmas spending spree created the 75,000 jobs that were promised by Mr Rudd. In fact, there is so little evidence before us of creating jobs that the script now coming from Labor is that they sustain jobs and protect jobs but no longer create jobs. There is a big difference between creating jobs and sustaining or supporting jobs.
The government’s mantra is spend, spend, spend, and if you do not have the money the government’s mantra is borrow, borrow, borrow and then you, the poor taxpayer or your children or your grandchildren, can always pay it back later. It may be fun for Labor to dramatically increase borrowings in the short term, but the reality is the nation is being saddled with massive future debts. Have we heard anything from the Rudd Labor government about increased long-term debt? Of course not, because they know that, when the Liberals next come to government, we, as we always do, will clean up the mess that they have made of the Australian economy.
The Rudd government is carrying on the proud tradition of successive state and federal Labor governments of plunging us into debt. As has been stated, you are addicted to debt. It is not a good addiction, but we on this side are prepared to help those opposite with their addiction. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has stated that he is prepared to sit down and discuss with the Prime Minister the appropriate form of responses to the economic situation. The Prime Minister, however, has rejected this offer. One needs to ask oneself: why would the Prime Minister reject such an offer? This is a Prime Minister who earlier this year wanted bipartisan support. Is it because he is panicking and running scared because he does not want his mishandling of the economy exposed? Why would the Prime Minister not sit down and speak with an opposition that, through long experience and a legacy of an outstanding economic record, knows that prudent management of the budget is the key to a strong economy in the long term?
On that point, for the benefit of those on the other side, because I know you all love to hear it, let us once again set down the coalition’s proud record of managing the economy. Labor inherited a world-class regulatory system with a strong banking and financial sector. Labor also inherited a $20 billion budget surplus and almost $70 billion in savings from the coalition. The coalition had paid off the $96 billion debt left by the previous Labor government, unemployment was at its lowest in 30 years, inflation was at historically low levels and Australia’s AAA credit rating was restored after it was lost under the previous Labor government. What have we seen from Rudd Labor since day one? Economic incompetence. What an outstanding piece of economic insight the now astonishingly quiet inflation genie that Treasurer Wayne Swan declared could only be fought by the Reserve Bank raising interest rates turned out to be. Labor’s doomed bank guarantee, which resulted in the freezing of the investment fund savings of a quarter of a million Australians and has caused a massive dislocation in financial markets, continues to cause problems. But it gets better—the $10.4 billion cash splash which the Labor government claimed would create 75,000 jobs. There is no evidence of those jobs; they certainly did not do what Mr Rudd promised.
But having just failed in its $10.4 billion cash-splash, Mr Rudd is now panicking and is asking us on this side to support a $42 billion cash splash—‘Do not scrutinise it, just support it.’ It is now clear that the Rudd government has panicked and that spending is more than out of control; it is train crash material. The government is determined to leave a debt legacy for future generations of Australians. Mr Rudd is a populist and will make decisions based on a short-term fix or a quick political gain. His financial management of this country is failing the Australian people. To gamble a sizeable chunk of Australia’s wealth in one hit is clearly the response of a government that is either devoid of sound economic policy or has well and truly run out of tricks. You cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat this time.
We on this side know that the decision to oppose the Rudd government’s debt-fuelled, spending-splurge cash splash or ‘throw it up against a wall’ approach to managing the Australian economy is the right decision. The coalition are committed to sound economic management and our record stands on that point. We want to ensure that government spending is of a high quality and reduces the burden on the Australian taxpayers and their children. We cannot support policy that does not spend the Australian taxpayers’ money wisely. That is not economically responsible and that, Mr Rudd, is not what an economic conservative does.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-02-05,"—These are serious times, of course, and serious times require serious action, not just any action but serious action. I know that politicians in the face of a crisis want to do something, they want to be seen to be doing something, but just doing ‘something’ just to be seen to be doing ‘something’ is not enough. Serious times require serious consideration of what is the best way forward for Australia. It requires serious engagement between government and opposition, not a government that comes in here and says: ‘Take it or leave it. We want to spend $42 billion of taxpayers’ money. Just roll over and within 36 hours we want to sign off on it.’ That is sheer arrogance. It is reckless and irresponsible and for the government to even expect that we would go along with it is just breathtaking. We have the responsibility to give serious consideration to this legislation to ensure that what we do here in Canberra does not make things worse across Australia.
Yes, we are facing a serious and significant economic challenge, but this package is not the answer. This is a reckless package. It is a misguided, ill-thought-out package. It is a package put out by a government in panic mode. Faced with a global economic downturn, the government has pushed the panic button instead of coming up with some real solutions. Faced with a global economic downturn, Labor have reverted to type—spend, spend, spend; tax, tax, tax; borrow, borrow, borrow—like Senator Cash has just said. They are spending like drunken sailors: ‘Let’s throw some more money at the wall and see what happens.’
This latest Labor government continues, of course, in the bad tradition of previous Labor administrations. Labor has a history of mismanaging our economy. Under Paul Keating it was the ‘recession we had to have’ and a $96 billion deficit. Today under Prime Minister Rudd it is a deficit we have to have—and a $111 billion deficit at that. And let us not forget the socialism we had to have under Gough Whitlam or the bank nationalisation we had to have under Ben Chifley. What else are we going to have? Are we going to put the economic potential of this great nation of ours at risk under future Labor administrations? At the end of the day, every time Labor has been in charge of the economy it has ended up in tears, with the Australian people having to foot the bill.
If the government happens to be successful in getting this package through, this will also end up in tears and it will be the Australian people yet again who will have to foot the bill. This $42 billion package does nothing to fix the problems we are facing. This package will actually make things worse. This package is reckless, it is ineffective and it is the wrong way to go. How did the government want the opposition to deal with this? They wanted us to rubber-stamp $42 billion in additional spending. They wanted this parliament, the parliament representing the people of Australia, to approve $42 billion in spending in less than 36 hours—more than one billion dollars per hour of scrutiny. To expect us to go along with this is just scandalous.
The Leader of the Government in the Senate was having a go at the opposition in question time yesterday—he did it again today and he did it this morning as he was introducing this legislation—because we were not prepared to give up our job of holding the government to account. I made the odd interjection yesterday in question time and on one interjection I was pulled up by the President for calling the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, a hypocrite, and I withdrew—
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Cormann, I do not think it is appropriate for you, under the guise of referring to a ruling that was made yesterday, to repeat that in the manner you have and I ask you to refrain from so doing.
—I would like to seek a formal ruling on that, because I have not actually reflected on Senator Evans in any way. What I want to do and what I intended to do is explain why I think the comments by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in question time yesterday and again this morning were hypocritical. I had a private conversation with the President of the Senate yesterday and he advised me very clearly on what I was able to do and not able to do, but if your ruling is different from what the President of the Senate advised me yesterday privately then I will take your guidance.
—I am happy to seek the guidance of the President. What I did was draw your attention to where I believe you were straying into unparliamentary remarks. It is not appropriate, nor is it in order—in fact, I understand it is a breach of the standing orders—to repeat, by way of quotation, remarks which have already been called unparliamentary. I would ask you to return to your speech on the matter before the chamber.
—Let me explain why I think the comments made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in question time yesterday and again this morning after introducing these bills into the Senate, having a go at us for insisting on some appropriate levels of scrutiny, were hypocritical. In doing so I quote from a speech that Senator Evans gave to the Subiaco branch of the Australian Labor Party, at the Irish Club in Subiaco on 28 June 2007—less than two years ago—at 6.30 pm:
Labor recognises the role and value of an empowered Senate. Our support for the Senate has grown as it has developed into an effective political institution.
Now, listen to this:
... ... ...
Labor—in government or opposition—supports the Senate as a strong house of review, scrutiny and accountability.
The fact is that the Australian Parliament constructed better legislation when governments had to negotiate and argue their case in the Senate. We got better legislation when Bills were thoroughly scrutinised by committees, the public had their input and governments were forced to listen and respond.
That is why I think that the comments that the leader of the government made in the Senate yesterday and again today are hypocritical.
We are talking about spending $42 billion of taxpayers’ money. We are talking about a package that the Australian has described as ‘Rudd goes for broke’. Let us reflect on that just for a moment. ‘Rudd goes for broke’, according to the Australian, refers to none other than the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia. When the Prime Minister goes for broke, the whole of Australia goes for broke. When the Prime Minister goes for broke, he forces Australians to go for broke. Australians have seen too many Labor prime ministers going for broke before. I put it to you that Australians do not want Australia to go for broke. Australians want a government that manages the economy carefully, skilfully and effectively. Australians want a government committed to sound and sensible economic management.
It is important to remember that governments cannot actually inject new money into the economy. Whatever the current government may believe, this is a very important reality. I do not think that this administration has quite understood it. Governments cannot inject new money into the economy. All that governments can do is redistribute money they have taken out of the economy by taxing individual Australians or businesses of today and tomorrow. They are forcing future generations of Australians to pay more in taxes to repay a significant borrowing of up to $111 billion or $200 billion, according to the package that this government is going to impose on future generations.
Would this $42 billion generate economic activity? Of course it would—$42 billion is a lot of money—but what sort of economic activity? All that the $42 billion package would do, by throwing more money at the wall, is create artificial demand—and, not only that, it will create artificial supply. You will have all those people out there with a ute in the back of their garage offering insulation. Whether they currently specialise in it or are responding to a genuine demand does not matter; the government is now creating artificial supply and artificial demand that does not correlate to genuine demand. What happens when the money runs out? Guess what—even $42 billion runs out one day. As soon as that $42 billion runs out, you will have all those people used to this government’s largesse coming through responding to a demand that is not real demand and responding to a demand that was created by government intervention.
What will happen to unemployment? The government will say, ‘All those people will be unemployed. Let’s put some more money out there, let’s create some more artificial demand and let’s create some more artificial supply,’ rather than let the market decide what it is that individual Australians want or need. Here we have a government who think: ‘We’ll take some money from these taxpayers over here and we’ll decide how you should spend it; we’ll decide how it is best allocated. Whether you need it or whether you want it, it doesn’t matter.’
Governments are not better at distributing resources in a more productive way than individuals. The arrogance of the government in the way they want to push this through the Senate is breathtaking. Labor wanted us to rubber-stamp this within 36 hours, without scrutiny, without asking too many questions. Have the government given us any reason to have confidence in their capacity to manage the economy? Have they given us any reason over the last 14 months to be prepared to sign a blank cheque?
Let us reflect on what has happened over the last 14 months. Before the last election we had the then Leader of the Opposition deceiving the Australian people into believing that he is an economic conservative, when now all he is is good old-fashioned Comrade Kevin. We had the inflation genie ‘out of the bottle’. They were talking up inflation and talking up interest rates for political purposes, even though that was not in the best interests of the Australian people and even though that was not in the best interests of the Australian economy. What has happened to the inflation genie? Have we heard about the inflation genie in recent months? It has gone, hasn’t it? Yes, it has.
Then we have the budget. In the lead-up to the budget, all the rhetoric was that we had to cut spending and it was going to be a tough budget. What happened? The government increased spending by $15 billion. They increased taxes by $20 billion. That was the only way that they were able to keep any sort of surplus at budget time: increasing taxes by $20 billion. When Labor came into government just over a year ago, they took over a $22 billion surplus. Now we are talking about temporary deficits. The reality is this: deficits under Labor are never temporary; they never are. Labor have got a plan to get us into deficit; they do not have a plan to get us out of deficit. We have the bank guarantee fiasco, and I do not even have to go into the detail of that as I am sure that the Senate well remembers the fiasco of the unlimited bank guarantee. Take the $10.4 billion cash splash. What has that done?
While all this has been going on, we have got the government telling us this is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That is what has been said in this chamber again over the last couple of days and that is what I have heard Labor ministers, including the Prime Minister, say in recent weeks. If it is the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, why aren’t they having a more serious look at the impact of their proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? Why don’t they even model the impact on the economy and the impact on jobs of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, an additional tax on carbon in the context of the global financial crisis? Treasury admitted that they have not done that. They have not done their job. From Paul Howse of the Australian Workers Union to Dr Brian Fisher, who has done some modelling for the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, a whole range of responsible and good people are calling on the government to do the responsible thing and conduct that modelling. But, no, they say, ‘Who cares? It’s not necessary. We’ve done modelling even though we haven’t looked at that.’ It cannot be so bad then if in the government’s view they do not think it is necessary to model the impact of the global financial crisis on their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It cannot be so bad in your mind, can it? I do not really understand where the government are coming from. While I am thinking of that, and while we are talking about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, I note that in the United States one of the things that President Obama—and Kevin Rudd is keen to be associated with the new momentum of President Obama—is doing is actually becoming more protectionist. Have you heard about this? President Obama is introducing some more protectionist policies in the United States of America to actually—

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—Yes, I know; you spoke out against it.
—Order! Senators! Senator O’Brien, you will endeavour to refrain from interjecting. Senator Cormann, you will address your remarks through the chair. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you will not speak while I am addressing the chamber.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is actually a very important point. This is a quite critical point for jobs, particularly in the steel industry. President Obama is seeking to support the steel industry in the United States at the expense of the steel industry here in Australia by introducing protectionist policies in the United States. At the same time this government is looking at implementing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which is going to impose additional costs on our exporters and which is going to make it more attractive for importers and which is going to make it more difficult for Australian manufacturers to export overseas. How does all of that fit together? How can this government think that it is not economically responsible to do some proper, thorough Treasury modelling into the economic impact of its proposed CPRS, particularly in the context of a changed world environment and in the context of some of the things that are happening overseas, particularly in the United States of America?
We have got this $42 billion cash splash. What is this going to do? It is going to end up with us having $111 billion worth of debt, for starters, and even up to $200 billion of debt, with a $9,500 debt for every Australian. This is absolute panic stuff, in the great tradition of the Labor Party. There is absolutely no doubt that this is Whitlamesque. I read comments by some commentators in the Australian who were critical of coalition members of parliament making that association. But let us reflect on that. Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister at a time of international economic turmoil. Kevin Rudd is Prime Minister at a time of international economic turmoil. Gough Whitlam thought he could spend his way out of trouble. Kevin Rudd thinks he can spend his way out of trouble. Gough Whitlam went to great lengths to borrow more and more money when he was getting into trouble because he could not keep up with it all. Kevin Rudd wants to borrow more and more money. Kevin Rudd wants to increase our bank card to $200 billion—a staggering $200 billion. It is mind-boggling. Senators opposite are going to go down in the history of Australia as having been complicit in taking Australia into the largest debt ever in the history of the Commonwealth. In 20 years time people will look back at this chamber’s members and they will say, ‘What did those senators do? Why didn’t they do their job? Why didn’t they hold the government to account? Why didn’t they stop this from happening?’ We have on the other side senators who are not even prepared to stand up and talk about it. Do you know why? The government has told the senators on the other side not to participate in the debate, so they just shut up.

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—Are you allowed to speak in this debate?

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—Order! Senator O’Brien, I have asked you previously to cease interjecting and I have asked Senator Cormann not to respond.
—But—
—Excuse me, Senator! I was about to ask Senator Cormann to address his remarks through the chair rather than debate across the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is it in order for the senator to fabricate the position of a senator across the chamber? Is that a misrepresentation or a reflection?
—Senator O’Brien, that is not a point of order. And I might just, while I am speaking, remind Senator Cormann that it is appropriate, if you refer to a member of the other house or the Prime Minister, to address them in the appropriate manner—by their title or Mr or Mrs.
—Senators on the other side are very touchy, aren’t they? Very, very touchy, aren’t they, those senators on the other side? Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to know whether one of those senators is actually going to participate in this debate, because I believe—and I am happy to stand corrected; I am happy for a senator on the other side to get up, ask for the call and correct my statement—that senators on the other side have been told by their government not to participate in this debate. I believe that senators on the other side have been told not to scrutinise, not to speak, not to in any way question or participate in the debate about this $42 billion package. In my view, they are just sitting there and not doing their job. The point I am making is that senators on the other side will go down in Australian history as not having done their job at a crucial time. At a time when we are facing significant economic challenges, the Labor side—in this Senate, at least—were not prepared to participate in this debate.
I will sum up by going back to where I started. These are serious times—of course they are. These are serious times which require serious action, not just any action. This package is not serious. The way the government have sought to rush this package of bills through the parliament is not serious. The way the government are treating this debate is not serious. If the government were serious about doing the right thing by the Australian people, if the government were serious about doing something that is going to help take the Australian economy forward, they would engage sincerely with the opposition. They would take up the offer of Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, to engage constructively with the opposition and have a discussion about how we can come up with a more sensible package, a package that is actually going to make a difference.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-02-05,"—When we come into this place, those of us on this side of the chamber have a very firm belief that we have a responsibility to ensure a secure future for the Australian people. That is what we believe; that is a priority. That is absolutely what we strive to do every single day. There is no doubt that we are facing very serious times, as my colleague Senator Cormann said. We are facing very difficult times.
This package of bills that we are looking at, the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and related bills brought to us by the Labor government, is $42 billion worth of economic stimulation, according to them—a $42 billion package that, according to them, is designed to stimulate the economy in these difficult times. Earlier today, my colleague Senator Mason pointed out that in fact it is not an economic stimulus; it is a political stimulus. You barely have to scratch the surface of this package to realise that it is not going to deliver the economic stimulus that is needed. That is what we on this side believe, and that is the reason why we are not supporting these bills.
The primary intent of this legislation is not going to be achieved. Labor wants to have that economic stimulus; we do not believe it is there. You do not have to go very far into this package to see that political stimulus. All the hype and media focus is on the package providing an economic stimulus, but, if you drill down—and if the media has a close look—line by line through this package, you see that it smacks of political stimulus.
One of the quite extraordinary things about this is the absolute arrogance of the Labor government in asking the coalition to tick off on this package within a matter of 48 hours. That is just extraordinary. It is even more extraordinary when you go back to when the coalition were in government—and you do not have to go back very far—and see that we were subjected to hours and hours of railing from the then opposition, from this side of the chamber, that they were not able to scrutinise legislation, that they were not able to look at things properly, that it was a dereliction of duty that they were not able to have a good look at legislation. And now what do we see? We see that very same Labor Party sitting on the other side saying, ‘Rush it through, tick it off, don’t look at it, don’t scrutinise it; we don’t want you to say a thing about this after any scrutiny—just tick it off.’ I do not know about anybody else, but to me that position is the direct opposite of the one they had when they sat over here. Now they have moved over there, they have decided that it is quite all right to rush stuff through and expect the coalition to tick it off, thank you very much.
Senator Cormann made some comments earlier about the hypocritical nature of that. I will just say that it is extraordinary, and the Australian people should look at what the Labor Party did when they were in opposition compared to what they are doing now they are in government. It is $42 billion—that is, $42,000 million—and the Rudd government expected the Liberal and National parties to say: ‘That’s fine, Prime Minister; you just pop that right on through. I’m sure the Australian people will be fine if we tick off on $42 billion worth of their money without having a look at it! But, sure, we’ll just go right ahead and do that.’ We do not think so. We want to have appropriate scrutiny of these bills. It is right and it is proper and it is fair, and the Australian people deserve it.
My very good colleague Senator Joyce said earlier today, ‘Why the haste?’ What difference do a few days make when we are going to have some proper scrutiny? Why the haste? As he said, ‘Is there a pile of boom gates behind a shed somewhere that might be pulled out and we can have a bit of a quick run-out around the country?’ I do not think so! While boom gates are very worthy and very necessary things for rural Australia—living in rural Australia I absolutely know that, as do my other rural colleagues in the chamber on this side—it is not actually the first thing that comes to mind when we are talking about what is going to lead us to an economic recovery. I cannot see President Obama sitting over there going: ‘Right, I’m in now. What am I going to do? Hmm. Quick, think: Economic recovery, 300 million people, $900 billion—I know! Boom gates!’ It is not appropriate. While that is only one part of this package, it is an example that comes back to my earlier statement about it being a political stimulus. That is about politics.
My good colleague Senator Joyce also mentioned the pink batts in the ceiling this morning—another thing to drive the economic recovery. And my very good colleague Senator Williams pointed out that, for a very close companion of his, this was going to do her absolutely no good at all in her house. So how much work, how much scrutiny have the government put into what they are doing? Minister Wong was asked this afternoon in question time about the Energy Efficient Homes program and about the batts going into the homes. The question was: what was the estimate of the carbon dioxide that will be emitted in the manufacture and distribution of the insulation required for the 2.2 million homes targeted under the government’s program? Guess what? She did not know. The minister could not answer that question. This is from a government, from a side, that rails constantly about how important the environment is. And it is. It is extremely important. And in spite of the minister’s comments, comments that we often hear about this side of the chamber, we are very, very conscious of the importance of the environment on this side, of the chamber, particularly those of us who are farmers. We realise that, if you do not look after the land, the land will not look after you.
With a question like that anybody would think, ‘Hmmm, perhaps the government’s actually considered what the effect of rolling out these batts is, seeing that it’s such a great idea and it’s one of their keynote things—but the minister could not answer the question. Is this indicative of the amount of work and scrutiny that has gone into their own package? If they do not know the answers, how on earth are the Australian people going to get the answers? How on earth are the people in Australia going to have any confidence that the Labor government have put this package together with the right amount of analysis, scrutiny, foresight and thought that it deserves? It is that very reason—that is, that we do not believe they have—why we are not supporting it. We are not going to support it for precisely those reasons.
Interestingly, my colleague Senator Cormann said earlier that the Labor Party has reverted to type. He is quite right. Borrow, borrow, borrow; spend, spend, spend; borrow, borrow, borrow—it is what they know, it is what they do. ‘Sound economic management’ are three words that are not in their vocabulary. It is about borrowing and it is about spending, and it is not their money. The $42 billion is not money that has suddenly fallen out of the sky recently or that we have managed to pull up from underneath a building. This is Australian taxpayers’ dollars. This is Australian people’s money. And $42 billion is an extraordinarily huge amount of money—42 thousand million dollars. Perhaps the ALP has not realised it, but going into debt has its consequences. It has consequences. And who is going to pay it back?
I will tell you who is going to pay it back: our children. It is our children who are going to pay it back. It is my William, my Henry, Barnaby Joyce’s four, all of my colleagues’ children and every other family’s children in this country who are going to pay this back. I do not know if the Labor Party have actually thought about that, but these are real children that are going to be burdened with this debt for years and years and years to come—debt for a package that we do not believe is even going to go close to delivering the economic stimulus that is actually required.
We are not going to tick off $42 billion of spending that is going to plunge mums, dads and our children into enormous debt for years and years and years. Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, is constantly talking about working families, as are all of the other Labor members because they work on message and they are like little parrots and they all say exactly the same thing all of the time. They are constantly talking about working families. Well, working families are going to be working for a very, very long time to pay this back.
—That’s if they’ve got a job!
—Thank you, Senator Cormann, I will take that interjection: that is if they have got a job. This package should be about productivity and job creation, not handing out buckets of money in a cash splash that is going to disappear to China or goodness knows where else like the last $10 billion did. This should be about productivity and about creating real jobs. It is an irresponsible package.
The Prime Minister and all of the ALP—again, because they are like parrots and they all keep saying the same thing; an original thought might be a little bit tricky—are constantly talking about decisive action. They think that if they say ‘decisive action’ for long enough, the Australian people will believe that everything they do is decisive. I do not know. Senator Conroy was in here this afternoon talking about ‘decisive action’. I wonder if he popped out his Weet-Bix this morning and said, ‘Gee, this is decisive action as I’m eating my breakfast!’ Everything is decisive action. It does not matter if it is or not; everything is labelled decisive action in the hope that the Australian people will eventually believe that they are actually taking decisive action. They are not. It is not decisive action; it is irresponsible action. What we need from the government is not decisive action that means nothing; we need responsible action. This package is irresponsible. It is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money. Quite often we have said that in this chamber about a number of other things, but never, never, never about $42 billion in one hit—never! This is an unprecedented amount.
And the amount of funding in this that is just going to completely disappear is extraordinary. If we are going to do a government spend, it should be targeted at productivity, it should be targeted at job creation and it should be targeted at infrastructure. If we are going to give our children a debt burden for years and years and years, then there should be infrastructure to show for it. We should be talking about inland rail, we should be talking about dams, we should be talking about water infrastructure—the important things. Not ‘here’s $950 in your wallet’ in the hope that maybe not all of it will be saved. There is no doubt some of it will be saved, which, in general, is a very good thing but not for the point and the purpose of what the government are trying to do. They are trying to encourage spending. They have got no idea where that $950 is going to end up. They have not got a clue, and yet there is nothing targeted for solid, substantive infrastructure that is going to provide a sustainable future for this country.
The $10 billion package before Christmas, as my colleagues have already referred to, was an absolute failure. What happened to the jobs that were going to be created? At best, in a fairies-in-the-garden scenario, you could say the jury is out. But, lo and behold, now we have another $42 billion: ‘Give us the tick on this. We are not sure if the first economic stimulus worked. We really haven’t got a clue about that. I know: we’ll just go and get another $42 billion and we’ll throw that after the $10 billion. A bit more money might work.’ That sounds a bit familiar, doesn’t it? It has the ring of previous Labor governments about it. A bit more money! They are throwing money after money. Is there any substantive thought? No. Is there any sustainable future? No. Are there any infrastructure priorities? No, they just throw out more money. Most of my colleagues and I were absolutely flabbergasted—that is probably the only word I could use—when we saw the legislation come through that said, ‘Current borrowings are $75 billion; we want to increase it to $200 billion.’ It is a bit like going into the bank and saying: ‘Look, I have my MasterCard here. I’d like you to just rack it up to $200 billion, thanks. We aren’t sure what we’re going to spend it on. We don’t have any idea. We haven’t put any thought into that’—
—We might need it one day.
—‘We might need it one day’—thank you, Senator Cash—‘and we might need it one day soon, because this is all falling apart.’ The very interesting thing is that hospitals and health have not been mentioned in this package. I wonder what is suddenly going to start coming out of that $200 billion limit you are asking for. It looks like an omission from this, so I am sure the Prime Minister has a little plan in his back pocket. The point is that this spending is not anywhere near finished. You do not ask for an increase to $200 billion without the intent to spend it. That money is going to put the burden of debt onto our children for years and years.
What is in the package for infrastructure? Schools. We are great believers in investment in schools. The coalition put in place the Investing in Our Schools Program. What a great program that was. How much the schools responded to and completely applauded that program. Of course, the Labor government got rid of it. Isn’t it interesting to look at all this funding that is going to schools at the moment? If the state Labor governments were doing their job properly and were putting the money towards schools as they were supposed to, the ALP government would not even have to be doing this. The Labor governments around the country are failing our school system, and they know it. This is just a cover-up. It comes back to the point that this is not an economic stimulus; it is a political stimulus. This is about bailing out state Labor governments. If they had been doing their job properly, the money would not be needed.
It is interesting to note what else is not in the package—rural Australia. Senator Stephens, as somebody who professes to be from rural Australia, you should be absolutely appalled. What is the total value of the package? $42 billion. How much do you expect rural Australia to get out of that? Maybe $15 billion? Ten billion dollars? Five billion dollars? Maybe we should cut it down a bit—$3 billion out of $42 billion? Does that sound fair? Maybe it is a little bit light on for rural Australia. We get $20 million. There is a big outlay from the Labor government! As a percentage, I would say that that shows exactly how much Labor cares about rural Australia.
Hospitals are not in the package. ‘Kevin Rudd will fix our hospitals’ was the quote about the current Prime Minister during the election campaign. There is nothing at all in this package for them. Maybe it is to come later. Maybe we will see it next time around. Why isn’t it a priority now? That is an absolute priority for people across this nation.
—They should swap the insulation for hospitals.
—My good colleague Senator Joyce is absolutely right.
Where are pensioners? Where are self-funded retirees? They are simply not there.
It is interesting that the Labor Party said earlier that people out there in the communities are going to be absolutely appalled at what the coalition is doing. I want to read you an email that I received today from Mr Steven Mitchell. His email is indicative of the view of a number of people out there in the community. His email is indicative of what they actually believe is happening.
I do not make it a habit to write to elected members of parliament, but in this case I feel compelled to.
The federal government has recently forwarded a bill that it has labelled as a ‘stimulus plan’ for the country. It is nothing more than an insane political stunt that threatens the very welfare and prosperity of all Australians for generations to come.
Borrowing money to give cash handouts is in no way going to turn the Australian economy around. For every $1000 given out it is likely that the government will need to raise $2000 or more in taxes to pay for the handout. This taxation will deter future job growth. Many of their other spending initiatives will not create genuine wealth either, as they do not focus on greater productivity; productivity is the heart of employment. There is no long-term value in this radically irresponsible proposal.
I urge you as a fellow decent Australian to reject the government’s ‘stimulus plan’. Please do not try and second-guess what may be popular - this plan is utter madness. If this proposal is passed by the senate we are on the path towards complete destruction of future economic prosperity for generations to come.
So much for the Labor Party saying that those out there think that we are doing the wrong thing. We are not doing the wrong thing. We are doing the right thing, the responsible thing, for the people of this country. There is no doubt that we are experiencing very difficult and serious times, but this plan is not the way forward. I and my colleagues will oppose the package and make sure that we have a secure and sustainable future for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-02-05,"—The coalition supports stimulation, in this case of a fiscal kind, because the economy needs it. Australia needs stimulation of the economy and stimulation of Australians to spend. The trouble with the Prime Minister’s so-called fiscal stimulus package is that it will achieve none of that. This so-called fiscal stimulus will not stimulate jobs, jobs, jobs. What it will stimulate is debt, debt, debt, so that tomorrow’s children will be required to repay today’s debts. It will stimulate debt and, as my colleagues have said, in particular Senator Nash, it will stimulate politics. It will stimulate the Prime Minister’s popularity in the immediate short term.
What is wrong with the Prime Minister’s so-called fiscal stimulus package? Let us consider just some of the aspects. It is too much money, it will not work and it will burden tomorrow’s kids with today’s debts.
We know that our opposition to the so-called fiscal stimulus package will not be popular in the short term, but we are prepared for that. We believe it is the right decision, unfortunately, for our country at this time. We know that our opposition to a cash splash will not be popular, but we know it is right. Many people would welcome free money, but many people will also recognise that government money is not only not free; it is not government money—it is their money and one day it has to be repaid. They know that they will be the ones that have to pay it back, but, worse than that, their children and their children’s children stand to have to pay back the debts of today.
Let us reflect for a moment on some of the reasons why the world might be in this mess. I am no economist, but the world’s economists have suggested that we have this so-called global financial crisis in part because of the sophistication of the financial products that were being utilised around the world. The financial products were so sophisticated that they camouflaged the risks. You could not see them. It was someone else’s money and someone else somewhere else was taking the risks. The scenario allowed too many people to borrow too much money.
The Prime Minister’s so-called fiscal stimulus package mirrors those faults. It camouflages the risks; it risks other people’s money. Governments do not have money; they borrow it and use taxpayers’ money—it is our people’s money. The government is asking tomorrow’s taxpayers, tomorrow’s children, to foot the risk and fund today’s debt. How can this package cushion us from a recession when it is premised in part on the very things which the world’s economists say led us to this position in the first place?
The Prime Minister is asking us in this place to rubber-stamp his so-called fiscal stimulus package. Labor has demanded that parliament approve the plans within 48 hours, yet it refuses to sit down and discuss the plan with us or, indeed, with others. It is 48 hours for just 42 billion bucks. That is just over an hour for every billion dollars or, to put it another way, just one second for each quarter of a million dollars of expenditure of taxpayers’ funds. We think that is taking a risk too far.
The Prime Minister expects Australians to hold him in blind faith, but he was not upfront when he made his policy announcements on Tuesday, because the fact is that while talking of a $42 billion emergency package the Prime Minister was actually seeking a taxpayer funded line of credit to five times that amount, some $200 billion. Like an oversized credit card, Australians will be paying for these debts well beyond the end of the Prime Minister’s spending spree.
But Australians have learnt from bitter experience what happens when you get that letter from the bank. In the government’s case it would say: ‘Dear customer, you are about to reach your $75 billion credit limit. Would you like to extend it to $200 billion?’ Australians have learnt that behaviour like that in a consumer sense has contributed to the situation we are in today. They have learnt that our lending institutions lent too much money to too many people who could not afford to pay it back. They will see through this ploy from Rudd Labor. They will see through this move by the Prime Minister to write to parliament, under camouflage of a bill, saying, ‘PS: Let’s extend the line of credit from $75 billion to $200 billion. Let’s almost triple it.’ They will see through that and over time they will not accept it. They will see that as the beginning of the end or, worse still, the continuation of what has got us to where we are today.
Why not this package? The country needs a stimulus package that will create and protect jobs and bolster the economy. But when subjected even to minor scrutiny—of course, that is all we have had time for—the package cannot do what it seems to purport to do. The Prime Minister might as well have been running for the job of Santa Claus prior to Christmas when he handed out his cash splash at that time, with cash bonuses to the tune of $10.4 billion. Now we work out that it was all for nix. It is gone, gone, gone.
—It’s got to be repaid.
—It has to be repaid, indeed, Senator Cash—with interest! For all his promises, the Prime Minister’s grand plan to save the economy resulted in the expenditure of less than 20 per cent of the total bonus payments pre Christmas. Had that plan been at least partly successful, we would not be in the situation in which we find ourselves today. We would surely not be debating the so-called need for and wisdom of a $12.7 billion cash splash starting tomorrow. Indeed, the cash did not cause enough of a splash last time, and it certainly will not help now.
—It barely created a plop.
—I didn’t get wet. Let us look for a moment at the aspects of the cash splash that promise some bonuses to individual taxpayers. This helps illustrate why it is not just the concept but also the manner in which it is to be administered that fails to stand up to scrutiny. In their rush to have the plan put into action, the Treasurer and the tax office say that eligibility for the one-off cash payments will be assessed on the basis of last year’s income tax returns. Of course, when you splash the cash you have to draw the ad hoc line somewhere, so the government has chosen to draw the line at the financial year ending June 2008. Well, by the government’s very own admission, we are right now in very different times from June 2008; otherwise presumably they would have been planning back then for exactly this scenario, yet they tell us they were not.
June 2008 was very different from today—let alone from the short-term future. Yet the government proposes to splash its cash according to those who had certain income levels as of the end of June in the preceding financial year. What of the Australian workers who have lost their jobs since then? What of Australian workers who stand to lose their jobs in the future? Where is the justification for splashing the cash based on whether people had incomes at a certain level as of June last year when, by the government’s own testimony, the circumstances have been changing daily? If examples like this are just obvious on the surface then the package clearly demands further scrutiny.
The Leader of the House, Mr Albanese, suggests that any reasonable person would consider 20 hours sufficient time to consider this country’s biggest ever one-off spend. But signs of a contracting economy did not mysteriously appear on Monday of this week. Perhaps if the Prime Minister had spent recent weeks looking after the economy rather than writing a thesis we might have got a more considered so-called stimulus plan.
Instead, the Prime Minister seeks to allay the concerns of massive debt-skewing government balance sheets by saying that Australia will experience only a temporary deficit. Australians know that Labor deficits are never temporary—as if debt to the tune of 20 per cent of Australia’s gross domestic product is something that should be taken lightly. Representing the Treasurer in question time today, Senator Conroy all but dismissed concerns of interest payments being an ongoing burden. He suggested that $2.6 billion a year was nothing to be concerned about, yet 12 months ago $2.6 billion constituted 10 per cent of the budget surplus. Contrary to the opinions expressed by well-intended Australian consumers about free money and free batts during, for example, the TV news on Tuesday night this week, this package is anything but free. It is certainly anything but guilt free.
In a stimulus package designed in large part—yes, Senator Nash—to stimulate politics, we have a Prime Minister asking this place for a blank cheque and seeking to risk $200 billion of taxpayers’ money on the one-off chance that it will be enough to keep Australia out of recession. But what he is really doing is seeking a level of debt equivalent to $9½ thousand for each and every Australian. The opposition have a responsibility to ensure that we are not risking the future of our nation’s children. We know that tomorrow’s children will pay today’s debts. So, without further scrutiny, it is a risk that the opposition will not take. Rudd’s package is poorly targeted, ill thought—
—Mr Rudd.
—Mr Rudd’s package is poorly targeted, ill thought out and irresponsible. It will not bring about the necessary fiscal stimulus. In question time, Senator Conroy accused the opposition of playing short-term politics, yet this is a stimulus package designed to stimulate politics in the government’s favour. For the short term, it may well do that. We are ready for that, because opposing the package is the right thing for us to do.
On jobs and the economy, this package will fail the bang-for-the-buck test. The only bang that we will hear will be the plans backfiring and landing in the wrong place. As the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, has said, we need to keep a few shots in the locker. There will be none left if the package proceeds; this will be it. It is supposed to be about stimulating spending and encouraging Australians to shop for the benefit of the nation’s bottom line. Yes, that is what we need. So will it be free money? Will it be guilt-free spending? The Prime Minister tells us to go shopping—shop, shop, shop as if the money is free. No cost, no guilt. Think of the country and help us to spend to avoid recession!
Some well-intended shoppers have taken the Prime Minister at his word. They think they will be able to shop, shop, shop as if the money is free—no cost, no guilt—and they will like it because they will be able to feel good whilst they are doing it because they will think they are doing it for the country, at the Prime Minister’s request: ‘Think of the country and help us to avoid recession.’ But over time they will realise they have been misled, and badly so. They will remember the lessons of past Labor governments: debt, debt, debt. Like an offer of an increased credit balance on an already maxed-out card, they know that this package is all about spending money we do not have.
But it gets worse, because the Prime Minister is attempting to sell a defective product. If an Australian shopper were to buy a defective product, if it were not fit for purpose, they would be entitled to one of two things: either their money back or a replacement product that is fit for purpose. But what will happen when Australians discover that this so-called fiscal rescue package is not fit for purpose? They will not be able to get their money back, because it will be gone, gone, gone, and they will not be able to get a replacement that does the job because the bank will not have the money to pay for it. There is no fallback. There is no return clause. There is no replacement guarantee. It will be the game threatening to be over.
The Prime Minister’s so-called stimulus package fails at the very first test. It is not an economic stimulus. It will not stimulate jobs; it will stimulate debt and it will stimulate the Prime Minister’s politics. It is too much money, it will not work and it will burden tomorrow’s children with the debts of today. It must be opposed in its current terms.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-02-05,"—As a parent I have found it amusing but slightly irritating to watch the Prime Minister throw the granddaddy of all temper tantrums in the past two days. If a child were doing this, one would be tempted to characterise it as a game a spoiled little boy had made up all by himself. The game would be called ‘beat the inflation genie’, and the little boy would have written all the rules himself with absolutely no help at all from the grown-ups. One of the primary rules he would have adopted would be that no-one can play unless they agree with that little boy’s rules. Of course, in this situation we are not dealing with the underdeveloped emotions of a child; we are dealing with the expectations of an adult, the person who is supposed to be the country’s most responsible adult. We are dealing with the expectations of the Prime Minister.
Australia has had the details of this package only since Tuesday afternoon. Parliament has not had any time at all to analyse it in detail, yet it is the largest expenditure by a federal government in 35 years. In the view of the coalition—and I am pleased to say of the other non-government parties—it deserves detailed parliamentary scrutiny and will, because of the moves of the coalition and the other non-government parties, receive some detailed parliamentary scrutiny, though certainly not with the approval of the government, who are doing their best to stop scrutiny of this bill. The government wanted to push this bill through parliament in 48 hours. As my colleague Senator Fisher pointed out, that equates to $1 billion an hour that we would have been throwing out onto the Australian public and through which we would have been racking up debts for them for years to come.
—Yes, that’s all; it’s only taxpayers’ money!
—Yes, just a billion dollars an hour! I think that the rushed response of the government indicates exactly how they deal with all economic matters. The coalition stands very firmly by the view that the wealth and economic activity of this country are best handled by the private sector, with competent, sensible regulation by government. It is clear that the government need to act and do their best to help Australia ride out the financial crisis that is currently affecting every country in the world. Luckily, to date, the Australian economy is not as badly affected as most. However, if we are going to act, we would like to think that the action is planned, that we know what we are hoping to achieve by doing it and that we implement it in a sensible and calm way. We recognise that overzealous, rushed public policy from government can lead only to unintended consequences—and we have already heard from Senator Brown about a few of the errors that have crept in and about people being potentially able to double dip for the $950 payout.
Not only are we looking at rushing this through but we will be putting Australian taxpayers in a far worse position than they already are. We saw exactly how that worked when the government tried to put through a bank deposit guarantee last year. A bank deposit guarantee was a very good idea, but the government rushed, as usual, into that policy and ended up with an unlimited bank guarantee which had knock-on consequences and made the situation much worse than it needed to be. We saw investment vehicles that were not covered by the guarantee freeze investment redemptions because money was flooding out of the funds whilst investors were trying to move their money to bank deposit accounts that attracted this mythical unlimited bank guarantee. Many investment funds have stated that their decision to freeze funds was a direct response to that government policy.
So that policy increased the illiquidity of the market and left thousands of investors with money trapped in accounts. It is nice to at least know that some of them will now be eligible for the $950 handout courtesy of the government’s mishandling and ineptness in terms of the bank deposit guarantee because with their funds and income streams frozen they are now eligible for some of the Centrelink benefits. The availability of money that people would have used—their own money—to help themselves get through the global financial crisis is made so much worse by inept policy from this government. And that was just the baby one; now we start to get to the grandaddy. The bank deposit guarantee was not decisive policy; it was panic policy. And now we have yet more panic policy in this $42 billion package—and panicked responses are not the actions of a confident and responsible government, and that is what the people of Australia want to see: a confident and responsible government.
Like Senator Nash I have also received numerous emails and letters from people who are not exactly going to hand the money back—they are going to take the $950; they are Australians after all and they are not stupid—but they are asking: ‘Why? I’m a bit embarrassed about this. I don’t need this money but the government is going to give it to me.’ I have one letter from a person in Cedar Creek in Queensland. It says:
I’m writing to you today about the government’s proposed stimulus package. I’m very concerned that it will put the country into huge debt without helping the economy sufficiently.
I’d like you to vote against the package, as it stands, particularly the cash handout section.
It is difficult for me to disapprove of it as, being married with 3 children, I stand to get almost $5000 and that money would be very useful.
Nonetheless, in the long term it is going to leave the nation, and thus my family and I, worse off.
That correspondent then goes on to list a number of infrastructure and tax ideas that she believes would be of more immediate benefit to this nation.
Australians are not stupid, as I said earlier. They can recognise an attempt to buy their loyalty and to buy popularity when they see it. They are generally not at all impressed by this. But they are very worried by it. And, when the public becomes panicked watching their leaders scrabbling to throw policies—any policy—at an issue, the situation is going to get worse and worse.
The US economist Professor Robert Shiller, from Yale University, who in the competition to produce the best economist must come fairly high up the list, is one of the few people who in writing in 2000 predicted the home lending crisis in the US. Professor Shiller commented that the real issue we have here is how we go about restoring confidence. He points out that if people are confident enough to continue trading with one another, to continue generating and creating wealth and to continue growing the economy then the crisis will be averted. What governments should do, as far as Professor Shiller is concerned, is normalise spending as much as possible. It is not little one-off pots that are thrown about at the whim of the Prime Minister that are going to restore confidence among ordinary consumers; it is normal everyday increases in the money that people can expect to find weekly, monthly and quarterly in their bank accounts—the sorts of things that are achieved with the tax cuts that have been proposed by the coalition.
Professor Shiller pointed out that the package as proposed by this government could in fact cause people to become more anxious about why there is such a desperate need to depart from the capitalist principles that have governed the way our economy operates and that people have based their livelihoods on for so many years. Why? How bad must it be if the government is behaving in this irrational and radical way? If that view is accurate then surely it does not help that the great former economic conservative, our Prime Minister, is speaking at every opportunity about the errors of the modern capitalist system. It is the system, after all, that our businesses operate in. It is the system that has created the jobs that Australians currently have. How confident does the Prime Minister think the wealth generators and the consumers in our economy are going to feel when he is threatening that very system by speaking as he has against it?
We saw this from the government at the beginning of 2008, when they began talking up inflation. As I said, they invented the game of ‘beat the inflation genie’. The only problem was that they had no idea what they were doing when they started their game. What happened to the economy? We saw employers put prices up to deal with the inflationary threat that followed. We saw consumers struggling with higher prices for necessities. We saw confidence in the economy stutter after so many years of confident activity. There is very little in this new stimulus package to inspire the confidence that prevailed during the years of the Howard-Costello government. There is nothing in the package to assist the 1.9 million small businesses in Australia, who are largely going to be responsible for pulling Australia out of this crisis.
—What about the 30 per cent tax cut?
—We will get to that, Senator McLucas.
—So you can’t say ‘nothing’.
—You can say ‘nothing’ because you make nothing out of nothing—you need something to start with. We will get to that. At the same time, the Rudd Labor government is hurting the ability of these businesses to employ staff and produce goods by working to impose the so-called Fair Work Australia legislation on us, which will in fact discourage many small businesses from employing new staff, even if they were able to do so. These businesses deserve the confidence of knowing that government policy is sensible, prudent and permanent and not subject to the whims of the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. Australian workers deserve to feel confident that the objective of the government’s package is to create jobs, support small business and strengthen the economy.
As evidence of how confident people can feel, we have the promise of the Prime Minister about the $10.4 billion package of last year. It was going to create 75,000 jobs, the Prime Minister told us. We have seen no evidence of this at all and the unemployment rate continues to rise—in fact currently it is at its highest level in two years. We all acknowledge that the unemployment rate will go up but we do not want to give the government the opportunity to play the game of ‘how fast can we get it up there’.
The Prime Minister has stopped talking about government packages ‘creating’ jobs; he is now talking about ‘supporting’ jobs. Ninety thousand jobs are mentioned, but they are not supporting 90,000 jobs; they are supporting up to 90,000 jobs. So I presume that if one job is saved by this package it will all have been worth it—$42 billion for one job—and the promise will have been kept, given that he has so carefully phrased the proposition. It is a bit like saying, ‘I support the footy team.’ Yes, but that is not going to help the footy team to win. Supporting and winning are two different things. It does not guarantee anything. The current package is very poorly targeted and it has purported economic benefits that, in the view of the coalition, do not exist.
Let us look at the $950 handout which will go to approximately 10 million people. This will not have the effect that a tax cut would have. Let us look where the cash splash went. We have evidence from retailer organisations that it would appear that $1 billion of the $10 billion was actually spent, and it is expected that some more of it will be spent. We have evidence that suggests that two-thirds of it has been saved. That is a good thing for those individuals but it is not helping the economy, which I thought was the whole idea. If you give people a one-off payment they will save it, in the main, because they are not sure what is around the corner. You talk down the economy and you give them a one-off payment and then you think that they will go and spend it because you might decide to give them another one-off payment sometime.
Economists such as Shiller have shown that the effect of aggregate demand in the economy from consumers is what makes permanent change. It will make a big difference if that money is in their bank account every week—but not the one-off splurge, because they do not know where the next one is coming from, whether there is going to be a next one, or whether in fact taxes are going to have to go up to pay for the last one that went wrong.
We have argued that tax cuts would allow Australians to know that the additional money is permanent and they can spend it on a weekly basis without losing anything come next payday. They can budget and they can plan. It seems that this is a concept that the government have trouble understanding. In fact I am not sure that they have ever thought about what consumers make of their take on economics. We even have the Prime Minister saying that he does not know if this plan will work but, oh well, never mind, let’s blow $42 billion and see what happens.
We have similar problems with the schemes that are proposed in the construction industry. I have talked to numerous people in the business world in the last few days and the almost unanimous view is that this package is completely the wrong way around. Quite a few people have used somewhat more colourful language to describe it being the wrong way around.
—It’s a bad package.
—It’s a bad package. Not quite a third of the funds in this package can be spent immediately and, if you are really lucky, you will get to spend the rest over the next two years. What a great idea! Let us have a small amount of money now but let us put the rest of it out, if you are lucky, over two or three years to stimulate the economy in two or three years time. But of course, because you did not put the money in immediately, we will need more stimulus than it would have needed if you had put the money in earlier.
The idea of shovel-ready programs is a nonsense, and I think that everybody except perhaps a couple of journalists at the Canberra Times knows this. There are very few programs that are ready to go. Certainly, if you are relying on the assistance of groups like QBuild in Queensland, which is notorious for its inefficiency, to assist you to get things on the ground fast, you are in big trouble. When you start involving state governments you slow things down. One shire engineer commented memorably to me that with the Roads to Recovery program—which was a Howard government initiative, with the money going directly from the federal government to the councils—if you gave the money to local government 95 per cent of it went on the roads. If you gave the money to George Street—meaning the Queensland state government—50 per cent of it got spent on meetings in town. That is exactly the way this money will go. And of course you add a few more months so that all of those meetings can be had and all those public servants can do whatever it is that the government has required of them.
So it is an ill-considered package and it is the wrong way round. Government intervention in the market will distort the market—that is for sure. We are going to have distortions all over the place in terms of the building industry—and, again, where is the confidence? What happens in December 2010 if by some miracle all the schools and houses have been built? Where is the next package going to come from? No-one knows. If it is as irrational as this one, why would you be worrying about it? Let us look at this rush into policy without any detailed modelling. There is even absolute outrage at the possibility that we would want to scrutinise it.
I mentioned earlier that there is nothing in this for small business. There is a suggested business investment allowance for small business that would allow a greater write-off—a faster depreciation—and a payment back to small business for equipment purchases over $1,000. Of course, if you are going to make an equipment purchase over $1,000 you need to have cash flow first, and the problem with this system is that if you do not have cash flow you have to wait until 30 June to get the money back. It is ridiculous. The superannuation guarantee levy that we proposed—which was grossly misrepresented by Ministers Sherry and Emerson—is a sensible and better solution for getting money to small business right now and for fixing cash flow right now. We will be opposing the government’s package.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-02-05,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and cognate bills. The blinding obscenity about this package is not that it will not actually work. That is obscene but that is not the blinding obscenity. It is not even the fact that future generations will be placed in debt for who knows how long. That is obscene but that is not the blinding obscenity. Even Labor’s financial incompetence is no longer obscene because that is part of Australia’s political folklore—we know the history of Labor governments, particularly federal Labor governments, and we are used to it. The blinding obscenity is that this government and Mr Rudd propose to push through the largest expenditure package, outside of budgets, in Australia’s history without parliamentary oversight. That is what he proposes to do and that is the blinding obscenity of this government.
If you want to know how significant that is—I am not very good with numbers but I did a quick calculation upstairs—we are talking about 42 thousand million dollars. There are, I think, 21 million Australians, so for every man, woman and child in this nation the debt immediately will be $2,000. And for every taxpayer—there are around 9,200,000 taxpayers—the contribution will be $4,565.22. The obscenity is that that debt was going to be placed on every man, woman and child and every taxpayer without proper parliamentary oversight. That is the blinding obscenity of this government. They have been in power for 15 months and already they are pushing through $42 billion without proper parliamentary oversight. That is a disgrace.
But politics is funny—it is an interesting profession. There are those who know the Labor Party well and know how they operate. Mr Latham, a former Labor leader, wrote today in the Australian Financial Review that Mr Rudd and Mr Swan:
… have jumped all over the financial crisis, not with a clear economic strategy in mind but with an urgent sense of the political opportunity it presents.
The stimulus package is about politics much more than it is about economics. Mr Latham knows that, the opposition knows that and Mr Rudd knows that, and that is a disgrace.
The problem—and my colleagues have touched on this eloquently throughout the day—is this: we now have a government that does not believe in anything. One of my favourite topics—and I will get onto this later—is that embarrassing essay from Mr Rudd. The problem is this: the Labor Party now no longer has any coherent ideology or framework.
—They have Ruddbank.
—Yes, they have Ruddbank. They used to believe in socialism. That failed universally—it has been dropped. Then they developed the Third Way. Remember the Third Way? Mr Blair developed it—and Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. Mr Rudd has just dumped it. And what does he propose to replace it with? Nothing at all. I have read the essay twice. It is pathetic in its sparseness. It is funny when I think of it; the Labor Party used to be a grand party of ideas. I always opposed them. When the Maoists used to run around at university I opposed them. Now of course all they believe in is opportunism and ‘me-too-ism’. So in my lifetime they have gone from Maoism to ‘me-too-ism’. And what a pathetic downhill ride it has been.
I think it was Dostoyevsky who said that the problem is that someone who believes in nothing in the end will do anything. That is the problem with the stimulus package. It is all about politics and has very little to do with economics.
My colleagues have all said eloquently that the cardinal rule of stimulus packages is this: make sure they are properly targeted and that you get bang for your buck. It is all about bang for your buck with stimulus packages. Unfortunately, this $42 billion extravaganza fails that test.
One of the centrepieces of the package is the handouts to many Australians. Sure, it is attractive superficially—we all accept that. Many people will think it is terrific. But will it actually make a difference on the ground? Every poll I have seen published says this: most of that money will be used to pay off mortgages and credit cards—to retire debt—and the other part of it will be used for savings and will not be used to spend and to stimulate the economy. That is the problem. Again, there is no bang for your buck. In short, this is a package directed towards social infrastructure rather than economic infrastructure, and that nub is the nub of the failure of this package.
I accept that building libraries and sports halls might be laudable. Even if you put aside the fact, as my friend Senator Nash said, that that is of course a state responsibility—but I am a generous man so let us put that aside—what sort of bang do you get for your buck and what return do you get from the stimulus package? The same could be asked of community housing, ceiling insulation or indeed all of the financial handouts to taxpayers: what sort of bang do you get for your buck? What return do you get on the money you spend?
It is estimated that parts of President Obama’s proposed stimulus package in the United States will generate a multiplier as high as about 1.7 to one—that is, every dollar that the US congress votes to spend will generate about $1.70 in the next 12 months. As my colleagues have said, eloquently, that is because the money is being spent on physical infrastructure projects like highways, railways and bridges, which generate jobs during construction and then produce benefits to the economy through reduced transportation costs. In other words, when the orgy is over something still remains. When the orgy is over, there is something for the morning after.
There were a couple of good articles today in the Australian Financial Review. Michael Knox, an analyst from ABN AMRO Morgans, analysed Kevin Rudd’s package. ‘What sort of return,’ he asked, ‘will this country get?’ What return will Australia get from Mr Rudd’s stimulus package? Michael Knox said:
The economic impact of the plan is that GDP growth is expected to be around half a per cent higher than in 2008-09 and about 0.75 to 1 per cent higher in 2009-10.
In 2008-09 we are spending 1.7 per cent of GDP in stimulus to get an increase in GDP of 0.5 per cent. This means we are spending $1 in stimulus to get only 30c in GDP. This is a multiplier of just 0.3—very low by international comparison.
He concluded by saying:
By emphasising social over economic infrastructure, the bang for the buck is so soft it might better be described as a dull thud.
So even within the terms of the government’s own reference this is a very poor package—no bang for the buck.
What about the other objectives? My friend Senator Boyce has raised the issue of jobs. Clearly, the opposition is all about jobs, jobs, jobs. Mr Turnbull has spoken about it relentlessly over the last few days.
—And eloquently.
—And eloquently! After the debacle of last year’s $10 billion package, where it would seem very few of the promised 75,000 jobs have materialised, the government is now rather more modestly promising that the $42 billion will ‘support’ up to 90,000 jobs. We do not know what ‘support’ means. I am like Senator Boyce; I do not know what ‘support’ means, but presumably it does not mean to create or to maintain.
I go to a quick bit of arithmetic, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, and I am not good at this so you may have to help me. That is 90,000 jobs at the cost of $42 billion, which comes out at $400,000 per job. And those are not new jobs; those are the supported jobs. At $400,000 a job, what a wonderful package! As Mr Costello said in the House yesterday about the government’s new policy to borrow and to splurge, we are reversing 10 years of hard work and we are doing it to support 90,000 jobs at more than $400,000 per job. What a fiasco! That is the Labor arithmetic, and it is not very pretty.
Rather than trying to remake capitalism, which Mr Rudd has tried to do with his sad little essay, he should perhaps do something to ameliorate the pain that ordinary Australians are feeling. I thought it was the job of governments in recessions to help those in pain, rather than to try to remake the economic system, which is Mr Rudd’s preoccupation.
Who are the principal people who should be benefiting from Mr Rudd’s concerns? The unemployed. They are the people at the bottom of the social heap. And what is Mr Rudd doing for the unemployed in this package? This is from a party that supposedly believes in social justice! The government is doing absolutely nothing for the unemployed. Do you know what? Within the next year there are going to be a lot more people who are unemployed. So perhaps the new social democracy that Mr Rudd talks about in this frightful little essay has nothing to do with social justice. The new social democracy is not about social justice at all. There is no concern for the unemployed at all. It is increasingly obscene.
Tim Colebatch wrote in today’s Age:
Those who need it are the poor people who bear the cost of the recession on behalf of the rest of us: workers who lose their jobs, apprentices laid off, youngsters who can’t even get into the labour market, and businesses and self-employed people who go broke. There is nothing in this package for them.
So much for new Labor! So much for a party trying to rediscover a new direction! So much for a sad, new social democrat who does not believe in social justice!
The worst thing, however—and my colleagues have spoken about this forcefully and with passion—is the tremendous cost to the economy for future generations. It is about sizing up debt for years and years to come, for our children and potentially our grandchildren. Others have spoken at length today about the government’s reckless policies that in just over a year have managed to turn a $22 billion surplus into a $20 billion budget deficit and have sent Australia back on the road to government debt. That is the problem. What is worse, judging by the legislation introduced by the government, is that we can expect it to get even worse.
What has the government done? It has given itself plenty of wriggle room. It is going to allow itself to borrow up to—
—$200 billion.
—$200 billion.
—‘$200 billion,’ is the chorus from the opposition. What worries me—what worries the opposition—is this: when we came into government in 1996 the budget deficit was about half that; it was about $96 billion. It took us about a decade to pay that off. I hate to think how long it will take to pay off if it is $200 billion. It could take an entire generation to pay off a debt like that. It would become in a sense systemic—as it has become in the United States and in western Europe. In fact, 10 per cent of the budget could be paying for budget deficits of previous years. Government debt can so overburden budgets that governments are crippled. And who pays the debt? Taxpayers in future generations. The worst thing that could happen to this country, sir, is this: like the United States and like western Europe we get used to living with—
—Structural.
—structural debt that gets written into the budget each year and cripples us. That is the long-term problem.
You will recall that Mr Costello years ago commissioned the Intergenerational report. You will recall his concern about intergenerational equity. This is another matter of social justice, I might add. The opposition is raising another matter of social justice. Who will bear the burden of today’s splurge? The point of intergenerational equity is, as Mr Costello pointed out, this: the changing demography of Australia means that with an ageing population there will be fewer taxpayers over the next generation to foot the bill. That is the problem. So the systemic, structural debt that Senator Brandis mentioned in his excellent address today is not just some sort of myth; it is highly likely. That is what petrifies the opposition.
—And no Labor government will even start paying off.
—That is right. In the end, as always, it will be the coalition that has to pay the debt off. Some might think that I have a boring life. Perhaps I do. But I read with morbid curiosity Mr Rudd’s essay, ‘The global financial crisis’. To those people in the gallery: I suggest that you do not bother.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Senator Mason, I suggest that you direct your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you. I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, that you do not read it either. Let me point out the salient parts. Right towards the end of this embarrassing essay, Mr Rudd quotes President Sarkozy of France, who said, ‘Laissez faire, c’est fini.’ It is the end of laissez faire and the end of liberalism. For a start, as my colleagues know, France never adopted free market economics. That is why they have had 10 per cent unemployment for the last 20 years. Even worse, the irony is perhaps lost on Mr Rudd of something that I read in Monday’s edition of the International Herald Tribune. It was:
Prime Minister François Fillon on Monday rejected demands that the French government seek to stimulate consumer spending, rather than follow his plan to stimulate corporate and infrastructure investment, to lift France out of its economic slump.
He rejected demands; France rejected it. The article went on:

“It would be irresponsible to chose another policy, which would increase our country’s indebtedness without having more infrastructure and increased competitiveness in the end,” Fillon said in a speech in Lyon.

If the French can get it right, why can’t this government? Even Mr Rudd’s continental idols do not agree with him. Even the French are spending their money on roads, buildings, ports and railways and renovating infrastructure.
I suppose it comes down to this in the end with that embarrassing little essay: there are three policy prescriptions in this essay. They are: spend, spend and spend. There are no other ideas in it at all. And that is the problem with the Labor Party today, you see: they actually do not believe in anything except opportunism. That is at the heart of the problem in the debate in this parliament and the problem with Mr Rudd. Dostoyevsky was right: if you believe in nothing, you will do anything to survive politically, even if you have to mortgage the country in so doing and even if you have to mortgage future generations. That will be on Mr Rudd’s head and on the head of this government. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-02-05,"—I do so hate to follow Senator Mason in these debates. I regret to note in rising to speak that I am the eighth, ninth or 10th coalition speaker in a row to address the Senate on what we are told is one of the most important packages of legislation this country has seen in decades. I suppose the other side have decided—decisively!—to hang out somewhere else and sip coffee or do something else rather than take part in this important debate. What a pity.
What Australia needs most at the moment is experience. Experience affords you insight. It gives you the chance to make points of difference and it allows you to demonstrate calm in the face of pressure and temperance in the face of potential disaster. The Labor government has very little experience and this package of bills demonstrates that very amply. What sort of experience do I mean when I say that? I mean the experience of taking Australia from a deficit of $100 billion to a surplus of $22 billion; the experience of lowering interest rates over 10 years from 12.75 per cent to 7.15 per cent; the experience of lowering unemployment; the experience of creating new jobs; the experience of increasing growth while lowering inflation; the experience of increasing funding affordably and sustainably for schools, universities and public institutions.
This government does not have that experience, and that is a great pity in the present environment. The coalition does, and its experience—which led, of course, to the upgrading of our national credit rating to AAA—is the kind of experience that, frankly, this country needs right now. We balanced market freedom with an appropriate level of market regulation. The Deputy Prime Minister presumably understood that when she told the World Economic Forum at Davos a few days ago that ‘Australia has the best inflation regulation system in the world’. That system was created by, and was successful under, the coalition government.
We now find ourselves on the cusp of perhaps the most important decision this nation will have to take in this decade to ensure the survival of our precious way of life, and in this dire hour the Labor government do not have the wisdom to consult with those more experienced. This Labor government does not have the experience to ensure the package they propose will lead to the best possible outcome for this country. The Labor government do not show the respect for parliamentary institutions that would allow adequate time to review their bills properly. This government is not acting in the best interests of Australians. This government’s lack of experience is excusable. Its immaturity, its panicked response to this crisis, its political gamesmanship and its complete disregard for the proper processes are not. The Labor government’s arrogance is certainly not excusable.
A panicked response is not a plan. A stimulus package cannot simply be labelled that because it says it is going to do that. Not all expenditure, obviously, is good expenditure in this sense. Not all expenditure stimulates the economy. This Labor government is promising most Australians $950 per person as its way of stimulating the economy. The Labor government are not, however, telling Australians that they are asking us to give them the capacity to put us all in debt to the tune of $9,500 per person.
Earlier today the Premier of South Australia drew an analogy between Australia’s present circumstances and fighting a war. When you fight a war you need to have all shoulders to the wheel—everybody needs to be behind a war effort. It is not a bad analogy, but there are some differences between the situation we find ourselves in now and fighting a war. Firstly, when governments start to fight a war they generally bring in the other parties in a parliamentary system to support them. In fact, some countries embark on governments of national unity to make sure that they bring all represented interests around the table. There has been no attempt at that in this situation. In a war you also do not begin the battle by firing off the one big gun and dropping the one big bomb that you have, knowing that there is not much left in your armoury once you have done that.
The Leader of the Opposition in this crisis has put forward alternatives to those which the Labor government has proposed in its stimulus package. We have not simply criticised what the government has on offer; we have proposed alternatives. We proposed that the tax cuts that were scheduled to be rolled out on 1 July this year and next year be brought forward and backdated to 1 January this year. By the middle of 2010, this would have left a two-income household earning about $80,000 something like $1,700 better off. That is money that, because it is coming in on a regular basis, people are more likely to spend to stimulate the economy than is the case with one-off payments. Perhaps the largest gap in the government’s package is the lack of measures that directly and broadly support employment, particularly employment in the small business sector.
The alternatives are as numerous as they are self-evident, were the Labor Party to take a moment to breathe and think rather than what they have called—rather ironically—acting decisively. Acting decisively equates to providing solutions, developing options and making substantial, measured, effective contributions to an extraordinarily important issue. My colleagues have listed a number of possible alternatives today. In doing so, we have shown our willingness and preparedness to discuss other ways of tackling this very important issue.
While, for example, the accelerated depreciation concept has some merit, the coalition believe measures that more directly and immediately improve the cash-flow position of small firms and help them protect jobs are preferable. We have proposed to discuss with the government, if it is willing to do that, the Commonwealth paying a portion of the superannuation guarantee levy on behalf of small employers—those with 20 or fewer staff—for the next two years. That is the sort of measure that would directly allow small employers to make positive decisions to retain staff. I do not see anything in this package that would have a similar effect. I do not see measures that are likely to make an employer say, ‘I’ll make the decision to keep that person on my payroll.’
It is perhaps not surprising that a lot of employers are listening less to what the Prime Minister says and looking more at what the Prime Minister does. The Prime Minister urges Australian businesses not to let their employees go and yet, once the cameras are off him, talks about taking a meataxe to the Public Service and shedding jobs in large numbers—the sorts of jobs I would have thought right now Australians need behind the helmsmen to make sure we have made the right decisions in the face of a serious economic crisis. Jobs are the big question facing us all behind this package. We are doing ours to ensure that Australians can keep theirs.
Are the Australian Labor Party doing their job with respect to this legislation? Are they doing that by rushing these bills through with inadequate scrutiny? Are they doing it by promising cash handouts to the Australian public without properly spelling out the cost of those handouts? Would it not be responsible of the government to detail a program for the repayment of that debt—a description of how heavy that debt might be and what strategies the government might be developing to address it? With respect, it was not addressed the last time Labor were in government. The debt was still there when they left office in 1996. This is not a pain-free decision. There are costs and consequences, but we see nothing of that in what the Labor Party have told the public as they describe in gleeful tones the handouts, the cash splash, which they are engineering.
Appealing to voters through promises of boom gates and school buildings and completely ignoring the fact that there is no plan for those very buildings when schools can no longer afford to pay teachers—is that being responsible? Is it responsible of the government to say that parents should gratefully accept these new assets without explaining to them how schools can sustainably continue to grow to meet the needs of their communities? I think that this package is a decision which has not been thought through, is not wise and does not deserve the support of the parliament. In the absence of a demonstration of the government’s comprehensive, careful, meticulous planning of what it needs to do and of how Australia will recover from the position it is being placed in with respect to debt, the government needs to persuade the parliament that it has done its homework, that it has prepared the ground for this momentous decision. That would give us the satisfaction of knowing that the colossal amount of money that the government proposes to spend is money that we can afford to spend and that we need to spend in order to find ourselves in a better place in the future.
I am very shocked at how quickly the government has geared up into PR mode on this package and ignored the harder, more mundane task of planning, explaining and setting out the fiscal basis on which this decision has been made. In particular, I am shocked by the way in which this government is prepared to bypass parliamentary process. What pride this government must have to ignore the lack of success of its most recent stimulus package and propose an even bigger one! The government was apparently unsuccessful with its a $10 billion package last year and now suggests that what we need is a bigger package, but it does not explain why or how this will succeed when the last one failed.
Previous speakers, including Senator Mason, have drawn attention to the lack of logic in the way in which this package is meant to create or support jobs. I would have thought that a package which is worth $10 billion and creates 75,000 jobs must mean that if you spend $42 billion you will create 300,000 jobs. Is that not logical, or has the cost of jobs risen so much in recent months or weeks that we can no longer make that kind of claim? If so, will the government have the decency to tell us that the promise of 75,000 jobs was a false promise, that there were no 75,000 jobs? In his article in Money magazine just yesterday, Mark Westfield, a director of CT Financial, said:
The last stimulus package in which $10.4 billion was given to sensitive voter groups before Christmas barely touched the sides and achieved nothing beyond a very temporary shot in the arm for retailers and pub and club poker machine owners.
Do we have the evidence before us to convince us that we are more likely to be successful with this package than with the last one? I do not think we do.
I would have thought that most Australians would instinctively welcome handouts of this kind. I have no doubt that those organisations who have spoken out in favour of this package—and a large number of them have been referred to already in the course of today’s debate in this chamber—would naturally welcome the spending of money on them or their constituent catchment groups. But I am surprised, in the midst of all that carpetbagging and pork-barrelling, that there are a large number of voices expressing concern. One constituent wrote to me today and told me about the reactions of local businesspeople in Canberra to the announcement of the stimulus package. He quoted a few things that they had to say, such as: ‘This will be great for stimulating poker machines.’ ‘Roof insulation—is that a joke?’ ‘This looks like panic, and that panic will spread.’ ‘They have no idea whether this will work.’ ‘We will be paying this off for years.’ That last comment was the kind of comment that any businessman would make when looking at the size of the debt being incurred by this measure.
I am particularly reminded that the Labor Party, while pushing this legislation through in a short time frame, was very opposed to the way in which the previous government handled sensitive legislation. The Labor Party was scathingly critical of the Liberal government for, for example, passing the Work Choices legislation in two weeks. I remember Senator Lundy expressing her shock on ABC Radio at that kind of ‘poor use of parliamentary processes’. I wonder what she thinks about a party which has now attempted to push through by far the biggest single package other than a budget in the space of just 48 hours. It does not say much for the consistency of the Australian Labor Party.
How astonishingly selfish, how incredibly short-sighted, how immensely patronising to think that the Australian public would not see through this self-serving sham of a stimulus package. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and indeed the entire Labor Party are behaving as though they deserve a Tim Tam for working so hard to come up with a package to jump-start the economy. I have told my children on occasions that you do not automatically get a Tim Tam because you have started the job; you get one when the job is done. And the fact is that this job is far from done. This job is a very big job that may take months or years to resolve. The Australian Labor Party puts forward its package at enormous cost to the Australian taxpayer in the expectation that this is the job done, and we have to assume that because it has left so little in reserve for the next stage, if that is required. Perhaps when the arrogance abates, the pride subsides and the Labor Party decides to have a mature, reasoned, real discussion and debate with other concerned Australians about the best way forward for Australia and its economy, then there will be a true reason to be proud. Our chores are not done, and now is not the time to break out the Tim Tams.
I hope that this government realises that Australians will see through this, that they will want convincing that this is right. The test of that will not be now or in the next few weeks or even in the next few months. It will be in a year’s time, when we look back and ask ourselves: is Australia substantially better off for having spent $42 billion of our children’s future? And if we cannot say that then that is when Australians will pass judement on this government and its package.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2009-02-05,"—I rise to speak on this package of bills that is before us today to fund a $42 billion stimulus package because I believe it is my duty, not only as an Australian and a member of the Senate but also as a father, to vehemently oppose this economic threat to the next generation, our children, and to their children. I have an email that I believe another colleague of mine may already have read out today, but I would like to read it out again because I think it states things very well. It is an email I received earlier today from an extremely concerned constituent. She says:
I do not make it a habit to write to elected members of parliament, but in this case I feel compelled to.
The federal government has recently forwarded a bill that it has labelled as a ‘stimulus plan’ for the country. It is nothing more than an insane political stunt that threatens the very welfare and prosperity of all Australians for generations to come.
Borrowing money to give cash handouts is in no way going to turn the Australian economy around. For every $1000 given out it is likely that the government will need to raise $2000 or more in taxes to pay for the handout. This taxation will deter future job growth. Many of their other spending initiatives will not create genuine wealth either, as they do not focus on greater productivity; productivity is the heart of employment. There is no long-term value in this radically irresponsible proposal.
I urge you as a fellow decent Australian to reject the government’s ‘stimulus plan’. Please do not try and second-guess what may be popular—this plan is utter madness. If this proposal is passed by the senate we are on the path towards complete destruction of future economic prosperity for generations to come.
The Australian people, as demonstrated by that email and many more that all senators on this side of the house have received, are genuinely concerned about this government’s reckless and risky plan, a plan with absolutely no guarantee of success. And so they should be.
At the last federal election just 16 months ago, Australians faced a choice between two political parties. The first was clearly acknowledged by all as having delivered strong economic management and guiding the nation through many challenging times. Back then, the future looked rosy for all Australians. The 11.5 years of hard work by that first party, the coalition, had eliminated the $96 billion debt accumulated through a series of ‘temporary deficits’ under the Hawke and Keating governments. We were consistently running surplus deficits. Our strongly growing economy was naturally increasing tax revenue to such an extent that we were able to put away billions of dollars for future needs, such as in the Future Fund and in the Communications Fund, which has now been disgracefully raided, and to provide billions of dollars in tax cuts to Australians. On that point, I would like to note that I have some concerns about where the government are going with the Future Fund. If they are going to find $42 billion to fund this, going $200 billion into debt, how long is it going to be before they get in and raid that trust fund as well? It is disgraceful.
As I said, 16 months ago we had a strongly growing economy which led to record low unemployment. Things were good. So much so that the current government were also keen to associate themselves with the economic approach of the then government—to ensure that voters felt comfortable about abandoning the coalition and coming to them, because economically Labor would approach things just the same as the coalition had. But here we are in February 2009 facing a vastly different scenario which exposes the misleading nature of what they were trying to present at the election.
It is incredible that we are standing here today looking at going back into debt—and not just in a small way. We are looking at going massively back into debt. As part of this package of bills, we have a request before us today to permit the government to expand the limit on its credit card from $75 billion—to lift it by an amazingly large amount, an additional $125 billion—to $200 billion. That is just astounding. As any Australian knows, once you get into the debt interest trap of a large loan it is very hard to pay it off and the debt load spirals.
So what is the government proposing in this package, given that it is going to impose such a large debt burden on future generations? Is it a package that addresses the single biggest potential threat to Australians from the effect of the global financial crisis, which is of course the loss of jobs? Does it contain measures to directly address the cost of employing people? Well, no, there is nothing in here that directly addresses the cost of employing people. Where is the money for new hospitals and improving the health system? It is not there. Where is the money to help those who have been most affected by the crisis—the self-funded retirees who have seen the impact on their share portfolios, on the money that they have squirrelled away over many years as they have looked after themselves and never asked anything of the taxpayers of Australia? There is nothing in there to help them. I have looked closely through this package and in all of these areas there is nothing. There is nothing for aged care. We saw in Tasmania recently that less than half the available beds offered in the latest aged-care approvals round were actually taken up because aged-care providers do not have the money to build the facilities to put the beds into. So where is the money for infrastructure to ensure that those most vulnerable Australians, the aged and the frail, actually have appropriate care in their older years? There is nothing in there.
I have heard a number of government senators in this place talk about how this package will help Australians deal with the impact of the global financial crisis. Quite clearly they are not going to be addressing those areas I have mentioned, but there is no doubt that all Australians who under this package are about to receive a cash handout will welcome it. Who would not welcome a cheque in the mail for $950 or multiple cheques for $950? What I have not heard is what the impact on most of those Australians will be. How has the global crisis that we currently face in the economic world impacted on many of these Australians who are looking at getting a cheque in the mail? If you still have a job or if you receive a government support payment of some type, I would suggest that there has been very little impact on you at this point. This is not to say that people with secure incomes are not struggling—there are many out there who are—but the struggle that they face is not a consequence of the financial crisis if they have a secure income. On the contrary, most Australians with a stable income are better off at the moment as a result of falling interest rates and petrol prices.
There is a well-accepted economic proposition that deficit finance should only be used to fund long-term infrastructure that will provide direct benefits to those who will be paying for it through taxes to cover interest and principal repayments. Despite the rhetoric and spin of the government, there is nothing in this package that provides such long-term benefits. What benefits will my children and their children receive for the taxes that they will be paying for many years, if not decades, to cover this massive exercise in political pork-barrelling? I contend that there are no benefits for them.
This package contains nothing to build future productive capacity; it is all one-off spending. Sure, it will temporarily boost economic activity figures, as we see in the retail figures that the government is so proudly touting, showing that there was a spike in retail activity last December. It is not surprising as there was $10.4 billion put out into the economy. The spike does not go anywhere near being a $10.4 billion spike; it is probably about one-quarter of that. It is not surprising, of course. If you put the money out there, it will increase the economic figures. It will show that there is a spike. But what will happen afterwards? What is the long-term benefit? Where is the long-term advantage in that spend? All it has done is cause a one-off increase in economic activity.
The package contains nothing to build future productive capacity. It will not jump-start any ongoing or lasting future economic activity. Rather, it places the burden of interest and principal payments on our children and grandchildren in order to fund one-off cash splashes. I contend that this is both irresponsible and inequitable.
Even worse, and as mentioned, this package is seeking authorisation to increase borrowings by an additional $125 billion from their current authorisation of $75 billion up to $200 billion. As I noted yesterday, Australians will best understand this as Mr Rudd asking whether he can extend the limit on his credit card from $75 billion to $200 billion. But, unlike the rest of us, he is not the person who will have to pay back the debt. That is right, there is no obligation on Mr Rudd to pay back the debt. He goes out and racks up $200 billion on his credit card and he does not have to worry because he never has to pay it back. On the contrary, it is a debt that he is incurring that will have to be paid back by taxpayers, particularly future taxpayers; our children and our grandchildren.
It is important to note as well that we are talking about up to $200 billion of debt. That works out at about $9,500 of debt for every man, woman and child in this country. I would think that any thinking Australian faced with the chance to get $950 upfront in return for a debt of $9,500 plus interest would reject the offer. But the Prime Minister does not have to concern himself with who will bear the heavy obligation of this debt. He does not have to plan or state how he intends to pay it back. He does not have to worry about that as it will not be him who retires the debt he wants to create today.
Then there is the interest on all this debt. The Prime Minister has not told the Australian people what services he will have to cut back on to pay the interest on the credit card which, if he takes it to its new limit, will be about $20 billion in interest per annum. What healthcare, education or defence spending programs will he cut so that he can pay the interest of up to $20 billion a year? All you can conclude from a package like this is that the Prime Minister is concerned with delaying the pain of this economic crisis, delaying it for just long enough for the full impact of the crisis to be masked, to be hidden from voters, so that he and Labor can be elected again. But of course in doing so he is condemning current and future taxpayers to far greater pain, condemning our young people and future governments to the challenge of finding $200 billion plus interest to put us back in the black. As mentioned, even if Mr Rudd remains Prime Minister for a number of terms, there is almost no chance he will have to make the hard decisions required to pay off the credit card.
This ill-considered and irresponsible spend of $42 billion is the latest instalment in what can only be termed a comedy of economic errors. It would be a comedy if it was not such a serious economic policy blunder—a blunder with ramifications that not only will leave future generations saddled with unprecedented levels of debt but will inevitably result in higher taxes in the medium and long term. Even the Prime Minister, the grand architect of this economic vandalism, this gross fiscal irresponsibility, this blatant abuse and misuse of taxpayers’ money, has clearly spelled out to us that it might not even work. What is becoming increasingly apparent is that this is a government in panic mode, this is a government that is making up policy on the run and this is a government that is completely lost at sea when it comes to the responsible economic management of this nation.
It is interesting to note the commentary in today’s media by former Labor leader Mark Latham on this government’s spending habits, using such terms as ‘profligacy’ and ‘fiscal carnage’. This is the same Mark Latham that many in the Labor Party abandoned after the 2004 election because he was too radical, yet here is the too-radical Mark Latham telling us that this government is leading the Australian economy into economic oblivion. I am sure it will not be too long before Australians will wish that Mark Latham was still the leader of the Labor Party because, incredibly, he would have been a more responsible economic manager than Kevin Rudd.
Even more worrying is that the illustrious overseer of the recession we had to have, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, has come out from under his rock to congratulate Kevin Rudd on his plan to plunge Australia into debt of epic proportions. It is a $200 billion millstone around the necks of the Australian people, whose interests we are bound, by solemn oath, to faithfully represent in this chamber. That is from Paul Keating, the last Prime Minister to send us into the debt shackles, the last Prime Minister to deliver more than one million unemployed and a man with totally disproven economic credentials. It took 10 years for the coalition to fix the economy after his time in office. Australians should be shivering in their boots at the thought of this government taking advice from and accepting the plaudits of Paul Keating. The only more worrying event would be the same from the man who oversaw the dismantling of our economy in the 1970s, Gough Whitlam. It took 20 years for the economy to recover after his efforts.
Here we are staring down the face of a $200 billion  debt, a full $9,500 debt for every single Australian. This is what the Prime Minister has arrogantly asked the opposition to obediently agree to, without question and without scrutiny. But this we will not do. It is time to make a stand for ordinary Australians, to draw a line in the sand and to say no to the man whose spending plans for this country utterly dwarf those of the previous government that he accused of spending like a drunken sailor when he was in opposition.
The government continually repeats the phrase that they are taking swift and decisive action. It obviously tests well in focus groups. I will tell you that there is a very important element missing in that phrase, and that is that the action must be the right action. It must be correct and it must be appropriate for addressing the challenges. It is not enough to simply say, ‘We are taking swift and decisive action,’ if it is the wrong action.
In circumstances such as we face, where we are staring down the barrel of a sustained period of economic difficulty, it is incumbent on us making decisions in this place to ensure that we make the right decisions. We have to look at these issues in detail and ensure a proper, full and considered decision. If this takes time, then it has to take that time; otherwise, the consequences of the crisis will be much worse for all Australians.
It has been suggested that, because of the severity of the crisis, we on this side in this place should sit down and get out of the way. It is said that this is not the time for us to delay and obfuscate necessary measures for fixing the economy. On the contrary, I very strongly believe. Given the severity of the potential consequences of failure, it is precisely in circumstances such as these that the opposition has its strongest duty to ensure that measures such as this package are fully and properly scrutinised and rejected if they do not measure up. The consequences are too great to get it wrong in this place. And I contend that clearly this is not the package that this nation needs today.
With breathtaking hypocrisy and not a small amount of self-indulgent, ideological navel-gazing this Prime Minister and his government have, with the greatest of ease, performed one of the most spectacular U-turns in Australian political history. The term ‘U-turn’ has most famously been applied to Ted Heath, British Prime Minister during the early seventies, who, in a similar fit of mind to the one we are seeing here in Australia today, abandoned the Conservative Party’s core principles of economic liberalism to disastrous effect in the UK.
But back to the comedy of errors. Back in 2007, as the signs began to appear, warnings of an impending crisis were given, most notably by the then Treasurer, Peter Costello. I think he even warned, while still in government and still Treasurer, of the impending economic tsunami that Australia was facing as a result of the global financial situation. But rather than heed the warnings so prudently given by those of us who actually understand economic matters—those on this side of this place—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer instead chose to engage in an ill-advised strategy of talking the economy down, characterised by their widely cited references to a fairytale menagerie of inflation creatures.
This led to an enormous amount of pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia, the RBA, to increase interest rates, which was a disastrous outcome for an economy about to experience its biggest downturn since early last century. Despite central banks in comparable nations around the globe reducing interest rates during that period in an effort to stave off the crisis, the penny just did not drop for our esteemed Labor friends. In 2008 business and consumer confidence fell away in Australia, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry business confidence survey showed the lowest level ever of business confidence in the 14-year history of the survey. Still the Labor government continued to talk down the economy.
I also find it very interesting to note that, around the time of releasing the first economic stimulus package late last year, the Treasurer started talking about how he had been planning it with the Secretary of Treasury since February of last year. If he was aware of the need to stimulate the economy in February of last year, why did he persist in talking down the economy for another seven months with interest rate rises and other negative consequences for Australians? The only conclusion that I can draw is that the government saw a political need to attack the reality and strength of the coalition’s economic credentials and saw talking up inflation as the only option they had, as misleading as it was. If we were in the US such a scenario would lead to the commencement of an impeachment process.
Having failed to act appropriately or in the interests of the Australian people during the initial stages of the effects of the global financial crisis on this country, the government—by this stage in a state of panic—decided to devise and implement some of the most disastrous economic policies we have seen in many, many years, which brings me to the bungled bank guarantee. Yes, the bungled bank guarantee that resulted in the freezing of the investment savings of a quarter of a million Australians. Where in the package is something to help them? A quarter of a million Australians were then advised by Treasurer Wayne Swan to ‘go to Centrelink’. This was truly bad policy. It was an initially uncapped—and I stress ‘uncapped’—bank guarantee for all deposits in certain Australian banks and financial institutions, but not all financial institutions, and for wholesale term funding. Not surprisingly, financial markets are still suffering from the disarticulation caused by that policy. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (NATION BUILDING AND JOBS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2009-02-05,"—I join my colleagues in this momentous debate. It is one of the most important, significant, momentous pieces of legislation to go through the parliament in my time. I was party to many such reforms when we were in government. They were tough reforms and we undertook them. The GST comes to mind, which was a very big one. Previous to that, during the Hawke-Keating government, a debate that took up a great deal of emotion and time in this chamber was the native title debate. I could run through a whole list of momentous occasions where both sides of the parliament made exchanges in the debate, as is their responsibility and as is their duty to their public office.
I say to those listening to the broadcast, we have a very bizarre situation here in the parliament. We have a government whose Prime Minister recently—and on more than one occasion, I should add—has gone on television, looking all so ashen-faced, to alert the Australian public to the crisis that befalls the nation. He has done it twice. He did it for the $10.2 billion package and he did it for the $42 billion package. He has elevated this issue to priority 1, which, by the way, it is—of course it is—and that is why we are in the chamber.
Opposition senator interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, you can see where I am heading with this. The point I am making is—you are asleep, are you?
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order, Senator McGauran! I ask you to withdraw that. I made no comment. Your colleague interjected on you; I made no comment about your remarks. I ask you to withdraw that. I find it most insulting. I am sitting here listening to your speech. I ask you to withdraw your comment and apologise.
—I withdraw my comment to you.
—Thank you. You should withdraw, particularly given that we are being broadcast.
—Indeed.
—And you might ask your colleagues to refrain from interjecting on you.
—I do not have the courage to do that.
—I will call them to order otherwise. Carry on.
—I do withdraw with all sincerity. Such is the emotion of the issue and, as you rightly point out, we are being broadcast. That is the point I want to make: we are being broadcast on an issue that the Prime Minister, the government and the world are deeply involved in, yet look at the speakers list. Not one government member has come in to speak on this bill. Are they out there being clever? I would say they are out there—most of them have flown home. I would guarantee it. We ought to call a quorum on this just to see if anyone stayed behind. The point is this: they may think that they are being clever by not speaking on this issue—and this is what they will tell their electorates—‘so that we could get it through the parliament’. Parliaments are not for that, and this issue most of all is not for that. This issue is for debate. They ought to get up and justify it, not just to us in this parliament, which is their responsibility; they ought to get up, justify it and debate it with us whilst we are being broadcast and on the internet. Not one government member is on the speakers list. As a Victorian senator I find it doubly offensive that the Victorian government senators have not come into the parliament and debated this momentous issue, and it is a momentous issue.
Where is Senator Conroy, representing the Treasurer, who should be leading this debate? Where is Senator Conroy? He has gone home. I would guarantee that Senator Conroy has gone home. Where is the other Victorian senator, Senator Marshall? Senator Marshall is never short of a word, but today he is quiet—nothing.
—Gag order.
—The gag is on him. What courage do they have against the whip or the leader? It would be coming from the Prime Minister’s office, because everything comes from the Prime Minister’s office on that side, even such disgraceful instructions. It is an offence to their oath as part of their public life. Where is Senator Marshall, who is never short of a word? He is one of the great filibusters in this parliament. He has gone home and refuses to debate one of the most important issues to ever go through this parliament, one that is going to affect generations, as my colleagues before me have said—and how true is that? You do not ratchet up $200 billion and not affect several generations, quite frankly. The previous speaker, Senator Bushby, mentioned the Whitlam government. It took generations to flush all the errors of the Whitlam government out of the system. Quite frankly, it was not until the Howard-Costello government that all those errors of debt and deficit were flushed through the system. It took generations, and here we are faced with the same economic madness and approach, as we see it, as the Whitlam government. It is worse, frankly, and I will speak about that later.
Whatever our argument is, whatever we believe is right—and we do—where are you to tell us your case in this parliament? It is not just us—although you are responsible to the whole parliament—but those following the proceedings via the broadcast or the internet, and those back in your electorates, who want to know, who want to see the Hansard and who want to see you present the case. I am labouring this point because I will duplicate everything else that speakers before me and to follow say about the ineffectiveness, the inefficiency and the sheer danger in $42 billion. I will get onto that, but I particularly want to focus on this point and the Victorian senators. Where is the Victorian Senator Collins who has been in and out of this parliament and replaced Senator Ray just recently? She is an experienced senator; she is not inexperienced. She knows how to get up in this parliament and argue her case. She has replaced the godfather of Victorian Labor politics, Senator Ray, who I should add would never kowtow to such an instruction as to not get up and speak on this issue, but Senator Collins has. Is she in the parliament? She has gone home.
—She’s in a committee hearing.
—Order, senators! You should not be having this across-the-chamber chat.
—She ought to—
 (Senator Forshaw)—Excuse me, Senator McGauran, but I just want to advise you that I have listened closely to your remarks—all of your remarks, despite your earlier comment—and you are potentially reflecting improperly upon members of this chamber, particularly those who may actually be in this building attending a Senate committee hearing on this particular legislation. So I think you should address the matters before the chamber, as distinct from reflecting upon other senators.
—Are you on the speakers list, Mr Acting Deputy President, at some point?
—Senator, I ask you to return to your remarks.
—The remarks are hugely significant and I will reiterate the point: no government senator has risen to speak on this bill. That is hugely significant. Those watching or those listening ought to know that and those back in the electorates ought to know that. We have a government who are laying down the foundations of generational debt and have a facility within this bill for $200 billion of borrowings, of debt—future debt—and who would doubt they are going to spend it?
—The Prime Minister couldn’t even be bothered voting for it.
—Yes, thank you, Senator Birmingham, who is to follow me. Last night the House of Representatives went to five o’clock in the morning on this bill and even then, I should add, many opposition members—Liberal and National party members of parliament—never had a chance to speak because the guillotine came down. But five o’clock is fair enough, to a degree; I am not going to dispute that there was significant debate. I should add that some of the government members did rise to speak. It was a long and tiring but hugely significant debate.
When you go to five o’clock in the morning in this place, it is for a debate of national interest. Now, this is a debate of national interest and the bells ring but where is the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister? They are nowhere to be seen. This is a Prime Minister who, ashen faced, does not mind taking up a bit of dramatic time on television to alert the nation to the crisis that we behold and to say that he is available to fix it, but he will not turn up and put his name to the legislation. You are paid to vote in this place and in the House of Representatives. You are paid to vote, but the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister did not turn up. No doubt—separately—they had gone to bed. They left it to the juniors to fix up. You cannot do that. It is an insult to the parliament and it is an insult to the constituency—an utter insult. As for the Prime Minister, as we get to know him, as the Australian public get to know him, we see that this is the man, this is the fake, this is the fraud who went to the Australian public before the election calling himself the economic conservative. We always knew it was a fraudulent statement but we see now he is railing against neoliberalism and economic conservatism. Quite frankly, it must be a great relief to the likes of Senator Cameron and Senator Carr that this facade of economic conservatism has been dropped. No-one ever believed it. The Australian public may have bought it at one stage but now the facade has fallen—and what a relief to Senator Cameron and Senator Carr! They could not get off the blocks quickly enough to condemn economic conservatism under, as they put it, the banner of neoliberalism—whatever that means. Both of them have stood up here espousing their old and dearly held socialist policies and the Labor Party policy of tax and spend.
—The comrades are back.
—‘The comrades are back,’ says my colleague, and no two epitomise that more than Senator Carr and Senator Cameron. Where are they? Where are they in this debate?
—Senator McGauran, I ask you to refrain from making improper imputations against members of this Senate because they are not here in this chamber or in this debate at the moment. I can advise you that Senator Cameron is actually attending the hearing of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee—as a member of that committee—dealing with this legislation and that that is sitting through till 10 o’clock tonight. I ask you to refrain from making those improper imputations. It is disorderly and it is contrary to the standing orders.
—I take it you are entering my debate; you are debating with me.
—No, I am drawing to your attention—
—No, it is most—
—that you have—
—I consider it most improper—
—Order!
—the issue that you would raise to defend two colleagues in a debate that I have raised.
—Order! Senator McGauran, I have just called on you to refrain from making that improper imputation that was made against Senator Cameron, and I explained my reasoning for doing so. I ask you to return to the debate.
—I do return to the debate and I do ask you, in your role as chair, to reflect on what I would consider an entry into my debate. I would like a ruling from the President on that matter.
—I am happy to refer it to the President.
—Thank you.
—I will ask the President to consider all of the remarks that have been made. I ask you to continue.
—Whatever the circumstances, I have here a printed speakers list. This is what we go by, and it is in black and white. People can try and justify their absence from the speakers list, but the whole government crew are not on the speakers list. Unless they—the likes of Senator Cameron, Senator Carr and Senator Conroy—throw themselves on it on Monday to speak, unless they finally break the shackles of the Prime Minister’s gag and get up in here on Monday, it is fair enough for me to say and take it that no-one from the government is going to speak on this matter. I stand my ground on that. It is pretty basic. I do not know—or care—where they are in the parliament; I would like them at some point to stand up here in the parliament and speak on this bill. It is highly significant. It is critical. I bet you this: the next election will turn on this issue.
As our leader, Mr Turnbull, said, we may cop a bit of short-term unpopularity on this because we are saying that the cash handouts are ineffective and ought not be given, but I would say, as he said, that we are about doing the right thing. We have the record, we have the runs on the board, in regard to prudent economic management—successful economic management. Even when we were in government we took the hard decisions, the short-term unpopular decisions, in the national interest, because we thought they were right, and most of the time we were right. Most of the time Australian households were better off for it in the long run and for generations to come—until Labor were elected.
—They’re not better off now.
—They are not better off now, not since Labor were elected. The legacy of the previous government was the envy of the world. I do not know of another government that has zero debt—
—It used to.
—When Labor came into government, yes. ‘It used to,’ says my colleague; that is quite right. In just over 12 months, since they came into government, the zero debt—the jewel that we left them that would have greatly helped them ride through this crisis—is gone. No other country that I can name had zero debt. It took 10 years to pay off the former Labor government’s debt, their legacy of $96 billion of debt. I note the previous speaker quoted Paul Keating recently coming out and congratulating this government on their $42 billion racking-up of debt just with this one stimulus package. Of course he did, because this is classic Labor. The Treasurer of the previous Labor government congratulates the Treasurer of the existing Labor government for ratcheting up debt. We do not believe in the reduction or the minimising of debt for the sake of it; there is a reason behind it. That reason is the interest payments. A country makes itself vulnerable to the world circumstances and financial markets and has to pay it all out in interest rates, when that money could be better spent elsewhere.
I support my colleagues’ comments in condemning this ‘significant’, ‘important’ legislation. I condemn the other side not just for introducing the bill but for their sheer cowardice in not coming in to debate and defend it and put it up to the Australian people, to the tens of thousands that listen to this broadcast—and there are tens of thousands who listen to the broadcast. Sheer cowardice, that is what it is. We are going to continue to debate this all next week and we are going to take it into the committee stage. Maybe someone on that side will have the courage to stand up and speak. This bill ought to be rejected.
