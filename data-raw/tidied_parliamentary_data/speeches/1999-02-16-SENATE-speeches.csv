"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-16,"—My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Hill. Minister, I refer to the Remuneration Tribunal's decision in December last year to alter the conditions regarding parliamentarians' use of charter flights, and I ask: who wrote the government submission to the tribunal; when was the submission lodged; who authorised the submission; what did the government submission propose or recommend; and what was the reasoning for proposing the change? Most importantly, what prompted the government's submission?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Members of Parliament: Travel Costs</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-16,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for seeking that information. My question, Minister, went to who wrote the submission, when it was lodged, who authorised it, what the submission proposed and recommended and what the reasoning was. If the minister would care to take all those aspects of my question on notice and provide 
 an answer, I am sure we would all appreciate it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Members of Parliament: Travel Costs</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-02-16,"—I presume what prompted it was the ambiguity that has been recognised not only by our side of politics but also by the Labor Party, including Mr Beazley today. Alternatively—and I will have to check this—the Remuneration Tribunal, as I recall it, acknowledged the ambiguity itself the year before. So there were plenty of reasons for it to move to overcome that ambiguity and clarify the rules, and it so did. With respect to any specific submission that was made by the government in that regard, if it was made I presume it was made by the Minister for Finance and Administration, who I think normally makes these submissions. But I will seek information on that and provide it to Senator Faulkner as soon as I can.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Members of Parliament: Travel Costs</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-16,"—Further to a question to me from Senator Quirke earlier on in question time in relation to security and outsourcing, I can advise the Senate that, at the request of the Department of Finance and Administration, Ernst and Young are currently carrying out an exhaustive review of financial reporting procedures 
 in the department to ensure that fraud or unauthorised transactions do not occur.
In relation to the recent prosecution, I can advise that it is important to point out that the person involved was a contract employee. He was contracted by the former Department of Administrative Services in July 1997. Despite what some media commentators and members of the opposition are suggesting, this case has nothing to do with outsourcing. It does not involve in any way any of the suppliers currently providing services outsourced by the Department of Finance and Administration. In relation to the ongoing review that was mentioned, I will get back to the Senator.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Finance and Administration: Missing Money</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (Senator Ian Macdonald), to a question without notice asked by Senator Mackay today, relating to air safety.
I noted with interest that a question was asked in the other place by the member for Dickson in relation to this matter. I will give the chamber an indication of what happened during the estimates hearing. I will advise the chamber of what Minister Anderson's response was. In the estimates last week, Mr Smith, in an exchange with Senator Brown, indicated that he thought BASI had succumbed to pressure to stop the trial. He said:
I believe there is another agenda. I believe that BASI was forced in some way.
On the interim recommendations from BASI, Mr Smith said:
I said I believed it was substantially fictitious.
He also said:
I generally knew when I read the BASI report that it was very biased.
Rob Lee, who is the Director of BASI, said:
. . . Mr Smith did not present a shred of evidence which supported any of his claims . . . and the idea that we have this sort of capture by the airlines is unsustainable in the light of the evidence.
He said that Mr Smith was making bizarre allegations and that he was talking absolute nonsense. What was Minister Anderson's response to this in answer to a question from the member for Dickson just now? He said, `From time to time there are professional differences of opinion.' I think it is a statement of the bleeding obvious, and I do not think it adequately expresses the concerns that were raised in estimates.
In response to the G class air trial that was aborted late last year, Minister Anderson announced that there would be a full report in relation to this matter and released as recently as a week ago, unbeknownst to Senator Macdonald, it would appear, the terms of reference of the inquiry into the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and what it would look at. In the estimates—and Senator Macdonald seems to have had temporary amnesia—the question was asked directly of Senator Macdonald in relation to what is a critical report in terms of re-establishing the credibility of air safety in Australia: will this be a public review? Senator Macdonald with no qualms whatsoever said, `No, Senator. It will not be.'
Today in the chamber all of a sudden Senator Macdonald says that he has been busy helping regional Australia—I think we could go on a bit about that—but he is not aware of the facts, et cetera. Well, he was then. He was very clear—no, it would not be a public review. The government have never, ever said this review would be made public, yet they are saying it is a major panacea for the restoration of confidence in air safety in Australia.
What do we have from Senator Macdonald instead? Against a background where Minister Anderson has seen fit, in terms of the seriousness of the allegations, to order a full inquiry into the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, Senator Macdonald stands up here in the Senate today and reasserts Mr Smith's allegations that the airlines were pressured by the unions. This is a minister who is restating allegations already made by Mr Smith against a background where the substantive minister in the other place has felt it necessary to announce a major inquiry in relation to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. This is extraordinary!
A minister, irrespective of where he or she is, ought to be in a situation of attempting to allay these fears, not simply repeat the allegations which have led to a so-called impartial investigation which, I will repeat again, the government has absolutely no intention of making public. The government has made no commitment that this report will be made public. All that has been made public are the 
 terms of reference. We say, `Big deal!' Anybody can release terms of reference. What we want from this government is a commitment that the BASI report will be released.
At the moment we have the Hawke report in relation to CASA, BASI and Airservices Australia, which the government will not release. We also have a review into Airservices Australia which the government will not release. Now, before the report into BASI is actually done, the government is saying that it will not be released. No wonder there is no confidence in air safety in this country. No wonder the people of Australia are saying, `What is going on? What leadership is this government providing?'",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Airspace Trial</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-02-16,"—I too was at estimates on this particular day along with my colleague from Tasmania, Senator O'Brien. I believe that in the estimates that day the matters that Senator Mackay raised were fully canvassed. Dick Smith and the executive director of CASA had ample time to put their point of view. I also believe that Dr Lee from BASI had his opportunity to put his point of view.
There were quite a few accusations made both inside estimates and outside of estimates. I think the minister has taken the right action. He announced the very next day that there would be a review, not an investigation, of BASI. I recall that in the evidence on that particular day—it was a long day—the point was made that this would be the first full review of BASI in 10 years. There have been other reviews of parts of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, but the point was made that this is the first full review to be made in the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in 10 years.
It is very easy for the Labor Party to come in here and point the finger. But I recall when they were in government and when Senator Bob Collins was involved on that side of politics. He too during estimates and outside of estimates was very concerned about air safety in Australia. Air safety in Australia has been an ongoing problem. One only has to recall some of the disasters such as the Monarch crash and the more recent one of a seaplane in Sydney. I believe that a report 
 will be coming forward on that in the next week or two. That was indicated to us at estimates.
I believe that Dick Smith, who has been Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority both under the Labor government and under our government, is not a politically driven person at all. I believe he is looking to the best outcomes for the travelling public in Australia. A person of his character would not have raised these matters if he did not perceive that there may be a problem. I have total faith in both CASA and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. They both deal with similar problems. They both agree that there perhaps is a need for both organisations to work together more effectively and efficiently. This is one of the things that probably came out of the review.
I believe our minister, John Anderson, has, as I said earlier, made the right decision and nipped this matter in the bud. I just hope that all parties get together, have a look at what has been said and answer the questions that have been put. I do not believe that coming in here today and highlighting the matter again is going to alleviate any of the concerns that the travelling public might have, but I certainly believe that the review that Minister Anderson has foreshadowed may go some of the way to answering some of the questions that Dick Smith raised and will also give Dr Lee the opportunity to put to bed some of those queries that have been raised.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: Airspace Trial</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I rise to speak on this motion, having sat through the estimates and listened to the allegations which Mr Smith made about the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, Ansett and its officers and the RAAF. Frankly, I do not believe that there was any substantiation given for the allegations made under parliamentary privilege about those reputable organisations—certainly BASI is a most reputable organisation—which, as far as I am concerned, are without blemish.
But let me say that that was a trend which continued. Prior to estimates on 20 January Mr Smith was reported in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald as making severe criticisms of BASI and claiming that a series 
 of problems within CASA had existed for two years. He described BASI as a secret organisation that had never been reviewed—I want you to remember those words—and implied that BASI investigators may be the captive elements of the private aviation industry and that it suffered from conflicts of interest.
If those comments are not calculated to bring into disrepute one of the most reputable investigative organisations not only in this country but also around the world, then I do not know what sort of comments would be. Frankly, the most concerning aspect about those allegations is that on that same day Minister Anderson's staff were doing the rounds of the gallery within an hour of Mr Smith's statements highlighting the minister's concerns over those statements.
If, on that day, the minister was prepared to highlight his concerns, why have we not seen more expeditious action by the minister? So far as the parliament and the Australian public are aware, all that is being proposed is that there is going to be a closed door inquiry into BASI. We are told that that will have no relationship whatsoever to the allegations; it just happens to be occurring following Mr Smith's comments. We are told, `Oh, no, this is just a cyclical examination. BASI has got nothing to do with any particular aspect. We are just going to conduct a review.'
Following that, there was a meeting on 26 January between Mr Anderson and the CASA board. On 8 February we had Mr Smith telling the estimates committee a great many things, making all sorts of allegations, without any proof. He said, for example, that Ansett had threatened CASA over the G class air trial. He named an employee of Ansett, Mr Trevor Jensen, as the officer who made the threat. I found that rather strange, considering that prior to this having occurred, Qantas had said that they would not fly in the G class airspace trial area, and in fact stopped flying. Was this action which was calculated to suborn CASA, or was it in fact because Qantas—particularly its pilots, who have responsibility for their passengers, it must be said—had concerns about the safety of the system? 
—They did not want to change.
—It is suggested that they didn't want to change. But they fly through a great many changes. They are the people who sit up the front of the aircraft, who have responsibility for the safety of the passengers. They commenced participating in the trial and a number of concerns were expressed. The Qantas people withdrew. Qantas itself said, `We are not flying in the space.' There was an allegation made that they were trying to suborn CASA about that.
The allegation was made that a Mr Trevor Jensen had written a letter to Mr Toller and said that he was going to keep it in his bottom draw. I will tell you what concerned me about that allegation: if that was supposed to be material evidence, why did Mr Toller then shred the only piece of solid evidence that might have been given to the committee? That is the evidence that he gave to the committee. He shredded the evidence, if there ever was any.
This is a matter on which the government should have acted by now. This is an issue which will cause concern to the flying public. Unless the minister gets something done quickly, those problems will be exacerbated. A great many issues will continue to be raised about this matter.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-02-16,"—I too rise to speak on this particular subject. I think all the speakers here today were at the hearings last week, including Senator Mackay, who asked the question, and the minister, Senator Macdonald, who was there the whole time. From the question that Senator Mackay asked today, you would not believe that she had been there at all. That question was designed to deliberately mislead those people listening to this debate.
From the evidence put before us, whether it be by CASA, Airservices Australia or BASI, I ended up with a very clear impression that they all believed that, properly implemented, the G class airspace principles or scheme, which is used widely around the world—most countries of the world—was the best scheme. They highlighted very clearly that what effectively stopped the trial going 
 ahead was the reluctance of the companies or company—and you can put your own interpretation on the evidence given to us, although, as has already been said by Senator O'Brien, Ansett was named. But there was certainly a resistance to the scheme by the pilots operating the trial. They were reluctant to do it. There was a very clear implication that the pilots were resistant to the training that was required for the scheme's proper and effective operation. It was not the scheme itself that was under criticism per se; it was the attitude of the people who had to operate the scheme that put the risk in place.
Senator O'Brien interjecting—
—You can interject all you like, Senator O'Brien. I let you sit there in peace. You can put your own interpretation on what was said there, but at the end of the day, it was the resistance by the people who had to operate it that would not let it go ahead. Mr Toller, the secretary to CASA, said that once that recommendation was made from BASI, he had no option but to cease the trial or to resign. He was put in a totally untenable position. He related to that letter, which you correctly identified, and some of the pressures that were there.
It is absolutely unreasonable of Senator Mackay to come in here and say that the BASI report should be put on the table. That is the sort of proposition that comes only from oppositions. You must let that process go through. It must be examined properly by the government or the minister; he must determine what action should be taken in dealing with that particular report. That is the role of the minister, that is the role of government. At the end of the day, if he determines that that report or part of that report can be released, so be it. The allegations and the counter response left many questions wide open. It is not the sort of thing where you should be trying to pick winners in a political debate. Air safety is far more important than that.
I think it is a damnation on the opposition that they come in here today in this tone when this assessment process is going on right now. The allegations that were made need to be got to the bottom of. Minister 
 Anderson has already started that process, and he should be congratulated for that. I think there needs to be some recognition of the emphasis which all those who appeared before us—those from CASA, BASI and Airservices—put on the importance of air safety and also of their acknowledgment of the high standards which all in Australia are aiming to achieve.
I conclude my comments today by saying that the three organisations need clear guidelines put down. There needs to be definition regarding their responsibilities. Once that it is done, I think some, if not all, of the problems can be overcome. In the longer term, those hearings will be deemed to have been very useful in determining the direction of air safety. But if, in fact, it is the pilots, through their actions, or some individuals who have stopped this trial—not a shortcoming in the actual scheme of the trial itself—that is a damnation on them.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I would like to pick up the last comments made by Senator Crane when he attacked the opposition for bringing this issue into the Senate today. I would have thought that it was incumbent upon us and, indeed, the government to discuss this very issue in this chamber.
I watched the proceedings in the Senate estimates committee last Monday as a member of the committee. I have followed this issue closely for some years. In my second year as a senator, in 1995, I served on a committee, established at the request of the then opposition, that looked at issues of air safety and air noise surrounding Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The issue of air safety is one of the most critical issues that this government has to deal with at the moment. In my view, you have an absolute mess in this country at the moment, and this is due to the politicisation of air safety and air regulation by this government.
Let us go back to what the situation was prior to when this government was elected. Back in the early 1990s, issues came to light regarding problems that existed within the Civil Aviation Authority—and, particularly, we recall the Monarch and Seaview disasters. 
 The then minister, Mr Brereton, notwithstanding the political fallout that might have occurred and the possible damage to or criticism of the then Labor government, set about reforming the organisational structure of air safety and air regulation in this country. He took steps to separate from the then CAA the roles that it had in air regulation. We ended up with the establishment of Air Services Australia as well as CASA and, of course, BASI continued on as the investigative body. The appropriate structures were put in place to take us forward with respect to air safety and air regulation.
But what happened when this government got into power? The first thing they did was try to undermine the board of CASA. They hounded the board members and the then chairman of the board, Justice Bill Fisher, in an endeavour to drive them out of office. The then minister, John Sharp, even requested the resignation of those members. Why? Because he and the Liberal government had an agenda to put Dick Smith in charge of CASA. The government was trying to politicise CASA, and they eventually succeeded by replacing the members of the board and the chairman of CASA.
We all know that Dick Smith is a passionate person—and I certainly applaud some of the ventures and activities that Dick Smith has been involved in over the years. But everyone knows that he has a certain passion for reforming, in his words, air navigation and air safety in line with his views. He has pursued the Airspace 2000 program, particularly in relation to G-space regulation. In my view, he has pursued it to the point where, if he does not get his own way, he lashes out at anybody who criticises him. If you had watched the estimates proceedings the other day you would have seen him, first of all, blame Mick Toller, because Mick was the person who had made the decision when Dick Smith, the chairman, was in New Zealand. He then attacked the pilots. He said it was the pilots and the pilots union that caused the abandonment of the demonstration trial.
I remember John Howard, when he was Leader of the Opposition, giving evidence to the Senate select committee regarding the 
 issue of a new airport in Sydney. What did he say to that committee? He said, `I'll take the word of the pilots any day.' John Howard then said, `The best judges of air safety in respect of aviation issues are the pilots.' I am sure the Deputy President will remember this as she served some time on that committee.
Dick Smith attacked the airlines last Monday. Then he ultimately attacked BASI. What do we have here? We have a situation where the organisational structure that was set up and accepted by all the players in the industry is now coming apart at the seams, and it is ultimately the fault and responsibility of this government.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-16,"—I think it is very easy in this place to attack the players in this quite complicated set of circumstances and to forget to look at the basic need to be addressed here—that is, the safety of airline travellers in Australia.
Having listened to the quite complex arguments put to the Senate committee last week on this matter, I cannot help but conclude that the radar based system, which was implemented by CASA—the head of the board being Dick Smith—was a safer system than the old one. It brought Australia in line with modern practice in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. However, under pressure from the airlines and, in particular, the airline pilots, it has been abandoned, withdrawn, and Australia has gone back to the old system whereby pilots are informed and take note of air safety through the radio system.
What we should have in this country is a radar system which is augmented by a radio system at regional airports. That was recommended by the British Civil Aviation Authority when it looked at the situation in Australia before the implementation of the radar trial. That is what Australia should have. I am not going to be diverted by what the opposition, the government or anybody else has to say on this. I think Australia's air travellers are being given second-rate safety. I repeat that: I think Australia's air travellers are being given second-rate safety.
There is a real problem here because it appears that the pilots themselves do not want to change from the system they are used to, because they feel comfortable with it, to a system which they do not feel comfortable with, because it is new, although it is a safer system. As I said in the committee, I think this can be likened to me not wanting to change from typewriters to computers because I am a bit long in the tooth and I find the changing technology difficult. That does not mean that the technology is not as good. In fact, we all know that computers are far better technology. The same with the radar. It is a safer technology. Augmented with radio operators at regional airports, it is a far better technology for the travelling public.
When we got down to comparing the two systems, which is the exercise that should settle this matter, we found that BASI, a chief player in having the system abandoned, had made no comparison between the old system favoured by the pilots and the new system used everywhere else in the world which is safer.
—It was not their job.
—Senator O'Brien says it is not their job; I believe it is. They are the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and they told the committee that after 1990 when they reviewed they became proactive, not reactive. That meant that they were in the business of ensuring Australia had the best safety standards, not waiting until something went wrong, until there was a crash, before they reacted and saw those standards were bought in.
Beyond and behind all the skirmishing on this is the need for the minister to stand strong and to ensure that he backs those people, including Mr Smith, who want the best air safety system in Australia. I finish by saying that, like all honourable senators here and many people listening to this, I am a frequent air traveller and I am concerned about the safety of millions of Australians travelling each year. I am very worried indeed that the most safe system in the world, which Australia should have, is not implemented and has been put on the backburner and we are 
 not going to see it for some years. That situation is not good enough.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-02-16,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the second report on the deaths of Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975, together with the report and a copy of a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I watched the report on the ABC's Foreign Correspondent  program on 20 October 1998 concerns the deaths of five Australian-based journalists at Balibo in 1975. While not usually persuaded by journalistic crusades, I was struck by the account presented by the alleged new eye-witness to the deaths of the journalists. Having taken a transparent and open 
 attitude to this matter over the years I felt that further inquiry was justified into this new account and that I owed it to the families to see that all available information relating to the deaths of their loved ones was thoroughly examined.
I therefore asked Mr Sherman to look again at the deaths of the five Australia-based journalists. Mr Sherman's brief was to evaluate any information about the deaths emerging from or relevant to the Foreign Correspondent  program, which was in addition to that covered in his first report. As the new information related to the deaths of the journalists at Balibo, Mr Sherman did not look again at the death of Roger East—nor was he was offered any new information on the death of Roger East.
As I did when I tabled Mr Sherman's first report in 1996, I emphasise that the Government has been thoroughly transparent on this issue. At the beginning of the second evaluation I said that Mr Sherman would have full access to all material held by the Government on the matter. Mr Sherman did ask for access to a variety of material, including relevant intelligence material, and for interviews with a number of former government officials who worked with this material. The Government cooperated fully, and respected Mr Sherman's independence at all times. Mr Sherman sets out his account of the information from Government sources in Chapter 5, and his conclusions about it are on page 139. The Government is also giving favourable consideration to the publication of documents relating to this historical period and a final decision will be made in due course.
In his letter to me covering the second report, Mr Sherman states that he recognises the Government may be concerned that his references to intelligence material disclose details of sources and methods relating to the gathering of intelligence. The Government takes disclosure of such information very seriously, and has therefore decided not to include in the tabled version of the second report some references which could disclose sources of intelligence. These references are a very small component of Mr Sherman's report, and their length is apparent in paragraphs 5.28, 5.29 and 5.30. While the Government regrets having to take this action, it does not affect the conclusion Mr Sherman makes about the intelligence material, or his overall findings about the deaths.
I thank Mr Sherman for the care and attention he has devoted to this important task. I want to express the Government's appreciation for the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities.
The conclusions of Mr Sherman's second report are in Chapter 8. Mr Sherman concludes that the Balibo 5 were killed: 

.	 at Balibo, early in the morning of 16 October 1975 probably before 7.00 am;
.	 by an attacking force, consisting of Indonesian troops and anti-Fretilin East Timorese but under the control of Indonesian officers;
.	 in circumstances of continuing fighting between attackers end defenders or at least before the attackers had secured their objective.
Contrasting with the hearsay accounts of the deaths in the 1996 report, the bases for these conclusions include the accounts of three individuals who claim to have witnessed at least one of the killings. I am not going to comment in detail on Mr Sherman's findings as the report speaks clearly enough for itself, although I would note that he concludes that the evidence available on the Balibo killings is quite inconsistent, particularly as to circumstances of death.
Mr Sherman produced his report on the basis of information available outside Indonesia. The Government asked, at the highest levels of the Indonesian Government, that Mr Sherman be allowed to visit Indonesia in conducting his evaluation. The Indonesian Government did not agree to this request and we cannot compel it to do so, any more than it can compel the Australian Government to do something which we might or might not want to do.
Nevertheless, I have again written to my Indonesian counterpart, Mr Ali Alatas, asking him to pursue any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached. In the letter I also ask again for any additional information the Indonesian Government is able to provide us on the death of Roger East, whose killing was a concern of Mr Sherman's first report. I am happy today to table that letter along with the second report.
In its approach to the second report, as with the first, the Government has remained concerned for the next of kin. Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have provided copies of the report to the journalists' relatives and invited their questions and comments on it. The Australian Government deeply regrets the deaths and remains willing to receive any credible new information about them. In this context, and as part of our transparent approach, the Government would be favourably disposed to proposals for a parliamentary inquiry on this matter, should the parliament wish.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Deaths of Australian Based Journalists</title>,Ministerial Statements,8,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-02-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I rise to speak briefly in response to the minister's statement concerning the second 
 report of Mr Tom Sherman into the circumstances of the deaths of five Australian based journalists in Balibo, East Timor, on 16 October 1975. Unlike the minister, the opposition has not had the opportunity to conduct the detailed analysis such a document as this requires. As a consequence, I do not propose to speak about the detail of Mr Sherman's inquiry and findings, but suffice to say that I note his conclusion that the evidence available to him is inconsistent but leads to conclusions broadly similar to those he reached in his 1996 inquiry.
More than 2½ years ago, following the first Sherman report and the Indonesian government's refusal to reopen the issue, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said that it was not clear what further action would be `in the national interest'. Although the government did not say so explicitly, the case was effectively at that point closed. That was not the view of the relatives of the dead journalists of course, nor was it the view of groups such as the International Commission of Jurists, who developed a strong critique of the limitations of Sherman's inquiry, his analysis and his findings.
Then last year, we had further revelations published in August by Mr Hamish MacDonald of the Sydney Morning Herald and in October by the ABC Foreign Correspondent program that triggered the new inquiry. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced his further inquiry Mr Laurie Brereton, the shadow minister for foreign affairs representing Labor, said that it was unlikely to satisfy the families of the dead journalists. I understand that Mrs Shirley Shackleton has only received a copy of the report within the last hour. Mr Brereton said that he thinks she should have received an advance copy in a much more timely fashion than that. I suspect that, when the families do get to read the report, they will not be satisfied. Indeed, it does not appear to take us very far forward at all.
I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has again written to his Indonesian counterpart, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, seeking cooperation from the Indonesian government to provide further information which would 
 shed light on the deaths of the journalists. I do not think the minister has done so with much hope of a positive reply. Minister Alatas has already said that the Indonesian government considers the case closed and that further investigation would only open old wounds. In his letter, Mr Downer expressed `regret' that Australia is still obliged to raise what he described as `unfortunate incidents'.
What he should have said was that Australia cannot consider the case closed without a full account of the events at Balibo from the Indonesian side, including the role or otherwise of the present Minister for Information and others in the Indonesian military chain of command. He should have told Minister Alatas that it is not a case of reopening old wounds; it is a case of dealing openly and frankly with an enduring wound in the bilateral relationship, a wound which will not heal without full openness, transparency and fundamental accountability from the Indonesian side.
I also note the minister's statement that the government is giving favourable consideration to the publication of documents relating to this historical period. Mr Brereton has already made Labor's position on this matter very clear. We support a comprehensive declassification of historical records relating to East Timor, not only in respect of the Whitlam Labor government but also in respect of the Fraser government. With regard to Balibo, there should be a comprehensive release of documents which shed light on the Whitlam government's knowledge of the events prior to and after the killings and the Fraser government's subsequent investigations.
We now know from the documents revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald that Australian officials were aware in October 1975, and subsequently, that Indonesian troops had entered East Timor and, indeed, that the attack on Balibo was orchestrated by the Indonesian military. Yet, in spite of this, the 1976 Taylor inquiry merely reported denials of Indonesian military involvement in the attack on Balibo. Mr Taylor and other officials, and presumably the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, knew that these denials were lies but they did not dispute 
 them publicly, and a seriously deficient and misleading report was tabled in this parliament.
Some 23 years on, today's report has not taken us very far in understanding what happened in Balibo. We may never know the whole truth but no-one can say `case closed'. This has been a running sore in our bilateral relationship with Indonesia. Together with the broader issue of East Timor, it has been a cancer that has eaten away at the bilateral ties successive governments have worked to build. It has been an enduring concern for the relatives of the deceased. A satisfactory resolution of this matter is very long overdue.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Deaths of Australian Based Journalists</title>,Ministerial Statements,8,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1999-02-16,"—I would have to agree with much of what Senator Cook has just said. As I said in my press release at the time of that Four Corners  program, which Mr Sherman is having a look at, I also agree that the best way forward now would be through cooperation with the Indonesian government to have a look from both sides at what documents are available—not only look at documents but also talk to people. Even though Mr Sherman says in his report that he does not know that much can be taken forward in that way, I still believe it would be worth while if we could get both the Indonesian and the Australian sides and someone who is trusted by both sides, from either side, to have a look at where this can be taken now.
I was encouraged by the last sentence of Mr Downer's statement, which seems to me to indicate that the minister does intend to cooperate with the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that is hoping to look into these deaths of Australian and other journalists at Balibo. I assume, as Senator Cook does, that that means the minister will be releasing documents into these deaths. I certainly would hope that he will be releasing all relevant documents. It will be interesting to see whether he releases them in public to the inquiry or whether he releases them just to the members of the committee. I think it would a pity if that were the case.
It is a long time ago now. It would be very interesting to have a look at all the documen 
 tation which is held by the Australian government—not only by Foreign Affairs. It would be fascinating to have a look at the documentation held by Defence and by any government or semi-government body from the time just before this happened even up to the present day. That would all be very interesting. I am on that committee and I look forward to seeing that documentation.
 I regret also that we are not stronger in our condemnation of the actions of Indonesian forces during their invasion of a neighbouring country. Those actions were unacceptable at the time. They are unacceptable still. The deaths of the journalists were unacceptable at the time, as were the deaths of the East Timorese and as was every death that occurred as a result of that invasion.
The change in the views on East Timor of both the Australian government and the ALP over the last year and even more recently is one of the most significant changes to foreign affairs policy that we have seen in this country for a long time. Both of them are terribly significant and they are changes for the better. But what is most unfortunate is the attitude that the Prime Minister has taken recently. I take the point that he honestly does believe that, if East Timor were to become autonomous or independent—more importantly independent—they would become almost reliant on Australia for their wellbeing and for funding.
I cannot see why on earth East Timorese would turn to Australia for help now if they become independent because, if there is one thing that successive Australian governments have demonstrated, it is that they are not going to help the East Timorese. We set up the Timor Gap Treaty, and that is another question we should be looking at. I understand that several oil companies are currently putting together contingency plans for what will happen when—and it is inevitable—East Timor becomes independent of Indonesia. I think that is commendable. I would love to see whether Australia is doing the same. I do not know if we are; I doubt it.
I think the Prime Minister is way off the mark when he assumes that Australia will have very much of a role at all. And should 
 we? Well, probably not. What have we done for East Timor? What have we done to repay what we owe to the East Timorese? What have we done that the East Timorese would now turn to us for help? I cannot see there is an awful lot. If I were them, I would certainly not be coming here. They will be going to Portugal; they will be going to the European Union countries who have been offering support in the past and who are now saying that they offer support in the future. So I cannot see that that would be the case.
The one statement from the Prime Minister recently, just over the last couple of days, that I really find most offensive is where he said on a television program, `Australia has to realise that the situation in East Timor has now become serious.' Yes, it has. It became serious, though, quite a long time ago. It became serious when Indonesia invaded East Timor. It was serious when people were being murdered; it was serious when people were being tortured; it was serious when people were being armed, as they still are, to fight against other East Timorese. Torture and death are serious. It has been serious for a long time.
East Timor has now come to a critical point in its development. Of course, that critical point will not be resolved until after the Indonesian elections in May when we find out who is in power and what their attitude is. We have heard quite a few different attitudes coming from people who are likely to have some share of that power—not all of them are in favour of independence or even autonomy for East Timor. So nothing is certain except that the situation in East Timor is serious now and has been serious for a long time. It will only stop being serious when the East Timorese people are able to determine their own future; when they are not being tortured; when they are not being murdered; when they are not being taken away from their homes; when they are not being armed to fight each other—that is when it will stop being serious.
If we can help in that, if we can encourage the United Nations to bring in troops, which will help and which the East Timorese people want, and if we can encourage a free determination by the East Timorese—as many people 
 in this parliament from all sides have said all along and consistently over the last couple of decades—then that is where Australia will be helping. Australia will be able to help in building democratic institutions. To give the foreign minister his due, he has set that up. I think that is an excellent move. I also think that the foreign minister has a better grip on what is going on than the Prime Minister. I wish the Prime Minister would let him get on with dealing with it on behalf of the Australian government.
Let us be sure about this: the pain and the hurt of the families of these journalists will not go away until the families of these journalists believe that all the information that could come out has come out. I do not think that will happen until the Indonesian government and the Australian government can cooperate on that. That is something that may happen as a result of the elections in May. The results of those elections will be absolutely vital to the future of East Timor, of Irian Jaya, of West Papua, of Aceh, of Ambon—you could go on and on.
The whole of Indonesia is in crisis. It is bubbling along, and it could go in any direction. I think it will go in the direction of more autonomy and, I certainly believe, of independence for several places within Indonesia, either sooner or later; I hope that it is sooner. I hope, and I sincerely believe, that there are people across the board in the Australian parliament who want that to be as smooth as possible, who want to help, who want to stop the torture, who want to stop the killings and who want to make sure that our nearest neighbour to the north is a peaceful place. I believe that will happen; I just hope it is sooner rather than later.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Deaths of Australian Based Journalists</title>,Ministerial Statements,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-16,"—I concur with a great deal of what Senator Bourne has had to say, particularly when, towards the conclusion of her remarks, she indicated that Australia has a very positive role to play in East Timor's move to independence—if only we had the leadership that could take us into that positive role. The Australian people are willing and, amongst them, there is great feeling about the role we have to play in bringing this transition about 
 peacefully and ending the suffering of the East Timorese and, inevitably, the suffering of the oppressors—because oppression cannot occur without the oppressors themselves being damaged.
That is writ large in this report from Mr Tom Sherman. People who are hoping for some resolution of the events at Balibo and some attribution of clear responsibility for those involved in the journalists' deaths will find this report disappointing. It does not go anywhere near resolving the matter, and that is because the evidence is not available.
Unfortunately, the conclusions fall short of the mark of going as far as they could have. In the conclusion of chapter 8 there is no mention of there being the need for the Australian government to pursue very strongly with the Indonesian authorities the bringing to justice of those people who were involved in the deaths at Balibo. What Mr Sherman does say on page 148 of the report is:
The cover up of a murder is one possible answer but, on the totality of the evidence, another cover up is more likely. That is the cover up of a monumental blunder and to destroy the evidence of the Balibo 5—
being the people who were killed—
because of the acute embarrassment that the killing of the journalists would cause the Indonesian military and perhaps more importantly its effect on Australian-Indonesian bilateral relations. This is more likely in the light of the evidence so far disclosed. It is clear that, whatever the state of their prior knowledge, the attacking troops—
that is, the Indonesian troops—
quickly realised that they had killed five journalists and took immediate steps to destroy all evidence of what they had done.
They cannot destroy all evidence of what they have done. All those people present knew what they had done. Most of them are still alive and know what happened at Balibo.
The implication in Mr Sherman's report of there being nowhere really further to go at this time I reject out of hand. That is why the Australian government has a very clear obligation to pursue very strongly with Mr Alatas and President Habibie the need for an inquiry which is open, which is independent and which can bring those people who were on site to light with the requirement that the 
 evidence that they have still in their heads and in their hearts is brought into the light of day. Nothing short of that either is justice or will bring some feeling of resolution, particularly to the relatives of those people who died at Balibo.
I am further disappointed that Mr Sherman has spent almost half of his conclusions in waggling a finger at people who, he says, have developed fixed views on this incident. He then goes on to say that they nevertheless should be warned that there may have been East Timorese complicit in the murders at Balibo. I think Mr Sherman is putting the emphasis in the wrong place there.
I have never heard anybody say—and I have spoken to many people who are involved in wanting justice on this issue—that certain people who are involved should not be brought forward, that the evidence should not come from them and that they should not be subject to the same justice as everybody else, even if they are East Timorese. It is quite clear that in a state of war very often people do join the side of the attackers, the invaders—that is nearly a constant in these matters.
I think for Mr Sherman to spend nearly half of his report saying that people have to understand that, and those with so-called fixed opinions have to come to grips with this, is effectively to waste space which could have gone much more tellingly to putting the thumb on the Indonesian authorities and ipso facto the Australian authorities who have a great need to do more to ensure that the deaths of the Balibo Five are followed down the line, no matter how far, by the discovery of the facts and the attribution of justice.
Finally, I have a further word on Australia's role with East Timor from here on in. As I said at the outset, I believe that much more can be done. The Australian people will be behind the Howard government if it changes its current parsimonious—that is the best that can be said about it—attitude towards independence for East Timor and becomes a prime agent in the movement of not only a swift transition to independence for the East Timorese but also a peaceful one.
I have been around long enough to remember 1975 when the then Whitlam government 
 turned down the opportunity to offer Australia as neutral ground for the disputing parties in East Timor to come to a peaceful resolution of their differences and to establish a properly representative and democratic system in East Timor. That was a blot, amongst many, on the failure of Australian governments to represent not only the East Timorese people but also the general Australian dictum of `a fair go'. Australians have wanted better in the actions of their governments. Now we have another opportunity. It is 24 years down the line, but here is the opportunity to make amends a little.
It is just not good enough. In fact, it is woefully inadequate, wrong and remiss of the Prime Minister to be indicating that Australia will be penalised if it gets involved in this transition; that it is going to cost us money. I am troubled that each time the Prime Minister is challenged on values other than financial ones he cannot rise to the occasion. It is as if the only values motivating the people of this country are money. He is wrong in that. He is not representing the Australian ethos, and he is not representing the feeling of the Australian people.
There is here a great opportunity. I congratulate the Labor Party in having made a remarkable transition from the bad old days of policy towards East Timor to a much more enlightened policy at the moment which faces up to the fact that all governments involved down the line since the invasion in East Timor—and indeed the period before that in Australia—have been found wanting and have failed to help this small neighbour which, as history records, was so courageous in helping our service people during the last war.
The Prime Minister needs not only to catch up with the feeling in this country but also to go further and be a statesperson when the interests of our neighbours are  involved. Because it is in the interests of Indonesia to find a peaceful transition to independence in East Timor. The Prime Minister, instead of cavilling about how much it might cost, ought to be looking at what he can do to bring about peace in our neighbourhood, and therefore a feeling of greater security in this country of ours.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report to the Attorney-General, entitled Administrative review of patents decisions , deals with the very important issue of intellectual property. Intellectual property is that sort of property which now enriches countries around the world, so it is important not only as an issue of fairness but also as an issue of great economic moment. It is an issue of fairness because people who establish a new way of doing things or who invent a new object—for example, a new type of bicycle seat, which may seem simple but which requires a lot of thought and development if it is going to be built the right way and serve the purpose the inventor wants—need to have those things protected.
The situation at the moment is that people who develop new ideas, new ways of doing things or a new object are not protected as they should be. That is not so much because of the law but because of the cost involved. It is very expensive to take out a patent that is effective not only in Australia but around the world, and that is what people have to do now to protect their intellectual property. To apply to take out a patent is very expensive because it has to be done from one country to another.
This report dealing with this very important matter should be read by all senators and by the public as a whole. To return to the theme I started with, unless the intellectual property that we have in Australia is protected—in the sense of what flows from it—and remains in Australian hands or remains in a way that benefits Australia, then we are losing too much to a world that is ever ready to take hold of the many ideas that develop here.
I was talking about a bicycle seat, and I was thinking of a young man I know who has developed such an object. He has had considerable difficulty maintaining the product of his mind around the world, because people outside Australia are so endowed with money that they can hold others off until their pa 
 tents run out and they have to renew, and renew at great cost. This affects people like this young man I am thinking of and many others as well. This report to the Attorney-General about patents decisions, which seems at first sight to be a fairly dry subject, is a report that deals with one of the most vital issues that the parliament and the government face—that is, the proper protection of intellectual property developed in Australia.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Administrative Review Council </title>,Documents,11,1,speech
"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1999-02-16,"—Senator Cooney, as always, has made an erudite contribution to the debate in this chamber. The issue of intellectual property is a vexing issue for a range of reasons—none of which are ideological, I would dare say—but it constitutes a real challenge to our intellect itself to deal with them.
Senator Cooney quite rightly raised the issue of what you do to preserve the Australian ownership of intellectual property. He alluded to the difficulty of raising capital in Australia or from sources overseas to invest in Australia to help people develop the full potential of their intellectual property. Intellectual property in and of itself is not worth anything unless it is sold or the idea behind it is developed, manufactured and sold to other people. The property right itself is a lovely bit of paper, but it is nothing more, and I think Senator Cooney appreciates that point. I would say that Senator Cooney is correct, but we also need to look at a number of other things.
One of those is the way in which we raise capital for investment in businesses. One of the concerns I have is that, when seed capital is put into a business to start it off—and we have seen some spectacular successes of start-up businesses in the last two years, particularly involving intellectual property and computers or Internet technology—the people who invest the seed capital will make the decision at some stage to withdraw their seed capital. In order words, the company has flourished and they want to take their profit and invest it somewhere else.
One of the problems we have in this country is that we have a very onerous capital gains tax regime which makes it less attractive to put seed capital into a company in 
 Australia than it might be elsewhere. If I am a private investor, the profit I make when I sell my seed capital two years down the track is taxed at 48½c in the dollar—the top marginal rate—in the year in which the profit was derived. In other countries, that high taxation regime is not present.
That has a very simple effect; it encourages people who have good intellectual property in Australia to start up the company and list it overseas because overseas investors get a more generous tax treatment in another country than they get here. That is one of the crises we have in terms of venture capital. The capital gains tax erodes the gains and, hence, encourages the movement of the domicile of those companies offshore. I think Senator Cooney would agree that that is not a desirable consequence, but that is one of the problems we must grapple with.
But the other problem we have to grapple with is a much more esoteric problem, and that is this: rigorous maintenance of intellectual property prevents the development of that idea by someone else down the track. When you have products that have a very limited life—for example, certain computer technologies, algorithms and so on which may become superseded—you need to be able to develop them quickly. I think that generates a general philosophical debate as to the length of intellectual property.
I do not want to get into that tonight, but that is also one of the issues which faces us as a legislature. How much protection do you give to the inventor and how much do you encourage the development of the idea? In many cases, good ideas can be made better ideas by development but, if you have intellectual property rights which are too restrictive, it prevents that development. In conclusion, I hope Senator Cooney manages to find a venture capitalist who will aid his friend's bicycle seat, as I hope that we find venture capital for many other great Australian inventions.

"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1999-02-16,"—This evening I want to speak about the appearance in March of Australia before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, so I am particularly pleased that Minister John Herron is in the chamber. Many senators will not be aware that there is a process which enables the UN committee responsible for the compliance of parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination to seek from countries their particular response when there is criticism of that country's policies, and tonight I want to detail some of these processes.
 At the meeting in Geneva in August last year, a draft decision prepared by Mr Banton, Mr Wolfrum and Mr van Boven was introduced stating that there were worrying developments in Australia regarding the situation of Aboriginal people. I cannot go through all of this debate at the United Nations CERD committee because it goes from points 29 to 51—over five pages. There was quite a 
 considerable debate of concern, which I will summarise with this statement by Mr Wolfrum:
. . . the situation in Australia was clearly deteriorating. It was deeply regrettable that institutions such as the post of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, which the Committee had praised so highly in 1994, were disappearing. Aboriginals were being marginalized, their life expectancy was about 10 years less than that of the white population and the illiteracy rate among Aboriginals was approximately five times higher.
Similar concerns were expressed about the native title legislation and whether or not it complied with the convention—a debate which we had regarding the Racial Discrimination Act at the time of the debate in this place.
Tonight, in the spirit of reconciliation, I want to comment on how the government could maximise its appearance before the CERD committee as an opportunity to move forward in regard to the reconciliation process that the Prime Minister has committed himself to. A report has been prepared by the Attorney-General's Department and has been released. I have sought permission from the Government Whip to table the document and that has been granted. I now seek leave to table the Attorney-General's Department report.
Leave granted.
—For those who would like to look at this document, it is available on the Attorney-General's web site. But I think it is important that honourable senators have the opportunity to read it. I have to say that it is not a comprehensive document; it is not a visionary document.
If Australia is being asked to justify its position in relation to meeting the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, I would have thought the government would go out of its way to spell out its vision for the future, its vision for reconciliation. The Australian government is already about 2½ years overdue with its periodic report on how it is moving to implement policies that overcome racial discrimination, and it would seem that this was the perfect opportunity. Indeed, if you were as cynical as I am on such occasions, you could even argue that the govern 
 ment could have deflected some of the attention about the two issues that the committee raised by focusing on its vision for reconciliation.
I find the document extremely disappointing. But I think there is still time for the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation—Phillip Ruddock—and you, Minister Heron, to retrieve the situation not only in terms of fundamental justice for Aboriginal people in this country but for Australia's international reputation.
On Australia Day this year, in an advertisement headed `It's Time for a Treaty', 57 Aboriginal leaders publicised their demand for `the Australian government to sign a treaty with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples', stating that it `should be concluded by 26 January 2001 as a symbolic date for negotiated settlement between the nation and the indigenous peoples'. I know that this government has said all along—and in opposition it was also policy—that there would not be a treaty.
But politics is the art of compromise. The Prime Minister could give a public commitment to negotiating policy with indigenous people. For example, we could have negotiation here, out at the front of Parliament House, in relation to the tent embassy, instead of the confrontation that has developed. If, when Australia speaks at the United Nations on 12 March, there could be a statement of absolute commitment for negotiation, even that would be a major step forward.
Also, I believe the government could and should seriously reconsider the abolition of the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. It does not mean a lot of dollars; it is not a major step backwards in terms of government policy—and obviously I am looking at it from the government's point of view, not mine. But I am looking for realistic ways in which the government can set a new tone on 12 March in Geneva.
I am realistic; I know that there is no way this government will turn its back on the Wik legislation. So I predict that it will be criticised by the United Nations committee for 
 that particular piece of legislation. So why not balance that criticism by trying to recognise the concerns and giving a commitment to reinstate the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner?
In addition, I think an important issue is the selection of the Australian representative for Geneva. We do not yet know whether it will be a public servant—and, with every respect to public servants, I hope it is not. I believe that this is an opportunity, an occasion, for the attendance of a senior minister—the Attorney-General himself, Phillip Ruddock, even the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister were really committed to reconciliation, if he were really concerned about the way in which Australia is being portrayed internationally as to its treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, then he himself would be there. That may seem a bit unrealistic, but I think it would be a very good opportunity.
I think it is appropriate that on that occasion the government make some very strong statements of commitment for the future—commitment to negotiation; for it to recommit to having the position of Social Justice Commissioner, which was seen by the United Nations as very innovative and forward looking; and commitment to genuine reconciliation which, of course, will involve recognition of ATSIC and reinstatement of many of the programs that are now so underfunded.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Racial Discrimination</title>,Adjournment,12,1,speech
