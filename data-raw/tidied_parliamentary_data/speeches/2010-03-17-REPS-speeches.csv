"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I thank you in several ways, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, for facilitating my participation in the debate today by taking my chair duty and allowing me to continue with the debate. It is greatly appreciated. I continue with the very brief comments that I made last night before debate was interrupted. I indicate to the House my support for the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. It is my intention, for the information of the House, to take about 10 minute to complete my comments. I want first of all to outline the provisions that are in this bill, then to put the bill within the context of the government’s actions on anti-people-smuggling measures and then to wrap up with some general comments about where the debate is at the moment.
I should indicate to the House that this bill seeks to amend some other acts in order to increase the capacity to deal legally with people smugglers. It establishes a new offence of providing material support and resources towards a people-smuggling venture. This is contained in the Migration Act and Criminal Code. The offence will apply to a person who provides material support or resources to another person or organisation and to the provision of support or resources aids if there is a risk that the provision of support or resources will aid the commission of the offence of people smuggling. The offence applies if a person is reckless about whether the money or resources they provide will be used in or to assist with a people-smuggling venture. It would not apply to a person who pays smugglers to facilitate their own passage or entry to Australia or to a person who pays for another person in that venture. The maximum penalty for this offence will be 10 years, 1,000 penalty units—$110,000—or both.
This bill also extends the mandatory minimum penalties in the Migration Act. The Migration Act currently contains mandatory minimum penalties for the aggravated offences of people smuggling. That is a five-year sentence with three years non-parole or, for repeat offenders, an eight-year sentence with five years non-parole. The bill extends the application of the mandatory minimum penalty to the new offences, which are people smuggling involving death, people smuggling involving exploitation or danger of death or serious harm, and providing support or resources for people-smuggling activities. The higher mandatory minimum sentences of eight years and the non-parole period of five years will automatically apply to the offences of people smuggling resulting in death and exploitation or danger of death or serious harm irrespective of whether it was a repeat offence. This is to reflect the serious nature of these offences.
The bill will also extend the higher mandatory minimum sentence and non-parole period to a people-smuggling offence involving children and to a person convicted of multiple people-smuggling offences. The bill before the House also seeks to harmonise people-smuggling offences between the Migration Act and the Criminal Code. This is in order to strengthen the criminal framework and for greater consistency. There is also a section of the bill that improves the capacity for law enforcement and national security agencies to undertake the new tasks that become operative with the bill.
The bill before us sits within a context of a wider range of border protection policies that the Rudd government has put in place. The framework clearly outlined by the Prime Minister—which received, I have to say, a fair degree of bipartisan support early on when the opposition was endorsing some of the measures that the government put in place—was to have a more humane framework for those who were seeking asylum and to take a much harsher position with those who were seeking to make profits out of the exploitation of those people.
Within that framework, there have been a series of actions already taken to create a strong border protection policy within which the bill before us today sits. The Rudd government, for example, has maintained excision, mandatory detention and offshore processing of irregular maritime arrivals on Christmas Island. We have committed $654 million to a whole-of-government strategy to combat people smuggling. This is part of the Rudd government’s $1.3 billion strategy to strengthen national security and border protection. It includes $63 million for aerial surveillance to monitor a range of border threats, including irregular maritime arrivals and illegal foreign fishing. It also includes $42 million to better equip the AFP to stop people-smuggling ventures before they launch for Australia. This has involved ramping up the crucial partnership between the AFP and the Indonesian police to investigate and dismantle people-smuggling syndicates. It also involves funding to Customs and Border Protection to strengthen its international engagement in critical transit countries with people-smuggling activities, including new posts in Malaysia and Sri Lanka and boosting its presence in Indonesia.
This has been backed up by a range of other actions, including the establishment of the dedicated Border Protection Committee of cabinet to ensure the whole-of-government strategy is driven in a coordinated way; a single point of accountability for matters relating to the prevention of maritime people smuggling within the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service; continued regional engagement and cooperation, including reinvigorating the Bali process at the ministerial level; working with Indonesian authorities to assist in arrests of key high-level people smugglers—and it was very good to see the Indonesian President addressing this parliament only last week; increasing maritime surveillance and patrolling by Border Protection Command; making sure we successfully prosecute people smugglers and extradite alleged people smugglers; and strengthening the offences and the penalties that apply. This is all part of an important coordinated whole-of-government approach to delivering on the commitment that we made to get tough with the people smugglers.
This sits within an international context. I am going to give a bit of recognition here to someone who is known to many in this place by the pseudonym

Possum Comitatus—otherwise known as the individual writer, Scott Steel, who only recently in the
Crikey
newsletter had a wonderful graphic representation. As a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and out of respect for our report on props in parliament, I have not brought it in with me, so I will paint a bit of a word picture for members. It was a black square that indicated the 161 boat people who arrived in Australia in 2008. That square was placed within a bigger square which was the 4,750 asylum applications that were received by Australia in that year. Then that square was placed within another square which was the 96,870 asylum applications received by France, the UK and Italy in the same year. That then was placed in another square. That square represented the 382,670 asylum applications received by all 51 countries in the UNHCR statistics program. Then in another square were the 827,000 asylum applications across the globe. The final square indicated the 15.2 million forcibly displaced refugees around the globe in 2008. The graphic gave a very, very strong visual concept to people about the size of the problem we are dealing with. It is a serious problem. The reason that we want to stop people smugglers is that they put at risk the lives of the vulnerable people that they are preying on. Nonetheless, it has to be kept within the context.
I was very pleased to see that the period we had for a relatively short time in Australia where we took a strategic approach that said that you punish the vulnerable who are seeking asylum to send a message to the others has been replaced by a view that you punish those who prey on the vulnerable to send a message. That has certainly been a bipartisan position of this country since the 1950s. We had an aberration from it, but I was pleased to see that, when we came to government and introduced new legislation that would be humane with the vulnerable and tough with those who seek to prey on them, we had bipartisan support. Sadly, that does not always persist through to today, and I think that is a very regrettable outcome. The bill before the House is part of that sensible and balanced approach to what is a very difficult issue, and I endorse the bill.",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—No reasonable person could oppose the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, and the aims contained in the bill are clearly laudable. It is a bill to deter people smuggling, to expand the charter of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to include border security issues and to make related amendments to the Telecommunication (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the T(IA) Act.
There does, however, appear to be somewhat of a contradiction with the provisions of this bill and the record of the Rudd Labor government, which has in effect opened the door and created a superhighway across the seas into Australia. What the Rudd government has done is to put out the welcome mat to people smugglers and those people who want to jump the queue to come here in contravention of the laws of Australia. This is of course in complete contradiction of and in contrast to the very strong position taken by the Howard government, which said that we would determine who crosses our borders and that it is really a matter for the government and the people of Australia to determine who is able to enter Australia.
What this government has done by watering down the regime it inherited from the former government is essentially to send the green light out there to people smugglers. When one looks at the appalling record of this government in recent times as far as boat arrivals are concerned it is obvious that the softened, watered down, gutted policy that we have in relation to people smuggling has failed dismally. Really what the government should do is to keep faith with the Australian people. It should adopt the promise made by the now Prime Minister prior to the 2007 election—namely, that when boats were intercepted on the high seas they would be turned around and sent back. But the government’s reaction in practice has been quite the opposite of what the Prime Minister promised to the Australian people before they entrusted him at the November 2007 election with the keys to office.
Unfortunately the government in office at the moment has as its hallmark all talk but no action. People refer to the Prime Minister and say, ‘Blah, blah, blah.’ It is starting to penetrate the collective mind of the Australian people that this government is big on noise but small on performance. I can see the minister at the table, the Minister for Resources and Energy, smiling somewhat. I am not sure whether he is privately agreeing with me. I did not want to verbal him by suggesting that. But if the government had more ministers of the calibre of the minister at the table I believe we would have less talk and more action. Unfortunately the government has to work with the material it has, and it does not have anywhere near as many effective ministers as it would like. Of course, the minister at the table is one of the best that the government actually has.
Having said that, before you accuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, of embarking on my own unity ticket with the minister at the table, let me say that I think the people of Australia are really disappointed with the approach of this government. This government has in effect set out the welcome mat for people smugglers and those people who want to jump the queue. This government has indicated that it is prepared to bow to pressure, that it is prepared to blink when confronted. What the government has to understand is that people smugglers only respect strength. They do not respect weakness.
The now government criticised us while promising strong border protection, but what we have really seen is an open door policy. The government blinks, as on the
Oceanic Viking. The unauthorised arrivals on that vessel held the government to ransom, and the government has given preferred treatment to people who have in effect been rewarded for thumbing their noses at the government and the people of Australia by seeking media coverage as they did. Their plight was highlighted and the government folded. I understand that there were some people on the
Oceanic Viking
whose security assessments were less desirable than one would have liked, yet the government has been extremely benevolent towards them as well.
It is very important that this bill includes a provision to expand ASIO’s role. I am not suggesting that al-Qaeda is hijacking boats and bringing large numbers of people via the government’s boat people superhighway to Australia, but it is theoretically possible for people who are terrorists to get on a boat and to try and pass themselves off as genuine asylum seekers or refugees. ASIO and the other security organisations in Australia need an adequate capacity to vet those people otherwise they could enter Australia via the back door, particularly in view of the fact that, were they seeking to enter Australia through a more recognised, traditional and conventional process, they would be picked up by the very stringent checking that Australia quite appropriately does with respect to people seeking to join us. It would be terrible if we had some sort of terrorist incident because it was not possible to vet those people adequately.
I notice that the government says that this bill will not include any extra outlays. That presumably means that ASIO is going to have to fund the additional responsibilities it is quite appropriately given in this legislation from its existing budget. The government really needs to tell the Australian people—and I hope the minister at the table notices this, although I presume he is not the minister who will be summing up this particular bill—whether it considers there is so much fat and slack in ASIO that it can afford to reallocate existing resources to vet people who arrive on boats organised by people smugglers. That is a fair question, because the government has given this responsibility to ASIO. It is quite right that that should occur; however, I have to ask myself whether ASIO can afford to do what the government is asking it to do without the additional resources that it would quite appropriately need.
Is the government saying that ASIO has more money than it currently needs to perform its function? Does the government want ASIO to close down some of the functions that it already carries out to perform these new functions? ASIO simply will be unable, in my view, to carry out the excellent job that it does for Australia generally and then do this additional task, for which it is eminently suited, unless the government is prepared to provide additional resources to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It is appropriate that we should focus on the criminals who organise these boats to Australia, the people smugglers themselves. To a certain extent people who board those boats are victims, but they do so in many cases quite knowingly.
A few years ago, when the Woomera and Baxter detention centres were open and were being criticised, particularly by the then opposition, I organised to visit those two centres so that I could see with my own eyes whether the allegations of brutality and inappropriate treatment of unauthorised boat arrivals were in fact accurate. At the Baxter detection centre I was able to sit down with a lady whose religion was Sabian Mandaean. I had not heard of the faith before. Apparently, they are a group that emanates from Iran and they are followers of St John the Baptist. Water has a particular significance in their religion. I had a really good talk with this lady. She was really upset that she found herself in the Baxter detention centre. She felt it was a breach of contract because she and her family paid US$20,000 to people smugglers. They had bought an airline ticket from Amman in Jordan to fly to Jakarta. When they got to Jakarta they junked their passports and made their way overland to a port where people smugglers operated from, jumped on a boat and came to Australia. They felt they had a contractual arrangement to come to Australia and were really miffed not only because they lost their US$20,000, which is what they paid for their passage, but also because they found themselves in the Baxter detention centre.
I am not sure what ultimately happened to that family, but I did have a sense of sympathy for them. They seemed to be decent people and it just seemed to me to be entirely wrong that people smugglers were able to treat these people as they did. I believe we should throw the book at people smugglers, but that does not mean that we ought to willy-nilly allow the victims of people smugglers into Australia. As a former Labor immigration minister told me once, more than a million people are knocking on the door of Australia to come here legitimately and join our Australian family. That was quite a few years ago, so maybe now we have 1½ million people wanting to come to join us in Australia. We have freedom, we have stability and we have a way of life that has made Australia the envy of people throughout the world. While we might disagree with the result of an election—we were very disappointed that we lost in November 2007 and I am sure you were not, Mr Deputy Speaker—

(Mr S Sidebottom)—Now that I reflect on it!

Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting—
—What was that, Minister?
—I will give you a visa.
—Please stay on the legislation.
—I am very interested by the admission of the minister that, as the Minister for Resources and Energy, he has the capacity to hand out visas. But thank you very much for your generosity. This minister is clearly one of the most effective and influential ministers in the government. If more than a million to 1½ million people seek to come to Australia, then it is important that we do have an orderly immigration policy—a policy that has integrity, respect, transparency and accountability. For people to be able to jump on boats, to be able to pay people smugglers to come to Australia, to be intercepted and to be taken to Christmas Island or somewhere else—we understand that large numbers are about to be transported to Darwin—and that that enables them to jump the queue, it sends a real message to the world that we do not have a policy of integrity. You have really got to feel for the million to a million-and-a-half people who want to come here legitimately while people who are seeking to come here illegitimately are given preferential treatment.
People smugglers are amongst the worst type of criminals. They place many lives in danger, they prey on the desperation of those people who are needy and they will do almost anything to anyone who wants to come to Australia to seek a better life. It is clear that they are motivated by financial gain and what they can amass for themselves. They are not remotely concerned about the lives of those people they carry as passengers. This is demonstrated by some of the horrid conditions that passengers have had to endure on often unseaworthy boats. When these boats go down at times and lives are lost, one has to ask oneself whether the people smugglers who own these boats are able to claim for insurance on the boats that are lost in the country where those boats are registered and, if they receive funds from the insurance policies, whether they are able to buy new and better boats to transport even more people to Australia.
The people smugglers who are more than willing to breach Australia’s immigration and arrival conditions and legislation have to have the book thrown at them. That is really important. People smugglers show complete disregard for the interests of the people they seek to transport to Australia. We are a compassionate country. Our refugee intake is amongst the highest in the world on a per capita basis. I understand that only Canada exceeds our effort. We are genuinely receptive to the needs of others. We are compassionate. We are sympathetic. However, one of the concerns of people in the Australian community is that the government now does have this open door policy which is encouraging increasing numbers of boats to embark for Australia. People smugglers know that the welcome mat has been put out for them. We now have a super sea highway where the government is drawing people smugglers and unauthorised arrivals like a magnet. Everyone knows that, when the boat arrives at or near Christmas Island or in other Australian territorial waters, it will be towed or escorted to Christmas Island. All the people on board know that they will receive medical attention, they will receive food and they will then be processed on Christmas Island or maybe Darwin and, ultimately, there is a pretty good chance that they will be settled in Australia or another country.
What an incredible green light for people to breach Australia’s laws, to breach Australia’s borders and to come to Australia in this illegitimate way. I hold a series of public community meetings throughout my electorate every year. Last weekend, on 13 March, we had very good attendances at three community barbecues. One was held at Sippy Downs, another was held at Dicky Beach, Caloundra, and the third was held at Kawana Forest. I was impressed with the way that people were genuinely concerned at the arrivals of people in Australia. I think that is a major worry and the government needs to take on board what the community is saying. The community is saying that enough is enough. People who discussed this matter with me at those community meetings were genuinely concerned and they were very worried. They feel that the current Rudd Labor government has completely lost control of this issue.
Since the government softened our border protection laws there has been an increasing number of arrivals and more boats on the sea. There is almost a flotilla on the sea and almost every day we have a boat arrival. Let us look at some of the statistics—and they are really quite scary—since the government watered down our border protection. From August to December 2008 we had seven boats and 179 passengers and crew members. In 2009, 61 boats arrived and there were 2,792 passengers and crew members involved, plus the four on Deliverance Island and another two in an esky. In 2010, so far, we have had 24 boats with 1,191 passengers. That is a total of 92 boats that would not be here if the government had not softened our border protection policies. Those 92 boats brought 4,162 people plus the four on Deliverance Island and the two in an esky. That is a total of 4,168 people. This indicates that the government has given the green light to those people who want to break the laws of Australia—people who are prepared to risk the lives of others who are prepared to pay passage to come to Australia.
Of course, many of these people are not genuine refugees. They might be people who would prefer to live in Australia—and you cannot blame them for that. Australia is a very desirable country in which to live. We have equality of opportunity and anyone has a chance to achieve anything. The only thing that can stop people achieving things in Australia is the individual. There are boundless opportunities, so you can understand why people would want to come from right round the globe to join the Australian family. But if we have a situation where people are jumping the queue, breaking the rules and circumventing our transparency arrangements and laws then clearly what we are doing is sending a green light. The government have brought in a total of 4,168 people since they watered down our border protection policies. That is the number of people who effectively have been brought in because of that watered down policy.
I find this personally concerning. I have lots of people in my electorate who have family members who have applied to come to Australia on spouse visas, parent visas or, in some cases, even business visas. It takes a considerable time for those people to progress sufficiently up the queue to be accepted in accordance with the provisions. Some of them have asked me whether it would be better if they went to Indonesia, bought passage on a boat and arrived into Australia’s territorial waters, where they would then be fast-tracked. I have to say to them that we obviously cannot recommend that course of action. However, the present laws encourage people to circumvent the rules and regulations of Australia. I do not think that is a good thing; I do not think it is healthy. I think it is wrong for the government to water down border protection. I think it sends the wrong message to people smugglers and to the world. The government stands condemned in the eyes of the Australian people.

",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Hale, Damian, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise today to voice my strong support for the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. It is important that members on this side talk to the bill that is before the House and not go off on a rant, such as those opposite have indulged in, about the so-called weakening of the laws. This bill is another example of the government’s commitment to strengthening Australia’s national security and border protection regime. The key elements of the bill will improve whole-of-government efforts to combat people-smuggling, including ensuring appropriate investigative tools are available to law enforcement and national security agencies and providing greater flexibility for Australia’s national security agencies to support anti-people-smuggling activities. This bill includes additional measures to strengthen the Commonwealth’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework by putting in place laws that further criminalise people-smuggling activities to enable prosecution of a broad range of conduct, including the consequences of that activity.
The bill sees practical reforms in six areas. It establishes a new offence of ‘providing support for people smuggling’ in the Migration Act 1958 and the Criminal Code. The bill harmonises people-smuggling offences between the Migration Act and the Criminal Code to strengthen our criminal framework and provide greater consistency, including inserting into the Migration Act the aggravated offence of ‘people smuggling involving exploitation or danger of death or serious harm’. It extends the higher mandatory minimum penalties in the Migration Act for the new aggravated offence of ‘involvement in exploitation or danger of death or serious harm’ to offenders convicted of multiple offences. It makes associated changes to the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to enable law enforcement and security agencies consistent access under both acts to appropriate investigative tools. The bill also amend the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to enable ASIO to perform a greater role in relation to people smuggling and other serious threats to Australia’s territorial and border integrity. It also aligns the definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ in the T(IA) Act more closely with the Intelligence Services Act 2001.
People seeking asylum are not something new. In the 1970s, we experienced the arrival of the first wave of boats carrying people seeking asylum from the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Over half the population of Vietnam was displaced in these years. While most people fled to neighbouring Asian countries, some embarked on a voyage by boat to Australia. The first boat arrived in Darwin in April 1976 carrying five Indochinese men. Over the next five years, there were 2,059 Vietnamese boat arrivals, with the last arriving in August 1981.
My electorate of Solomon, like so many communities throughout Australia, is a vibrant, multicultural melting pot of nationalities. Over 80 different nationalities make up our fantastic community. The arrival of 27 Indochinese asylum seekers in November 1989 heralded the beginning of a second wave. Boats arrived over the following nine years, mostly from Cambodia, Vietnam and southern China. In 1999, the third wave of asylum seekers, predominantly from the Middle East, began to arrive, often in larger numbers than previous arrivals and usually with the assistance of people smugglers.
This is a global problem. There are over 42 million displaced people around the world. In recent years, global factors have meant a continued increase in the global numbers of refugees and asylum seekers. Figures published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, reveal that at the end of 2008 there were some 42 million forcibly displaced people around the world. That is twice the population of Australia. This includes 15.2 million mandated refugees, 827,000 asylum seekers and 26 million internally displaced persons.
On Afghanistan, in a recent report to the Security Council, the UN Secretary-General noted:
… 2008 ended as the most violent year in Afghanistan since 2001.
In 2008 there was an 85 per cent increase in the number of Afghan asylum seekers claiming protection in industrialised countries worldwide. From Sri Lanka, for the same period of time, the number of internally displaced people assisted by the UNHCR in Sri Lanka increased from 324,699 to 504,800—an increase of 55 per cent. Sri Lanka has just emerged from a decades-long civil war which cost tens of thousands of lives, uprooted hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans and left an economic divide between the north and the south and between east and west. There are currently 250,000 Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka in camps for internally displaced people.
This government takes the protection of our borders seriously. We have more assets patrolling our borders than the previous government had. We have retained mandatory excision of Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island. If a boat is intercepted, those on board are taken to Christmas Island where their health and identity are checked and they are checked for security risk. If someone claiming to be an asylum seeker is found not to be a refugee, they are sent home.
People smuggling is not just an issue for Australia but a global and a regional issue. I certainly welcome the contribution made in this place by the President of Indonesia last week. He spoke of the way our two countries are working together to combat this most evil of trades—that is, the smuggling of the most vulnerable and marginalised people on the planet. The commitment of our neighbours, through the bilateral cooperation of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, is critical to addressing this most serious issue. The Australian government is highly supportive of the Bali Process, which was established by Australia and Indonesia to develop practical measures to help combat people-smuggling crimes in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
The Australian government has an orderly and planned migration program and places a high priority on protecting Australia’s borders from irregular maritime arrivals by maintaining an effective and visible tactical response program of aerial, land- and sea-based patrols. Border Protection Command uses a combination of Customs and Border Protection and Defence assets to deliver a coordinated national response to security threats in Australia’s maritime domain. The global spike in people-smuggling activity around the world, including in Australian waters, means we need more resources and improved laws to deal with this global problem. That is why the government is funding a $654 million whole-of-government strategy to combat people smuggling and address the problem of unauthorised boat arrivals.
The strategy includes the largest surveillance and detection operation against people smuggling in Australia’s history. The massive funding increase in the budget will provide: $324 million worth of funding to increase maritime patrols and surveillance, which will see an additional maritime surveillance craft in Australia’s northern waters and increased maritime surveillance time; an almost $63 million funding increase for aerial surveillance, which means two additional surveillance aircraft; around $93 million to strengthen our engagement with our regional neighbours and international organisations; and $13.6 million to strengthen our legal and prosecution capacity and enhance regional cooperation on people-smuggling laws. The Rudd government has also established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of cabinet, which will be supported by the newly established Border Protection Taskforce to drive the government’s response to the people-smuggling threat.
Our government is determined to make the investments that are needed to protect our borders and strengthen Australia’s national security. In particular, there is clear evidence of a global spike in people-smuggling activity, which is causing an increase in people-smuggling activities in Australian waters. The government is determined to ensure we respond effectively and decisively to the global spike in people smuggling and other emerging threats to Australia’s national security. This bill demonstrates the government’s commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and to targeting those criminal groups who seek to organise, participate in and benefit from people-smuggling activities.
People smuggling is a serious and organised crime involving organised criminal syndicates which depend on enablers and facilitators. Targeting the organisers and financiers of people-smuggling operations is an important element of a strong anti-people-smuggling framework. People-smuggling activities involve significant risks and dangers, including the potential for loss of life and injury. Financial gain is a key driver for smugglers, who often have little regard for the safety and wellbeing of those on board the vessel.
This bill puts laws in place to provide a greater deterrent to people-smuggling activities and to address the serious consequences of such activities. I commend the efforts of the Attorney-General on these amendments and the strengthening of these laws. As the Prime Minister of Australia said in his first National Security Statement address to the parliament in December 2008:
The Government is committed to deploying all necessary resources to prosecute those criminals who seek to undermine Australia’s border security. We will work with our partners in the region to shut down the illegal operations of people smugglers and see them put in jail where they belong.
I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I am really not surprised that the government has brought this bill, the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, before the parliament now. The government’s abject failure on border security is evident, and we are now averaging 10 boats a month. The government is stuck in a hard place on this issue, although it has abandoned any mention of a tough policy. Maybe that is because it is such a simply ludicrous term, given the current flow of boats. Nevertheless, the government cannot reconcile the divisions within the party. The left holds a total commitment to supporting illegal arrivals while the remainder cannot actually take any action of strength, because that would be a total backflip and clear evidence of the stuff-up that has been created. Instead, they are left with trying to stop the boats—or at least the adverse publicity—with special deals, such as the
Oceanic Viking
fiasco, trying to get transit countries to do the work, or even the presentation of this bill.
Perhaps the Rudd government has not worked out yet that, if you promise no more than three months on Christmas Island and certainty of settlement in Australia after that, illegal immigrants will walk past our embassies, bypass the UNHCR and pay the people smugglers. It is a risk they see as worth taking and they consider the money well spent. Until the government addresses that reality, the government will continue to fail. It was previously the case that nowhere was the failure of the government’s policy more evident than in border control. Comprehensive as that failure continues to be, it is clear that in the last six months border protection failure has increasing competition across other policy areas, such as the bungled home insulation program with its and dangers and rortings, the green loans, the overpriced BER program et cetera.
As concerning as the loss of border control is, I nevertheless welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill. I recall that at the end of 2008 I made a speech in this place against the failures of the government in this precise area. I recall the member for Maribyrnong interjecting repeatedly in support of the government’s alleged border control policy, and he did so again yesterday when I asked a question on the government’s border protection failure. This proves what an embarrassment the lack of border control is for the government. We fixed the problem in the past, and since the government was elected it has wrecked the integrity of our borders. Indeed, thanks to the Rudd government, the borders of this nation are as porous as the 2007 Labor Party election promises. This Rudd government policy failure represents yet another example of all talk and no action.
Before going on to the bill, it is important to review what has happened leading up to this point. In this financial year there has been a $132 million blow-out in the cost of processing illegal immigrants. It is little wonder, because since 1 July 2009 there have been 67 boats and more than 4,000 people on those boats—a lot more than the 200 people the government planned on at the time of the last budget. That, of course, has also resulted in the need for $34 million to increase the number of beds on Christmas Island. It has been estimated that this financial year at least $230 million beyond what has been budgeted for will be required, and it will be required to deal with the numbers arriving as a direct result of the changes to the laws that this government said would not see an increase in arrivals. Indeed, if these illegal arrivals continue at this pace, the government may face up to $300 million per year in additional costs, with $1 billion being exceeded in the fourth year. This issue is very clear. Those with money are jumping the queue. Those without money remain in refugee camps, hoping that the numbers of illegal arrivals do not amount to enough to bump them beyond our humanitarian program numbers for the year, only to be reassessed for inclusion on the legitimate queue for next year. There are only around 13,500 on the humanitarian program list. What about these illegal arrivals? There are over 4,000. Surely this is not good news for those in refugee camps.
Before going on I would also go over some previously covered ground in relation to these matters. I have in the past been critical of the validity of many of those who have arrived by boat. I have questioned how much they were in fear of their lives, when they bypassed several countries on their way here. I am often asked by my constituents how it is that we have had Afghani people arrive in Australia by boat when their country is landlocked. Clearly the facts are that these illegal arrivals have passed by many countries on their journey, and that has included road and air travel. This was always my understanding of the situation. Therefore, I thought I would confirm that understanding by putting questions on the
Notice Paper
back on 16 November last year. With reference to illegal arrivals by boat, I asked firstly about arrivals from Sri Lanka and how many had some form of identity document with them upon processing. I was informed by the Attorney-General that between 27 November 2008 and 9 December 2009 742 Sri Lankan nationals arrived by boat. Of those 742 just 20 per cent, or 147, had some form of identity document. I was also informed that 492 of the 742 are understood to have used air travel to transit via South-East Asia. It would be a reasonable assumption that the 492 as an absolute minimum would have had identity documents in order to use civil aircraft. This information would therefore suggest that a lot of identity documents were lost between getting off the aircraft and arriving at Christmas Island. I would question the motives of anyone who throws their identity papers into the Timor Sea.
As part of those questions on notice, I also asked about those from Afghanistan who arrived by boat. I was informed that as at 31 December 2009 1,532 Afghan nationals had arrived by boat and that every one of them had used air travel to get to South-East Asia so that they could get on the boats. I will say again that I cannot reconcile a claim of a desperate fear for one’s life with firstly bypassing Australian embassies then bypassing UNHCR missions and transiting through airline departure halls before getting on a boat in Indonesia. So when those on the government side accuse my colleagues and me of a lack of compassion regarding those who arrive by boats, I would deny it. I say to them that I have compassion and regard for those in refugee camps. I have compassion for those who have done the right thing—not those who have paid for their airfares and perhaps even picked up their duty-free purchases on the way. There is no duty-free at the refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border. Clearly the opportunity exists to properly apply for entry to Australia under the humanitarian program, or for other visas, from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and other points along the way. The fact that illegal arrivals have instead chosen to bypass opportunities to apply for legitimate entry to Australia suggests nothing more than a deliberate intent to illegally bypass Australia’s immigration law to gain access to Australia by jumping the queue.
It used to be the case that when the Navy or Customs intercepted a boat of illegal arrivals it was bad news for the people smugglers and those on the boat. It used to be the case that this nation had border control systems with integrity so that there were no guarantees of staying—but that is all over. The interception of boats, as the minister calls it, is what the people smugglers call a successful delivery. The Navy or Customs taking a boatload of people to Christmas Island is mission accomplished for the smugglers. That so-called interception begins a stay of up to three months on Christmas Island with full use of the gym and unmonitored internet access, followed by a visa and permanent settlement in Australia. The only thing that can stop that certain resettlement is an adverse security assessment.
I therefore ask the question: is the $10,000-plus that is paid to people smugglers a good investment for those who achieve a permanent visa? If they get intercepted or dock at Christmas Island then any observer would have to agree that it is. If your dark past is not detected, you are in and there is no doubt that you will get one of those places in our humanitarian program—much easier and certainly much quicker than applying at the Australia embassy in your homeland or dropping into the UNHCR station in your homeland or at any point along the way. Perhaps it is more expensive, but why be diverted to another less desirable country when you can ensure success with around $10,000?
I would also ask the question about how this sort of money was generated in the first place. We know that these origin countries are of far poorer economic standing than our own. My question would be: how is the money generated? If it is generated legally then it would seem that they are not the desperate people that their advocates suggest they are. If the money is generated illegally, we should question their legitimacy and investigate that matter closely—perhaps that is a matter for ASIO.
Since my election to this parliament I have always wondered why there is no accountability for those who pay the people smugglers to come here. Why is it not an offence to pay a people smuggler? Beyond those who can pay, the refugee camp occupants on the Burma-Thailand border—the Karen, the Chin and the persecuted Burmese people—have to wait in line. They do not have the money. They have to wait while those with money take what may prove to be 4,000 places out of the humanitarian program. It is little wonder that people in this and other countries are unhappy with this situation.
Australia is a fair and tolerant country. This issue is not about racism. It is not about the colour of a person’s skin or their religion. It is about a fair go and whether we are still in control of who comes here. It is clear to me that what this nation needs is a return to the days when there were no guarantees about where you would end up if you tried to jump the queue. We need to get back to offshore processing, resettlement options beyond our shore, visas that are not permanent and a humanitarian program where we decide where the refugees will come from.
That brings me to the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. I say at the outset that we will be supporting this bill. It does not, however, address the core problem and we will see if it helps the current situation in any way. The bill seeks to deter the people smugglers, whilst expanding ASIO’s charter and modifying interception powers. Specifically, the amendments will create a new offence of providing material support or resources toward a people-smuggling venture. It will establish in the Migration Act an aggravated offence of people smuggling which involves exploitation or danger of death or serious harm. There is also an amendment to apply mandatory minimum penalties to the new aggravated offences, and to multiple offences, of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and a maximum penalty of 20 years and/or a $220,000 fine.
I note that there is a specific element of this legislation that suggests that a payment to a people smuggler for one’s own travel, or for that of a relative, is not included as providing material support. In other words, this legislation attacks some of the income for people smugglers but allows other income. I again struggle to understand why there is such an inconsistency. Although the bill does not address this inconsistency—or, rather, promotes this inconsistency—fortunately it does seem to leave the door open for ASIO to make an adverse security finding upon those who seek to circumvent our immigration system. Therefore, I encourage ASIO to examine the intent to bypass legitimate processes and also the intent in concealing one’s identity by getting rid of identity papers. These should be considered strongly as reasons to make an adverse security finding.
It is not my intention to speak to the intricate details of the sections of this bill. I see no point in restating the amendments line by line as I said that we would be supporting this bill, but I do say that the core of the issue remains a problem. Upon arrival at Christmas Island, they are as good as here, and that is wrong. The Rudd government changed the rules. The Rudd government ensures that they will come to Australia and that they will take up places on our humanitarian program. The Rudd government does not question their legitimacy or their intent to bypass legitimate application processes in order to come here, and the Rudd government, through their softness on this matter, ensures that those without the money for airfares or people smugglers will languish in refugee camps even longer.
I appreciate the opportunity to make these comments today. I look forward to seeing how these amendments will assist the current situation. However, I do not hold out great hope because I do not see that they provide any form of accountability for those who bypass our immigration system. Until those who refuse to apply for entry at our embassies or through UNHCR missions are forced to do so, they will continue to see their actions as worth the effort—which means they are jumping the queue. There has been a tendency to see this whole problem as caused by the people smugglers. Of course, we object to and abhor their reckless risk taking with the lives of others but, if there were no market for their product, they would not exist.
As I said before, I am not going to go through line items on this bill. The trouble with this bill is that it does not address the core problems of why people are paying to come here. It does not reverse the government’s changes from two years ago and it does not take away the surety of success that the government gave these illegal arrivals. Because it does not do these things it will not work and the government will find that their failure remains clearly evident into the future. I can see the future clearly: this problem will only be solved when the coalition again forms a government and direct action can be undertaken on this problem.",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I am pleased to speak on the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010
and to support it. Until relatively recently, Australia had a bipartisan approach, in effect, to the treatment of refugees both onshore and offshore. As of 2001, in particular, those opposite, who were then in government, have used this for overtly political reasons, realising that the whole issue of immigration, particularly what is deemed to be unlawful immigration, has always been a psychological lever in Australia’s culture. Strangely enough, it is a culture that, apart from our Indigenous population, is a totally migratory population from our origins. So there has always been this psychological factor of the outsider in Australia if you do not come via the welcome mat that we set out—finely attuned and attested to by the former Prime Minister in 2001.
What that has led to—and it is clearly indicated by many on the other side—is a divisive debate in this country. What is often forgotten, apart from the sheer misery, pain and persecution of those who seek asylum in this country, is that we are signatories to international conventions which obligate us to treat people fairly and humanely when they arrive at our shores or within our jurisdiction and under our sovereignty. But, if you listen to some members on the other side saying, ‘Turn the boats back,’ you hear language that not only defies practicality but defies our obligations as a civilised nation. The simple fact is that, yes, you can point out times in our recent history when the numbers of people seeking asylum, particularly boat people—most come by air, which is hardly ever mentioned in this place—go up and down. The simple fact is that they go up and down according to what we euphemistically call push factors. It essentially means that there are areas of trouble in our neighbourhood that force people, through persecution, to seek asylum elsewhere. Anyone with the means and the will will seek asylum in those places that are most safe. Anyone who is a parent or a guardian would understand that. You would do anything to find safety for your family and your children. It is natural, it is human, and yet many condemn people who would seek to do that.
We hear people say, ‘They’re jumping the queue.’ What queue? Where are these queues—nicely ordered and lined up? There are something like 42 million people in camps throughout our region and throughout the world who are displaced and seeking asylum. What queue? Where are these magical queues? Of course there are people who will make formal application, and this country is comparatively generous in taking on humanitarian refugees, but this talk of queues and people jumping them is absolute, utter nonsense. In times of intense conflict—more recently in our region in Sri Lanka, in particular, and in Afghanistan—we know people are suffering and are displaced and that they will seek asylum and do whatever they can to get to safe places such as Australia. When they enter our jurisdiction and our seas, we are obligated as a humane nation and as part of the international community to take these people and to process them humanely.
It is said by those opposite citing all the figures that, under the Howard regime—that tough old regime with the Pacific solution, Christmas Island and excising—the boats stopped coming. Okay, boats may have diminished in number but that does not mean it is cause and effect. When I was a history student there was a way of looking at history which was called the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy—that because one thing happens and then something else happens it must have been caused by the first. That is nonsense, but that is what they are perpetrating on the other side. The reason the numbers declined is that the points of conflict were diminished, but now the points of conflict are rising, and have risen more recently, and the numbers are increasing. It is a natural historical fact. Those on the other side would have us believe that it is not the push factors, it is not the conflict and it is not the persecution that surrounds us. Jack Hill the blind miner needs only to turn beyond the commercial channels to a bit of international news to see the misery and torment that goes on around us and to put himself in the position of saying, ‘What would I do about that?’ Well, people are doing something about it now, but you would have the mob on the other side saying that it is not those factors that are causing it, that what is causing it are the pull factors and that we have softened our stance on refugees. They say that the people smugglers and those people they are servicing are looking through our newspapers daily, running their fingers down the columns and looking at the changes in legislation and saying: ‘Ah, there’s a loophole. The pull factors have softened so we will increase our trade over there.’ That is absolute nonsense and anyone who really thinks about this for more than a couple of minutes can work that out.
What I find very interesting, and it is not mentioned by those on the other side, is that when our legislation came into place to modify the system—not weaken it but modify it to make it more humane—those on the other side accepted it and voted for it. Their members as part of committees did reports on this and all of them supported it. But now they do not; now it is the problem. Basic logic says that is a nonsense. This government has gone about creating a comprehensive program to make our response humane but at the same time make it firm. We cannot do anything unless we have the assistance of our neighbours. The turnstile is not here; it is elsewhere. We have been working progressively since 2008 to create a whole-of-government national and international framework to make this work better. Many resources are being put into it.
Those on the other side say they accept this legislation but claim it will do nothing to solve the real problem. What we ought to do to solve the real problem is to stop war and stop misery. We also need to do more in our region to support our neighbours. And we had better stop the effects of climate change, because if you think persecution has been the cause of a great proportion of those seeking asylum today, when we see the effects of environmental refugees throughout the world, we will really know something. This business of blaming us for an increase in the number of people seeking asylum here is a nonsense. We need to stop war, we need to stop persecution and we need to stop climate change and the negative consequences of that.
This legislation seeks to tackle people smuggling more comprehensively. Some people argue that people smugglers might be involved in a terrible trade, but at least they are helping people to do something to offset their persecution. I do not support that, but the trade of people smuggling exists because there is a need. We have to do something about these people smugglers and particularly those who prey on the vulnerability of those who are persecuted. That is what this legislation seeks to do.
I find it interesting that the 2004 United Nations Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, to which Australia is a party, defines smuggling of migrants in article 3(a) as:
… the procurement, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit, of the illegal entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident …
I understand that there have been 88 arrests and 25 convictions since September 2008 in Australia—that is, convicted people smugglers, crew members on vessels, who have received between five and six years imprisonment. We have been acting on this and we are seeking to strengthen our activities. How are we going about this? The legislation before us seeks to establish a new offence of providing material support and resources towards a people-smuggling venture in the Migration Act and the Criminal Code. It is worth noting what that means. According to the explanatory memorandum, the offence will apply to a person:
… if that person provides material support or resources to another person or organisation and the provision of the support or resources aids the commission of the offence of people smuggling.
The second reading speech says:
The offence applies if a person is reckless as to whether the money or resources they provide will be used in, or to assist, a people-smuggling venture.
So it attacks so-called ignorance in behaviour. It continues:
It will not apply to a person who pays smugglers to facilitate their own passage to Australia or who pays for a family member on the same venture.
According to the explanatory memorandum:
The maximum penalty for this offence will be imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units ($110,000), or both.
Prescribing a maximum penalty still allows judicial discretion to take account of the circumstances of the case. The second thing it seeks to do is important and it is something that former legislation, particularly by those opposite, did not do. I do not want to go tit for tat on that stuff. All frameworks evolve, no matter who is in government, and that is what this legislation seeks to do. That is why those opposite are willing to support this legislation. The legislation seeks to harmonise people-smuggling offences between the Migration Act and the Criminal Code to strengthen the criminal framework and for greater consistency. It may or may not be surprising to learn that harmonisation of legislation, particularly acts, in our system is an ongoing process because in some senses they contradict each other. This seeks to harmonise acts so they will working with the same intent and for the same purposes and not working at cross-purposes.
A third element of the legislation is to extend the mandatory minimum penalties in the Migration Act. This, of course, is to strengthen this to make it harsher in terms of and in relation to the penalties that are permitted and to improve the capacity for law enforcement and national security agencies to tackle their jobs not just in this but particularly in relation to people smuggling.
People smuggling is a serious and organised crime. We know it involves criminal syndicates and they rely on a network of people associated with them. Targeting the organisers and finances of people-smuggling operations is an important element of a strong anti-people-smuggling framework and that is what this legislation seeks to do on a whole-of-government basis.
Before I finish, I would like to return, if I may, to this issue of context and balance. You have those on the other side, and some of the conservative press, without a doubt, day after day putting the story out that we are being inundated by a peril. Some of the reporting is absolutely disgraceful and atrocious, happily taken up by many on the other side. I notice the member for Berowra—the so-called ‘father of the House’—is in a very sedentary mode at the moment. But he gets highly excited—in fact he bounces in his seat—as soon as you mention the question of boat people and refugees. He starts frothing at the mouth, recalling his enormous record of making the lives of those seeking asylum more miserable. I find it a strange thing to see, and a little disheartening for someone who has been in this House for so long.
Let me just remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of some of the contextual facts that we should take into account when we consider this. I will quote from a new book, which was delivered to all of us just recently—Future Justice
edited by Helen Sykes—from a section on refugees and human rights by Julian Burnside. You can imagine some on the other side would groan when they hear the name ‘Burnside’, but imagine having that record of humanitarian concern in your career and your lifetime. It is fantastic:
Looking at global refugee flows misses the point that very few of them come here.
Very few refugees come here:
If numbers are a concern, here are some to consider:
Australia’s population is 22 million. The number of visitors arriving in Australia each year (for tourism, business etc) is 4.5 million. The number of permanent new immigrants each year is 185,000. The refugee/humanitarian quota per year is 13,500. The number of asylum seekers who come here by air each year—
air!—
… is 5000.
In 2009, for example, the number of asylum seekers who came to Australia by boat was approximately 2,800, or the equivalent of five days migration intake. Yet, if you believe the conservative press, if you believe those opposite and if you take any notice of the frothing of the member for Berowra, you would swear we were being inundated and that this country is at risk. It is an absolute nonsense.
This government is working cooperatively with its neighbours, it has a whole-of-government approach and it has put considerable resources into creating a framework where we are fair, humane and carrying out our international obligations. I am very proud to support this legislation.",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—It is always a privilege to follow the remarks of the member for Braddon, who is generally one of the more thoughtful members on that side of the House. I do rise to speak in support of the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. As the Liberal Party has said through its spokesman, the member for Cook—or the member for the Shire!—we do support the measures in this bill.
However, it is of course a bill that is necessary because of Labor’s failures on this issue. While generally I enjoy the contributions of the member for Braddon, I thought that was one of his weaker ones in defending a very difficult policy issue for the Labor Party to defend. They always defend it on the basis that we on this side of the House are running some sort of fear or dirty under-the-radar campaign rather than actually arguing the real reasons why their policy has failed, which, of course, were the changes to the border protection laws in August 2008. Since that time, we have seen nearly 100 boats arrive in the northern part of Australia. The Christmas Island detention facility is so packed now that it is looking as if those seeking refugee status will need to be transferred to the mainland, a policy failure unlike any other from those on the other side, and probably up there with the insulation program.
Yesterday, the campaign that is run by those on the other side about the motives of members on this side of the House saw one of its worst episodes, with the contribution by the member for Parramatta—as so rightfully pointed out by the member for Higgins who followed her—as recorded in the
Hansard:
There are people in my community—and I despair at these people—who, when the opposition starts to spread this fear, come out with lines like, ‘We should just push the boats back and let them drown.’ We should not accept that. We should not accept those statements and we should not be stirring up that kind of attitude in our community. Yet every time we have this sort of fear campaign on the other side, this demonising of these desperate people, I get that kind of response from some members of my community. I get other members of my community saying, ‘Send them back to where they came from.’ When I say, ‘When they arrive, they might get shot,’ I get the reply: ‘Not my problem.’ I do not think we should be accepting that attitude either and I do not think we should be stirring that up in our community.
The very clear suggestion in that contribution from the member for Parramatta was that members on this side of the House are saying in a direct statement, ‘We should just push the boats back and let them drown.’ The member for Parramatta came into the House, after the member for Higgins quite rightly pointed out this absolute disgrace, and made a personal explanation in which she said:
The member for Higgins said at the beginning of her speech that I had put words in the opposition’s mouth and said that they had suggested that people should drown. I did not.
The
Hansard
quite clearly outlines exactly what the member for Parramatta said. It is a disgraceful campaign run by members of the government who are desperately trying to avoid answering the very real charge that we make on this issue, which is that their policy has meant that the people smugglers are back in business. The trade that people smugglers enter into is vile. No-one supports that type of activity. We certainly do not. We took action in government to ensure that the people smugglers were put out of business. The policy decisions made by this government have meant that they are back in business.
No-one wants to see desperate people in these situations, and for the member for Parramatta to get that low into the gutter and play this sort of politics is a disgrace. She should be brought in by the Prime Minister and thoroughly rebuked and she should apologise to the House for what are disturbing remarks. I notice the member for Braddon was far less outrageous in his claims. He made the suggestion that there was a fear campaign going on and he is right to do that—in a political debate he is able to make those points—but to suggest that people on this side of the House want to see other human beings drown and die is an absolute disgrace. The member for Parramatta should be rebuked and she should be rebuked today. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment at the table, who is a decent person, will ensure that that actually occurs.
This bill is a sensitive bill and we have very well-known splits on our side of parliament about this issue. It is a very difficult issue. People are very emotional about boat arrivals and illegal immigration. It is a sensitive issue in the community and it should be dealt with in a way and in a fashion which is above, hopefully, the low-rent stuff which from time to time does actually occur. However, we do make the charge and we make it very clearly—I think the shadow minister has articulated it very well in recent times—that the decisions of the Rudd government in August 2008 have meant that we are seeing an influx of boats in the northern waters. The Labor Party argue that is because of these additional push factors and the member for Braddon just argued then that war in our region has been the reason that there have been increased push factors. I presume the member for Braddon is talking about the recent conflict in Sri Lanka coming to an end and, certainly, that has added to the pressure. There is no doubt about that. However, to suggest that the Afghanistan conflict ended in 2002 and began again last year is simply wrong. The Afghanistan conflict—as the shadow minister for defence science and personnel at the table knows very well—has been going on since late 2001 and there have been push factors from Afghanistan since that time, as there have been from the Middle East and other parts of the world.
—It was very quiet over the last five years.
—Member for Melbourne Ports, I do not think it actually was. There was quite a deal of ongoing fighting in Afghanistan during that time. It was not as though our forces experienced reduced action in that time. There have clearly been push factors over the whole period. We accept that there are push factors, but what the government fails to accept is that there are pull factors.
There has been a big pull factor, which was the change by the government in its border protection regime in 2008. The government refuse to recognise this. They know that they have made an error; however, they are not addressing the genuine mistake that they have made. That has led to an additional nearly 100 boats arriving since that time. This year we have seen a record number of arrivals. This week alone I think we have seen two boats—it is hard to keep up with how many are actually arriving on our northern shores through the wet season, which is highly unusual.
Until the government can bring themselves to recognise that they have made a fundamental error in this policy issue, we will continue to see the massive number of arrivals occurring in the northern waters of Australia. That is putting additional pressure on our Customs service and defence services and it is a big problem for our border protection regime. I note in this bill the government are seeking to address some of the concerns in relation to security and they are right to do so. We need to protect our borders. We need to have a well-looked after system and ensure that there is a solid system of entry into our country.
We are very generous in the number of people that we take into Australia and we should be. I support that. I do not support a reduction in the humanitarian intake; I think we have a very proud record as a country. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, being a son of migrants, we have a very proud record in Australia of taking in people from other parts of the world whether for economic opportunities or because they are fleeing situations which have become very difficult for them in their home countries. But we need to ensure that it is done in a well-managed fashion, and the problem with softening the border protection laws in 2008 has been that it is putting pressure on the management of this system.
When the member for Braddon said that there are these accusations about there being no queue—‘Where’s the queue?’ I think he said, and then he said there are something like 43 million people in refugee camps around the world—that is exactly right; there is a queue. There is an application process. The department of immigration goes through a very detailed assessment of people to ensure that we are keeping ourselves secure, which of course is a major responsibility of people in this place, at the same time as taking in very high numbers of refugees—I think it is the second largest humanitarian intake of any country in the world, just behind Canada. We do do our bit. There is an argument about whether we could do more, but we certainly do do our bit.
However, what we say on this side of the House is that you cannot undermine your migration intake by softening your border protection laws, because in the Australian community’s eyes it will question the value of the whole process of taking humanitarian refugees. That is a genuine problem that we have. As illegal arrivals increase, the community becomes increasingly concerned about the way that we are managing this system. I think they are right to be concerned, because the government has made a big mistake and it is high time they recognised that mistake. I think it is quite clear that we have a very proud record on this side. There was a problem in 2001 and the former government addressed that problem; the boats stopped coming. There was no problem in 2008, but the Prime Minister created a problem and the boats started coming again. That is the story of the border protection regime in Australia over the last 10 years. The coalition addressed the problem; the Labor Party created a problem. Unfortunately, until the Prime Minister is able to stop talking and start taking some action, we will continue to see the large number of boats arriving in our northern waters.
It is unfortunate that this debate descends into personal attacks and gutter politics. Unfortunately, we have seen far too much of that in this debate so far. In addition to the softening of the border protection laws in 2008, the other mistake the Labor Party have made in government was to cut some of the Customs vessel inspections. They cut $58.1 million from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service air and sea cargo inspection services in the 2009-2010 budget even though they promised in the election that they would not do so—in fact, they said they would increase it. The breakdown of the cuts is $17.1 million over four years cut from the risk based air cargo inspections, $8.6 million over four years cut from the risk based approach to first port boarding inspection program and $32.4 million cut from the risk based sea cargo inspections. The effect of the cuts is that, of Australia’s 70 major ports, 1,300 local port workers and millions of shipping containers, only five to 10 per cent are checked. The decision to cut vital funds in areas of customs will put strain on the staff. They have already been stretched, and this will inevitably lead to more illicit drugs, weapons and biosecurity threats slipping through our borders. Our front-line agency has had major cuts to its budget just at a time when it has increasing pressure put on it through measures introduced by this government’s softening of the border protection laws.
I find it interesting that the Prime Minister just a few weeks ago was talking very loudly about ensuring that our passport system was protected and secure when there were stories about the illegal use of Australian passports. We should be making sure that our passports are used appropriately, but he equally seems to be quite comfortable with a huge increase in illegal arrivals in the northern parts of our country. This is an emotive debate. It is at times a difficult debate for the parliament. However, we need to handle it in a mature fashion. We need to be able to put our different perspectives. We on this side of the House put the perspective that the Labor Party in government has softened what were very effective laws. Those on the other side argue that it was not their decision and was not because of their changes; it has been purely push factors. I think there is clearly an uncomfortable position for those on the other side who can see this increase in the number of people coming. They see the correlation with the decision, but their Prime Minister refuses to take any action on it. It is high time he reconsiders this position. It is high time some of those opposite who are engaging in the gutter politics we saw from the member for Parramatta yesterday stop doing so and have a sensible and well-thought-through debate in this parliament.",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—In speaking on the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, I am pleased to continue to speak for a consistent and coherent policy that this government has established since it has been in office. As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration I have been closely involved with these issues, including those addressed by this bill, over the last two years. It is pleasing to hear remarks like those of the member for Mayo, who just spoke: relatively conciliatory and supportive of the humanitarian program that Australia has. Moreover, I listened carefully to the speech of the honourable member for Cook, who is now the shadow minister for immigration, and I am also pleased that he indicated the opposition will be supporting this bill. He expressed support for some of the measures the government has taken to combat people smuggling both by strengthening the criminal law and by further developing the framework of cooperation with our neighbours, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. But the member for Cook spoiled his good start by repeating the opposition mantra that the reason we are seeing an increased rate of unauthorised boat arrivals along our northern coast is policy changes made by the Rudd government.
Of course, he did not say what changes he was referring to. He did not explain how these changes caused the increase in unauthorised arrivals and he did not commit the opposition to reversing any of these changes if they win the election due later this year. Neither did he tell us what alternative policies the opposition was developing especially to deal with this problem. The opposition rhetoric is very puzzling for people like me, who go along to the immigration committee and listen to members of the opposition, who at various stages of this parliament have advocated that we abolish mandatory detention on Christmas Island. We had an enormous fight at the migration committee with the member for Kooyong and some of his supporters, who thought that the consistent policies of this government were too hard line. They are darlings of the press for their liberal views. They make one argument in the committee and then come into this parliament and make a different argument. I wish the members of the opposition would put the work into the inquiries that we have made into immigration at the very same time that they take to come into this parliament to bash the federal government’s consistent policies on immigration.
I would have thought that the opposition wanted to hold the government responsible for the increased rate of unauthorised boat arrivals. Its responsible shadow minister should have been able to specify exactly what the government did to cause that increase. I would have thought the shadow minister would have been able to explain how those changes produced that outcome. I would have thought, most of all, that the shadow minister would have been keen to commit the opposition to bringing back the policies of the previous government which opposition members claimed were so successful in preventing unauthorised boat arrivals.
We heard the member for Cowan, a member of parliament whom I think quite highly of, talking in his contribution about how some of these unauthorised arrivals get to use the gym, have unmonitored use of the internet and go duty-free shopping on their way here. He asked: where does the money come from for their arrival in Australia? These kinds of comments are very regrettable if you study the situation and they betray a lack of imagination about why people come to Australia in these kinds of circumstances and give effect to the kind of pub talk that leads to hysteria about unauthorised arrivals. I will return to some of those issues in a minute.
Let me help out the honourable member for Cook and his colleagues. Let me tell them about some of the changes that the Labor government has made. Immediately after the 2007 election, we carried out our election commitment to end the Pacific solution, and by February 2008 the camps at Nauru and Manus were closed. In May 2008 we abolished TPVs. These were the policies we took to the election, the policies that were voted for by the Australian people. We carried out those commitments and we were right to do so. However, as I mentioned, despite a large lobby in the Joint Standing Committee on Migration by members of the Liberal Party urging that we abolish mandatory detention, the committee made no such recommendations to government.
We did not suggest that the government open the floodgates, lay out the red carpet or any of the other colourful phrases the opposition likes to bandy about. We continued to argue for preventing the arrival of unauthorised arrivals reaching the Australian mainland by boat. I believe that in the more than two years of this current Australian government only one boat penetrated Australia’s migration zone—a much better record than the Howard government could boast. We continued to detain unauthorised people at Christmas Island where they are processed. We continued to send unauthorised arrivals home if they could not make a case to be considered genuine refugees. We saw that the other night on
Lateline
where the federal Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was criticised by one of the small ‘l’ liberal lawyers in Melbourne for sending a Sri Lankan unauthorised arrival in Australia home. He had no valid reason for being in Australia. His elderly mother had achieved permanent citizenship as she had other relatives who are here in Australia and, unfortunately, the recommendation of the minister was that, since this person had no authorised reason for being in Australia, he must go home.
Let us look at some of the figures from Europe as to why people might be leaving. Let me just remind this House that, in 2006, Europe as a total had 227,000 people making refugee claims. In 2007, that figure was 256,000; in 2008, it was 289,000. Australia during that period had 3,800, 4,200 and 5,000. In 2007 alone, over 51,000 persons arrived by boat on the coasts of Italy, Spain, Greece and Malta. In 2008, 44,000 undocumented migrants were detained when crossing the Turkish border into Greece. The official number of foreigners living in Greece is 800,000, but this number does not include an estimated 200,000 undocumented migrants, often escaping conflict and instability in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia.
The increase in unauthorised boat arrivals that began in 2006 had nothing to do with the Howard government’s policies. What it did have to do with was changes in the international situation, most noticeable being the deterioration in the situation in Afghanistan, the security situation in Iraq and the culmination of the civil war in Sri Lanka. The fact is that the opposition does not like to comment on or acknowledge the whole history of unauthorised boat arrivals over the past 15 years that has been, in my view, largely driven by international factors. The horror of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan caused an outpouring of about three million refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom tried to find asylum in Western countries. The liberation of Afghanistan in 2001 allowed millions of these refugees to go home and the flood of asylum seekers turned to a trickle.
The member for Mayo who just spoke did not focus on the fact that it was during a period of relative peace in Afghanistan that the number of asylum seekers to Australia, particularly Afghan Hazaras, went down. There was another surge, though not nearly as large, following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. As conditions in Iraq improved after 2005, this surge also slowed. Then we had the final, extremely bloody phase of the civil war in Sri Lanka which displaced half a million Tamils from their homes and caused 150,000 Tamils to look for refuge or asylum in other countries.
Figures from other countries bear this out. If we took a graph of the number of Afghanis seeking asylum in

the United Kingdom, for example, we would see the same patterns as we have seen in Australia—a peak of arrivals in 2002, a sharp decline in the middle of the decade and rising levels of arrivals from Afghanistan in 2007. The number of Afghanis seeking asylum in the UK peaked at 90,000 in 2002, fell to 25,000 in 2006 and now has risen again to 35,000. I ask the opposition: did the UK have a Pacific solution? Did it have TPVs? Has it changed its asylum policies in a way which would explain these fluctuations? The answer is no. The pattern in the UK is the same as we see in Australia because the cause is the same—the changing number of people seeking to escape from Afghanistan and find refuge elsewhere.
It is very disturbing to hear proposals from particularly the British government—which has understandable reasons for wanting to continue to receive intelligence information from the Pakistani government—that there should be arrangements made with the Taliban for peace between the international forces, the Karzai government and the Taliban. If I were a Hazara living in Afghanistan, those proposals would terrify me. The possibility that the fanatics from the Taliban regime may take over Afghanistan again, so eloquently explained to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade by Professor William Maley a couple of nights ago, would understandably lead to a huge exodus of Hazaras seeking to flee for their lives in case those fanatics from the Taliban regime took over their country, given what we all know happened to the Hazara minority there when the Taliban were in control.
Members opposite do not have to take my word on this comparison with other countries; figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees support the point I am making. UNHCR figures for 2009 show a rapid rise in the number of Sri Lankan asylum seekers in countries around the world: this year, an increase of 30 per cent in France, 14 per cent in Germany and more than double in Japan, admittedly from a very low base. Japan is a notoriously unwelcoming country for foreign arrivals, so the fact that Tamils are trying to beat down Japan’s door shows how desperate they are. Even New Zealand, which is a very long boat trip from anywhere, had an increase in asylum seekers last year. We see the same story with asylum seekers from Afghanistan. This is relevant because nearly all of the current wave of arrivals on Australia’s maritime borders are either Sri Lankans or Afghanis. This is a worldwide problem and not one that is much influenced in either direction by immigration policies in the countries to which these unfortunate people are trying to gain entry.
Let us look at this issue from another perspective, and I am grateful to the blogger known as Possum Comitatus for posting these figures on his website recently. In 2008 Australia saw 161 unauthorised boat arrivals. In the same year the UK, France and Italy saw a combined 96,000 arrivals. The 51 industrialised countries participating in the UNHCR’s statistics program received 382,000 applications for asylum. Globally an estimated 827,000 people were seeking asylum, a small part of the estimated 15 million recognised refugees in the world that year. In other words, the 161 arrivals which the opposition tried to present as such a terrible threat to Australia’s security and prosperity were just a tiny part of a great global problem, the problem of millions of displaced people fleeing from civil war, terrorism, natural disasters et cetera.
Australia’s problem with unauthorised arrivals is small compared to the problems being experienced in France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada and the US. Of the 150,000 Sri Lankans looking for asylum I mentioned, the great majority are trying to enter European countries. Only a small number risk the 4,000-kilometre trip across the Indian Ocean to get to Australia. It is so obvious to any reasonable person, such as the member for Braddon, who spoke before me, that the solution to Australia’s border security problems lies in doing several things. The most important is to work at the source of the problem in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sri Lanka. We do that in cooperation with other countries and through the UN, our military presence in Afghanistan, our civil and military training assistance in Iraq and our international development program.
It is in the Australian national interest that the scourge of terrorism in Afghanistan, as a base for al-Qaeda, is defeated. It is also in our national interest that waves of potential unauthorised arrivals be prevented leaving the country through peace being established there and through civil authority being established over as much of Afghanistan as possible. Therefore, I am greatly alarmed by proposals by the British foreign secretary, Mr Miliband, who insists on talks with the Taliban. For the British, getting information from their friends in the Pakistani intelligence service to prevent terrorism in London may serve the British national interest. But scaring the wits out of the people of Afghanistan that somehow the Taliban are going to be put back in office via their old mates in the British Colonial Office—sorry, the foreign office—does not serve the international interest or Australia’s interest.
On another level, it was very disappointing to see Senator Joyce, presumably speaking on behalf of the opposition, calling only last month for Australia to cut its foreign aid program. No wonder Andrew Hewett, the Executive Director of Oxfam Australia, said that Senator Joyce’s comments were worrying and disappointing. He understands what an important contribution our development aid makes in stabilising the situation in the very countries which are the source of the asylum seeker problems that the opposition claims are such a terrible threat to Australia.
The second leg of an effective policy is to work with our regional neighbours who must tackle the issue of the flow of asylum seekers to our borders. The opposition likes to make jokes about the ‘Indonesian solution’, but the fact is that the Indonesian archipelago lies across our northern maritime approaches and virtually all boats passing our northern coastline have come from or passed through Indonesia. The recent visit by President Yudhoyono showed relations between Australia and Indonesia are at an all-time high. Cooperation on asylum seeker issues, as with most issues, has never been better. I am going to Jakarta soon on what will be my fifth or sixth trip there. I regard it as a duty of any Australian parliamentarian interested in international affairs to have a primary interest in Indonesia, our closest and most important neighbour. Australia’s policy is clearly far more effective now than it was under the previous government, although I acknowledge we have a much more constructive negotiating partner now than in the days of President Megawati.
The third leg of our policy must be to maintain an orderly and fair refugee program. At present we take about 13,000 refugees a year. With our very large immigration program I personally think that figure should be higher, but relative to our population it is a high figure when compared to refugee intakes in other wealthy countries. I have to again remind the House that when unauthorised arrivals come to Australia they become part of the humanitarian program. The impression of a huge surge of boat people is created by some people who want to exacerbate tensions for political benefit. The member for Cowan suggested the asylum seekers get free internet access and go duty-free shopping before they come to Australia. This is a program that is funded and part of our immigration program. There is a marginal extra cost to Australia in processing these people, who after all are judged by the relevant authorities in the department of immigration as to whether or not they fulfil the requirements to come to Australia. They are all evaluated very seriously with health and security checks, as they should be. But none of them just floats into Australia, as the impression being conveyed suggests.
In order to make sure that our refugee program is both fair and orderly and that political support for our migration program as a whole is maintained, we need to take a firm stand against people smuggling. People smuggling puts people’s lives at risk, it undermines support for our refugee program and it encourages lawlessness and corruption in the countries where the people smugglers operate. The Australian government has taken a strong stand against people smugglers, and the measures in this bill are a reflection of that stand. They widen the legal scope of the offences for which people can be prosecuted in relation to people smuggling and they increase the penalties for those convicted.
These are necessary measures, but we would be kidding ourselves if we thought law enforcement alone was sufficient to prevent unauthorised arrivals. The US spends $3.5 billion a year patrolling its borders. It does not stop 500,000 people crossing illegally from Mexico into the US, nor does it stop 6.5 million Mexicans living illegally in the United States. This is not because the United States has rolled out the red carpet to illegal immigrants; it is because, given the economic disparity between the US and Mexico, it is simply impossible to prevent the influx of people across a border that is more than 3,000 kilometres long. Likewise, our maritime border is long and porous, and no amount of law enforcement will ever entirely stop unauthorised boat arrivals—although, as I said earlier, our problem is insignificant when compared to problems faced by other countries.
So long as there are countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, whose political problems are driving people to seek asylum, we will have this problem. Measures like the ones in this bill can reduce it but I am afraid they will not eliminate it. That is why it is so silly for the opposition to boast that their Pacific solution and their TPVs succeeded in stopping the boats during the years of the Howard government. Those policies inflicted unnecessary cruelties on hundreds of hapless people, as even Liberal members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration acknowledged when they signed up to our report on immigration detention. All of the members of that committee, including the then shadow minister for immigration, signed off on a proposal that did not soften our attitude to unauthorised arrivals but regularise it. The Australian of the Year, Professor McGorrie, explained why the changes to indefinite detention were necessary. He said that these people were being unfairly mentally tortured.

",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I am pleased to speak on the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to amend Australia’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework. In particular, the bill proposes to harmonise the existing offences between acts, create new people-smuggling offences, enhance investigative tools and extend the application of mandatory minimum penalties for aggravated people-smuggling offences. The amendments are as follows. The bill amends the Criminal Code and the Migration Act to increase the sanctions applicable to people smuggling, the ASIO Act to include the protection of Australia’s territorial and border integrity from serious threats within ASIO’s statutory charter, and the T(IA) Act and Surveillance Devices Act to include people smuggling within the definition of a serious offence and thus permit the use of these tools to investigate allegations of people smuggling and to align the definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ in the T(IA) Act with the definition in the Intelligence Services Act 2001.
The reasons that this is being done are all good, because both sides of the House want to see the end of people smuggling. We know the absolutely severe outcomes that you get when you have people smugglers taking to the waters with their precious cargo and we know what has happened in this country. We remember SIEV4, which disappeared with its total cargo of over 400 people. Today the Northern Territory coroner has reported on SIEV36, and he has stated that a crime did occur and that he is referring it on to the Northern Territory DPP. At least five members of the crew and cargo—human cargo—perished because, in his words, they deliberately sabotaged the boat by putting salt in the engine, spreading unleaded petrol around and putting a match to it. That was what they did to try and make sure that they were picked up at sea.
That is the cruel trade of people smuggling, and both sides of the House want to see that this practice is stopped. However, we depart on a few other matters. I will make the point today that the reason why we are talking about this again and having to toughen these measures is that, since taking office more than two years ago, the Labor Party has sent out a very strong signal to those who would come here unlawfully that we are open for business. You do not need to look any further than the words of those seeking to come here themselves. We know now that the mentality is: if you can get to Australia, you are going to get a visa. So the attraction is to get to the Australian mainland. If you get to the Australian mainland, the history is that most of the people who get here by boat get a visa—it is about 80 per cent. And why do they want to come by boat? Because close to 80 per cent of those people who come by boat get a visa, whereas for the overstayers who come by air—and other means, but generally air—who flush their documents down the toilet before they arrive in Australia and then claim asylum it is only about 20 per cent. So why wouldn’t you try and come by boat? These people are paying $20,000 to people smugglers to do this and they are willing to take the risk because they know at the end is the golden orb of a visa to stay in Australia.
We know, as I said, that people have lost their lives on the way here and I have referred to SIEVX. We now know even more from organisations like the International Organisation for Migration. An article in the
Herald Sun
on Friday, 16 October 2009 stated that the organisation’s Indonesian chief last year confirmed the fact:
People smugglers have clearly noted that there has been a change in policy—
this is in Australia—
over the last year there’s been a considerable kick-up.
For an organisation like that, an honest broker in this area, to observe that really sheets it home to the Australian Labor Party that they have changed the rules and now we know that it is a more attractive destination because, if you can get here, you get to stay here.
Whereas the Howard government realised that—and it came to a head, as most people would know, with the
Tampa
incident of 2001—and we said, ‘This has got to stop.’ We had hundreds and thousands of people making their way here unlawfully. At the end of the day we said, ‘Well, you’re not going to get to stay here if you get here. You might actually end up in Nauru or Papua New Guinea or elsewhere. Even if you get a visa, you mightn’t get to stay in Australia. You might be sent to somewhere else in the world.’ As a result, it stopped.
I would like to point out these figures. In 2002-03, there was one boat arrival after the Pacific solution. In 2003-04, there were three boat arrivals. In 2004-05, there were no boat arrivals. In 2006-07, there were four boat arrivals. In 2007-08, there were only three boats—even after the Rudd government came to power—because, up to that point, the coalition policies remained intact. So, for the last six years of the Howard government, there were only 18 boats in total, an average of three boats over the six years, every year, because of the border protection policies that were put in place.
People have asked me, ‘What’s the story with these temporary protection visas? How do they work?’ Well, we know that the temporary protection visas allowed them to stay on the Australian mainland and they allowed us to, during that time, assess their suitability and genuineness as refugees. It did not allow them to have a whole lot of the entitlements that have now come with the change in Australian policy, which I will refer to shortly. It did give them protection until their status was found. At the end of the day, they were either deemed to be genuine refugees or they were sent back to their country of origin. So the fact is that, by changing the rules, the Labor Party has now shown Australia as an attractive destination.
In April last year, Iraqis who had spent years in Indonesia told the ABC they would be sailing to Australia now that Rudd has softened our laws. One Iraqi told the ABC:
Kevin Rudd—he’s changed everything about refugee. If I go to Australia now, different, different, …
The
Australian
reported that the Rudd government’s changes prompted some to leave their homes in Iran and Pakistan and catch a boat to Australia. One refugee said:
I know Kevin Rudd is the new PM, … He has tried to get more immigrants. I have heard if someone arrives it is easy. …
Let us see what effect this has had. Mr Rudd decided he would try and do a deal with Indonesian President Yudhoyono. I was very pleased to see him here last week saying that he would try to toughen up. Unfortunately, my belief is not as strong as others’ that Mr Yudhoyono will follow through in any timely way, because he first of all has to get it through his parliament and he has some issues with that.
The fact is that Mr Rudd said there was a boatload of asylum seekers at sea. Interestingly, it is not exactly clear whether they were in international waters or Indonesian territory. They got on the phone and they claimed to be in trouble. Where did they ring? Not the nearest landfall, which was Indonesia; they rang the authorities in Australia and said, ‘Please rescue us.’ So Prime Minister Rudd rang his mate Mr Yudhoyono and said, ‘Look, can you do us a favour? Can you grab these people, rescue them and take them to your nearest port? We have a detention centre that you can put them in.’ But it has backfired, because these same people are now holed up in Merak and they have been holed up in Merak for 157 days in squalid conditions. The Indonesians are saying, ‘It’s not our problem. It’s your problem. You asked us to rescue them but we didn’t say what we were going to do about it.’ So here we have a policy failure, where these people are holed up in Merak and unable to move.
Interestingly, there were 255 people on that boat but there are only 254 now, because their spokesman, ‘Alex’, who has a Canadian accent, has disappeared into the ether. They could not find him. He has left the boat. They do not know where he has gone. We know Alex has a bit of form, because when he was in Canada he was in prison for fraud. This was a person who was endeavouring to come to Australia. I suspect he would not have passed the good character test. But, dare I say—and I note that the Attorney-General Mr McClelland is at the table—that we have a person in Australia at the moment, the Iranian Sheik Leghaei, who has been deemed not a suitable person because he has had adverse security assessments made against him. I note that in reports in the media today he has been given another month to stay here. Writing a reference for this particular person who has had adverse security assessments made against him is not terribly clever. It reminds me of the reference that was written for Mr Mokbel. Be that as it may—

(Mr KJ Thomson)—Member for Canning, return to the bill.
—I will return to the bill. We are talking about character tests for people who come to Australia. At the end of the day, the character test that would have confronted Alex should have made sure that he was not the sort of person who could remain here.
Let us put this into context. We hear the Prime Minister, the ministers and all of the Labor Party say, ‘Yeah, but look, we haven’t got a problem anything like what they have in Europe.’ And they mention Italy all the time. I am a bit of an expert on the Italian situation. I have been there to have a look at it firsthand. Recently I visited the detention centre in Sicily called Caltanissetta. I not only spoke with the deputies from the city of Caltanissetta, but once I got to the detention centre I spoke to the people involved in the administration of the detention centre, and it was all very revealing. They process them there very quickly and then they either determine that they are refugees and or they return them.
What has been missed by most people in this debate is that in 2008 Italy initiated a formal agreement between the Italian and Libyan authorities to intercept and return unauthorised boats. It was concluded and ratified by the Italian parliament in February 2009. This has been called the push-back policy in Italy. You can think what you like about Mr Berlusconi, and his behaviour as Italian Prime Minister is well documented, but he was elected clearly and still has a clear majority in the Italian polls, from what I understand, and one of the reasons is that he has done something about the illegal arrivals into Italy. Italy, like many European countries, does have very porous borders. At one stage they used to give up and say, ‘Look, we will take you into our reception centres and we will feed you and organise for you to keep going north.’ They were sending them off to Germany because Germany had a very lax system. There was a good pull factor—once they arrived there they got welfare payments, they got housing and they got health care. What does that remind you of? The current situation in Australia.
According to press reports in Italy, in 2008 there were 19,000 arrivals. Because of this push-back policy, in 2009 there were only 1,900—in other words, one-tenth of the arrivals because Mr Berlusconi was able to do a deal with Libya to intercept the boats making the journey across the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean has been the pathway to Europe, which has been a desired destination for political asylum. Here is something that might interest those who continue to use the Italian situation, saying we are nothing like Italy, which has these tens of thousands of arrivals. In proportion, we are. As I have said, so far this year, since Mr Rudd said in budget estimates last year there would be only 200 people, we know there have been over 3,100 people. So in Italy there have been 1,900 and we have had 3,100. We have had 68 boats in that period. So there is something going on that is attracting these people to Australia. There is a pull factor, and I will elaborate on that shortly.
Believe it or not, there is an island off Libya which is much like our Ashmore Reef. Once they get there, they are deemed to be on Italian territory. That is like Ashmore Reef because even today it is being said that those wanting to come to Australia actually plot Ashmore Reef into their GPS and they go looking for our boats so that they can be intercepted and transferred straight to Christmas Island. As we know, the Labor Party keep saying to us, ‘Oh yes, but it is not full.’ You will recall that before the election they said that they were not going to use Christmas Island as they would not need it—it was a redundant facility; a waste of money as it only held 800 people. What have they done now? They have filled it up with tents and dongas. It can now potentially hold up to 2,000 people, and even now it is filling up. There are reports now that there are moves to bring people onto the Australian mainland before they are fully assessed. Why would you do that? The danger is that, once they reach the Australian mainland, they potentially get access to greater legal support and the industry that flows from that.
So, as I say, the situation between Australia and Italy is very similar, but the Italians have dealt with it. As a result, they have now reduced the flow to a trickle. This was made very clear to me when I was in the Italian detention centre in Sicily. It certainly is a pull factor when if you can get here you can stay here and get a visa. That is why we have seen even more robust pushes of people from these countries who are trying to get to the mainland. We saw the group of Sri Lankans that got off the boat in Shark Bay, hundreds of metres from the shore. They swam ashore and then asked how to get to Sydney. That is how determined they are to get to the mainland.
The other point that people continue to make is that the war in Afghanistan is one of the push factors. As was pointed out by the member for Cook yesterday, the Europeans have done an investigation of all those arriving in Europe and the increase in that period of time has been only one half of one per cent, and yet Australia in the same period of time has had an increase of 31 per cent. So what does that tell you?
I was the chair and am now the deputy chair of the Sri Lankan Friendship Group in this place. The reports about Sri Lankans, the Tamils in particular, having to flee Sri Lanka because of the civil war are totally overblown. When you talk to their ministers and you talk to their government and you talk to their high commissioner in Australia, you see that this is absolute rubbish. They are resettling the Tamils into the conflict zone, and this is being monitored by international agencies. There are reports now that something like 80,000 Sri Lankans have appeared after the cyclone season to come to Australia. The Sri Lankans now know that you just get to Australia and you get your visa, so they are preparing on the shores around Trincomalee and places like that to get a fishing boat to come to Australia.
This is a grave area of policy failure by the Australian Labor Party. As a result, we have seen unfortunate deaths and we have seen a situation where the males generally come on their own and when they get here they can apply for all the other entitlements such as spouse visas, et cetera. Finally, we know that this is costing Australia enormously. While pensioners are doing it tough, Centrelink benefits paid to refugees have increased 40 per cent in the last two years—one wonders why this has happened over the past two years—to an estimated $628 million. In the last financial year, 52,469 refugee visa holders received Centrelink benefits, including the age pension, the disability support pension, Austudy, Newstart and youth allowance, and more than $20 million was paid to these people in baby bonuses. No wonder Australia is a desired destination. These are entitlements that you would never get anywhere else.

",REPS,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—in reply—I thank members for their contributions to the debate. The government welcome the opposition’s support for measures contained in the
Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010
and we look forward to their assistance in ensuring its passage through the parliament.
People smuggling is a pernicious trade which jeopardises the safety, wellbeing and security of those being smuggled. The government takes a hardline approach to dealing with people smugglers, their supporters and their financiers. The government is determined to maintain its strong message to people smugglers that they will face the full force of the law. Domestic efforts to combat people smuggling have yielded strong results. Since September 2008, there have been 117 arrests and 28 convictions of people smugglers in Australia. There are currently 87 people being prosecuted in Australian courts for people smuggling, four of whom are organisers. The government’s strengthened offshore approach is also working. In the same period, Australian government cooperation with regional countries has resulted in more than 130 disruptions involving more than 3,500 people otherwise bound for Australia. Our regional partnership has resulted in the arrest of more than 100 people smugglers overseas.
The bill will amend the ASIO Act to enable ASIO to respond to serious threats to Australia’s territorial and border integrity, including people smuggling. This will support the government’s intelligence-led approach to combating people smuggling and is consistent with the all-hazards approach to national security. Can I make it clear: ASIO’s top priority will remain counterterrorism and counterespionage, and the bill will not change that. Further, the government remains committed to ensuring that national security agencies are appropriately resourced to fulfil their essential functions. For instance, in the 2009-10 budget, the government increased resources to our border protection and national security agencies by some $1.3 billion over six years. This included $685 million specifically for law enforcement and counterterrorism measures and $654 million to implement a comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to combat people smuggling and enhance border protection. Within my portfolio alone, some $3.4 billion this financial year has been committed to funding our national security and border protection agencies. This is an increase of $186 million in this year alone.
ASIO has received increased resources to fulfil its important national security role. ASIO currently has around 1,720 staff—1,639 equivalent full-time positions—and this is projected to increase to 1,860 staff by mid-2011. Indeed, ASIO launched a campaign for that staff recruitment program last Friday. ASIO’s operational funding from government increased from $359 million in the 2008-09 financial year to $409 million in the current year, 2009-10, and is projected to increase to $412.9 million in 2010-11. ASIO has undergone very significant expansion in recent years. It has proven itself to be a highly professional and competent organisation that is capable of rapidly adapting and responding to a changing national security environment. The government is confident that ASIO will continue to respond effectively to both longstanding and emerging national security issues.
The government will continue to carefully monitor the resources of all Australian national security and intelligence agencies to ensure they are well equipped to protect our national security. The precise extent of ASIO’s people-smuggling role and the appropriate allocation of resources to support this role are, of course, matters for the Director-General of Security to determine, and we will rely on his expert advice.
This bill complements the government’s plan to combat people smuggling by strengthening Australia’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework. Measures in the bill will address the often serious consequences of people-smuggling activities, including the potential for injury and loss of life on maritime ventures to Australia. They will target enablers and financiers of people-smuggling activities, they will act as a greater deterrent for people smugglers, and they will enable law enforcement and national security agencies to play a greater role in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat people smuggling.
The ability for law enforcement agencies to obtain evidence through telecommunications interception technologies and surveillance devices is also vital to combating people smuggling. The bill will make telecommunications interception available for the investigation of offences relating to people smuggling. The bill will also ensure that law enforcement agencies can make emergency authorisations for the use of surveillance devices for the new aggravated people-smuggling offence. These amendments will ensure that law enforcement agencies are equipped with the necessary tools to effectively combat people smuggling.
The government maintains a hard line on people smugglers and a responsible approach to genuine asylum seekers, consistent with our international obligations. The bill is consistent with this approach. Whilst imposing new offences and strict penalties for people smugglers, the new offence of supporting people smuggling will not target persons who pay for their own passage or for the passage of family members on that same venture.
It is important to recall that conflicts and turmoil around the world are driving a global surge of asylum seekers, just as they did in the period between 1999 and 2003. The bill is an important part of the government’s response to this surge, bolstering the government’s ability to investigate, prosecute and punish people smugglers. I thank the shadow minister for immigration, who has been in attendance during the course of the concluding stage of the debate.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—The parliament has been waiting for this
bill, and its related legislation,
for a while. Going back to 2002 the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference recommended a specific regulatory framework for tissue and biological therapies. This was developed in the context of a joint regulator with New Zealand—the proposed Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority. However, in July 2007 the enabling bill in the New Zealand parliament stalled and so the joint agency is currently suspended. However, the need for a specific regulation of biological therapies in the Australian context remains and hence we have this bill.
Biologicals cover human cell and tissue therapies. Tissue therapies would be things like skin grafts after severe burns; transplantation of heart, kidney, lungs or pancreas; bone-tendon ligament grafts to repair injuries; heart valves to replace defective valves; and corneal transplants. The cellular therapies include things like making cartilage cells—chondrocytes—for cartilage repair, eyelet cell transplantation for diabetes and mesenchymal progenitor cells for musculoskeletal defects.
Looking at the organisations that are involved in producing the human cell and tissue therapies, in December 2008 the TGA estimated the number of organisations who are undertaking work on human cell and tissue therapies. These included organisations involved in IVF and organ transplantation, and it should be pointed out that these will be covered by different regulations. The organisations that this legislation will have implications for are the 20 licensed tissue banks—one in the ACT, five in New South Wales, three in Queensland, two in South Australia, one in Tasmania, five in Victoria and three in Western Australia; these include bone banks, eye banks, heart valve banks and skin banks—and also organisations which are working in the area of cellular and tissue therapies. Of the latter organisations, there is currently one in New South Wales, one in Queensland, one in South Australia, one in Tasmania, four in Victoria and one in Western Australia. There are companies that are involved in this area: Verigen in Western Australia and the Australian Stem Cell Centre in Victoria are examples of businesses who are involved in the manufacture of human cell and tissue therapies.
When we look around the world we see that in the United States, the European Union and Canada there is specific regulation for biologicals. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates biologics specifically. Somatic cell and gene therapy, which are a much more interventionist therapy, are regulated as a medicinal, or class III medical device, product, which is much more comprehensive. In the European Union there is a specific directive on human tissues and cells being used as therapies. In Canada they regulate HCTs, other than transplant and IVF, as class IV medical devices.
The number of therapies that are going on is potentially enormous. In the United States, the FDA estimates that the number of tissue transplants went from 350,000 in 1990 to 1½ million by 2007. These would typically be bone, ligament and corneal transplants, and so on. The problem with the current regulation in Australia is the lack of clarity. There is no risk based classification. There is a lack of international harmonisation with the other countries I have mentioned. In the legislation the regulation impact statement outlined a number of approaches to regulation. Option 1 was to retain the status quo. Option 2 was to regulate all HCTs as medicines or therapeutic devices and remove the exemptions for transplant, assisted reproduction tissues and HCTs which have been prepared for a particular person. Option 3, which is the option that is being taken, is to regulate the HCTs as a discrete class of therapeutic goods—biologicals. Organs and assisted reproduction tissues are to be excluded as they already have a separate regulation which works well; to include them would be to add a further level of regulation and additional compliance cost. This is consistent with the approach in the United States, Europe and Canada.
There is a remaining issue with this legislation which has not been addressed in the parliamentary secretary’s second reading speech or in the legislation. That is the situation of medical practitioners who are removing and then re-implanting tissues so that routine medical practice is not captured by the TGA. The opposition would appreciate a response from the parliamentary secretary to this to cover how this situation will be dealt with if it is intended to deal with it by way of regulations.
In the legislation there are four classes of HCTs, each with a different level of regulation based on the level of risk. From the consultation it is apparent that stakeholders prefer option 3, which has been reflected in this bill. As I said, option 3 has regulation based on risk and clarity, has compliance costs lower than option 2, has improved consumer safety over option 1, which is the status quo, and is consistent with the experience in the United States, Europe and Canada.
The parliamentary secretary has indicated that by way of legislative instrument organs donated for transplantation and assisted reproduction tissues will not be classified as biologicals for regulation under the act. Organs will continue to be regulated by the Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority and assisted reproduction tissues will continue to be regulated in the current way—that is, the status quo will remain. There is also a provision in the legislation for non-conforming biologicals to be used in exceptional circumstances when clinically necessary and when the patient or guardian consents. I have no issue with that at all.
This bill is part of the overall ongoing regulatory reform being undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This is the fourth in a series of bills to implement that reform. It seeks to build on the other reforms agreed to by the parliament over the last year. The coalition has been broadly supportive of these measures as they have been presented to the parliament by the government. The primary purpose of this bill, as I said, is to introduce a framework for the regulation of biologicals—human cellular and tissue based therapy products. This bill specifies what they are and provides for them to be regulated separately from other therapeutic goods and medical devices.
HCTs have been primarily manufactured by not-for-profit tissue banks and major hospitals. However, with rapid advances in cell and tissue technology, there is an increasing involvement by private sector companies and clinics in the manufacture of HCT products, while medical device manufacturers may in fact in future incorporate HCTs into medical devices. Clearly, therefore, we do need an update of the Therapeutic Goods Act to reflect that these emerging technologies and HCT products can be regulated as a specific group.
The government assures that under this legislation all biologicals used within Australia will be properly assessed and regulated, providing confidence for patients who hope to benefit from the outcome of these new technologies. As I said earlier, this is a bill that was first foreshadowed by the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference in 2002. Public consultations ensued through 2003 and 2004 and the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council and Australian Health Ministers’ Conference agreed to implementation of frameworks for biologicals in 2006.
Most of these reforms were agreed to in the context of the proposed Australia-New Zealand therapeutic products authority. When the New Zealand government decided not to proceed with the joint authority, the Australian government decided to implement these proposed changes in the Australian context alone.
The framework for the regulation of biologicals is established in schedule 1 of the bill. The government has said that the amendments will ensure that the regulation of biologicals is consistent with the regulation of other therapeutic goods. The bill will create four classes of biologicals from low risk—class 1—to high risk—class 4. The TGA has said that a risk based approach will be adopted, with the stringency of the regulations and other requirements increasing with the risk level of the biological. Biologicals at a low-risk level will be subject to less rigorous evaluation and regulation.
Biologicals will have to be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and only those that are so registered, or otherwise exempted, will be able to be supplied and used within Australia. Biologicals can be exempted from the TGA regulatory framework by regulation to deal with emergency situations, to allow for special experimental uses or where substitutes are not available.
Criminal and civil penalty provisions are provided for in the bill to ensure compliance by those bodies and individuals involved in the making, supplying and use of biological materials. It is stated that all these penalties are consistent with other provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act and can apply in the same way as penalties for the misuse of other therapeutic goods.
The parliamentary secretary has assured the parliament that the legislation will provide flexibility to deal with urgent medical circumstances and that non-conforming biologicals will be able to be made available in exceptional circumstances. The parliamentary secretary has also assured the House that the legislation will ensure that sponsors and manufacturers of biologicals will not face unnecessary requirement and that they will be able to transition smoothly and easily to the new regulatory arrangements. Importantly, organs donated for transplant and assisted reproductive tissues, such as IVF embryos, will not be classified as biologicals for regulation under the act and will continue to be regulated under existing arrangements.
In the main, the coalition notes that stakeholders are supportive of the need for these measures to regulate biologicals. Those stakeholders have, however, flagged some areas of concern. On the issue of immunity from prosecution for the Commonwealth and Commonwealth officers, the coalition notes that, while the Therapeutic Goods Act presently contains various immunity provisions, they will be repealed by these amendments. The provisions for immunity outlined in this bill provide greater breadth of the immunity conferred and to whom it is conferred upon. The coalition accepts that these provisions are consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and other regulatory agencies but notes the concern of some stakeholders that the TGA must remain responsible for its actions.
The coalition also notes that, where information is sought under the provisions of these amendments, in some circumstances the right to avoid self-incrimination is void; however, the bill balances that by providing that any information supplied will be inadmissible as evidence against that person. Again, these measures are consistent with other Commonwealth legislation.
There is also some concern about costs and cost recovery practices of the TGA in the context that any action that drives up costs could have an impact on the availability of particular therapies and their costs to the patient. Stakeholders believe that in this area, where rapid changes and advances are being made, there is great need for flexibility on the part of both the TGA and the government. Given that there will be a delayed commencement date for the amendments contained in this bill to allow for further consultation on various matters, the coalition would urge the government to heed some of the concerns outlined and to take up these matters with stakeholders during that consultation process. The coalition does not oppose the bill.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Raguse, Brett, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I rise today to speak about the
Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009
and the
Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2009. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009 is the fourth in a series of bills to implement reforms to the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia through amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The legislation reflects the government’s commitment to maintaining the position of Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, as a leading global regulator of therapeutic goods and to continue to strengthen and enhance this well-deserved position. It builds upon the other therapeutic goods reform bills approved by parliament over the past year, to further strengthen and improve Australia’s therapeutic goods regulatory framework. This legislation includes a new regulatory framework for cellular and tissue based therapy products, known as biologicals, so that these products can be regulated as a specific therapeutic goods group.
Implementation of the biologicals framework was agreed to in 2006 by the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference and was among other improvements that were to have been adopted as part of legislation underpinning the proposed Australia-New Zealand therapeutic products authority, ANZTPA. The Rudd government is committed to moving forward to implement these improvements. We have delivered on that commitment, with the majority of improvements now implemented through the reform bills that were passed by the parliament last year, in this current bill and in another just introduced amendment that is before the House today.
Schedule 1 of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009 will implement a new framework for the regulation of biologicals and will bring Australia’s regulation of these products into line with other leading therapeutic goods regulators around the world including, importantly, the United States, Canada and the European Union. Biologicals include things such as skin tissue for use in grafts following burns, and bone for grafting. It is envisaged that a legislative instrument will be made under the biologicals framework to declare that organs donated for transplantation and assisted reproductive tissues such as IVF embryos will not be classified as biologicals for regulation under the act. Instead, organs will continue to regulated by the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority established by this government and assisted reproductive tissues will continue to be regulated under current arrangements.
The new framework will enable the overarching regulatory principles that apply to all other therapeutic goods to be adapted and applied to biologicals by including a new part in the act. The principal benefit of the new biologicals part is its ability to apply different levels of premarket and postmarket regulation requirements based on the relative risk of each biological. It will also ensure that all biologicals used in Australia are properly assessed and regulated, as currently many are exempted and do not fit neatly under the medicines or medical devices frameworks. To enable this to occur, classes of biologicals will be set out in regulations to be made under this bill. The lowest class will include biologicals that are at a relatively low-risk level, while other classes will apply to biologicals of incrementally higher risk levels. For example, those biologicals that have been extensively manipulated or are intended to be used for a purpose that is not their usual or original purpose would fall under the highest risk class. The rigour of the application and assessment process and postmarket monitoring for biologicals will be aligned to these risk based classes so that higher risk biologicals will be required to provide a higher level of information to confirm their safety, quality and efficacy.
This approach means that sponsors of biologicals in lower risk classes are not required to comply with unnecessary requirements that are relevant only to the higher risk biologicals. Only those biologicals that are approved and included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods or otherwise given an exemption under this new part will be able to be imported, exported, supplied or used in Australia. This is consistent with all other therapeutic pubic goods, such as medicines. The new part will also apply criminal offence and civil penalty provisions to dealings with biologicals in the same way as they apply to other therapeutic goods. Were this not the case, the act would be inconsistent in its application and sponsors of biologicals or other therapeutic goods might have an incentive to frame the claims in relation to the nature of their product so that it would come under the more lenient offence and civil penalty provisions.
A feature of the changes for biologicals is the ability to deal flexibly with urgent medical circumstances. Unlike medicines which may be readily mass produced, biologicals are produced from cells and tissues. As a result, the amount able to be produced and available on hand at any one time may vary. Also, there will always be minor differences between biologicals of the same product—for example, bone tissue from one donor will obviously not be exactly the same as bone tissue derived from another donor. The new part will require that all biologicals must meet certain standards and be manufactured according to good manufacturing processes and practice. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where a patient is critically ill and urgently requires a biological for treatment but none that conform to the requirements are available and no other approved therapeutic good is appropriate. This part will also provide that non-conforming biologicals can be used in such circumstances if, stringently, the patient’s doctor believes it is clinically necessary and the patient or their guardian consents. The decision to use non-conforming biologicals in exceptional circumstances would be made, as it is now, on a case-by-case basis by the doctor and the patient or their guardian.
It is important that this bill reflects the limited but critically important role for exceptional release. The bill provides that details for exceptional release will be set out in regulations. The requirements will be similar to those for access to unapproved medicines under category A of the current Special Access Scheme where patients are critically ill and no other approved therapeutic good is appropriate. Implementing the new arrangement proves the government is committed to making sure that sponsors and manufacturers of these products will be able to transition smoothly and easily to the regulatory arrangements so that the supply of biologicals to those who need them will not be affected.
As part of this commitment, the government has undertaken extensive consultation with the industry over the last 18 months, including explaining the proposed framework to sponsors and manufacturers, and setting out the steps they will need to take to comply with the framework. To further support the transition, the amendments in this bill establishing a framework will not commence until a date to be proclaimed within 12 months. This will ensure that the remaining consultation work on supporting details, such as the product-specific standards, can be finalised and in place to commence at the same time.
Schedule 1 also includes specific transitional provisions for any applications for inclusion of biologicals in the register as medicines or devices that are under consideration by the TGA at the time the new biological arrangements commence. Those biologicals will continue to be assessed as either medicines or devices, depending on which group they are currently regulated under. Where an application is approved, the biological will then be included in the register and moved to that part for biologicals. This will prevent applicants needing to make a new application or having the application assessment process being restarted or protracted as a result of the application being transferred for consideration by the biological assessment area. However, input into these applications is routinely provided by the biologicals assessors to ensure they meet the necessary standards. The existing arrangements in relation to advertising of therapeutic goods, review of decisions and other general provisions in the act will be applied to biologicals in the same way that they are for other therapeutic goods.
Through the cognate bill, associated amendments will also be made to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 to enable annual charges to be payable by sponsors to maintain the inclusion of their biological in the register. These charges apply to all therapeutic goods and reflect the work of the TGA to monitor products on an ongoing basis. The biologicals industry sector has waited for a long time for this new framework and has begun readying itself to implement the new arrangements.
Schedule 2 of this bill replaces a number of currently somewhat inconsistent provisions that indemnify the minister, the secretary and others acting as required under the act with a single provision. The schedule does this by including a new section in the act to provide that the Commonwealth, the minister, the secretary, the national manager of the TGA and others empowered or authorised to do certain things under the act can do so without fear that civil legal action can be taken against them for doing so, as long as they do not act in bad faith. This is consistent with Commonwealth legislation for a number of other regulatory agencies such as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 and others.
In other amendments under schedule 3 of the bill there will be provision for greater flexibility to recall specific batches of therapeutic goods where there are safety, quality, efficacy, presentation or performance concerns about any affected batches. Currently, in some cases where there are safety, quality, efficacy, presentation or performance concerns, the entire entry for a good must be suspended or cancelled in order to enable the recall of batches to occur. This approach is unnecessary and excessive in some circumstances where only a small number of batches are affected.
Consistent with the provisions included in the previous amendments, enabling information to be sought from a person who previously held a conformity assessment certificate for a medical device, schedule 4 of this bill enables information to be sought from people who previously had a medicine included in the register. Schedule 5 clarifies that unpaid annual charges are a debt due to the Commonwealth, to ensure that they are able to be recovered, as the TGA operates on a full cost recovery basis through the work it undertakes.
Finally, schedule 6 of the bill includes a number of minor amendments. These include providing that, where a person asks to vary the conditions of registration or listing for a medicine, the application for this must be accompanied by the relevant fee, to enable the TGA to assess and respond to the request. This will principally support postmarket monitoring of those medicines that are required to have an approved risk management plan as a condition of their registration and where the sponsor may wish to make a change to the agreed plan.
This schedule will also clarify what is meant by ‘new information’ in regard to reviews of decisions made under the act. So that now includes any information that a sponsor had at the time of the original decision but which was not provided to that decision maker. The amendments in this schedule support the minister or their delegate being provided with all pertinent information on which to make a decision, and remove a loophole that enabled such information to be withheld from that decision maker and lodged later for consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Further improvements to the therapeutic goods regulatory regime introduced to parliament today will further round out improvements which we had as a government implemented throughout 2009.
I would like to make some comments—and to put at rest the mind of the member for Boothby—about the ability of the TGA to use discretion and to have flexibility in some of those processes. I would like to relate an anecdote about some pragmatic approaches that were recently taken by the TGA with its administrative allies—in this case, Medicare—in having appropriate flexibility to make regulatory changes while still being stringent as to the use of certain medicines and medical products. Late last year I was approached by two Gold Coast City councillors, Councillor Donna Gates and Councillor Jan Grew, about major concerns for their communities over the effects of diabetes on eyesight and that a certain medication, Avastin—used for retinal vein occlusions and severe diabetic retinopathy—due to a classification of use, was not being provided for certain ophthalmic procedures or for other uses in cardiac cases and other uses.
After representations to our minister, and departmental discussions through the TGA, I am pleased to report to this House that the critical needs of diabetic patients have been recognised. The appropriate changes were made to secure the use of Avastin—and, by the way, at a much lower cost to the government—not only to provide critical sight-saving injections but at a much lower cost to taxpayers—in fact, at about a 20th of the cost. This, of course, affects the whole of Australia. This is, as I said, an example of the stringent but flexible approach that is appropriate when you are looking at some of the regulation.
I would like to read an email from a retinal surgeon about this very issue. It goes:
Dear Brett
Please see attached re reversal of the TGA/HIC’s decision re item number 42740 as it relates to intravitreal injection of numerous important sight saving injections (E.g. Avastin for retinal vein occlusions and severe diabetic retinopathy, Triamcinolone for inflammation, antibiotics for serious intraocular infections …
May I personally thank you for the great efforts that you have brought to bear with respect to this welcome decision.
My patients have literally lived through a very dark era in the history of eye health care in Australia and the reversal of the November 2008 decision by TGA/HIC is very welcome.
This had caused huge heartache for many and they are all glad that this era has passed.
Once again, many thanks for your help with this issue.
That is an example of that flexibility. I know that on both sides of the House we would be pleased at least to have legislation and a framework that allows certain decisions, particularly in the case of critical medical need, to be addressed in that way. So credit goes also to Councillors Gates and Grew from the Gold Coast City Council for bringing this issue forward for their community.
This bill provides a substantial raft of improvements for all people, for Beenleigh and for all the seats in that South-East Queensland region. As the member for Moncrieff well knows, we do work very well together in the Gold Coast region and I see myself as the government member representing that whole region of South-East Queensland. I thank the member for his interjections and his support for the work we do collectively. I know the member for Moncrieff would have been frustrated in those 12 years under the previous government at the lack of ability of the previous government to support South-East Queensland. I am glad to see him here in the chamber today supporting what I am doing as the federal member for Forde and working for the Gold Coast region.
On a serious note, it is clear that these councillors from the Gold Coast City Council brought forward an issue that has surfaced not only their community, which is my community, but every community in Australia. It is so important that governments, irrespective of their political flavour, understand the need for legislation and procedure that allows for these decisions that at the end of the day are very important for and critical to medical outcomes.
In conclusion, this bill provides a substantial raft of improvements to the act and the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia. Together with the wider regulatory reforms implemented last year, this bill will reinforce Australia’s international position as a leading therapeutic goods regulator. I therefore commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise and speak on the
Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009
and the
Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2009
that we have before us in the parliament today. As all members would know, the Rudd government is the government of health reform, be it in the total overhaul of the nation’s health system by the establishment of the National Health and Hospitals Network, be it in addressing the chronic work shortages that were addressed in
The
blame game
report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing which was commissioned by the previous government or be it in amending the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in the way it is being amended here today. The primary purpose of this amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act is to introduce a framework for the regulation of biologicals which is consistent with the regulation of therapeutic goods and medical devices under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This bill is part of the overall regulatory reform to the act undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA. We believe that this is important legislation that positions the Therapeutic Goods Act to benefit the people of Australia. This is the fourth bill that is being considered by the parliament.
In addition to the Therapeutic Goods Act amendment that we are debating today, the Rudd government has undertaken a large number of reforms to our health system. The first I touch on is the National Health and Hospitals Network reform that was announced by the Prime Minister at the National Press Club two weeks ago. It replaces eight separate health systems with the National Health and Hospitals Network combining all the hospitals and all GP and related services. It dedicates one-third of the GST revenue that currently goes to the states and territories so that the Commonwealth can make major financial changes to meet the needs of the Australian people. It is going to put in place small local hospital networks which will benefit the people of Australia.
This legislation is the result of the Rudd government listening to the people of Australia. They are acting on the recommendations made in
The
blame game
report after the inquiry on health funding. There were some significant and substantial recommendations made in that report but, unfortunately, they were not acted upon. The Rudd government has embraced that report and taken it a step further. The government has responded to
The
blame game
report. The National Health and Hospitals Network is an answer to the report commissioned by this parliament which was never acted upon when the opposition was in government. I believe it was the current Leader of the Opposition, who was the Minister for Health and Ageing at the time, who decided that he would ignore the recommendations of the report. This system will deliver 60 per cent of funding responsibilities for public hospitals. It will take over full responsibility for GP and related services provided outside hospitals and it will pay local hospital networks directly for each service.
Coming from an electorate like Shortland, I know the difficulties that have been experienced because of the chronic workforce shortage that existed and was allowed to escalate under the previous government. For 10 years in this parliament I have raised the issue of the workforce shortage with a series of health ministers, including the current Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister for health. No matter how often I spoke in the House and no matter how often I wrote to the then minister for health, my words were ignored. There was no response. There was no humanity shown by the previous government in addressing these issues that were so important to the Australian people and to the people in the Shortland electorate. When the opposition was in government I stood in this House and shared with members how people in the Shortland electorate would have to wait three weeks to get an appointment with their doctor. I have said in this House that a person was either dead or better by the time they could obtain an appointment with their doctor.
Chapter 4 of
The blame game
highlights that there is a critical workforce shortage. It makes recommendations, it identifies all the issues and it emphasises how important it is to address workforce issues in relation to GPs, allied health professionals and nurses. Unfortunately, for 12 long years nothing was done—and it has been said to me that it was going to happen in the 13th year! This week we have had some fantastic announcements that will go a long way to addressing the chronic shortage of doctors. The only thing I am upset about is that that shortage will not be able to be addressed tomorrow. It takes time to train new doctors. Whereas the previous government was reluctant to invest in the health of the Australian people, the Rudd government has shown it is fully supportive of ensuring that each and every Australian can obtain the health care they need. This week the Rudd government has announced $622 million to train a record number of new doctors, which will be welcomed in the electorate of Shortland and throughout Australia; $339 million to increase GP training places to record levels; $148 million to ensure that more junior doctors can experience a career in general practice—and I know that the doctors in the Shortland electorate will be very supportive of helping those doctors gain that experience and training; and $145 million to train more specialist doctors.
In addition to the issues that have been outlined, this bill implements a new framework for the regulation of biologicals; provides that civil legal proceedings cannot lie against Commonwealth staff members and others carrying out functions under the act; increases the flexibility of arrangements for the recall of goods to enable recalls of goods where there are concerns about safety; and enables information to be sought and clarified on unpaid charges.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—in reply—I thank members for their contributions to this debate, particularly the member for Shortland. As I mentioned in my second reading speech, the
Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009
amends the Therapeutics Goods Act 1999 in a number of ways. Firstly, and most importantly, it implements a new framework for the regulation of human cellular and tissue based therapy products, known as biologicals. Biologicals include such products as skin tissue for burn grafts and bone grafting. I discussed this in depth in my speech introducing the bill into the House, so I will just give a brief overview of the new arrangements.
Australia’s current regulatory arrangements are not well suited to regulating biologicals because they were developed for medicines and devices, which are quite different from biologicals, not least because of the variability inherent in biologicals. This means that many biologicals are currently required to be regulated as either a medicine or a device. As a result, biologicals are unable to be regulated based on their varying risk level. For example, unmanipulated skin tissue which is to be used for skin grafting poses a lower risk than highly processed cells that are to be used for a purpose that is not the same as their original use. Schedule 1 of the bill addresses this by providing that biologicals be regulated as a distinct group of therapeutic goods. It also enables these products to be placed into classes depending on their level of risk. The higher the class of biological, the higher the regulatory requirements that will need to be met to ensure the biological is safe, effective and of a high quality. This is as it should be.
Regulating biologicals as a distinct group will also bring Australia into line with other leading therapeutic goods regulatory agencies around the world, including the USA, Canada and the EU. The bill also adapts and applies to biologicals the broad overarching regulatory principles that apply to other therapeutic goods. The offence and civil penalty provisions are consistent with those for other therapeutic goods. They need to be; otherwise, there is potential that sponsors will characterise their therapeutic good as a medicine, device or biological, depending on which would provide the most lenient penalties. Therefore it is essential that the bar be set at the same level for all therapeutic goods.
A key feature of the new part 3-2A for biologicals to be inserted into the Therapeutic Goods Act by this bill is a provision to enable the exceptional release of biologicals that do not meet the standards where there are no conforming biologicals or approved therapeutic goods available or that would be appropriate where a patient is critically ill and requires urgent treatment. The regulations will set out rigorous requirements that must be met before the biological can be used under exceptional release, and will require that the patient or their guardian be fully informed and give consent. Exceptional release is not a new practice; it has been used by doctors in Australia previously—such as during the Bali bombings in 2002 to treat badly burned patients when sufficient conforming skin tissue for grafts was not available. The bill better regulates this practice to ensure the safety of patients. The new arrangements for biologicals will be implemented over a period of three years. The biologicals industry is aware of this and has been awaiting these changes for some years now.
Other amendments in the bill include consolidating the existing immunity provisions in the act into a single provision to ensure that civil legal action cannot be taken against a person acting under the act unless they do so in bad faith; enabling specific batches of therapeutic goods to be recalled without the need first to suspend or cancel the entire entry of the good in the register if there are concerns about the safety, quality, efficacy, performance or presentation, but only for limited batches; enabling information to be sought from past sponsors of medicines; providing that unpaid annual charges to keep a therapeutic good on the register are debts due to the Commonwealth to enable these to be recovered; and other minor amendments.
The member for Boothby raised a couple of questions in relation to this bill which I will take a few moments to respond to. Firstly, the member for Boothby raised some questions about biologicals custom-made by doctors for their patients and the degree to which, if at all, this bill would impact on that. I can advise the House that, as with other therapeutic goods, medical practitioners will continue to be able to exercise their clinical judgment and custom make biologicals for their patients on an individual patient basis.
As noted by the opposition, regulations will be developed for this bill and these will provide details for implementation of the biologicals framework. Among these regulations will be exemptions for medical practitioners from biological regulatory requirements. Consultation on these draft regulations will occur and the input of medical practitioners obviously will be welcome.
The second point raised by the member for Boothby concerns patients’ own biologicals which, I am advised, are called autologous biologicals. The second issue raised by the opposition was that of use of a patient’s own cells or tissues for reimplantation—known, as I said, as autologous biologicals. These autologous biologicals will not be regulated under the framework introduced under this bill. This practice is currently not regulated by the TGA under the act and this exemption will continue under the new biologicals framework implemented by this bill.
As indicated in the second reading speech, the changes made by this bill do not encompass all the reforms the government intends to make to the therapeutic goods regulatory regime. The amendments in this bill are the fourth instalment in an ongoing program of reform to the act. Australia has been served well by the TGA in the past and it is important that the regulatory regime the TGA administers is kept up to date so that the TGA and the industry it regulates can operate as efficiently as possible and so that Australian consumers can continue to have timely access to safe and effective therapeutic goods.
Before concluding, I table a minor correction to the explanatory memorandum for these bills. Page 4 of the document has been updated by removing the reference to specific companies and organisations as being involved in the manufacture of HCTs. I commend the bill to the House.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I move:
That the requested amendments be made.
This is the return to this House of the student income support legislation. We are now in a position to secure passage of this piece of legislation today, which is good news. It is good news for university students and their families who have been waiting anxiously for the outcome of this bill. It is good news for the 150,000 students who will now receive student start-up scholarships. It is good news for the 100,000 students who will receive youth allowance for the first time or more youth allowance. It is good news for students in country Australia because the old system of student income support was one in which the participation rate of country kids was going down.
I would like to thank those who have played a constructive role in ensuring passage of this bill. First, I would like to thank members of the government backbench who have worked with me, reflecting the views of their community to me about the contents of this bill. I would like to thank the three Independents in the House of Representatives. Each of them represents a rural constituency and each of them worked with the government to secure passage of this bill because they understand what is good for country students. I would like to thank the Greens and Senator Nick Xenophon. At all stages, they have been honest and straightforward in their dealings with the government. They have been clear on their objectives. They have been prepared to work with us constructively.
Had the opposition taken a comparable approach then passage of this bill could have been secured at the end of last year, avoiding these many months of uncertainty and delay. However, finally, in the last sitting fortnight before we adjourn prior to the budget session, the opposition have managed to do something constructive. I thank the shadow minister for abandoning the opposition’s absurd amendments, where they sought to spend an extra billion dollars on student income support—a billion dollars they never saw fit to expend on student income support over 12 long years in government. I thank the shadow minister for abandoning a proposition which would have meant that a student from the home of a multimillion dollar family could have accessed full youth allowance if they had chosen to move from Melbourne to Brisbane to study. This was the original proposition of the opposition, costing more than a billion dollars.
Finally, after all of these months of delay, that proposition has been abandoned in favour of the following very limited proposition which cost something less than $100 million. This limited proposition is that students who come from the outer regional Australia, remote Australia or very remote Australia classifications under the Australian Standard Geographical Classification index and whose parents’ income is less than $150,000 per annum will be able to access the old independence test criteria. This is a proposition for change that applies to around 1,900 students around the country.
Delay is bad enough but, despite the opposition having entered into an arrangement with the government to deliver this bill, today we have seen unnecessary continued politicking from the opposition, who have always been more concerned about the politics of this than the outcome for students. Despite having entered an arrangement with the government that this new change would apply to students in outer regional Australia, remote Australia or very remote Australia, today the opposition have gone through the farce of moving amendments in the Senate they up-front said they would never insist on to play politics with other country areas. This is a disgraceful thing to do.
The final disgraceful thing done by the opposition is that they have now campaigned up and down the length and breadth of the country promising an extra billion dollars for student income support but, as the shadow minister has made clear, in government they have no intention of delivering it. Their only promise to Australian students is a review. It would have been better for the opposition to have taken a straightforward approach
(Extension of time granted)
and this could have been achieved last year. I will conclude in one minute’s time and then I understand the shadow minister will take equal time and we will be able to dispose of this matter before question time.
—No, I want to speak on it too.
—Well, we will not dispose of it before question time and we can have an extensive debate if you like.
I conclude with the following. I say to the students of places like Shepparton, places where the opposition went and campaigned, understand this: the proposition agreed to by the opposition does not change youth allowance arrangements for you. The amendments being moved by the opposition today that apply to places like Shepparton are amendments that they up-front said to the government today that they would not insist on—that is, they are a pure piece of political theatre. And the opposition are not saying to those students in places like Shepparton that if they are elected as the government they will provide youth allowance under the old independence criteria to those students. They are providing them with a review.
Argy-bargy between politicians is one thing, but this is cruel expectation-raising around the country, only to then abandon those students, to move theatrical amendments they know that they are not going to insist on, to abandon them now and to abandon them as a matter of substance, because the opposition will not go to the next election promising those students extra money. This has been a cruel exercise in delay and ultimately it is a cruel exercise in substance from the opposition because they have raised the expectation of those students and their families. The opposition will do nothing today and, if they are ever elected as government, they will do nothing then to actually assist those students. I am not sure that the National Party leader actually understands this, but that is precisely what his shadow minister has agreed to. With those words I say: let us get this done and get some money into the hands of students, which is where it always should have been and could have been at the end of last year had the opposition taken a more responsible approach.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—In May last year the opposition first raised its very real concerns about the government’s reforms to youth allowance and the Commonwealth scholarships, which subsequently became a problem because of the mishandling of this matter by the Minister for Education in abolishing the Commonwealth scholarships before she had replaced them with the new scholarships. We raised these problems in May, we raised them throughout the last calendar year, and right through to the end of the year the minister refused to negotiate with the opposition. I think this was under the misapprehension that somehow the opposition was not committed to its decision and its position of supporting rural and regional students in particular and removing retrospectivity as a fundamental principle.
We did stick to our guns throughout the entire year. The minister refused to discuss this with us, in spite of the many offers I made to meet with her. I told her my door was open and I would be happy to speak to her last year between about August and December. At no stage did the minister make any effort at all to speak to the opposition. That is why we are still here, in March, with students missing out on their scholarships and missing out on their improved youth allowance. It is because the government did not negotiate. We asked for three things. We asked for all retrospectivity to be removed from this bill. We asked for a pathway to higher education to be included in this legislation for people from rural, regional and remote Australia, who are already a disadvantaged group in terms of higher education and would have been more disadvantaged by the government’s changes. We also proposed a savings measure to pay for those amendments that was to reduce the start-up scholarships by whatever cost was necessary in order for this change to be budget-neutral. In February the minister said that that was impossible. All of those changes were utterly impossible. They were out of the question; they simply could not be done.
Something changed between February and March—it might perhaps have been the new interest and heightened view of the Deputy Prime Minister as the replacement for the Prime Minister—and in March this year the minister decided that in fact these seemingly impossible changes were all utterly doable. We met twice last week and got impossible changes apparently accepted and now doable. As a consequence, this bill has been amended in the Senate to remove all retrospectivity and to ensure that there is a pathway to higher education for students from rural, remote and regional Australia in three of the categories that the ABS uses to determine remoteness, and we believe the government could have gone further and should have gone further. We have committed, if we are elected at the end of this year, to reviewing the entire youth allowance from the ground up to ensure that there is a proper pathway for students from regional areas. The coalition achieved this—not the member for Flynn, not the member for Dawson, not the member for Braddon, not the member for Capricornia, not the member for Bendigo, not the member for Ballarat, not the member for Leichhardt. None of the Labor members stood up for their constituents.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—by leave—I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 15 March 2010, namely: a vehicle storage facility near the Parliament House Loading Dock.
This motion is seeking the approval of the parliament to construct a vehicle storage facility near the entrance to the Parliament House loading dock. The loading dock is located under the formal gardens east of the House of Representatives entrance. The facility will be a modern garage design with wooden cladding complementary to the other buildings in the precinct. The construction of the new facility is required so as to free up space in the loading dock area to accommodate a new mail screening facility.
There are strong health and safety reasons why this new mail screening facility is required. Security operations staff provide screening and handling of all mail and parcels delivered to Parliament House. The existing facility is too small and is separate from the decontamination facility. This means that if a suspect mail item is identified it has to be carried by staff to the decontamination facility thereby risking the release of contaminants throughout the loading dock. This puts staff at risk and requires the operations of the loading dock to be shut down, often for several hours. The mail screening task is potentially hazardous and the Department of Parliamentary Services wishes to provide maximum safety for its staff. Construction of the new mail room is planned for this year.
The Department of Parliamentary Services is proceeding with the design of the vehicle storage facility while taking into consideration the heritage values of the national iconic building and precinct. The National Capital Authority has been consulted in planning this facility and has endorsed the plan. It is intended that the works will be undertaken by June 2010. The estimated cost of the design and construction of the vehicle storage facility is $205,000. The total project cost will be met by the Department of Parliamentary Services through administered funding.
Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precinct and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is responsible for other works in the Parliamentary Zone. Accordingly, I am moving this motion on behalf of the Speaker and the President. I have also had discussions with the Manager of Opposition Business and, as I indicated to the representative of the Department of Parliamentary services yesterday, I believe that there is a need for increased scrutiny of proposals which become before this parliament which would result in expenditure by the parliament.
The concerns of a number of members, senators, staff and Comcar drivers have been raised with me as the Leader of the House. These concerns are about some of the resultant work on the road which circles this building. I think that it is appropriate, and I have suggested to the Manager of Opposition Business, that he and I should avail ourselves of briefings before motions are moved before this House so that we can ascertain exactly what spending is required and exactly what the resultant work will be. The Manager of Opposition Business has accepted this invitation and I intend to provide that scrutiny in the future. Mr Speaker, you will be pleased to know that the department has accepted that that process needs to be improved in the future.
—Whilst I cannot enter into a debate that has been carried out by interjection, I am more than pleased that in future, as representatives of the House, and in the absence of another appropriate committee of the House, briefings will be given to the Leader of the House and to the Manager of Opposition Business. I would say to the three Independents that, if they wish to be included in these processes, I would ensure that that is carried out as well. I emphasise that I am happy for that to happen, but I stress that, unlike the Senate, we do not have an appropriate body such as the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing where I would be delighted if these things were thrashed out.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—by leave—I wish to update the House on the situation in Sri Lanka since my last report to the House in September last year.
In particular, I wish to update the House on the ongoing political and humanitarian challenges facing Sri Lanka and Australia’s strengthened financial and diplomatic support for the people of Sri Lanka to help Sri Lanka meet these challenges.
I highlight some recent progress on resettling internally displaced civilians which is an enormous task.
I underscore Australia’s longstanding bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, underpinned by substantial people-to-people links. Our bilateral cooperation continues to expand in important areas, including combating people-smuggling and human trafficking. Addressing transnational issues such as these is important, not only to Sri Lanka and Australia but also to our region.
I do so at a time when President Mahinda Rajapaksa has recently been re-elected, following Sri Lanka’s first nationwide election after over two decades of conflict and at a time when Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary elections on 8 April.
Political challenges
As I said in my statement to the parliament in September last year, the military victory in Sri Lanka has changed the situation on the ground irrevocably.
During my visit to Sri Lanka in November last year, I urged the Sri Lankan government to win the peace, after decades long military conflict, by forging an enduring political settlement for all Sri Lankans.
I acknowledged that this would not be easy. Nor would it occur overnight. It would come only after a process of political reform and rapprochement between all parties and communities. While the outside world could help in practical ways, the solution needed to come from within Sri Lanka, from the people of Sri Lanka.
The re-elected Sri Lankan government has both a special responsibility and a special opportunity to use its second term to promote the political freedoms and the reforms, including the empowerment of minority communities, which will enable all citizens to have a stake in the country’s future. Australia believes that Sri Lanka’s democracy, its rule of law and its national security would be enhanced by a stronger civil society and an independent and free media. Such freedoms could enhance Sri Lanka’s prospects for lasting reconciliation.
Another crucial part of the reconciliation and peace-building process is the proper conduct of elections. In this regard, it is notable that polling for the presidential election proceeded reasonably peacefully in most areas. There were, however, reports of violence and possible violations of election law in the lead-up to and following the presidential election. As we approach the 8 April parliamentary elections, Australia urges the government of Sri Lanka and its civil institutions to ensure that there are credible investigations into past election incidents and measures are put in place to prevent similar problems arising again.
As members would be aware, the former army chief and presidential candidate, General Fonseka, was taken into detention on 8 February and faces charges of undertaking political activities while still in the military and violating military procurement guidelines. General Fonseka was brought before a military court at navy headquarters on 16 March and is due to appear again today. General Fonseka is challenging the legality of his detention through Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court. The international community, including Australia, has been and is watching these developments closely. Australia has underlined the importance of General Fonseka and his supporters being treated fairly and transparently in accordance with Sri Lankan law.
Decades of civil war have impacted terribly and adversely on Sri Lankan civilians. Australia made repeated calls during the conflict, and since, for all parties to make the welfare and protection of civilians the absolute priority, and for international law to be respected. Australia has called on the Sri Lankan government to investigate allegations of human rights violations and violations of international law. Proper and transparent investigation of these allegations is an important step towards reconciliation. Australia welcomed the announcement by the Sri Lankan government on 26 October last year that it would establish an expert committee to investigate allegations contained in the United States State Department’s
Report to congress on incidents during the recent conflict in Sri Lanka. The deadline for the committee’s report was extended from 31 December last year to 30 April this year. It is important that the expert committee moves more quickly to progress its investigations and implement its findings. We look forward to the committee’s report, by 30 April 2010.
I welcome President Rajapaksa’s re-election statement on 27 January in which he committed to govern for all Sri Lankans, to build on the peace already achieved and move forward on a reconciliation program.
Others have indicated a willingness to explore options for reconciliation and long-term stability. The Tamil National Alliance said in its platform for parliamentary elections that it would accept a ‘federal structure’ in the north-east. Obviously this is a sensitive political issue for Sri Lankans to resolve.
Australia encourages all political voices in Sri Lanka to engage together in a sincere process to achieve lasting political reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
Humanitarian challenges
Following my visit to Sri Lanka on 9 and 10 November last year, the first by an Australian foreign minister since 2004, it was very clear that the humanitarian task facing Sri Lanka was immense. Australia has been a close observer of the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka both during the recent intensified fighting and since the end of the military conflict in May last year. Throughout, Australia has stressed the need to make the welfare of civilians an absolute priority.
Australia held concerns about the camps for internally displaced people and we put these concerns directly to the Sri Lankan government at the time, calling for freedom of movement for displaced persons and management of the camps in accordance with international humanitarian standards. My discussions with the Sri Lankan government in November, including with President Rajapaksa and foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama, revealed that progress had been made in tackling the challenging task of resettling hundreds of thousands of displaced citizens and rehabilitating their communities. However, for several reasons—including the scale of the resettlement task—the Sri Lankan government was not able to meet its self-imposed deadline of 31 January for completing the return of all internally displaced people to their place of origin.
This process is continuing. Of the nearly 300,000 civilians displaced by the conflict, over 185,000 have been released and are living either in their own homes or—in greater numbers—with host families. Living conditions in the 12 remaining camps, which now house over 90,000 internally displaced people, continue to be difficult but reduced numbers have relieved the problem of overcrowding. Efforts are being made to meet the basic needs of people still in these camps and essential services are being provided.
During my November visit to Colombo, I discussed with the Sri Lankan government the importance of freedom of movement for all internally displaced civilians. Accordingly, Australia welcomed the Sri Lankan government’s announcement on 1 December last year which allowed freer movement for people in the camps. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of that decision to travel outside the camps.
Many of these civilians and those recently resettled have suffered immensely through decades of conflict which has resulted in significant trauma for many Sri Lankans. In addition to the situation in the camps and the resettlement areas, we remain watchful of the conditions for over 10,000 individuals who have been separated from the civilian population and held in detention as ex-combatants. We urge the Sri Lankan government to regularise the legal status of this group and afford international agencies access to those so held in detention.
Enhanced diplomatic efforts
Australia has adopted an enhanced diplomatic and humanitarian effort to help Sri Lanka address the challenges of recovery from over two decades of civil war. On 2 November 2009,
the Prime Minister announced the appointment of Mr John McCarthy as Australia’s special representative to Sri Lanka. Mr McCarthy’s role has reinforced the messages that I and Australia’s high commissioner in Colombo have put to the Sri Lankan government on the importance of—and Australia’s support for—stabilisation and resettlement of internally displaced civilians within Sri Lanka.
Special Representative McCarthy has also engaged with the international community widely on the challenges faced by Sri Lanka.
He has been consulting extensively
on the importance of supporting reconstruction and rehabilitation programs in the north of the country. These programs are important both for humanitarian reasons and for laying the foundations of lasting peace.
Mr McCarthy visited Colombo with me in November and has just completed a further visit to Sri Lanka this month, where he met President Rajapaksa. During this February visit, Mr McCarthy was also able to travel north with our high commissioner to the
Jaffna peninsula where they visited camps for internally displaced civilians and resettlement areas, and met local government and community leaders.
In a number of discussions overseas, both in the corridors of international meetings and bilateral visits, including in London in January and in New Delhi in March, I underlined the importance of international support to assist Sri Lanka meet its challenges.
Humanitarian assistance
Australia continues to respond generously to the humanitarian challenges facing Sri Lanka. Our aid program is targeted to meet the needs of displaced civilians, their resettlement and the rehabilitation of their communities. Our aid efforts in the camps are focused on the wellbeing of internally displaced people, and not on the camps being a long-term settlement option.
The proper, transparent and compassionate treatment of those citizens of the north and east will be important for post-conflict reconciliation in Sri Lanka. It is for this reason that Australia continues to advocate resettlement of all remaining displaced persons in safe and dignified conditions as soon as possible. Australian officials in Sri Lanka are working closely with central and local government authorities and community groups to determine how best Australia can continue to address the needs of the displaced, and support their resettlement and rehabilitation. A senior AusAID official visited resettlement areas in northern Sri Lanka in late February for this purpose.
In many cases resettlement areas have been badly affected by the conflict. There are impassable roads, destroyed houses and a lack of potable water. Infrastructure, including schools and health facilities, is damaged or non-existent. Large swathes of agricultural land are as yet unusable and tools to restart livelihoods are scarce. In addition, there is the ever-present danger of landmines and unexploded ordnance.
Demining is an essential first step to allow people to return home and rebuild their lives. For this reason, Australia has already announced its commitment to provide up to $20 million for demining over the next five years to ensure that the northern part of Sri Lanka can be made safe for resettlement.
Aid announcement
In November 2009 following my visit to Sri Lanka I informed the House that Australia was looking favourably to assisting both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank on their reconstruction projects in the north and in the east. In Singapore in the margins of APEC I had a conversation with Mr Zoellick, the Executive Director of the World Bank, indicating Australia’s in-principle support for those reconstruction efforts so far as the World Bank is concerned.
Today I announced that Australia will provide an additional $20 million in targeted assistance for Sri Lanka. This support will be delivered through international organisations who are making a practical contribution to stabilisation efforts. It is focused on enabling people to return to their homes and communities and to re-establish the economic and social infrastructure required for recovery.
Twelve million dollars will be provided to the World Bank to co-finance the World Bank’s emergency northern reconstruction project. Over an 18-month period, the World Bank project plans to help over 100,000 displaced people by providing cash grants, raising standards of living and rebuilding essential community infrastructure. Australian funding will go directly to resettling families, allowing them to regain some control over their own lives and to start repairing their houses and clearing their fields and wells. Our assistance will also provide seeds and essential farming and fishing implements to improve food security.
Eight million dollars will be provided to co-finance the Asian Development Bank’s north-east community restoration and development project. This project aims to rapidly improve living conditions by restoring basic social infrastructure including critical health facilities and schools. It will restore village roads, provide irrigation and water supply schemes and restore electricity supplies. It will give priority to districts affected by conflict including parts of Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi.
The assistance I am announcing today builds on Australia’s existing support for housing to enable internally displaced people to be resettled more quickly. Large-scale damage to basic housing infrastructure in the north remains a critical challenge, with the total number of houses damaged or destroyed reported to exceed 230,000. This announcement and support follows on from the $3 million Australia provided in November 2009 to UN Habitat to provide cash grants to affected families for quick repairs and longer term reconstruction of housing, as well as restoring land titles.
Bilateral relationship
Sri Lanka is important to Australia. Sri Lanka and Australia share strong bilateral relations, built on our shared Commonwealth membership, as well as links in trade and investment, defence, education, sport, culture and development cooperation. The people-to-people links between Australia and Sri Lanka are strong with around 100,000 people of Sri Lankan extraction now living in Australia, contributing to all aspects of our society.
The opportunity now exists for the Sri Lankan diaspora to play a constructive role in promoting the conditions for sustainable peace. I urge the diaspora to look forward and work in positive ways to help communities inside Sri Lanka realise a peaceful future for themselves. Australia is committed to working with Sri Lanka to help address the serious challenges facing today’s world, including counterterrorism and people smuggling, climate change and organised transnational crime. Such issues require global solutions and Australia is firmly committed to supporting and enhancing the vital role of multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, in meeting these challenges.
People smuggling is an issue that affects our entire region, not just Australia. We are working more closely than ever before with international organisations, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and with regional partners to combat this issue, through such groupings as the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. People smuggling remains a high-priority transnational issue for source, transit and destination countries in our region, including Australia and Sri Lanka.
People smugglers and people-smuggling syndicates work without regard for human safety or national legal frameworks. Australia is working together with Sri Lanka to address people smuggling. In a joint ministerial statement I issued with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister on 9 November 2009, Australia and Sri Lanka reaffirmed our continuing commitment to work together to combat people smuggling and related organised criminal activities, including enhancing cooperation to bring to justice the criminal organisers of the people smuggling trade, taking a leading role to promote regional cooperation to act against transnational people-smuggling networks and undertaking a public information campaign to alert Sri Lankan citizens to the dangers of maritime people smuggling.
We acknowledged our ongoing constructive bilateral cooperation between key domestic operational agencies and underlined our commitment to work together in practical ways to address people smuggling issues in a cooperative and comprehensive manner.
Conclusion
Mr Speaker, Sri Lanka is emerging from a long period of conflict and insecurity towards greater stability. With new presidential and parliamentary terms soon to begin, now more than ever is the time to forge a new beginning for all its citizens and take forward national reconciliation and lasting peace.
As a long-time friend, Australia has been, and will continue to be, committed to working with Sri Lanka to build a peaceful and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—In rising to respond to the ministerial statement on Sri Lanka I acknowledge the further assistance to Sri Lanka announced today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is important that our aid effort be focused on our region and that it be targeted and delivered in the most cost-effective way to ensure value for money for the benefit of the aid recipients and the Australian taxpayer.
Sri Lanka is emerging from arguably the darkest chapter in its history since independence in 1948. The people of Sri Lanka have suffered terribly through a civil war in the decades since 1976, culminating in the final confrontation that led to the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May last year. The events which followed that military defeat raised international concerns as hundreds of thousands of Tamil people were held in camps. A decision to prevent access to the camps for humanitarian workers from NGOs raised further concerns in the international community. The situation in Sri Lanka was further complicated by allegations of war crimes and the decision of Sri Lanka’s top military officer, General Sarath Fonseka, to resign from the military late last year and contest the January presidential election against the incumbent president. General Fonseka was unsuccessful at the election. He was arrested and is currently facing courts-martial for alleged violations of military law. The government has been accused of conducting a campaign of persecution against General Fonseka, raising further concerns about political freedom and democracy in Sri Lanka.
Without seeking to pass judgment on the government of Sri Lanka, it is my wish and the wish of most people around the world that Sri Lanka find a path to sustained peace and prosperity. Sri Lankans share the aspirations of most people in most nations, wanting their government to provide a safe and secure environment in which they can raise their families and live their lives in safety. Having won the war against the LTTE, it is important that the Sri Lankan government win the peace. It is vital that international standards for human rights be maintained as Sri Lanka continues its transition to a post-conflict society.
I note the European Union withdrew Sri Lanka’s trade privileges last month due to concerns about what it described as ‘significant shortcomings’ on human rights issues. However, overnight a spokesperson has said that the European Union is committed to working with Sri Lanka to see whether the conditions for a reversal are in place. A high-level delegation from Sri Lanka visited Brussels this week, with further meetings scheduled which will hopefully prove to be a constructive exercise. It is also worth noting that the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, had proposed to establish an advisory council to investigate ways of holding accountable the alleged perpetrators of human rights violations during the final days of the battle against the LTTE. In recent days, a spokesperson for the Secretary-General has said that Ban Ki-moon is still discussing the idea of a panel of experts to investigate alleged war crimes and that ‘it is unlikely such a panel will be established very soon’.
It has also been reported that the 118 nations of the Non-Aligned Movement wrote to the Secretary-General, expressing concern about such an investigation. There is a difficult balancing act for the international community in that anyone who has committed crimes against humanity or war crimes should be held to account for their actions. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that actions by the international community do not cause further internal turmoil within Sri Lanka and do nothing to undermine efforts to develop a sustainable peace on the island. It is vital that the seeds for long-lasting peace be sown from the current situation and that it does not sow the seeds for a return to violence. There can only be a political solution to the tensions in Sri Lanka—a negotiated solution that accommodates the reasonable concerns of all parties.
One positive development is the recent report from the Tamil National Alliance, which was regarded as the political wing of the LTTE, calling for a new federal structure that provides Tamils with a level of independence under the umbrella of the Sri Lankan national government. This is a major step forward, as the TNA had previously supported the establishment of a separate Tamil homeland. A report has said that the TNA wants a negotiated solution and its leader has effectively renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals. The Sri Lankan government has assured the international community that it is working on a political solution and that time is needed to obtain a consensus. The President of Sri Lanka, in his speech declaring victory over the LTTE, spoke of the need to end ethnic and religious conflict and promised a home-grown solution to this conflict. The coalition in Australia welcomes recent reports that 185,000 people have just been released from the camps and allowed to return to their homes. While this is a positive development, it is vital that the process of release and resettlement be completed as quickly as possible.
The sooner that people are able to return to their homes and start to rebuild their lives, the sooner that steps can be taken to rebuild trust and respect between all communities in Sri Lanka. That process has begun, according to respected analyst Sergei DeSilva-Ranasinghe, who wrote in a recent report of Future Directions International:
The defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam in May 2009 has given vital democratic space for previously suppressed and sidelined Tamil political parties to meaningfully engage in the democratic process. As such, the political landscape for Tamils has changed dramatically over the last six months in particular, which has seen a new energy and optimism emerge among Tamil leaders in Sri Lanka eager to make headway in restoring normality and rebuilding their society.
Mr DeSilva-Ranasinghe went on to say:
Although the Sri Lankan Lankan government remained overly cautious after the defeat of the LTTE, it steadily relaxed its security posture, which was first demonstrated in May 2009, when it launched a major recruitment drive to recruit 2,000 Tamil speaking police constables in the Eastern Province.
He wrote that the previous atmosphere of tension had dissipated and had been replaced by a vitality and energy that brought great hope for a longer lasting peace. While it is not possible to form an independent view of the situation on the ground without visiting the region, these reports are greatly encouraging. If accurate, there appears to be much greater hope that future tensions between ethnic groups in Sri Lanka will be solved at the ballot box and not through the use of violence.
I also note that in the minister’s statement to this House he said that the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka had changed irrevocably since the military defeat of the LTTE. That is welcome news, as it would indicate that there will be a lessening of pressure on Australia’s borders through the people-smuggling trade in people from Sri Lanka. Given that the government has consistently claimed that push factors are driving the surge in boat people to Australia through the people-smuggling trade, I would hope that there will be an assurance from the government that the number of asylum seekers will drop.
Australians are rightly concerned that the almost daily arrival of boats, many from Sri Lanka, continues the massive surge in unauthorised arrivals under Labor which will end up costing Australians more than $1 billion. The Rudd government has already admitted to a $132 million blow-out in the cost of processing boat arrivals on Christmas Island this financial year plus another $34 million to increase the number of beds on Christmas Island because the government had predicted only 200 people would arrive illegally by boat this financial year, a massive underestimation which ignored the pull factor of the government’s weakening of our border protection laws. So far this financial year, over 3,000 people have arrived by boat and, even on a conservative estimate, by the end of July the Rudd government will be forced to spend an extra $230 million to deal with the sustained surge in arrivals under its failed policies.
As the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship pointed out recently, the Rudd government is currently planning on spending only $130 million per year over the next three years. Based on this year’s expected cost blow-outs, it will have to upgrade these estimates by an extra $300 million each year. Over four years, including 2009-10, this will leave Australians with an additional bill of over $1 billion in immigration costs alone because of the government’s failed immigration policies and the weakening of the coalition’s strong border protection regime. So we anticipate that at some point the government will reflect the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and revisit its estimates of likely boat arrivals, including from Sri Lanka, given the changing political environment there.
I have spoken previously in this House on the efforts of the member for Canning who, as chair for a number of years and now Deputy Chair of the Australia-Sri Lanka Parliamentary Friendship Group, has played a major role in building greater understanding between our two nations. The member for Canning has long recognised that personal relationships between Australians and Sri Lankans underpin strong diplomatic, cultural and economic relations. Australia, as a friend of Sri Lanka, will continue to support efforts at building peace and greater prosperity.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Sri Lanka</title>,Ministerial Statements,23,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2010-03-17,"—I thank the House for the unanimous way in which they have supported the agricultural sector by rising to their feet. The point of today’s matter of public importance, which is about the future of agriculture in Australia, is not designed to take political issue on various policy points, as we normally do—or some do—in this place. The overlying reason for bringing this issue to the parliament is that there are a number of issues out there that are sending conflicting messages to the agricultural sector. We really need a debate—some sort of strategic plan, a white paper or an arrangement—that will take the lid off the farm sector within Australia and ask the Australian people: do we need agriculture? If so, why? If we do—
—We have to feed ourselves.
—I am a farmer, as is the member for Barker, who is barking away up there, and I have personal views. But I do believe that in some of the policy issues that have been in the parliamentary sector, both state and federal, for probably the last couple of decades there are very subtle—and in some cases not so subtle—messages being sent to the farm sector, the agricultural community, that we are not needed. It is a question that we really have to take some cognisance of: do we want it, and why? Obviously, food production is important. We all eat. Our agricultural sector exports 80 per cent of what we produce to other countries who presumably need to eat and some of whom do not have much in the way of finance to pay for that food. In those negotiations, quite often the price of the product that we grow and sell is very close or below the cost of production. So in a sense we are an export nation.
I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who has just arrived, for being here. Being an export nation and relying on exports for a great deal of our income, we need to overproduce and send those products to other countries. There are a range of issues where policy is actually on a collision course, and there were some real insights into some of the points of collision during the climate change debate that recently took place. That debate is, of course, still taking place. We are told that we need agriculture in this country because we need to produce food. We need to produce food, particularly in the long term, because the globe’s population is growing. Every time we produce a surplus in this country we face what are essentially corrupt world markets, and then we have a domestic cost structure which does not reflect the nature of our export economy. So we have the worst of both worlds: a corrupt export arrangement and, at home, an artificial cost structure that affects our capacity to make those export opportunities profitable.
The climate change debate has raised a number of issues. It is suggested that carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are concerns in terms of global warming. When we look at the role of land use there are certain positives and negatives. The minister would be well aware of some of these issues. We are told there are potential negatives in terms of methane. We are told there are potential negatives in terms of the use of fossil fuels in the agricultural sector. We are told that the transport sector is a major emitter. When we look at agriculture in this country, particularly but not only in the grains industries, we see that we export most of what we produce to other countries. Then we exchange most of those export dollars for fossil fuels which we bring back to this country.
So, in a carbon economy, we are doing two negatives. In the grains industry we produce a product—for instance, wheat, which contains starch, a carbon—which is needed for the food business. We transport that to the seaport, we put it on boats, we transport it overseas—so we are actually shipping carbon—and then we sell that product. Occasionally we have to bribe an Arab to be able to unload that particular commodity. Then we bring back a fossil fuel, which is carbon again. In a carbon economy, what role do the minister and others see agriculture playing? What are the negatives in terms of the export arrangements that we currently believe in, or is Australia badly placed in terms of distance if a carbon economy is to come into play? There are a number of issues there that need to be addressed.
We are told that we need land for food production. As I said, 80 per cent of what we produce is exported, so we are at the behest of other people, not the domestic market. We are told that land should be utilised in that capacity most of the time. But what if it were not? What if, in a carbon world, we were actually to plant trees? In fact, there was an incentive built into the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to shift land use away from food and towards trees. What if we went to second generation biofuels with, for instance, a deep-rooted, annually harvested plant such as switchgrass, which was the original grass on the prairies of the United States before the Corn Belt was developed? That particular plant has the capacity to produce biomass for second generation biofuels. It has the capacity to grow with very little nitrogen input, so it ticks a box in terms of nitrous oxide. It has the capacity to sequester carbon at depth, which is one of the problems in the accumulation of soil carbon. So why would we not, in a carbon economy, promote some of these non-food activities in terms of the surplus that we produce?
We have this policy conundrum, and it varies depending on which portfolio we actually look at. In my view we are not doing very well in the water portfolio, given the negotiations that are taking place between the Murray-Darling people and the people on the ground who use water and have allocations within the Murray-Darling system. We are told that we will have to use less water because of so-called climate change. But, when it is suggested that perhaps there are ways of bringing water into the system to compensate for the human induced climate change component of the loss of water in the Murray-Darling system, that is scoffed at as being in breach of nature. We are told that parts of Queensland will get more water because of human induced climate change and that the southern parts of Australia will get less, but rectifying both of those issues is deemed as being, still, interference with nature. In my view, it is not.
So the land use debate becomes a fairly significant debate. Do we use farmland to produce food or do we use it in the most economic way in terms of a carbon economy? If we went down the carbon economy route we might well not use much of our land for food production at all. Rather than growing grain to export and exchange for fuel, we may end up growing biomass for fuel, using it within our nation and ticking a lot of the boxes in current climate change policy that relate to agriculture being included globally in any sort of future emissions trading scheme.
The other issues I would like to raise relate to a report that came out only yesterday from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, of which I am a member, entitled
Farming the future: The role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. There is a need for much more research into soil science. Soil science—the capacity to know what our soils are doing, how soils are responding to various treatments of infiltration and the effect of the accumulation of the humus and organic matter in soils and soil carbon—is being neglected. In fact, governments have virtually eradicated many of our basic soil scientists and have left the science up to commercial interests. It was not seen to be fashionable for many years, but suddenly climate change has come along and soil carbon has been raised as an issue. Now we are asking, ‘What can we do?’ and the answer is, ‘We don’t know; we’ll have to establish a number of funding arrangements so that we can find out what is going on in our soils.’ Irrespective of whether the emissions trading arrangements or the climate change issue goes away, a lot of this work needs to be done and, in fact, should have been done many years ago.
There is also the issue of competition, particularly on the Liverpool Plains. Many people would be aware of that issue where there is an interface between the need for coal dollars as opposed to long-term food production on some of the very fertile black soil areas not only in New South Wales but also in parts of Queensland, particularly where there is an interface with underlying groundwater systems. That interface could have severe repercussions with the current arrangements to establish end-of-valley caps et cetera for the Murray Darling system. We have a range of issues out there. For instance, just recently we have had the property rights debate. It was raised again in question time today. What rights do people have who own freehold land? I think we really need to think through that issue once again because there are some very old issues there. Native vegetation is one issue that is raised from time to time, but there are other issues that relate to the rights of individuals and offside impacts such as longwall mining on the alluvial floodplain that is underpinned with a groundwater system that not only involves the localised area but also has a hydraulic effect for hundreds of kilometres and impacts on the river systems as well.
I do not think we have put together a policy that reconciles a lot of these issues. On one side, people are saying that agriculture is about food. On the other side, people are saying the innovation may not be about food. And then we have another government policy that says we have to plant some trees. They will have an impact on the run-off into the Murray system and they will have an impact on the land available for food. It will have an impact on a whole range of things. Then you have policy initiatives that encourage tree planting. I am not taking sides, but we have to start thinking about the totality of what we are doing here because we have a lot of regional towns, communities, individuals and investors who need to know where this debate is going and where it is likely to end up.
This report raises a number of technologies—which I think is invaluable—particularly in relation to drought policy. I know the government is looking at new drought policy initiatives. I urge the government to look at some of the technologies that are raised in this report. Some of them have been mentioned by the opposition in dealing with what they call direct action on climate change. Many of the technologies are good for our soils, good for moisture infiltration, good for productivity and relate to drought. We have all heard of the ongoing exceptional circumstances debate. Just recently, a group of us on this primary industries and resources committee went out to a property near Bungendore called Mulloon Creek where we met with a chap called Tony Coote, who is practising natural sequence farming. It is similar to what Peter Andrews and others have been involved with. I would urge you, Minister, to actually take the time—and I are more than willing to go with you—to go out and have a look at what is happening there. I think the advances that are being made are quite remarkable.

",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Agriculture in Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I thank the member for New England for bringing the issue of the future of agriculture to the attention of the parliament through a matter of public importance and also for the fact that, when he does bring these issues to the parliament, we actually have some of those rare and truly constructive discussions. This reflects well on what he is able to bring to the parliament. The member for New England referred to Australia being effectively, in agricultural terms, an exporting nation. We export just over 60 per cent of what we grow here, and this carries its own context. I want to look at the four different sorts of challenges that we have. There are some areas that in some ways have the biggest effect on agriculture which we have to acknowledge we simply cannot control at a government level, there are some areas where we can manage risk, there are some areas where we can intervene, and there are some areas where the best thing government can do is to get out of the way. I want to have a look at each of those four areas.
One of the areas that cannot be controlled by us, as an exporting nation, is the value of the dollar. There is nothing farmers are feeling more acutely at the moment than the value of the dollar. The dollar is trading at US92c at the moment. As an exporting nation, many of our farmers are feeling that and are feeling that very deeply. You have only to look at what has happened to a lot of the cattle prices of late. At the same time, there is a lot more quantity coming onto that market because of the reopening of access particularly in Japan and Korea to US beef. There are challenges out there that have a price impact where it is beyond the realm of government to be able to directly intervene. Farmers have suggested to me that we would be able to fix the dollar issue if we had a weaker economy, but I suspect that no Australian would say thankyou for that as a method of fixing the challenges they are having with their export prices.
The other issue that cannot be controlled by government is drought. We know from the projections that we can expect to see longer and deeper droughts in the future, even if only because increased temperatures have an immediate impact on soil moisture. Even if rainfall remains steady, increased temperatures mean that soil moisture tends to run out earlier.
I think we need to be upfront and acknowledge the areas we cannot control. We need to say, ‘Within that context, what are the things we can do?’ The first thing we can do for the future of Australian agriculture is work out how much more effectively we can manage risks. A quarantine risk, a biosecurity outbreak, is the key risk the government has a role in assisting to manage. When I first came into this portfolio, equine influenza was still present throughout the country. I undertook one of my first visits to country New South Wales with the member for New England. I remember going from one section to another, and we were spraying under our shoes to disinfect them. We had to follow a lot of different rules to make sure we were part of the successful eradication of equine influenza. That outbreak alone cost the Australian economy at least $1 billion, and I think the truth is that we will never know the full cost of the outbreak.
The last time the Productivity Commission had a look at the likely cost to the Australian economy of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the figure they came up with was between $8 billion and $13 billion. A determination to manage risk at the border more effectively in the future than Australia has done in the past is a responsibility that falls heavily to government. There is no such thing as zero risk. Zero risk would involve shutting the borders, closing down tourism, closing out all forms of imports—and probably shooting all migratory birds. Zero risk is not going to happen. But everything that can be done to reduce risk and to make it as unlikely as possible that we will have future biosecurity outbreaks is an important thing for government to do in terms of creating a better situation for Australia’s farmers.
Quarantine used to have in their risk management a whole series of things known as the IQIs, whereby it had been determined that a certain number of containers and passengers had to be checked. A whole lot of raw data figures were the benchmark. If there was a greater risk somewhere else, our officials were not put there. We had a rigid approach that said, ‘We have set the key performance indicators and they will remain.’ But we have now moved to a system where we are able to deploy our resources directly where the risk is greatest. Does that give a guarantee that there will be no problematic outbreaks in future? Of course not. But I do think it has been a very important development to get to that first threshold of saying risk is what we will look at.
In areas where we can directly intervene, there is none more important than the one the member for New England referred to, which is research and development. The capacity for direct government engagement in research and development is extraordinary. You only have to look at the story of productivity growth for cropping in Australia—and once again this is an example the member for New England has referred to on many occasions. Productivity growth was running at about double the rate for the rest of the economy, and it was directly linked to research and development. There were a number of factors that helped, but one was critical, and that was the uptake of minimum-till/no-till farming, the direct drilling of seed into the ground. That is a great example of how research and development can find a pathway forward that has massive improvements in the tools available to farmers.
It is my view that we should never go down the path of telling farmers what they should grow and precisely how they should grow it. I think all of those decisions are best made by farmers taking their own risks on their own land. The more we can hand over to that ingenuity, the better it will be for the nation and the greater the productivity outcomes. But, as was referred to a moment ago, for many years there has been underinvestment in research into soils in Australia. We have put extra money into research and development since we came into office. I am very pleased to have insisted that a very large part of the $46.2 million that we added through the Climate Change Research Program went into soil research. I think we can be more optimistic about the extent to which the different priorities can actually be aligned. The concept of a low-carbon economy and higher productivity for farmers can and will go hand in hand if we get the research and development right. There are areas of science which are not yet fully formed. With biochar, for example, there are examples where we know it works great, but we have not yet worked out how to match all the different soils we have in Australia with all the different sorts of biochar. What is the answer? Let us do that research and find out—which is exactly what the government has done through this funding.
I also believe that we should not close our minds to any area of scientific research. While I appreciate that from time to time there are strong community campaigns and wariness among people about genetic modification, I do believe that all areas of biotechnology should be on the table. Let’s face it: this industry is in the business of feeding people. We have a world population that will be pushing towards nine billion people by 2050. If we are going to do something about alleviating hunger, we are talking something in the order of a 70 per cent increase in total food production between now and 2050, largely running off the same area of land. There are very significant reasons why we should not be shutting our minds to any area of research. While some people will argue a moral case against genetic modification, I am happy any day to put that up against a moral case for feeding people.
On the carbon economy, when people talk about trees I say, ‘It depends.’ With the planting of trees, there are ways things can be done which do complement agricultural production. In Victoria I have seen some fantastic examples of improved afforestation on grazing land which has had a dual benefit. It has provided a timber asset on those properties for the farmers involved and it has allowed them to increase—not decrease but increase—their stocking rates. It is, of course, not the same story at all if you plant your trees on cropping land or on plantation land or anything like that. In grazing areas, however, what is available through extra shading, through wind breaks and through the extra nutrients provided to the soil by careful strategic tree-planting should not be viewed in any way as a threat to a commitment to agricultural production.
The final area where we can intervene is market access. Improving market access is always painfully slow. Essentially, when we are trying to improve market access to other countries, we are talking about one thing—we are trying to get extra customers for an Australian farmer. We are trying to increase the number of customers available. A good job has been done for a very long time by both sides of politics, no matter who has been in government, in trying to push the envelope on market access wins.
I have a document here—though it says ‘last 12 months’, so it covers only a limited period, and it is quite a few months old—that has a number of examples of improved market access: new access for kangaroo meat into China and dairy breeder cattle into Sri Lanka and New Caledonia; recognition of Sunraysia as seasonally free of fruit fly; access to new markets for the live animal trades; access for citrus into New Caledonia, fish into Korea, dairy products to India and fish to Russia. Example after example has been presented to me. Another one is cherries, particularly Tasmanian cherries, making their way into Japan. There are many examples in front of me of where farmers have radically increased their numbers of customers, and that is a very good thing in terms of the options available to them.
The final example, though—and I appreciate that this example will not necessarily win the favour of the honourable member who brought forward the matter of public importance—is of areas where government can properly get out of the way. I do believe wheat deregulation is an example of that. I appreciate the strength of opinion of a number of wheat growers, particularly in the New England area, who would prefer that the government took a different path. Those concerns have always been voiced very strongly and loudly by the member for New England. I do believe, though, that allowing farmers to have extra choices and to choose whom they sell their wheat to provides extra opportunities for them.
There are other areas where I believe we can get out of the way. With export certification, by moving from a subsidy process, with a transition arrangement which was negotiated in very good faith with the opposition and the shadow minister, we have eliminated a lot of the red tape which has occasionally held up entire shipments—after the grain was already loaded, a problem would arise and then all the demurrage costs would flow on. By allowing private enterprise a pathway for a greater engagement in some of these export certification issues, I do believe, once again, we reduce red tape. Similarly, there was legislation introduced this week—today, actually—about registering the use of pesticides with the APVMA. There are many examples where red tape and the government being in the way is one of the problems for farmers. I am determined that, wherever we can responsibly find ways of taking that step back and saying, ‘No—these are areas of red tape that we can remove for you; these are areas where the inefficiency is actually our fault, not the farmer’s,’ we should do so.
There are many other issues, obviously, but I am mindful of the time. Essentially, the context of being an export nation must not be lost in this debate. Some 60 per cent—it is much more than half—of what we grow is dependent on those international markets. We need to manage risks where we can, acknowledge the areas where we cannot intervene, intervene strategically in ways that actually help and be careful that government is not getting in the road.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Agriculture in Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak in this debate and I congratulate the member for New England for bringing it forward—not in a typical use of the MPI to attack someone in this chamber but to bring on a thoughtful and important debate on the future of agriculture in this country. As a colleague, I can confirm he is a longstanding thinker on agriculture and the future of agriculture. His involvement in the document of the committee chaired by the member for Lyons, which I am sure has been talked about this afternoon, is just another example of that commitment to the longer term issues in and around agriculture in Australia’s future. I congratulate him.
I also acknowledge the comments from the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. I was not going to mention the topic of wheat, but he has thrown it out there, so I will raise it before he leaves. His comments flowed on from a conversation about market access and a long list—and a very good list, I am sure—of examples of improved market access. I would hope I speak on behalf of all farmers and all Australians when I say that, when we talk about trade generally and when we talk about the pragmatism of trade, we should not forget the principles and the values of what it is to be an Australian—especially when we try to get access to markets with regimes that are more than questionable in international affairs.
I was surprised one morning over summer—I think it was about six weeks ago—when I awoke to read in the newspaper that at the shareholder class action around AWB there had been the startling admission of a very late acknowledgement by the company involved that they were aware of the moneys going to the regime in question. I would hope that at some point in the future the minister considers the implications of that comment—and, yes, it was under a former government, but it is the same bureaucracy—and where that comment of six weeks ago stands in relation to the Cole inquiry, market access and the importance of trade for the future of agriculture in Australia.
I agree wholeheartedly that we are a trading nation. As to the figure of 60 per cent, I talk about two of every three cows going overseas when I go to a saleyard and someone tries to have the discussion of the moment with me about why we have to import beef. We die as an agriculture industry and we die as a nation financially if we do not acknowledge the importance and value of a vibrant industry in this country for the export of food products. The give and take of trade means that we have to import as well. I would hope that is understood in 99 homes out of 100, as part of who we are as a trading nation in the area of agriculture.
The report of the committee’s inquiry, which was chaired by the member for Lyons and had involvement by the member for New England, is an excellent one. I urge all members in this place to have a look at it and I urge all members of my local farming community to have a look at it. We in this place have been through a pretty meaty debate on global issues around climate change, and its implications for agriculture were front and centre of much of that debate. Issues debated were whether or not to offset, whether or not to provide exemptions and the implications of particular pieces of legislation on the agriculture industry. I make that point because after all the debate of the last six months the foreword by the member for Lyons—and I told him this last night—in this document is the best after-sales service on the topic of climate change I have yet come across. It is personal, it is localised, it is 2½ pages long, it is simple to read and it is food for thought for everyone in government and everyone who gives a damn about the topic of climate change. I congratulate the member for Lyons for that.
I also like the report because it does not even matter whether or not there ends up being a price on carbon. It does not even matter if the topic of climate change flies or not. There are good, practical thoughts and suggestions for the agriculture sector in this document, and it is certainly worthy of further debate on all of the various topics covered, in this place and in the community. I have done my best to sell the document; I hope everyone buys because it is well put together. A lot of people’s time was involved and hopefully it will be a valued contribution for those who are genuinely looking at the topic in this country.
I also want to make mention of the issue of the clash of the moment, which was again on the front page of one of the national dailies today—that is, the growing importance and value of the coal sector to the New South Wales budget and the growing clash of policy between the desire to export coal—again, regardless of climate change—and the importance of farming land and food products, both domestically and to contribute to exports generally. I know that the member for New England has been up to his eyeballs in this topic, in a positive way, and I endorse and support the work he has been doing and those who recognise the importance of protecting the food bowl areas of this country.
In the member for New England’s case, that is largely shaped around the Liverpool Plains in an area that has just been included in the Lyne electorate. We have a similar clash in regard to the Gloucester Basin, and I am sure there are many other locations around Australia where there is this sensitive, complex and difficult clash between the want for the minerals under the ground and the desire to keep food security and keep the farming industry in play in this country. I would hope that it is on the agenda of the minister and the executive to start to put some boundaries around food security and the importance of agricultural land in this country. Yes, by all means this country has the natural resources to participate in a mining boom, but we cannot give up the agriculture sector as a consequence. That would be long-term stupidity for all of us. So I endorse the ongoing campaign that is taking place on that front.
Finally, in the short time I have left, on the mid North Coast of New South Wales it is a pretty exciting time in the agriculture sector. We have been front and centre of the traditional industries of commercial fishing, timber, beef and dairy. All of them have been under the pump with regard to change: deregulation, sustainable practices and therefore changing practices. All of them have taken a hit over the last 15 to 20 years, but all are surviving. In many cases, those industries that have managed to ride out the last 15 to 20 years are stronger and are very well placed to continue to contribute to the supply of product in this country. As well, I am seeing some really fascinating and interesting new products on the Comboyne, which used to be all dairy. We are seeing avocados, blueberries and a whole range of new products coming into the mid North Coast. Markets like cut flowers are alive and kicking. Organics have hit the mid North Coast in a big way. I think these are a reflection, but an exciting reflection, of change and of the future markets, both in this country and overseas, that are available and therefore of the security of agriculture in this country. With a bit of support from government, we will be looking good.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I also welcome this MPI from the member for New England. I know his heart is in the topic he has put forward and in everything he had to say in the debate. This MPI comes at a time when the parliament has just received the report from the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, called
Farming the future. I am proud to say that I am a member of that committee. I want to congratulate the chair, the other members of the committee and the secretariat for the work that went into that report. The report sets out a bit of a stocktake of what is already happening in adaptation and innovation in our farming sector and it underlines quite strongly the need for government to be involved in facilitating the further change that will be required.
The committee’s inquiry gave us the chance to hear from farmers, their representative bodies and researchers about how they see the future and the government’s role in that future. Of course, the future of Australia’s agricultural industries and the communities those industries support is something that is very important, and the government well understands that. The importance of agriculture to Australia’s economy was illustrated during the worst days of the global recession, when it was our farming sector that stood out in the export figures and made such a strong contribution to the nation’s GDP. We do not take that for granted for a minute, so we have been active in vital policy areas like biosecurity, drought reforms, natural resource management and programs to help farmers adjust to climate change and to boost their productivity.
There is plenty of work to do to help our farmers prepare their businesses for the challenges and opportunities of the future. I am pleased to say, though, that we are already seeing the signs of the future of agriculture in my electorate. I know that the member for New England is passionate about the contribution our farmers can and will make to Australia’s energy needs and how that can be a source of diversified revenue for them. I know he will not mind if I start my speech on this MPI by telling the House, yet again, about the fantastic cogeneration project that is underway in Mackay, in my electorate.
I have talked about this project a number of times in the context of the renewable energy target legislation because it is a great example of how the expanded renewable energy target is encouraging renewable energy projects in regional Australia. This project is also great news for sugar growers in the Mackay district and points the way to the opportunities that are there for farmers in the energy sector to produce energy as they grow food.
As I say, this is a fantastic project. Mackay Sugar, which is Australia’s second-largest milling company, will invest $120 million to install a new boiler at its Racecourse sugar mill in Mackay. The mill has always burned bagasse—a waste product from sugar milling—to produce energy to run the Racecourse sugar mill. The new boiler will now burn bagasse much more efficiently and will be able to produce 36 megawatts, of which 28 megawatts will be exported into the grid. That equates to 30 per cent of the city of Mackay’s electricity needs and will also abate 340,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.
Thanks to the expanded renewable energy target, Mackay Sugar has signed an off-take agreement with electricity retailer Ergon Energy. This project has been devised and driven by Mackay Sugar. Mackay Sugar was a milling cooperative and is now a company whose shareholders are its canegrowers. The contract with Ergon Energy represents a significant new source of revenue for Mackay Sugar. This will be passed onto some 850 growers, as shareholders of the company and through the cane price that they receive from Mackay Sugar.
Former chair of Mackay Sugar Eddie Westcott summed up what this means for farmers. I should just say that Eddie Westcott stepped down from the role of chair of Mackay Sugar. I wish him all the best in his retirement and I welcome the chance to work with the new chair of Mackay Sugar, Andrew Cappello. When this project was reaching its final hurdles and contracts were being signed, Eddie Westcott said what it meant for farmers—and he should know, because he is a sugar farmer. He was quoted as saying that having an extra stream of income that does not depend on weather or exchange rate is music to growers’ ears. He also said:
It is certainly a difference in income, because we are now divorced from the vagaries of the world market for sugar and the vagaries of the exchange rate. We will be selling in Australian dollars locally. So that’s probably the biggest change for us—an income stream purely in Australian dollars not dependent on the world market.

         

…
      

…
      

…
It just puts stability in the business … It is what the whole of us want from the growers, the harvest to the staff and employees—we want a bit of stability and this is what this will provide.
This is an example of innovation in the agricultural sector. It is the kind of innovation and capacity to adapt that we saw so much of as the agriculture committee travelled and talked to farmers through the course of the inquiry. It is also an example of where government policy can provide the incentive needed to unlock this kind of opportunity. In this case it is the expanded renewable energy target, but there are other ways the government is providing support to assist farmers to identify and pursue opportunities.
For example, I spent last Friday with the chair, Royce Bishop, and some staff from Reef Catchments, which is the community based catchment management group for the Mackay-Whitsunday region. Reef Catchments has received over $6 million in funding from the government’s Reef Rescue program and works very closely with local farmers on projects to improve water quality and reduce runoff. These projects also require investments from farmers but they pay off in reducing inputs, improving soils and boosting productivity.
Reef Catchments has developed an investment strategy which will improve water quality in the regional priority sub-catchments identified in Reef Catchments’ recent water quality improvement plan to improve water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. That is something that is important to all of us as we do our best to protect the Great Barrier Reef.
Projects will utilise strong, effective and efficient collaborations between the region and industry delivery partners, such as canegrowers, to engage regional farmers in Reef Rescue. Regional land managers are set to benefit from the investment through support for farmers to undertake risk assessments, on-ground works and multifarm projects.
I visited some of the on-farm projects with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry last year, and the engagement with the Reef Rescue programs was very encouraging. The staff from Reef Catchments told us that they were getting an even greater level of interest in the program for the next round of project funding, so this is clearly having an impact and is more evidence of the willingness of farmers to adapt when good information and support is available.
It is a similar story in the southern part of my electorate where the Fitzroy Basin Association is the natural management body charged with the responsibility of working with landholders on projects that deliver both improved productivity and environmental outcomes. The member for New England might remember that the Fitzroy Basin Association hosted us for a couple of days in Rockhampton. We went out to Neil Johansen’s property at Dululu to see what he was doing in his cropping business in using controlled traffic farming. We also went to a very large property near Springsure with the Chair of the Fitzroy Basin Association, Charlie Wilson.
In the case of the Fitzroy Basin Association, the Reef Rescue component of Caring for our Country will allow it to invest $23 million over four years in collaboration with its industry partners. Regional land managers are set to benefit from the investment through support for farmers to undertake risk assessments and on-ground works. The focus for the Fitzroy Basin region is grazing and cropping, and it will target activities that will result in a reduction in the sediment that reaches the Great Barrier Reef.
The Fitzroy Basin Association tells me—very proudly, I should say—that landholders across the region are already reducing annual average sediment loads delivered to waterways by about 75,000 tonnes and are on target to cumulatively reduce sediment entering waterways by 4.1 million tonnes by 2014. That represents significant change going on in farming practices in our Central Queensland region, and Reef Catchments’ experience tells the same story.
This underlines the message that came out in the
Farming the future
report—that Australian farmers are innovative and adaptive because they have always had to be. The new challenges of globalisation and climate change, among others, will call on these traits, but there has to be input from governments to support and encourage farmers through these challenges. One of the key recommendations in the report is for the government to understand the needs and decision-making processes of farmers and to ensure that the delivery of adaptation programs is flexible and responsive to the needs of farmers and rural communities.

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—With regard to the matter of public importance submitted by the member for New England, one thing that is very clear is that Australian producers have far more to fear from government policy than they have from climate change or anything else. I can attest that in Brazil and America people are far more fearful of what governments might hand down than they are about what nature might hand down. Having said that, food security is not only about farmers being able to do what they do best and grow the food or the fibre; it is also about food manufacturing and processing, and the food manufacturing sector is the last major one left in Australia. It employs 315,000 people, mainly in regional Australia. It is vital to our nation’s food security, and this side of the House is extraordinarily concerned about its viability. For example, we are extremely concerned that there is only one frozen vegetable-processing plant left in the country after McCain closed its Tasmanian plant. That is obviously a major concern and it needs to be addressed.
One thing that simply cannot happen, if we are serious about the long-term sustainability of the land and of the industry, is the cutting of funds for research and development. As with any industry, staying up to date with the latest in technological and industrial improvements allows our producers to keep ahead of the pack when it comes to the global agricultural market. In many of our agricultural industries, Australians are clearly the best and in the rest, if they are not the best, they are certainly up there with it.
This MPI is about an issue that is obviously very close to me. Two years ago, for the first time in the history of mankind, there were more people living in cities than in rural areas. Never before have so many relied on so few for their food. To put it simply, if you do not eat, you die. Let us be clear: fewer people are producing food and, more simply, cannot produce food. As the urban trend continues, this gap is going to widen. It has brought many new challenges, none greater than the widening gap between urban populations and food producers. It is increasingly evident that at times unrealistic environmental green tape is being placed on food producers, and the lack of empathy of some city based politicians with people in the country is not helping this.
It was when I was shadow water minister that I saw the black hole opening up in our nation’s food security, and I saw the absolute contempt with which the government treated the Murray-Darling Basin irrigators and the two million people who live in the basin. Probably half of them are dependent on water in one guise or another. Unfortunately, the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water is still treating them with contempt, and this was graphically illustrated when she was interviewed by the ABC on the
Four Corners
program after the government bought the food-producing powerhouse Toorale Station and converted it into a national park.
The two million people who rely on water in the Murray-Darling Basin need to get through to the Labor government that they have to stop ignoring the economic and social costs associated with the reforms. I would point out that food security is not only about our ability to feed Australians now; it is also about the fact that we are looked upon as the people who set the benchmark for good food production around the world, not only in quantity but in quality, and we do have a responsibility. If we produce only enough for ourselves and we do not provide enough good food for the rest of the world, a lot of people are going to die. We have a responsibility. Look at Sydney—they reckon there is enough food for seven to 10 days within Sydney and after that they would be in trouble. Food security is not only about the long term; it is also about the here and now. The next 50 years will see greater pressure placed on our farmers to deal with that. I finish by saying that farmers here and around the world are more frightened of government—(Time expired)

"Turnour, Jim, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance. It is always a wonderful privilege and pleasure to speak on the future of agriculture or agriculture in general. Members may not know but I was born on a property near Batchelor in the Northern Territory. In the 1960s, my parents grew bananas and sold them in Darwin. We grew Townsville stylo which was a newly developing technology back then, a legume that would help revolutionise the pastoral industry until it was wiped out by disease. There have been follow-ons with Seca, Verano and a range of other stylos that have had an impact on the Northern Australian beef industry. Agriculture is a very important part of this country and the fabric of this country. It is a great privilege to stand here today and talk about its future because, as somebody who comes from the bush, has an agricultural science degree, has worked for the department of primary industries as well as privately with farmers and graziers and shares many of the values of people representing country areas in this place, I believe that it is important that we do have debates and discussions about these issues.
Today I want to focus my comments on Northern Australia, the area where I was born and which I represent. Recently the report of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce was brought down. There has been a lot of debate and discussion around that report and I think there were a lot of myths about dams and the future of the north as a food bowl effectively being ruled out. The reality is the report was a well-thought-out document which was not produced by government but produced by independent people like David Crombie. My father worked for GRM International for a period of time and Mr Crombie is the President of the National Farmers Federation. Another independent person involved in the production of that report was Mr Joe Ross, the chair of the committee and an Indigenous elder. He is a very well respected man in Northern Australia. We also had representatives from the mining industry and a range of other groups. Today they are in the parliament discussing the report and meeting with members from the Labor side and the opposition side.
I believe that the report provides a foundation for a good cross-party discussion and debate about Northern Australia. We can have simplistic debates about dams, development or no development, greenies or this and that in Northern Australia, but fundamentally if we are interested in the future of the area we need to sit down and work through the science and what sort of future is wanted with the communities concerned. That is what the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce did and what their report brought forward. As I said, the report was not written by government; it was written by them and they are very proud of that. Joe Ross has put out a paper entitled ‘A new era for northern Australia: avoiding past mistakes and building a shared future’. It is very much worth a read. He goes through the report in an overall sense. One of the things he points out is that there are more myths about the north than perhaps any other part of the nation. Much of the criticism directed at the task force report is that it is ill conceived and ill informed. Critics are encouraged to read the report in depth and understand the full significance of the recommendations.
The media have suggested that the report basically rules out agriculture. Let us look at a few issues that the report identifies in the further development of agriculture in Northern Australia. The report identified that at the moment there are about 20,000 hectares of intensive agriculture in Northern Australia. As I said, my parents grew bananas there in the 1960s. Members opposite from rural areas would know that 20,000 hectares is not a large area. The report identifies that mosaic agriculture has the potential to increase that by another 40,000 hectares to a total of 60,000 hectares. That is a significant contribution. The report also identifies that most of those opportunities relate to being able to take up groundwater. Coming from the north and understanding the north, the reason it has not been developed is not only the limitations of some of the water resources and opportunities but also the lack of infrastructure and the lack of markets available in that part of the world. We need to continue to build roads and broadband networks. That is something that this government is doing.
The report also identifies that we can almost double the grazing industry through the intensification of the agricultural area in the north. There are great opportunities to develop agriculture in the north, but we need to look at the science, we need to work with the community and we need to make sure the business community and the private sector drive the economic opportunities.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I will not go over the ground that I covered before question time with respect to the important changes that the coalition has wrought from the government and which have allowed us to finally pass the youth allowance bills. I made the points regarding the Minister for Education saying that these changes and amendments were once impossible and suddenly a week later are doable. I was making the point that the Labor members of parliament from rural and regional Australia and, unfortunately, the three Independent members from rural seats in this place can take absolutely no credit at all for extending to thousands of new rural and regional students the old workforce participation criteria enabling them to keep their pathway to higher education. They can take no credit at all for removing all the retrospectivity from this legislation, which was a very important principle.
(Extension of time granted)

I appreciate the opportunity just to finish my remarks. The members for Lingiari, Leichhardt, Dawson, Capricornia, Flynn, Richmond, Page, Hunter, Macquarie, Eden-Monaro, Corangamite, Lyons, Braddon, Bass and Franklin all need to explain to their constituents why they signed up to a youth allowance reform which cut out so many thousands of their constituents right across Australia and why it was left to the coalition to stand firm and be tough with the government.
Certainly, the minister eventually recognised the need to back down and support the coalition’s amendments. That has happened in the Senate today and we welcome her flexibility. I would not be so bold as to suggest it may be part of her campaign to be the next leader of the Labor Party. I am not sure whether she wanted to be the person who can deliver—the person who can get something through the Senate—unlike the Prime Minister, who is all talk and no action. That is certainly sticking.
Clearly the Deputy Prime Minister wanted to be able to be the minister who said, ‘Well, nobody else on our side of the House can get anything done, but we can get something through the Senate. We can negotiate with the opposition.’ That is her win, I suppose. She will be able to go out and tell her caucus colleagues that she was the person who could get something done—get something through the Senate—unlike the Prime Minister, who has manifestly failed to deliver on any of his promises from the last election.
A number of my colleagues from rural and regional seats and from the National Party wish to comment on how much more could have been done if the government had been prepared to bend even further. Then more rural and regional students, particularly from inner regional areas, would have been able to access the old workforce participation criteria for the independent youth allowance. That is the one disappointment I have with regard to the coalition allowing this bill to pass. If the government had been prepared to even bend a little bit more, more students would have been able to keep their pathway to higher education. But those students only have one party to blame, and that is the Labor Party.
It is the Labor Party that introduced this legislation and it is the Labor Party that refused to bend any further, but we were not going to stand in the way any longer of 100,000 students across Australia being able to access Commonwealth scholarships and of improving youth allowance. We got a better deal for thousands of rural and regional Australians and their families. When we are elected to government at the end of this year we will review the entire youth allowance from the ground up and we will make sure that there is a genuine pathway to higher education for a group that is already recognised as being a disadvantaged group, to give them the opportunity to have the same start and the same opportunities as people who live in the city and who can stay home with mum and dad—or with mum, or with dad or with whomever—go to university and get the kind of education that we want everybody in Australia to have the opportunity of receiving.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—The amendments before the parliament are an improvement on the old arrangements that the government was insisting upon. The government has made some concessions, but the government itself acknowledges that those concessions are not substantial. They have removed the retrospectivity that was a part of the old arrangements. It should never have been there. It was obscene that the government sought to take away an access to independent youth allowance from people who had abided by the rules as they were advised by Centrelink and by their school counsellors, and as had been in place for quite some time. They had been working at that for a year or a year and a half, only to be told that the rules were changed. The removal of that retrospectivity is perhaps the most important change in these amendments.
However, they have made a number of concessions also in relation to a continuing access to the independent youth allowance for people who live in very remote, remote and outer regional areas. The government has made much of that but, in fact, the Deputy Prime Minister herself said in question time today that only 1,900 people are actually going to benefit from that change. There are about 30,000, we are told, who were getting the independent youth allowance, and of those around 12,000 to 15,000 were in regional areas. So fewer than 2,000 out of 12,000 to 15,000 are actually going to be eligible for any benefit as a result of the changes to the independent youth allowance, and that is a pretty paltry effort.
The government has chosen as its index for determining remoteness a geographic index which is fatally flawed. Most of those 1,900 people who will be able to access the independent youth allowance will be coming from cities like Townsville, Cairns and Darwin. They are included in the areas that will get access to the youth allowance under the old arrangements, whereas if you live in Mackay, you do not get it. If you live in Dalby or Echuca, you do not get it. The minister is actually saying that it is easier to get a job in Dalby, Echuca, Yarraman and Cherbourg than it is in Townsville, Cairns and Darwin. It is simply a nonsense that the 30-hour rule should apply in one place, but a 15-hour rule applies in the other.
You could live next door to the James Cook University in Townsville—a very fine university—and qualify for the independent youth allowance. But if you live in a town like Dalby or Echuca, hundreds of miles from your capital city, you do not qualify. The government is asking us to believe that this is a good, a reasonable and a fair deal. The reality is that students in regional areas have far less chance of completing a university education than young people who live in the cities. It is a statistical fact that about a third as many people from remote areas have university degrees as those who live in the city. About 30 per cent of rural people complete a university course, compared with the best part of 60 per cent of people who live in the cities.
That is a social injustice that must be addressed. The minister is the Minister for Social Inclusion, and that she can completely ignore this injustice leaves me absolutely in despair. The educational outcomes in regional areas are not equivalent to what occurs in the cities. There is a huge cost imposition on people who have to move from a regional area to live in the capital city.
I recognise that there needed to be some reforms made to the independent youth allowance. I do not disagree with that. But we do need to have a student assistance scheme that enables all young Australians to achieve their education potential, including those from poor families and those who come from regional areas. The government’s changes to student assistance will in fact further disadvantage those who live outside the capital cities. They have delivered an outcome with serious anomalies. The government must address those issues if it wants to be fair minded.
For the next student year there will be a new government and a government with a different attitude to the importance of equality in education, and we will address those concerns. We agree to the passage of this bill because the student year has already begun and there are hundreds of thousands of students out there who have been left in limbo because of the unwillingness of this government to address the serious issues much earlier. But even now what has happened is only tokenism. Only 1,900 students will benefit in the longer term and that still leaves thousands of rural Australians who will in fact not be getting the university education they should have.

",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak on the Senate’s requested amendments to the
Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. I acknowledge the Minister for Education is in the House and also the Leader of the Nationals and the member for Sturt, who has been spending quite a bit of time with the minister. We were getting worried about him, given the amount of time he was spending there, but we note that he has made some progress, which is welcome from my point of view, representing a landmass three times the size of Victoria in my seat of Maranoa.
The requested amendments remove the retrospective nature of what was in the bill, and anything that is retrospective I cannot support, so that is certainly welcome. I want to say something about when this Prime Minister was first elected. He went to my home town of Roma and I pulled up the transcript of what he said when he was out there. He said:
I said when I became Prime Minister of Australia that I intended to be Prime Minister for all of Australia, and that included being the Prime Minister for rural Australia.
Those are the direct words from a press conference he held in my home town of Roma seven days after he was sworn in and took office as Prime Minister of Australia. What we can see from this legislation is not a Prime Minister for rural Australia. He is certainly not a Prime Minister for regional Australia, and all those regional members from the other side of the House who have walked away on this issue since the budget initiative was brought forward by the minister stand condemned. They will have to answer to their constituents at the next election because we will be reminding them of where they stood on this issue.
The index that is used to determine eligibility for the independent youth allowance, the work test, is just nonsensical. I have gone to the map. The Leader of the Nationals has outlined some of the anomalies, including Dalby in my electorate of Maranoa. But I went to a village just north of Dalby on the Cooyar Road, which I know the Leader of the Nationals would know well, called Kaimkillenbun. It is a little village. About 100 people live there. There are 30 students at the school. It was once serviced by a railway line, and when you cross that railway line you head up to Cooyar on the way up to Kingaroy. On one side of the tracks in this little village you will be in an outer regional area and the work test there will be for 15 hours work per week and a certain income you have to earn. But if you are on the other side of the track you will have to work 30 hours. It is one of those classic anomalies that we see when you start drawing lines on maps.
I then went to the town of Millmerran. All the areas surrounding Millmerran, which is about 100 kilometres west of Toowoomba, are outer regional areas. The work test of 15 hours per week will apply. If you live in a rural residential area of Millmerran, a town of 2,000 people, you will be in an outer regional area, but if you happen to live in the confines of Millmerran’s boundaries you will be considered to be in an inner regional area. These boundaries are just nonsensical. That is why this government should have accepted the amendment put up by the opposition in the upper house. And shame on those Independent members and the Greens in the upper house who joined with the Labor Party to defeat a very sensible amendment that would have got rid of these stupid lines on maps. How long has it been that a pathway to affordable access to education depends on lines on maps? I represent those students from rural and regional areas, whom many on this side also represent and whom those opposite have failed to represent.
Access to post-secondary education should not be a privilege. It should be a right for all Australians to be treated in the same way as those students who live in capital cities. The great anomaly in this legislation is that, if you happen to live in Cairns or in Townsville, you will be able to gain access to the independent youth allowance with a work test of 15 hours per week, but if you live in Kaimkillenbun and you live on the wrong side of the track you will have to qualify through the 30-hour test. That is a little village of 100 people north of Dalby on the road to Kingaroy.
Before I came in here a lady from the media outlet in Kingaroy had been contacted by families in Kingaroy wanting to know whether they would be eligible under the new rules. Well, they are in one of those towns where to qualify for the independent youth allowance they will have to work 30 hours per week. But if they lived 30 kilometres up the road in Wondai they would have to work 15 hours.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I think it is interesting to look back on this debate and where it started. In the May budget last year some massive changes to the independent youth allowance were proposed by this government, including one of a retrospective nature affecting students who under the previous guidelines at the end of 2008 had decided to take a gap year in order to comply with the independent youth allowance guidelines. Those proposals were obviously so shocking that students and parents from all around Australia jumped up in outrage over these changes—a shifting of the goalposts. It would be like shifting the grand final from the MCG to the WACA for the third quarter. It certainly was not fair. I now recognise that these changes will fix that problem up.
But of course this government, against our advice, removed the Howard government’s scholarships—I believe in August 2009—and did not have anything in there to replace them. This legislation does help in some respects. I understand that in my electorate approximately 534 students will be eligible for start-up scholarships of about $1,300 in the first year and $2,100 in the second and subsequent years. That will be a little bit of help, but the fact is that for most students in my area the cost is something like $15,000 a year to leave home to attend university.
I also understand that 703 extra students will receive youth allowance. We welcome that change. There is no doubt that we support those changes. But, unfortunately, the second biggest city in South Australia, Mount Gambier—population about 24,000—will not comply with the new guidelines for ‘regional’, even though it is 400 kilometres away from Melbourne university and 400 kilometres away from Adelaide university. It is impossible for students from Mount Gambier to attend either of those universities without leaving home and without the extra cost. These new changes have withdrawn those students. It cannot apply to people in Mount Gambier because the test is done on a medical services test. It is not based on education or on the ability to afford to leave home and attend university; it is based on medical services. Yes, Mount Gambier is a reasonable centre for health, and so it falls under those federal government guidelines. It is a stupid—very stupid—boundary line for this situation, because, obviously, they will have to leave home at a cost of, as I said, about $15,000 a year to attend university. There are many families—even under the new guidelines—who simply will not be able to afford that. It is a crying shame that the second biggest city in South Australia, Mount Gambier, will not be eligible for these changes.
It is interesting to look at the towns in my electorate. Murray Bridge—yes, okay, it is 45 to 60 minutes away from university, so they do not get the ability to apply for youth allowance under these guidelines. Tailem Bend is another 15 minutes away from there and an hour and 15 minutes away from the university. Students from there will still have to either leave home or drive there and back every day—two and a half hours in a vehicle. If you go further down the road to Coomandook, that is another quarter of an hour—and, according to this, that is an hour and a half away from university. They will not be under these new guidelines. So there are anomalies due to the fact that these boundaries are not drawn in a fair way. There are still areas of my electorate that will not receive the benefits they should. I welcome some of the changes, but, obviously, when we get back in government, we will change it to make it fairer for all rural students all over Australia.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I appreciate the opportunity to talk on this very important bill, the
Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. I commend the shadow minister for education for coming up with an outcome that would not have happened if we had we let the government put through this outrageous piece of legislation when it was first introduced. As an opposition, we had to balance the interests of 100,000 students who without this legislation passing this week would not be able to access new Commonwealth scholarships or improved rates of youth allowance with those of people who, quite frankly, are going to be dudded under this rather ridiculous lines-on-maps access arrangement that the Minister for Education has attached to this bill.
I wonder, with all of the resources of the two megadepartments at the minister’s disposal, why we had to have a map that has such erroneous and misleading descriptions and definitions when it relates to access to education. It might be a good indicator of remoteness when it comes to a range of other measures and policies, but this is different. This is specific. I do not know why the departments in question could not produce a map that made access and equity to education for rural students a whole lot better. And I do not accept that it would have cost a whole lot more.
We have a list of towns and, as all members have, we have looked through this list to see which of the towns that we represent will be able to access youth allowance under what I will call ‘the old rules’—because that is what students in regional Australia want, the existing system. I accept, having seen the outcomes of the Bradley review, that changes needed to be made. I do not believe we should have kept the old system completely in place. Definitely there was rorting. Definitely changes needed to be made. But I do not accept that they were needed to the level that the government has suggested and I do not accept the taint that the government has cast over the entire youth allowance scheme, and over rural students and tertiary education as a result. That is just totally out of order.
On this alphabetical list of what is described as ‘outer regional, remote and very remote locations’, I see some of the towns in my electorate, because I represent a rural area of western New South Wales. But there are three towns that immediately I do not see. One is Albury. Yes, Albury is a large regional centre. It is about four hours from Canberra, it is about seven and a half hours from Sydney and it is a good three and a half hours from Melbourne. It does have two regional universities, and they do a great job, but they do not cater for every student in every case. Students from Albury—who made long, loud representations to me when this bill was initially introduced—would like to stay with the old rules for youth allowance. They are not in a position where they can get jobs that last for 30 hours a week for an 18-month period in two years, which is the route they will now have to take to qualify for independent youth allowance.
The other two towns are Corowa and Deniliquin. In the case of Deniliquin—a tiny town on the Murray River with no air services, no public transport, a population of 8,000 and getting smaller, a town which has struggled unbelievably in the drought over the last 10 years—it is absolutely outrageous. It is one of the most rural locations you could possibly imagine and it has been classified under this system as ‘inner regional’. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, with all of the resources that she has at her disposal: could she please consider a better map that better categorises the towns that we as rural members of parliament represent. It is not the principle we oppose. We understand the principle. It is this map—this archaic object that has been brought down from the shelf and rolled out—which is expected to do a job which it really cannot do.
So, the towns of Albury, Corowa and Deniliquin in my electorate of Farrer are going to be seriously disadvantaged. I feel terrible for the parents that have approached me over the last six months that have signed petitions, that have poured out their hearts; for the kids who have come to me. The cases that really stick in my mind are those kids that say that, because their parents are on farms that have had declining incomes over the last five years, ‘I am not going to put my parents through this—I just won’t go to university; I will put it off to some later stage in my life.’ There are no jobs like this in a town the size of Deniliquin—there are very few jobs, but there is certainly no opportunity for students to work 30 hours a week for a period of 18 months in a two-year period in order to access youth allowance. I appreciate the income thresholds have changed, and that will make some difference—and that is a good thing. And I appreciate that the gap year students from 2008 are quarantined, and that is something that we really drew a line in the sand about, and we have achieved that. I feel pleased with that. But there is a much room for improvement. As a member of the coalition, I commit to working to change this if re-elected.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—This is a bittersweet moment. Certainly no sense of triumph should be felt by either side of the House. There is much work still to be done in terms of student income support going into the future. This has always been about the kids; it has always been about the young people in regional Australia. There are members on both sides of the House who have approached this issue in a great deal of good faith and have endeavoured to get a result which has been in the interests of regional people right across Australia.
I do take exception to the approach of the Minister for Education to this whole debate from May last year. She announced during the May budget that basically she was going to make it retrospective; she was going to strip the gap year entitlements off students who had prepared for their time at university, had taken a year off and were working to achieve that status. The rug would be pulled out from under them. On 25 May last year I asked the minister in question time to guarantee that country students in their gap year would not be financially penalised. She said at that time, ‘What a very silly question.’ Here we are, almost nine months later, and that very silly question has come to fruition in that the minister has finally agreed that there will be no retrospectivity for students in their gap year. That is a very good thing.
I do say to the minister in her presence that she does not always need to rush to the barricades and bludgeon her opponents to death when it comes to issues where there is concern or there are alternative points of view. I honestly believe that in this debate, in particular, there were people who were acting with good intentions towards the students. You do not manage to achieve 5,000 people signing a petition in 10 days in an electorate the size of Gippsland unless there is passion in the community and real concern about what is being proposed. That was repeated right throughout regional Australia. I acknowledge that the minister facilitated a meeting between me, Russell Broadbent and a member of her staff, and I thank her for that opportunity. From then on I believe we had a better working relationship in terms of trying to achieve some positive outcomes.
Having said all that, I do not believe this is an education revolution. At best, this is tinkering around the edges when a massive overhaul of student income support is required. We have not yet dealt with the fundamental issue of equity for regional students, and now we have actually created a situation where there are too many winners and losers. Under this new arrangement, people in the electorate of Gippsland living in towns like Sale, Maffra, Stratford, Yarram, Traralgon and Heyfield will not have the opportunity to use one pathway of achieving independent youth allowance, that being through the 15 hours per week and earning $19,500 over an 18-month period. These are small country towns and it can also be very difficult for these students to achieve the 30 hours per week required of them under the legislation which will be passed today. I fully accept, and the minister regularly makes the point, that that is not the only avenue for achieving income support. I do give credit to the minister in that regard—the increased income thresholds will accommodate a lot of people from the poorer socio-economic areas of my electorate, and the more generous income thresholds will be well received. I have publicly put that on the record on many occasions; that is one of the good things we are doing here with this legislation.
The fact remains that families in regional areas with multiple children going to university will face additional costs of $10,000 to $15,000. Accommodation costs are not going to be covered in any way by what is going through the House today. I referred earlier to my emotions being bittersweet. It is a sweet moment for the students who will now finally be able to access scholarships—they will have some certainty as they go into the 2010 university year. I think that is the right thing for them at this time. My bitterness relates to those students in the future who will not be accommodated by these changes, and to the simple fact that we are missing an opportunity in this place to do the revolutionary work that we hear so much about from those on the other side. We hear about the education revolution, but the students in regional Australia are really waiting to see it. They are still waiting to see when the fundamental issues of equity will be addressed, and I am concerned that they will be waiting for a very long time while this government just talks to them and spins them a line.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—My comments are similar to those of many other members. I acknowledge the work and persistence of the shadow minister on this issue. I also acknowledge all of the members who sit in this House who have worked so ferociously to represent the concerns of their country students. If it was not for their efforts and the wonderful efforts of our constituents who lobbied constantly, who wrote to us and who begged us to act on their behalf, then we would not have these results. The Minister for Education was not going to do this voluntarily. She was dragged kicking and screaming to this point. It is the efforts of the people in this chamber and all of our constituents who are affected by this that have brought this about. I want to acknowledge my constituents who have worked so hard and have been so concerned about this on an ongoing basis.
We have heard about the map being used—this wonderful map that is entirely inappropriate as a measure for determining student regionality. I can see it in my electorate, as can each member who is here to talk about how this is going to affect their students so badly. I am already getting the emails from young people in my electorate who are going to be left out. The assumption is that it is not going to cost any more for these young people to go to university—and they have no choice but to have to move, to go to Perth, essentially, to pursue their tertiary education. There is no choice. Yet, when I looked at the map I saw a little place like Collie, in my electorate—and Collie is out but somewhere like Cairns is in. I see places like Boyanup and Dardanup and Donnybrook, and we have all these people who are reliant on seasonal work, or no work at all, as the member for Grey is very well aware. There are all these issues facing rural and regional students. Those who come from family farming backgrounds are also going to find this extremely difficult. Where on earth does a young person from Donnybrook, which is left out on this map, unlike Darwin, Dunsborough, Brunswick, Harvey and Capel, find 30 hours of work a week over that 18-month period? These young people live anything from two to 2½ hours away from a university, so they are not going to be able to qualify under the map that the minister has offered.
I, like my colleagues, am disappointed that this seems like a piecemeal, throwaway approach to these students and to the serious nature of how much focus should have been on this issue. There should have been a very diligent approach because the minister has had since May to do this. If the minister genuinely cared about making sure of equal opportunity for rural and regional students—those who genuinely need it—these are not the criteria that should have been used to determine this outcome.
I have received an email from a very concerned parent from Bunbury. Their young daughter was dux of her campus and she has to go to Perth to pursue her education, yet she is going to miss out. They are seriously devastated about this but they know that we have fought hard. They know that we have fought to make sure that that the minister did not impose problems for those on a gap year—that you would even consider excluding those currently doing their gap year is appalling.
Then we saw the 30 hours of work a week applied unilaterally—I am not sure where members on the other side imagine that their young people can find that 30 hours of work a week that is going to be necessary for so many. I can say for a lot of young people in my electorate: it is not possible. Again, we increase the disadvantage for young people in my electorate. I know that my email inbox is going to run hot and I will be continuing to let the minister know exactly about this process. We put that amendment in, but the government voted against it. I cannot believe that the places that I have mentioned in my electorate will be excluded and not considered as regional when those young people cannot go to university unless they go to Perth to attend a university. There is an assumption by this minister about regional areas, and it is incorrect.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I have only been a member of this House for a little over two years. There are many weeks when I go home from Canberra and wonder what on earth we can achieve from opposition, but this turnaround in the last 48 hours from the minister is a great achievement from opposition and a reward for hanging tough. I recognise that we do not have all we wanted and I acknowledge the member for Gippsland’s comments about those that will not benefit from this turnaround.
The fact is the coalition has hung tough against all those who have called for us to back down in the last few months: the vice-chancellors of the major universities of Australia; the students union; the minister; and the government. We have hung firm on this, and I congratulate our shadow minister for education because on this occasion from opposition we have delivered a great improvement. The unwinding of the retrospectivity is a great improvement and it should never have been included in the first place. The ability for those who live in remote, very remote and outer regional areas to still be able to apply for youth allowance under the old arrangements is a great move forward.
The electorate of Grey is one of the luckier ones, I must say. There is only one community in my electorate that will not qualify under these new arrangements—that is the township of Eudunda of around 1,200 people. They could move five kilometres down the road and they would qualify. For the rest of my electorate it is without doubt a very good result, but I identify with the comments of those people who are living in the inner regional areas with arbitrary lines on the map who can have very little understanding of how they were drawn in the first place. I will have to go back to the people in the community of Eudunda and explain how they will get different treatment to the people of Robertstown who live just up the road.
Having said all that, it was in Woomera in April last year at the Isolated Children’s Parents Association where I launched a discussion paper on this issue. Because I come from a small rural township and have had to guide three of my children through university under the old arrangements, I understand how difficult it is for people who live in regional and rural areas. It has been a longstanding passion of mine to try and get a reasonable deal for country students. I wrote a discussion paper which I delivered to the Isolated Children’s Parents Association on 1 April in Woomera last year. The purpose of that paper was to get this subject on the discussion table. Little did I know how successful that would be because in the budget, only a matter of six weeks later, it was well and truly on the discussion table for all the wrong reasons. It was not because we were getting a better deal for country people; it was because we were going to get a worse deal.
From the outset, I have recognised in the minister’s statements the good things she was trying to do under this rearrangement: the lifting of the thresholds; the lowering of the age of automatic eligibility from 25 to 22; and the ability for students to earn a bit more money. But the kickback was that she was dragging $800 million in support from students who qualified under the independence test into a scholarship that was going to everyone. I saw that as a redistribution of support for country students to support for city students. That is one of the reasons I was determined to dig my heels in along with the rest of my colleagues in the coalition.
The central issue here is fairness for country students. We are starved of people with professional skills in regional areas, and we know that if we can get kids from regional areas to undertake education the opportunity of getting them back into our communities is far higher. So this is about more than just each individual student. It is about what kind of communities we are going to have in regional Australia going forward.
We have designated intakes for doctors who come from rural areas, but there are all kinds of other professional areas where we need that kind of support. We know the take-up rates of university study from regional and rural students are lower than those from the city, so we are already operating at a disadvantage. Every time we make the situation tougher we put ourselves in a worse position.
The outcome we have achieved for those people that live in the three regions leaves us in a better position than before; I acknowledge that. But I am concerned for those who live in the inner regional areas and who will not be able to access the old independent test—(Time expired)

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I rise to support the comments made by my colleagues in the coalition and, in particular, to commend the shadow minister, the member for Sturt, for the hard work that he has put in to get a much better arrangement; albeit, as colleagues have mentioned, that it is not ideal and not what we would really like to see. But I think the most important point to start with is that the government has agreed to get rid of the retrospectivity. It was extremely unfair. I think all colleagues had examples of people who in good faith had started their gap year and who had suddenly been told: ‘Well, that’s too bad. You’re going to miss out.’ So I commend the member for Sturt and I thank the government for accepting that point.
However, I must go on to say that we still face the same problem. The rate of take-up of tertiary study for people in the country is lower than for those in the city. The reasons for this are very clear. People from the country have to go away in order to study and they therefore have the costs of living away from home. In addition, they have the difficulties of having to settle in a strange environment, which is not easy. Many country students find that very difficult. It seems strange that the government has still not recognised the inequity that is there.
I would also like to address the issue of anomalies. The use of a map that is totally unrelated to education issues to decide whether or not you are allowed to qualify for the gap year under the old arrangements or under the new arrangements does seem to create some enormous anomalies. Some of the towns in my electorate of Wannon that will be missing out are Stawell, Ararat, Avoca, Mortlake and Camperdown. They will all miss out and they are all smaller than, say, a town like Portland that will come in. And, of course, all of those towns are much, much smaller than places like Townsville or Cairns, both of which seem to be allowed to stay under the old arrangements in terms of qualifying under the gap year.
So it is still far from satisfactory. I would urge the minister to look at how these boundaries could be improved. While I accept that the legislation has a sense of urgency about it now because there are so many students hanging on it going through, nonetheless I think it is very, very important that we remove this anomaly. It is almost like a lottery because it is based on whether you live on one side of the line or the other, despite the fact that the situation you are living in is virtually the same. I do not think that is fair by any measure, and I hope that the minister will look very carefully at this and say that we can improve on it.
It really comes back to this point: that we should be doing everything possible to encourage country students to continue their studies. We now have a situation where some are going to find it easier than others purely because of some lines on a map that do not bear much relation to each individual’s situation. So, again, I join with my colleagues to say that I see this as an improvement but that I still think there is a long way to go to improve it further. I hope that the minister will listen to the members who have, in good faith, spoken here this evening to say that we can do better. With those words, I am conscious that other colleagues would like to speak, and I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for my opportunity.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—I think this matter is one of the most important that has come before the parliament in my time, especially in terms of equity for country people. We get a lot of troubles in country areas with drought and floods and so on, but the one thing that we all pride ourselves in is seeing that our kids get a fair shake. I, for one, have a son who went to university and had to have four jobs to get himself through. So I know what it is like for young people to struggle to get that university degree.
For the life of me, I cannot understand why we would use a measure of medical availability as the basis for lines on maps around accessibility to a university. I just cannot see the connection. Perhaps it was just a lazy bit of work on the part of someone in the minister’s office or the bureaucracy who said: ‘We can’t quite find a map. This one is fairly close. We’ll do this.’ That decision excluded so many people that it is quite frightening. But I will acknowledge the clawing back of the young people who were excluded by retrospectivity. If that had been allowed to continue, it would have been a manifest injustice.
However, what we see now is a different form of injustice. In my electorate I have the university cities of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. They are two very good campuses and two different universities. I find it extraordinary that those two cities are excluded but Townsville and Cairns are included in the 15-hour measure. Why should the kids in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay have to do 30 hours? I put this to the minister: it is not just a mechanical thing of 50 or 30 hours that we are talking about. What it really comes down to is the availability of jobs in some of those towns.
If you are in a town like that—especially one that has been through drought recently—it is incredibly hard to get to 15 hours much less 30. So the move now to take this whole cohort of students from the 15-hour measure to the 30-hour measure will by its very nature exclude them. I think there is a lot of work still to be done. As I said, I have a son who went to university and had to maintain four jobs to get himself through. I am intensely proud of him.
I also want to stress the importance of education in country areas. I understand that the minister at the table is the Minister for Social Inclusion. If we are talking about social inclusion, it should be a constant source of anxiety to her—I do not say this with any sense of bitterness or vindictiveness—that only 30 per cent of country kids in this nation get to university. It is only 30 per cent.
—That is the Howard government’s legacy.
—You can say it was the last government’s legacy and we can say it was the Keating government’s legacy. You could run that argument for ever and ever amen. The point is, however, that you hold the reins at present and you have the ability to give more of those kids the opportunity. Not only have you not given more of those kids the opportunity; you have imposed harsh measures that will drive some of them out. I think that is something you should reflect on.
Also, we wring our hands and say we need people from country areas, especially doctors and pharmacists and so on, to go back and take up the cudgels and live and work in country areas. What we are going to do with this measure is make it all the harder to encourage students in country areas to take up those courses and in doing so take a burden from government and from the communities in which they serve—(Time expired)

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I rise this evening with great concerns. I support everything said by my colleagues on this side of the House. It is untenable that we should be confronted at almost the last moment, in my opinion, with this imposition of a limitation of $150,000 of household taxable income for students wanting to attend tertiary institutions. Students who fall outside that limit are to be denied access to independent youth allowance. It goes against the grain.
Has anyone in government, even from the Labor side of politics, ever suggested that a student’s access to HECS be means tested? No, they have not. Whether you are from a wealthy family or from a very poor battling family, no-one has suggested that you not be entitled to access HECS. When we have devised this independent youth allowance, why should a student that has qualified to be independent suddenly be saddled with the imposition of the income of their parents? Why should my students from families living in Port Hedland and Karratha where both parents are forced to work because rents are somewhere in the vicinity of $2,000 a week and the disposable income is on a par with the disposable income of families living in metropolitan areas be denied the opportunity to qualify for independent youth allowance and have an income whilst they relocate to a capital city to attend a tertiary institution?
It is an untenable proposition. I believe the minister has not realised the consequences of such an imposition. My students in Karratha, Port Hedland and in the remote areas of Western Australia are hardly living in the leafy suburbs of any of our capital cities. They are living some 1,600 to 2,000 kilometres from a suitable institution. It is not an easy move to shop in the city. It is not an easy move to take up opportunities such as are offered by large populations as far as cost-of-living reductions are concerned. These students need to be able to qualify to receive the independent youth allowance and paddle their own canoes independent of their families. That is what I thought independent youth allowance was all about. Now we are suddenly being confronted with a situation where the minister decides if your parents earn too much. We are moving here into the politics of envy, I am sure. This policy, I suggest, is just to appease Labor voters and for it to be seen that the Labor minister is doing something to stop these incredibly wealthy people from having their children attend tertiary institutions with assistance from the government.
The whole thing is based on the fallacy that $150,000 for a household taxable income in the Pilbara is somehow some vast amount. Labourers are being paid nearly $100,000 a year and out of that is a margin that allows them to live and save. Is this minister denying students from those sorts of families the opportunity for any government assistance to attend tertiary institutions? The whole situation is untenable. This government, I thought, operated in the interests of all people. I would not have expected them to promote policies that distinguish between one sector of the community and another. Surely our children, our future, have a right to be treated as individuals, especially if they are going to have a crack at qualifying for an independent youth allowance. But they cannot apply for that because they are being saddled with a classification according to their parents’ income. To have a situation where we are demanding more and more professional people move to the country and operate and not have the opportunity—(Time expired)

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—There is no argument that the youth allowance provisions needed changing. My view is that all kids who have no choice but to leave home to study their chosen pathway, be it at TAFE or university, should have access to youth allowance with a sensible asset or income test applied to it. However, that is not what we have here. We have here a Deputy Prime Minister who put together the legislation, came to the dispatch box time and time again, and defended her legislation. She said that it was right and that we were always wrong.
Then the minister realised that she had made a mistake after she got a lot of feedback and she realised that the members of the House on the opposition side were not just making this up. She then decided that she would take retrospectivity out and make some changes around the edges. Then she came back to the dispatch box and she said that she was right and we were wrong. Every time, she was right and we were wrong. We have come to the position whereby we have now argued strongly again under the leadership of the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training, Christopher Pyne. He has determined that we have been able to achieve more concessions from the minister, who as I said has argued at the dispatch box day after day that we are wrong and she is right and that everybody is better off under her proposal and that we are making this up.
Under the leadership and guidance of the shadow minister, the opposition has been able to get more concessions for regional students. However, we have come to a point where the concessions are for some and not for others. That is a fundamental problem. It is a fundamental problem when the minister continually comes to the dispatch box and argues that her policy is right and her legislation is right and then it continually gets changed. It was a fundamental problem when the Deputy Prime Minister stood up at the dispatch box—I took exception to this—and told everybody in Australia who was listening that families who earn up to $140,000 per annum could access youth allowance to help support their children at university.
What the Deputy Prime Minister did not say was, ‘Okay, if you’ve got two children at university, you will receive $2.80 per fortnight of the youth allowance.’ No. She led the Australian people to believe through those comments that students would get the full youth allowance if their families earned $140,000 per annum. I see that she has honed her press release and rectified her comments. She now says the parental income test will be raised so that families with two children studying away from home can earn more than $140,000 before the allowance is cut completely. In fact, the truth is that they will receive $2.80 per fortnight per child. What do you get if you have one child at university and the parents earn $140,000? If you have one dependent child at university and the parents earn more than $140,000, you get zero. That is the minister’s own calculation.
I am proud of the Nationals and I am proud of Fiona Nash and her carriage of this through her inquiry on this issue and through listening to the students of Australia telling her what the problems are. The problem that we have now is that some will get access to something that they previously did not have—they will get access to the scholarships on offer that the minister talks about and they will get access to youth allowance—but others will have access to youth allowance removed from them. That is the problem: some will get access to something they never had, but others will have taken away what they currently have.
That is the wrong part of this legislation. That is the part we would like to see changed. Inner regional areas should be included within this proposal and the minister should again agree that she has made a mistake and that the members of the opposition are standing up in earnest for the people that they represent. They are not crying wolf; they are crying the reality of living in regional Australia. They would like to see all students—(Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—Ensuring that we have the skills base in regional Australia is vital for our economic prosperity. It is vital for the prosperity of this nation because education is the key to meeting the future skills needs in regional areas. But there is, in this country, great inequality in access to education. The ability to live at home and study your course of choice is an option available to all too few regional students. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister’s decision to eliminate the gap year pathway to independent youth allowance was so short-sighted. Educational costs for regional people are so much more when they have to live away from home because they have no choice.
Many regional students are not just choosing between one education institution and another. They have to leave their home towns to study their course of choice, which provides the skills needed in their home towns. It is kids from regional areas that are the most likely to return and provide the future accountants, doctors, lawyers and highly skilled trades professionals that those regional areas need. Many courses are not offered in regional centres, even the larger ones.
Fortunately, under the pressure from the Nationals and our coalition partners, the Liberals, the minister has done a welcome backflip indeed. We have a long way to go to deliver equity for regional students, but the minister’s backdown certainly has addressed the very worst elements of her original legislation. Getting rid of the retrospective elements in the legislation was an important, positive step. I think retrospective legislation in any form is always a problem. When people have made plans based on the situation that existed at the time and then they have the rug pulled out from under their feet, it is just unacceptable. This original legislation was definitely unacceptable.
The government has, to its credit, agreed to retain the original gap-year pathway for people living within certain boundaries but, unfortunately, drawing lines on a map has meant that the devil is in the detail of this proposal. We welcome the youth allowance pathway being retained in centres in my electorate such as Bellingen, Bowraville, Dorrigo, Macksville, Nambucca Heads, South West Rocks and Wooli. Those centres retain access to the youth allowance gap-year pathway. However, people living in centres such as Coffs Harbour, Urunga, Arrawarra, Kempsey, Port Macquarie and, in Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin’s electorate, Grafton will miss out. There are winners and there are losers under these changes and, unfortunately, there are many losers.
The minister claimed that there was great equity in the new income test. As the member for Riverina has rightly pointed out, a family on $140,000 a year with two young people at university will get the princely sum of $2.80 a fortnight each. I have to say that, from talking to university students in my electorate, $2.80 a fortnight is not going to go very far toward ensuring their continued participation in further education. If the family has one child at uni they get zero. We have to encourage regional youth to go to university. It is good economic policy and it is good social policy, and these measures, whilst an improvement on what was originally put forward by the minister, fall far short of what is required to reform the system to support youth in further study.
We see billions of dollars wasted on a home insulation program. We see the shonkies ripping off the government. We see the charlatans entering the industry. They are everywhere. Much of $2½ billion has been wasted. We see billions being wasted under the Building the Education Revolution program because we are paying far too much for our school buildings—in many cases, 100 per cent over what should have been paid. The waste from these two programs alone would have financed a high-quality youth support system at university for years into the future.
This bill has been improved, but this country has a long way to go before we will have a system of support for our youth at university that is a 21st-century outcome. I certainly welcome the improvements and will undertake as a member of a coalition government to put in place the changes that will be needed to support our youth in going on to further education.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,25,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—To summarise this debate, I find it intriguing that, in opposition, members of the coalition have found their voice and the only tune they know is hypocrisy. When they were in government the participation rates of country students in tertiary education at universities went backwards. Where was all this passion for equity and rural participation then? Where was all this spirit of reform and support for students from country areas in universities then? Where was it? Of course they did not do one thing about it. Anybody in this House in this debate tonight who was a member of the Howard government deserves to bear the brand ‘hypocrite’ because they did not do anything about it.
Now, having listened to so much hypocrisy, let us deal with the factual assertions made during these speeches—these so-called ‘factual’ assertions, which are 100 per cent wrong. What is in this package? One hundred and fifty thousand scholarships. That is 29 times more than anything that was offered under the Howard government in the Commonwealth Scholarships Program they talk about. One hundred thousand students around the country will benefit. Some will get youth allowance for the first time. Some will get a greater rate of youth allowance. Coalition members speaking in this debate continue to distort it by pretending that the only way a student can get youth allowance is by becoming independent. That is completely untrue, 100 per cent nonsense, a complete distortion. The primary way of getting youth allowance under this package is qualifying on your parental income. You do not have to take a gap year. You can be in a family on, say, $70,000 a year and have kids who need to move away from home. They will get benefits, and they would have missed out under the Howard government’s scheme. The prime way of becoming eligible for youth allowance is directly on parental income.
Of course we are talking about bringing the independence age down from 25 to 22. I was amazed by the contribution from the member for Kalgoorlie, who said students should be judged on their own income. We are the party that has brought to the parliament the proposition to bring the independence age down. He sat in a government with an independence age that was put up to 25 and would have voted for every piece of that legislation.
Then members like the member for Kalgoorlie ask, ‘Why do you means test?’ We means test to put dollars into the pockets of people who need it the most. The pension is means tested. Family tax benefit is means tested. Every social security benefit in this country is means tested. If the Liberal Party now stands for a universalist system of welfare payments for every income category, I will be amazed; we will be hearing more from John Howard and Peter Costello if that has happened—if their new vision is that we should wake up in Sweden with the associated tax rates. What a load of nonsense! In government everything they did was means tested. Indeed, the grand new paid parental leave scheme of the Leader of the Opposition is what? It is means tested at $150,000—the same income cut-off in these amendments. So, if the member for Kalgoorlie and others reckon means testing is wrong, they had better get on to the Leader of the Opposition about his paid parental leave scheme, because obviously they do not support that either, let alone our current pension arrangements, let alone our current family tax benefit arrangements—and the list goes on.
What else is in this package? There are $4,000 relocation scholarships to make a difference to kids and the start-up scholarships that I have spoken about. This is a package that will benefit students across the country. When you run the geographic spread, every electorate is a winner. More people in every electorate qualify for youth allowance under this package than under the old Howard government arrangements. They are the facts, not the hypocrisy that we have heard from the other side.
On the question of amendments to this bill I freely acknowledge that when this bill was first brought to the parliament there were legitimate concerns about students who had made their arrangements before it could have been known that the student income support scheme was going to change.
(Extension of time granted)
When we brought this bill to the parliament, yes, there was a problem for students in the transition between the old and the new schemes. It was raised by members of the government backbench. To be fair, it was raised by some members of the coalition backbench. It was raised by the rural Independents in the parliament. It was raised by the Greens and by Senator Xenophon and it was fixed in negotiation with the Greens and Senator Xenophon—fully and completely fixed. The opposition are now trying to take credit for those amendments. They had absolutely nothing to do with those amendments. Those amendments that made sure that people were not caught in transition problems were wholly agreed between the government and the Greens and Senator Xenophon, and I thank them for their maturity in dealing with those amendments. They are the ones who deserve the credit for having negotiated those amendments for a problem that was raised by Labor backbenchers and rural Independents in this House.
Listening to the speeches that have just been given, one would be absolutely amazed to know—when coalition speaker after coalition speaker has got up and bagged these amendments—these amendments are before this House because they were agreed with the coalition. There is no other reason they are here. They are before this House because they were agreed with the coalition. If the coalition does not like them, why did you agree with them? What a load of old cobblers! They were agreed with the coalition and then speaker after speaker has got up and said, ‘We do not like the index.’ The index is the index that has been used across government for geographic divisions of this country since 2001. If you do not like this index, I am very happy for any member of the coalition to say, ‘Every minute I was a member of the Howard government since 2001 I supported this index and I was wrong every minute that I did it.’ To construe this index as something that is only used for health programs is 100 per cent wrong. It is used for other programs, including education and child care. I have not put any lines on a map. I have got the index that has been accepted as the appropriate index across government, across departments, across the Howard government, across the Rudd Labor government—

Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—
—since 2001, and no amount of caterwauling by the member for Mackellar will change that simple truth.

Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—

(Ms AE Burke)—The member for Mackellar may find herself amusing but others do not.
—On the question of the delivery of these benefits, opposition members now say there is something with wrong with the index. Well, it is their index. Then we had the member for Hinkler suggest that somehow it is neglectful that my department or my office did not come up with a purpose-specific map of Australia for student income support. It is a pretty tough thing to do when the first time the opposition ever raised with us that they would accept a geographic division of the country on these questions was last Tuesday. How was one to do a purpose-specific map from last Tuesday? Obviously, we used the map that is across government. The change to the map—the so-called great victory that the opposition have had on all of this—is to change the circumstances for 1,900 students in a revenue neutral change that is being paid for with a small reduction in student start-up scholarships. They fought all these months, caused all these uncertainties, promulgated a billion dollar plan; they have settled for an amendment of less than $100 million for 1,900 students.
I conclude by saying that, in respect of the coalition contributions, they say this is not enough. Well, if they do not think it is enough, make a promise to the electorate that if they are elected as the government at the next election they will spend half a billion or a billion more to deliver what they say they want to deliver. The only political promise from the opposition at the moment is that, in government, they would have a review. Every opposition member who has spoken in this debate and said they would fix this in government is not telling the truth. The only thing that they have committed to is a review. All of this expectation raising and now they are walking away from the students whose expectations they have raised. It is a dreadful and cruel hoax.
I conclude by thanking the people who have worked hard on this package in my department and ought not to have been the subject of criticism in this debate: Robyn Shannon, Dianne Peacock, Alison Morehead, Colin Caldwell, Oliver Caddick, Robert Griew, Brett Harris, Dannie Edmonds and Marg Sykes. And of course thanks to my own staff, particularly to Jim Round, for their work on delivering these beneficial changes for Australian students.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The government, working closely with the opposition, moved a number of amendments to this bill in the Senate. Both parties agree that these amendments improve the bill. The government’s amendments moved the start date from 1 January 2010 to 1 July 2010; changed the definition of ‘unfair’ to include the consideration of detriment to the consumer; removed the minister’s power to blacklist certain terms; introduced specific criteria that the minister must take into account when listing examples on the grey list; and made a number of technical and transitional changes. The opposition moved an amendment to remove two rebuttal presumptions in the unfair contract terms provisions of the bill. The removal of these rebuttal presumptions would undermine the ability of private consumers to use the unfair contract terms law at all. Therefore, the government could not agree to this amendment. Senator Xenophon also moved a number of amendments, none of which the government could agree to. I commend the amendments.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This
bill
implements the decision, announced by the government on 23 December 2008, to establish the position of the National Security Legislation Monitor.
The independent National Security Legislation Monitor will review and report on the operation, effectiveness and implications of counterterrorism and national security legislation on an ongoing basis.
The government’s aims in establishing the monitor are, firstly, to ensure that the laws which Australia has enacted or enhanced since 11 September 2001 to specifically address the threat of terrorism or security related concerns operate in an effective and accountable manner and, secondly, that these laws are consistent with Australia’s international obligations, including our human rights, counterterrorism and international security obligations. We all remain hopeful that one day there will be a time when the threat of terrorism will diminish and make these laws no longer necessary, and on that basis we hope the monitor will also be able to consider the extent to which our counterterrorism and national security laws remain necessary.
This bill puts in place a mechanism for the regular review of Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation and will provide for greater public confidence in the operation of those laws. One way it does this is through the monitor considering if the laws contain appropriate safeguards for protecting individuals’ rights.
The proposals in this bill reflect the government’s commitment to strong counterterrorism laws that protect the security of Australians, while at the same time preserving the values and freedoms that are part of the Australian way of life.
Since 2006 a number of inquiries into different aspects of our terrorism and national security legislation have recommended the introduction of an independent reviewer to provide comprehensive and ongoing oversight. In its report of December 2006 the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) observed:
The Independent Reviewer, if adopted, will provide valuable reporting to the Parliament and help to maintain public confidence in Australia’s specialist terrorism laws.
That report was essentially bipartisan. In his November 2008 report on the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef, the Hon. John Clarke QC recommended:
… consideration be given to the appointment of an independent reviewer of Commonwealth counter-terrorism laws.
The Clarke report supported:
… the notion of ensuring that the system is balanced between the need to endeavour to prevent terrorism and the need to protect an individual’s rights and liberties. An independent reviewer could play an important part in striking this necessary balance.
The United Kingdom has an independent reviewer of terrorism laws, currently a position held by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, who conducts regular reviews into different aspects of the United Kingdom’s counterterrorism legislation, including the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. I indicate before this parliament the tremendous support Lord Carlile has provided to us in considering and discussing issues and assisting us to form a view as to the appropriate model for Australia.
Like the United Kingdom model, the role of the monitor will be undertaken by one person who will be expected to be independent from the current administration of the counterterrorism legislation. In line with the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee’s recommendations, the inclusion of the word ‘independent’ in the title of the office and in the title of the bill has more than simply symbolic value. It reflects the notion of independence as fundamentally important to the position of the monitor. Although the bill does not formally require the monitor to be a lawyer, the monitor must have sufficient experience in the criminal law and be of high standing in the community. In recognition of the importance of this appointment, the bill requires that before a recommendation on appointment is made to the Governor-General the Prime Minister must consult with the Leader of the Opposition. That will be done.
In order to bring clarity to the monitor’s role and function, the counterterrorism and national security legislation within the scope of the monitor’s consideration is outlined in the bill, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry in October 2008 into similar legislation to establish an independent reviewer of terrorism laws.
The bill provides the framework within which the monitor can review the relevant legislation. The monitor may also initiate his or her own investigations or the Prime Minister may refer a matter to the monitor to review within a specified time frame.
Turning to the functions of the monitor, the monitor will be required to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation, which primarily includes the legislation which has been specifically enacted to counter terrorism and related security threats. However, the monitor is also given the ability to review other Commonwealth legislation, such as general Commonwealth criminal legislation, to the extent that it relates to Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation. The monitor’s functions also require the monitor to consider whether Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation contains appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individual citizens. As well, the monitor must consider whether these laws remain proportionate to any threat of terrorism or the threat to national security or both and whether they remain necessary to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism and terrorism related activity. Recognising the valuable contribution to the bill made by the Senate, the monitor is also specifically required to assess whether Australia’s counter-terrorism or national security legislation is being used for matters unrelated to terrorism or national security.
When reviewing Australia’s counterterrorism legislation, the monitor must give particular emphasis to that legislation which has been used or considered in the current and previous financial year. This will ensure not only that the monitor reviews those laws as they have been applied in practice but also that the monitor’s resources are used effectively and wisely with respect to current circumstances.
In reviewing the legislation, the monitor must have regard to Australia’s international obligations, as I have mentioned, including human rights obligations, counterterrorism obligations and international security obligations as well as the agreed national counter-terrorism arrangements between the Commonwealth, states and territories.
The monitor must report his or her comments to the Prime Minister on an annual basis. The bill, as amended by the Senate, now requires the monitor to produce both a classified and a declassified version of the annual report. Edited as necessary on the grounds of operationally sensitive, national security classified or cabinet information, that declassified annual report will be laid before each house of parliament and will therefore be available for parliamentary and public scrutiny.
In response to the Senate committee’s recommendation, the bill has been amended to enable the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to refer matters relating to Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation to the monitor. The monitor would only be able to examine matters referred by the PJCIS if they are within the monitor’s functions. The monitor would not be compelled to act on the committee’s reference and the monitor would retain discretion in dealing with any reference provided by the committee. This would ensure that the monitor’s resources would be effectively used and the monitor would be able to report back to the PJCIS references in the annual report.
To ensure the monitor can conduct a thorough review of legislation, a provision has been made for the monitor to have access to national security classified documents and operationally sensitive information if that information is required for the proper performance of his or her functions.
The bill provides the monitor with the power to compel the giving of sworn testimony. Further, the monitor has the power to hold both public and private hearings if a person is giving evidence that discloses operationally sensitive information. In addition, the monitor has the power to summon a person and to compel the production of documents and things. These powers are supported by criminal offences for conduct in the nature of contempt. In the performance of his or her functions, it is expected that the monitor will have regard to the functions and roles of other oversight and accountability agencies and those agencies that have functions relating to the implementation of Australia’s counter-terrorism and national security legislation.
The bill enables the monitor to liaise with other key bodies, such as the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Human Rights Commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner and the head of any Commonwealth, state or territory agency. The role of the monitor will complement the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and other oversight bodies, but it will not duplicate their roles.
The bill also contains a number of standard miscellaneous and administrative provisions. The bill provides for the monitor’s terms and conditions of appointment, remuneration and allowances, leave, the possibility of outside employment, disclosure of interests, resignation, termination of appointment and acting arrangements. It goes without saying that heavy emphasis is also placed on the need for the monitor to safeguard appropriately and maintain the operationally sensitive information or national security classified documents entrusted to him or her.
A new independent review mechanism will ensure that Australia’s laws underpinning Australia’s counter-terrorism and national security regime are effective as the threat to Australia’s national security interests evolve. Importantly, the impartiality of the monitor, as envisaged in this bill, will strike a necessary balance between the need to prevent terrorist activities from threatening Australia’s way of life and the need to protect our individual rights and liberties.
The debate about establishing in Australia an independent reviewer of counterterrorism laws is not new. This bill represents implementation of bipartisan recommendations, as I have indicated, of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Mr Clarke’s inquiry into the case of Dr Mohamed Haneef and the Sheller committee of 2006. I also commend some individual members who have personally agitated for the establishment of this office. The calls to establish this role have now been answered and I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—One of the most profound consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 was the need for governments around the world to assess their capability to deal with the new and frightening threat of international terrorism. In many cases there was a need for the introduction of domestic legislation to try and deal with the new challenges as they appeared. In Australia, as elsewhere, this meant quite a large amount of legislation which tried to address this problem while still providing a balance between the protection of the rights that we all treasure and the civil liberties that we take for granted and the need for public and national security. It is up to governments to make a judgment about what the right balance is. They have to strike a balance between individual rights and the provision of national security, which is of course increasingly demanding. It is not an easy balance to strike, and clearly that balance is open to debate. We have seen that extensively in this chamber with other bills of this type.
Terrorism is a profound challenge to this society and to many others, and we should never make the mistake of underestimating how serious that threat is. The Australian public are entitled to expect that their government will do all it can to provide for their personal security and the national security. That is what I believe much of the legislation that has been introduced in Australia does. It seeks to provide that level of security and confidence that we can meet the kinds of challenges with which we are confronted. There is plenty of evidence in relation to the success we have had in meeting these challenges. That said, governments need to be cautious about the way we act. It is in this context that the opposition welcomes the
Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2010.
I now want to move to the specific provisions of the bill. The central purpose of this legislation is the creation of a safeguard, an independent reviewer, to ensure that Australia’s counter-terrorism legislation is effective but also contains appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals in our society. This is not a new idea. As the Attorney mentioned in his speech, the office of the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws has been in place in the United Kingdom for quite some time. The bill, or at least the concept it adopts, has its origins in the reports of the Sheller committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in 2006, which were themselves informed by the regime that applies in the United Kingdom.
It is also worth mentioning—and the Attorney neglected this in his speech—that in March 2008 the member for Kooyong moved to introduce a private member’s bill to appoint an independent reviewer of terrorism laws. But that motion was gagged by the government. Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate, by Senators Troeth and Humphries, in November 2008. It was passed in the Senate but it failed in the House. The government’s bill in many respects resembles the arrangements in force in the UK, as applied by the Independent Reviewer, Lord Carlile. However, there are important differences. The bill comes with a series of amendments which the coalition will support. These amendments make the bill resemble the member for Kooyong’s bill in almost every respect, and much more so than the initial version of the government’s bill.
It is almost two years since the manager of government business marshalled the numbers to quash the member for Kooyong’s initiative, although quietly within this bill the government have adopted most of his policy as their own. The key difference between the government’s original bill and the regime proposed by the coalition is the notion of independence. In keeping with the approach of the Rudd government, the bill in its initial form required that the monitor be subject to the direction of the executive—personified by the Prime Minister. Any ad hoc inquiry would have been subject to prime ministerial approval. Any report deriving from it would be both secret—there having been in the initial bill no provision for tabling—and subject to executive micromanagement. These provisions, following the recommendations of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, have now been abandoned by the government. The government’s amendments address the coalition’s concerns raised in the committee and restore independence, which is essential to the concept of this office. The coalition will therefore be supporting the amendments and, with carriage of the amendments, this bill, which for practical purposes is our own.
The principle behind this bill is protective. It is to add to the armoury of parliamentary surveillance another mechanism designed to ensure that the counter-terrorism laws, which were amended so as to expand the executive and policing powers of the state in extraordinary times by introducing into our laws exceptional measures, are not allowed to become ordinary measures with the passing of time. The government and the parliament were of the view that some traditional protection should be reviewed and that the policing functions of the state should be extended through such devices as preventive detention orders and control orders, which of course were controversial at the time. It was done in the service of the fundamental obligation of this government and of all parliaments—that is, to protect the public interest.
Those of us who remember those debates also remember that the government which introduced them, the previous Howard government, made it clear at the time that these were extraordinary measures. This bill introduces an Office of the Independent Monitor, which we expect will bring an objective and detached mind to the question of both the functionality of the laws and the necessity for their continuance. This can only be beneficial and it has proven to be beneficial in other jurisdictions. Subject to the amendments I have just foreshadowed, the coalition supports the passage of this bill.",REPS,<title>INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—We live in times when, in a democracy, the security of a nation such as ours requires laws which are not customarily considered appropriate in our society but which nonetheless are necessary to ensure the safety of the population. Since 11 September 2001, that has become a dramatic reality for far too many people around the world and certainly for Australian citizens. The
Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2010
does have bipartisan support and it should enjoy that bipartisan support. It is sound legislation which enhances the oversight of the antiterrorism laws that are necessary in our land.
I was a bit taken aback by some of the contributions of the shadow minister, the member for Stirling, when he spoke just then and, in particular, his reference—in part accurate—to the private member’s bill moved by the member for Kooyong. I was not going to make reference to that, but I think it is worth pointing out, given the contribution we have just heard from the shadow minister, that as with so many other things that we now deal with those opposite had control of this parliament and, indeed, control of both chambers of this parliament to put through any legislation their party room wished without the need to negotiate with minor parties in the Senate. For part of that time, they had an absolute majority. At any time during the last eight or nine years of their office, they could have introduced legislation of the kind that was referred to in the private member’s bill.
Frankly, most commentators and, I think, most people in this parliament saw that manoeuvre for what it was. It was a political manoeuvre. It was a political stunt. In saying that, I do not for one minute say that those who spoke to it, supported it or moved it did not believe in it. Indeed, I think the member for Kooyong does believe in it. He would have been in a very small minority in the Howard government in seeking to pursue that. The Howard government had no desire at the time it had the opportunity to enact this sort of legislation. So to try and make some cheap political point, as the shadow minister did just then, is I think twisting the history a little bit too much. This bill is a good bill. We do not need to play the sorts of games that the shadow minister just sought to play in his contribution.
Let us look at the importance of this legislation. Reference has been made to the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in the course of the previous parliament and deservedly so. A good deal of the issues dealt with in this legislation arise from it and the committee has a very well deserved name and respect in this parliament for the quality of the work it does and the bipartisan way in which it goes about looking at matters of this kind. It is a bit alarming to look at the attitude, though, which was adopted back in 2006 when the committee took evidence in its review of the legislation.
During the committee’s hearings in August 2006, officers of the Attorney-General’s Department indicated to the committee’s inquiry that reviews of all of the terrorism legislation were not being planned. No doubt that was the instruction from the government of the day. However, that clearly was not a view that the committee in 2006 regarded as acceptable. As a result, the committee proposed the appointment of an independent reviewer of terrorism laws, based on much the same model as the reviewer in the United Kingdom. In its report in December 2006, the committee said:
To date, post enactment review has been sporadic and fragmented with a focus on specific pieces of legislation rather than the terrorism law regime as a whole. This has limited the opportunity for comprehensive evaluation and highlights the need for an integrated approach to ensure ongoing monitoring and refinement of the law, where necessary.
That stands in stark contrast to the actual policy of the former Howard government, but I am delighted that, in opposition, they have changed their position on this and I am delighted that this bill is before the parliament with bipartisan support.
The independent National Security Legislation Monitor will have an important function in advising government and, through government, the people of Australia about the suitability of our antiterrorism laws. That will enable somebody with a different perspective—a well-qualified but different perspective—to provide advice which can be considered. Ultimately, it is a matter for the parliament whether the legislation should be changed and whether the parliament believes it has got the settings right. However, in matters of this kind, when legislation is being considered which impinges upon civil liberties and rights of individuals and which in the past would not have been agreed to by parliament, in those sorts of areas it is important that we have available to us as legislators a wide range of good quality advice. Having an independent office such as this will for the first time provide that advice for our consideration and, importantly, it will for the first time provide a new set of eyes not just, as the committee in 2006 noted, looking at parts of bills that may be before the chamber but looking at the totality of the various pieces of legislation that together make up our national security legislative framework.
The independent National Security Legislation Monitor will have the function to review on his or her own initiative the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia’s counter-terrorism and national security laws and any other law of the Commonwealth to the extent that it relates to Australia’s counter-terrorism and national security legislation. As the current Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I welcome this development. I think it will enhance the collective knowledge and ensure as best we can that we do have effective legislation which provides for the safety of Australian citizens with the safeguards we expect to be in place to protect our civil liberties.
I am also pleased that the bill makes provision for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to refer matters to the independent legislation monitor. I think that is a very useful addition to the processes of oversight in this parliament. Of course, the work of the monitor, as important as it is, is still different to the work that we, as members of the parliament, are engaged in. It will still be an important function of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to itself review the legislation, both bills before the parliament at any point in time and the existing legislation dealing with counter-terrorism related matters. The committee, as it has in the past, will continue to look at those bills and the legislation and, where it thinks it appropriate, will make recommendations to government, the parliament or both about changes that the committee thinks are warranted.
I am also pleased to see the principle of bipartisanship embodied in the appointment of this office. As with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Governor-General will make an appointment of the person to fill the role of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, but first the Prime Minister is required under the bill before us to consult with the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. That is a thoroughly appropriate mechanism. Many people who are listening to or interested in this debate may well think that has always been the case; it has not. It is a result of reviews conducted by previous Labor governments and royal commissions. It reminds me that this bipartisan consultation about the appointment of these officers is fundamental to the public confidence in the work of these intelligence agencies and, in particular, the work of those who supervise the intelligence agencies.
In days not that far past, when this bipartisan consultation did not occur, we also did not have effective oversight by parliamentary committees. In the days before the inspector-general we had situations in which intelligence agencies were responsible to nobody other than the ministers of the Crown to whom they reported. If you have a look at those decades in which that was the case, there was a situation where the agencies, left to their own devices, not surprisingly got up to all sorts of things secretly that the Australian public, and I suspect even the parliament of the day, would not have sanctioned. We know this because there were royal commissions. Some of those earlier royal commissions have now been made public after the 30-year rule, and they do not paint a very flattering picture of the activities of some of those organisations. Not only were they incompetent in many respects in the discharge of their core responsibilities but they clearly strayed from their core work and were engaged in a raft of other activities that were unsuitable.
Thankfully, following a couple of royal commissions about a decade or so apart and the actions of this parliament in establishing oversight bodies, such as the inspector-general, the parliamentary committee and now this independent legislation monitor, we have a greater degree—I think a very high degree—of confidence in the community about the work of these agencies. I have made the comment to some of those involved in the agencies that, whilst this review process is no doubt a bit of a pain in the neck for our intelligence community from time to time, it is a heck of a lot better than letting them have free rein for 10 years and then ending up having a royal commission that publicly dismembers them limb by limb and rebuilds them from the ground up. If you go back over a 25- to 30-year period through the sixties, seventies and eighties, you actually find that was pretty much the way things happened. That is not good for anybody. It is not good for the security of Australia, because the work these agencies do is very important. It is certainly not good for governments of the day, because security of the people is one of the most important responsibilities that any government, irrespective of politics, has before it.
It is important that governments are confident that the work they need to have done is being done effectively and within the remit that has been given to them. We have seen examples in the past where government has introduced legislation, ostensibly as a result of the threat of terrorism, which has not been well received in the community, has not been well supported by all of the state and territory governments and indeed was not supported by the Senate. My mind goes back to the legislation introduced not long after 9-11 in 2001. The legislation that was introduced during that period was extremely controversial. I doubt that many people would recall the provisions of the actual bills that were introduced by the government at the time, but they were referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, then chaired by David Jull, a person for whom I have a great deal of respect. That committee did an outstanding job in reviewing that legislation and made a number of recommendations for substantial change to the bills that were introduced by the government of the day. Amazingly, even though many of those recommendations were not immediately endorsed by the then Attorney-General or then Prime Minister, subsequent to their passage through the parliament both the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister were on the record in speeches inside or outside of this parliament acknowledging the improvements that had been made by that parliamentary review process.
As I said earlier, that parliamentary review process is important and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security will continue to undertake that function. I warmly welcome the creation of this independent monitor. I think it is a significant improvement in the way in which we calibrate our counterterrorism laws to make sure that they are as a whole taken together, that they are effective in protecting Australian people and that they impinge upon the basic principles of liberty upon which our democracy is founded only to the extent that is necessary. I commend the bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I move:
That the requested amendments be made.
The government amendments to this bill are unrelated to the introduction of weekly payments. The bill is a convenient vehicle to make an unrelated amendment to the family assistance law. I thank the House for its assistance in bringing on this bill and debating the amendments in a non-controversial manner. The amendments have been supported by the opposition and minor parties in the Senate. This amendment is a necessary consequential amendment due to timing changes in other legislation, specifically the changed start date to youth allowance changes. These amendments will delay the start date of the new education participation requirements for family tax benefit—FTB—children aged 16 to 20 years until 1 July 2010. This aligns with the new start date of the youth allowance changes.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I rise tonight to support the
Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2010. The bill is important and does a number of things that I think many in this place would agree are worthy. However, I do want to address some of the points made by the member for Brisbane. In his remarks he made a number of important points about this bill and the lead-up to this bill. However, he did speak about the member for Kooyong and his motives.
I am glad that he raised the member for Kooyong in relation to the development of this piece of legislation before us tonight, because for a member in this chamber to label the member for Kooyong’s proposal for bill for a national security legislation monitor as a political stunt would be doing the member for Kooyong a great disservice. He is a passionate believer in this particular bill, and in what this bill means, and I think all members of this House know that. So I think it is unfortunate for the member for Brisbane to accuse the member for Kooyong of engaging in some sort of political chicanery in something that he is passionate about.
There is no doubt that, when the member for Kooyong attempted to introduce and speak on the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws Bill 2008, the actions of the government and the Leader of the House in gagging the member for Kooyong were extremely unfortunate. There is no doubt today, looking at the provisions of this bill we are examining tonight, that if it were not for the member for Kooyong introducing that earlier bill, and attempting to push this very important and worthy cause, we may not now be facing this worthy development in legislation in Australia today.
In examining what this bill provides for, it comes with a series of amendments which the opposition supports. The amendments make the bill resemble the member for Kooyong’s bill in almost every regard. I just want to make that clear to the member for Brisbane: the amendments almost make this bill identical to the member for Kooyong’s Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Laws Bill 2008. So I think to assign some sort of ill motive to the member for Kooyong in developing or speaking on this bill is poor indeed.
These amendments are important because the other point that the member for Brisbane made was that, in appointing a national security monitor, independence was one of the most important concepts. The key difference between the government’s original bill and the bill that was proposed by the coalition and the member for Kooyong was the notion of independence. It was one of the things that the member for Kooyong was particularly keen to ensure was in the final legislation. That is why we can support this bill now—independence is the hallmark of the monitor in the current bill before the House.
Having a monitor subject to the direction of any executive would lead to bad outcomes. I think having a monitor responsible to the Prime Minister or having any ad hoc inquiry subject to prime ministerial approval would be a weak outcome. Therefore, the amendments that have been proposed do give genuine independence to the monitor, and that is significant in what we are proposing.
What we are talking about in this legislation is having a monitor on laws that seek to limit the freedoms and the rights of citizens. The parliament has taken the view in recent times that, due to the dramatic security and other threats to the ongoing stability of Australia from terrorism, we should limit the rights of citizens in our country. That is something that we would only do in the most extreme circumstances, where the most extreme threats were faced. It is something that I think most of the Australian public has been willing to accept and accede to as long as parliament takes those measures appropriately and has oversight and monitoring of those powers.
There has been no experience of how these new developments in international terrorism and international antiterror laws will play out in the long term in relation to civil liberties, citizens’ rights and ongoing issues of government having too much power or authority over the individual or an individual’s life. The United Kingdom created an office of an independent reviewer of terrorism laws some time ago with that very view in mind. That was the motivation of the member for Kooyong, taking inspiration from the United Kingdom, to put forward a bill that would ensure that we have some monitoring and some safeguard against laws that may well be used aggressively in the future. So, as we progress through this period where terrorism is a major threat in world terms, we do need to constantly monitor and assess the efficacy and adequacy of and the need for laws such as security and terror laws in Australia. That is what the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2010 attempts to do and establish. It is our answer to the UK legislation.
The standing function of the monitor will be to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the counterterrorism and national security legislation. The monitor will have to report findings and recommendations to the Prime Minister on an annual basis, which of course is a worthy objective. I do want to endorse what the member for Brisbane said about bipartisanship in relation to this bill. Regardless of who is in government, I think it is important that the Leader of the Opposition be consulted in relation to who the monitor is and who the appointment is. Bipartisanship in relation to these matters is something that is worthy and that is to be lauded and it is a good objective of this bill.
The bill provides for the appointment of the monitor and prescribes the functions and framework for reviewing the relevant legislation. The bill also provides the monitor with the power to compel a witness to take an oath or an affirmation that the evidence given will be true. Further, the monitor has the power to hold both public and private hearings, which I think is another important feature of this bill—that indeed there is the capacity for public hearings—and to compel the production of documents and things. This is supported by criminal offences for conduct in the nature of contempt. Again, obviously the monitor will require certain powers in this regard.
The fundamental difference between the bill as presented in its initial form and the bill as amended following the urgings of the coalition is that we were strongly of the view that, if you have a reviewer, it is important that you strongly support the apparatus of an independent reviewer of terrorism laws. I do think that if you had your so-called independent reviewer set up as a bureaucrat or in a similar vein as with other agencies, you would of course not have that independence. So it is very important that this amended legislation provides for that. I think it is worthy that they have allowed for an independent monitor to be in place.
In concluding, I do not want to speak for a long time on this bill tonight, because it is a worthy bill. I do want to say that the member for Kooyong’s motives are that he has followed this issue for some time, both in the United Kingdom and here, and he is well known as a person who has a passion for these issues. In relation to national security legislation it is important that we do have ongoing monitoring of the efficacy, the adequacy and the ongoing development of these laws and how they impact upon citizens in Australia. Having an independent monitor—I stress the word ‘independent’—as we as a coalition urged the government to do is a worthy and laudable objective. With the amendments, this is a bill that we can support.",REPS,<title>INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION MONITOR BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I rise in support of the
Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Bill 2010. It is pleasing to hear from opposition speakers that this bill, in the form in which it is now before this chamber, has the support of the opposition. It is of course the case that we have had very substantial debate in this country since late 2001, when the first of a series of antiterror laws were introduced by the Howard government, and those antiterror laws are, of course, rightly regarded by all in this place as temporary measures. They are regarded as temporary measures because they make extreme changes in some respects to what has been traditionally understood to be the balance between the liberties that Australians enjoy—indeed, the liberties that Australians have fought wars for—and the need for our authorities to be armed with necessary powers in order to combat the threat of terrorism.
It is because of the extreme nature of these measures and because they are rightly regarded as temporary measures that, at the time that the antiterror laws were debated in late 2001 and in 2002 and the years following, a substantial part of the debate was devoted to considering what length of review was appropriate for them and what type of sunset provisions ought to be introduced so as to ensure that temporary measures of the nature of these antiterror laws did not remain part of Australian legislation for any longer than they needed to. I can say that—and I think there would be some agreement, with the benefit of the years since these laws were passed—the sunset provisions that we find in the legislation introduced by the Howard government were inadequate. In fact, only division 3 of part III of the ASIO Act has a clear sunset clause and it brings on a review in 2016. It was because of the absence of sunset provisions applying generally to the Howard government’s antiterror laws that there have been repeated calls for other reviewing mechanisms, and those calls have included suggestions that there ought to be an independent reviewer of the antiterror legislation who would conduct regular reviews and bring to the attention of the government and the parliament any suggestions that there was no longer a need for these antiterror laws to be continued.
It is unfortunate that two of the opposition speakers who preceded me, the member for Mitchell and the member for Stirling, have sought in a sense to rewrite history. They have sought to forget the attitude that the Howard government took to the Sheller review in 2005, and that attitude was to implement not one of the 20 recommendations of the Sheller review.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—This week we have seen the first public signs of the internal battles going on in the background within the Rudd government. An explosive article by James Massola and Chris Johnson appeared in the
Canberra Times
last Saturday that has flashed a spotlight on the backroom dealings of this government. The article outlines in very careful detail just how advanced the plans are for a transition from the current Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister. The plans are particularly being developed by the dominant right-wing faction of the Labor Party. The article makes plain that senior figures on that side of the House have had enough of being bullied by this Prime Minister or, as some Labor members are describing it, being ‘keneallyed’ by him. These Labor members want to move the leadership sooner rather than later to the more agreeable Deputy Prime Minister.
Following the
Canberra Times
article, the story was given additional lift yesterday morning when the well-known supporter of the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Corangamite, spoke on the doors of his desire for the Deputy Prime Minister to become the Prime Minister. You can start to see the chess pieces being strategically moved around the building. The assumption is that this will occur post the next election and certainly that is where the smart money is right now. One punter has decided to put $2½ thousand with Centrebet that it will happen sooner.
The Prime Minister is so nervous that, thanks to the work of Simon Benson from the
Daily Telegraph, we know that key factional players were summoned to his office on Monday night for crisis talks. What is interesting is the pace at which Labor members are keenly positioning for the Gillard prime ministership.
—Who wrote this for you?
—I think the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy would be okay in a Gillard administration. For instance, who will be her deputy? My mail has it that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the member for Charlton, is busily positioning himself to be the front-runner. Minister Combet has been dubbed the Mr Fix-it of the government, but information provided to me suggests that fixing things is a speciality. In recent days I have been contacted by a couple of the minister’s Labor colleagues who are not what you would describe as supporters of the minister. They point to several examples of where the minister has been able to deftly move ‘political roadblocks’, as they describe them, without too much difficulty. For instance, they point out how easily the minister was able to gain a very safe Labor seat against the wishes of the local branches

although the seat is approximately 2,000 kilometres from where he lives. They point to the fact that the preselection contest was made significantly easier when the sitting member faced serious accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct. These allegations appeared on the front page of the
Sunday Telegraph
in an article titled ‘Rudd MP asked driver for sex’. In what has been described to me as a ‘miracle in timing’, the article appeared in the week that the then ACTU chief nominated for the seat.
Labor sources also suggest very strong links between interest in the Defence portfolio and the circumstances around the resignation of the then Minister for Defence. These discussions followed a story in the
Daily Telegraph
on Monday reporting on last week’s caucus meeting where the minister reportedly stole the thunder of the Prime Minister. The article says:
Kevin Rudd was ‘white-hot’ with anger. His new Mr Fix-it, Greg Combet, had stolen his thunder.
The Benson story goes into some detail of how the minister stole, or took, 45 minutes of the Prime Minister’s time and quotes the minister as saying, ‘I could get used to this.’ The story also reports the minister as saying to the Prime Minister:
If any of your staffers come near my office, I’ll throw them out myself.
This is pretty strong stuff to say to a Prime Minister and it is remarkable that a private discussion between the two of them was leaked verbatim. It is something to be noted. According to my Labor sources, this minister will stop at nothing to achieve what some would describe as his destiny. Whatever the case, we know that the volcano building inside the Labor government is going to explode sooner rather than later and the bodies will be strewn around this place for some time to come.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Labor Party</title>,Adjournment,32,1
"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—Prior to the last election, Kevin Rudd stood in Kings Park in Perth, Western Australia, overlooking the backdrop of the CBD. He promised in very vague terms that, under him, Western Australia would get more of its fair share of Commonwealth funding. Clearly, he never put any statements of fact around that; it was just some general statement that, under the new Labor government, Western Australia would be better off. When he was pressed on any of the detail he refused to give it. What we have found since Labor has come to power is that that promise has proved as hollow as most of the other promises that Labor made prior to its coming to government. Western Australia is substantially worse off as a result of the election of the Rudd Labor government.
Recently, the Commonwealth Grants Commission outlined a change in the funding formula of the GST, which will leave Western Australia $443 million worse off. Another example of where the Rudd Labor government has specifically targeted Western Australia is the $2½ billion condensate tax. This was essentially a tax on Western Australia because condensate is only produced in the offshore fields off our coast. This latest change to the funding formula of the GST means Western Australians will get only 48c in the dollar for the GST that they pay. This is in contrast to New South Wales, which receives 95c, Victoria, which receives 93c and Queensland which receives 91c in every dollar that they pay in GST revenue. The Western Australian Premier has indicated that this severe cut will place enormous pressure on the state’s finances and, as a result, it will affect the state’s capacity to deliver services in such areas as health, education and in other areas of social services.
The formula that the Commonwealth Grants Commission uses in the funding of the states is a very complicated business. The purpose of my standing up here today is to indicate that this is another slug to Western Australia and to show how hollow Kevin Rudd’s promise was prior to the last election that Western Australia would somehow receive its fair share under the election of a Labor government. The reality is, of course, completely different. In Western Australia, 11 out of 15 seats are held by federal Liberal members and, as a result, this Labor government pays very little attention to the state.
We are very concerned that the government has actually taken specific actions to decrease the ability of the Western Australian Liberal government to provide goods and services as is appropriate for a state government. The reality is that Kevin Rudd spends far more time overseas than he ever does in Western Australia. All the Western Australian members on our side, the opposition side, of the House are very concerned about the lack of interest that this government takes in Western Australia. We also believe very strongly that this government is bad for Western Australia.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I rise to indicate the coalition’s support for the
Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2010. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 stipulates that the act should be amended each year to incorporate the amount appropriated for the Australian Research Council and bring up to date the details of the fund administered by the ARC. The bill reflects a practice adopted in 2001 and applied annually ever since. It also provides for funding adjustments of approximately $889.6 million to allow the ARC to implement its budget initiatives and provides additional out-year funding.
In addition to providing indexation of existing appropriation accounts, the bill provides funding for three initiatives. Firstly, the research in bionic vision science and technology initiative will provide funding for research leading to the development of a functional bionic eye. The research funded through this initiative is expected to lead to significant innovation through collaboration. It is something that I particularly look forward to. The bionic eye has the potential to give sight and restore sight to many Australians from one end of our shores to the other and, indeed, to others overseas. The bionic eye project follows on from previous successful innovations in this area, such as the bionic ear, which provides hearing for those who are profoundly deaf or hard of hearing. That particular innovation has transformed the lives of many Australians. There are also expected to be other health outcomes resulting in significant spin-off and successful commercialisation.
Secondly, the Super Science Fellowships Scheme will seek to retain researchers in three key areas: space and astronomy; marine and climate; and future industries. The fellowships will provide funding of $72½ thousand a year plus 28 per cent on costs. One hundred researchers will benefit from these fellowships, and eligible organisations will administer these fellowships and provide $20,000 per participant to support the research projects they undertaken. The organisations hosting the fellowships, which commence this year, include Australian universities and research institutes, Australian government agencies and research functions like the CSIRO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, and the Anglo-Australian Observatory in the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio.
All members of the House should be well aware of the challenge we face in science education in Australia. We have seen recent reports over the last few weeks and have heard in broader discussion on the national curriculum of the need to encourage more students, particularly in senior years, to study science. We have seen the need to encourage and train more teachers in the science and maths field. This is a serious, long-term issue that needs to be worked on. We need to ensure that students’ interest in science is encouraged and harnessed at an early age so that they can go on to participate in these sorts of programs. A number in the science profession have high hopes of the draft national curriculum for science, but were—just like myself—bitterly disappointed that, when the draft curriculum was released, there was no workable implementation plan to go with it and no practical assistance given to implement some of the measures. Even in a field as important as science, education and innovation, the Rudd government is unfortunately all talk and no action.
Thirdly, there is continued funding for National Information and Communication Technology Australia. NICTA was established by the former coalition government in 2002 to ensure that Australia was able to fully harness the benefits this sector has to offer. As the shadow minister has said, the ICT sector has a critical role to play in continued innovation and development across all industries in Australia. Through two research nodes in Sydney and Canberra, NICTA is now a world-class organisation in its field which attracts internationally recognised reseachers, and it obviously benefits our domestic researchers to be able to work alongside internationally recognised researchers. It allows some of our younger, up-and-coming researchers to have access to some of the best brains and some of the highly recognised people in this field. The ICT sector is a fast-shifting field, and we need to be able to continually invest and allow the domestic flourishing of this sector; otherwise, we will be left behind.
In conclusion, the coalition does support Australian innovation and research. It is fundamental to our productivity. It is fundamental to the growth of our economy. We look forward to seeing the results and future work of great Australian scientists.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—Madam Deputy Speaker May, may I congratulate you on your elevation to that position of high esteem.
An opposition member—Lofty esteem.
—Absolutely, and very well deserved. I look forward to being under your leadership in the chamber, Madam Deputy Speaker, in future times. I rise to talk about the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, which I was a member of for nine years before this parliament. I regret not being on that committee anymore, but with a largely agricultural seat like mine, the seat of Barker, I of course take a great interest in the work the committee does even though I cannot participate in it. So I was very interested to see this report,
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We all know that climate change is here; it always has been. We can argue about whether it is anthropogenic or not, but the fact is we do have climate change and farmers for centuries or millennia have actually been adapting to climate change. In fact, people in Greenland took up farming in the medieval warm period when it was about two degrees warmer than it is now. That is why it was called Greenland, because it became green with the warming that was happening there between the 11th and 14th centuries. So farmers do adapt, and it is important that as a committee and as a parliament we look at how we can help farmers adapt to climate change.
I think it is rather ironic that in the chamber on 19 February 2008 I talked about the importance of adapting. I have always believed that the more important strategy for adapting to climate change was always going to be through direct action, which the coalition of course have put down as their policy on climate change, and this report talks about adapting. On 19 February 2008 I talked about how important it was to adapt, so I was quite bemused when, a couple of weeks after that speech, the then environment minister, Mr Garrett, tried to make fun of that in answer to a question on 11 March 2008. He said:
The member for Barker went on to advise that the most sensible approach to climate change would be ‘to adapt’—
in inverted commas, as if this was some revelation that it was a really stupid way to go. That was very interesting because, a couple of questions later, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, mentioned the importance for farmers to adapt to climate change. It really did make a mockery of the then minister for the environment, Mr Garrett, suggesting that I was somehow a bit loony to suggest that we should be adapting. That is exactly what this committee report is about. I will give you the title again:
The role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. As a farmer myself, I have adapted all my life.
—A very good one!
—I would like to think so. Last year we had the best crops on record. That was not due to any work that I did; it was actually due to the fact that the climate gave us a great season. In fact, if you were writing a script for a season, in 2009 we had it in my area. So you do adapt. I remember in 2006 suggesting to my son that I had a feeling we were not going to get much more rain. That was in about June. The predictions from the Bureau of Meteorology were that we might have a little bit below average rainfall for the rest of the year. In fact, it forgot to rain after June. Normally, May, June, July and August are our wettest months in our Mediterranean climate. I am glad we stopped sowing crops because it was the driest year in 117 years of recording. So the crops were a disaster and my area, which is generally drought free, found it had a year like no other. As a farming family we adapted to those circumstances.
If you go through the recommendations, there are some very good ones. For example, recommendation 2 states:
… the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, take more effective account of the needs and decision making processes of farmers—
I have just given you an example of that—
and ensure that the delivery of adaptation programs—
please listen, minister for the environment—
is flexible and responsive to the needs of farmers and rural communities.
I think that is a good recommendation. I note the member for New England has been a long-serving member on that same committee, and we worked together very strongly for the nine years that I was on it—and I think that was six years for you; you are now in your ninth year.
—Yes.
—Recommendation 3 is also very important because it says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, invest research funding in the following high priority areas:

Soil carbon sequestration—
Hello: coalition direct action policy; great stuff—
Soil stabilisation and pasture improvements using methods such as perennial pastures, pasture cropping, rotational grazing, biodynamic farming, minimum/no till cultivation and controlled traffic farming;
I can say from my own experience that we have been using those sorts of programs on our farm. Some of them are very successful, depending on the soil, the climate and what you are trying to achieve. Another recommendation referred to soil-water retention strategies and water-use efficiency. I think there is no doubt that that is very important: to get more crop per drop—in other words, to use our water more efficiently. South Australia, I think, have a proud record of being the most efficient irrigator in Australia. They have upgraded their infrastructure, which unfortunately seems to have stopped in the last couple of years under this federal government. Even though there is $6 billion set aside for it, it actually has had proven effects in South Australia—for example, the Loxton irrigation rehabilitation scheme in my electorate, where it saved huge amounts of water. I think it was something like 44 gigalitres annually just by using pipes rather than open channels, which seep and evaporate. Unfortunately, the state government at the time, who I might add was Labor, decided to sell those savings of 44 gigalitres rather than return it to the river. It would have had a much greater effect if that water had through its savings been returned to the health of the river rather than being sold off for a cash supply by the state government at the time. But you can do those sorts of things, and quite successfully.
The report then refers to energy on farms, and recommendation 6 states:
… the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agriculture sector and the development of alternative energy and alternative fuels on-farm, particularly in regard to:
Biofuels;
Biomass from agricultural waste; and
Biochar.
Hello: coalition direct action policy. What a great committee this is! It is actually adopting the coalition’s direct action policy in just about every recommendation. What a fantastic committee!
Recommendation 7 recommends:
… the Australian Government increase funding for research into improving the consistency and accuracy of weather and climate forecasting, especially at a seasonal and regional level.
Well, can I tell you, as a farmer probably the most important knowledge you can have is about the upcoming weather, whether it is trying to avoid rain because you are spraying or making sure that you sow at the right time and you have got the right moisture. So it is very important that more money is spent on that research.
I found recommendation 8 quite interesting. The committee recommended:
…
the Australian Government develop an education and training scheme for farmers in the understanding and use of weather and climate information.
In my experience I am not sure that is necessary. Every farmer I know knows a lot about the weather. That is what controls their lives, and they use every bit of the latest technology, going onto the Bureau of Meteorology website to get long-term and short-term forecasts or sometimes to find out what is happening in just the next couple of hours. If you go onto the website you can find very accurate forecasts by looking at the radar—some of us would have seen that on the cricket forecasts—which shows the weather patterns and where the weather is coming from.. So I am not convinced that that recommendation is going to be all that necessary. I am not saying that it is a bad recommendation; I am just not sure that we actually need to do a lot in that area.
Recommendation 10 is good because the committee recommended:
… the Australian Government, as part of its ongoing strategy development to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, develop a strategy to capture, evaluate and disseminate the range of farmer driven—
and that is the important thing, that they are farmer driven—
innovations that have a significant capacity to increase the resilience and productivity of farm enterprises.
Farmers in this country have got a really good record of inventions and innovations, going back as far as the stump-jump plough, for example, or the Sunshine harvester, the first motor driven harvester. Certainly by today’s standards you would think: ‘An eight-feet comb?’, but it was better than what they had with the horse and dray. Of course now we have 40-feet combs and huge headers for reaping. From that original innovation they have expanded and obviously moved on to something better. That original innovation happened in Australia and of course it progressed from there as time went on.
Recommendation 11 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government ensures that there is an overall body to receive and analyse research and co-ordinate research across the nation in relation to climate change adaptation in agriculture—
that lovely word ‘adaptation’—
and that said body is given the necessary resources of staff and funds to carry out its role.
I think it is very sensible that we have some coordination of the information we are getting that can be disseminated to farmers—and the ability to take up the latest innovations and technology. Look at minimum till. When I grew up, 50 years ago, you had to plough the paddock at least four or five times to kill the weeds. Unfortunately, doing that you used up a lot of the moisture. You may have killed the weeds but you used a hell of a lot of diesel running the tractors to plough those paddocks and sometimes you just did not get it in time. Now with direct till you go straight in, you do not waste the moisture, you use a lot less fuel and, if you believe in problems with CO2, you are reducing the CO2. In fact, farming in Australia is the only industry that has actually reduced its CO2. Farmers have done it not because of climate change but because they want to save money and do their farming better. It is the only industry in Australia that has done it and they have done it without government help. So if we can help a bit that is good.
The last recommendation that I want to refer to is:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give further consideration to the analysis of government policy and outcomes in the submission to the current inquiry made by the Future Farm Industries CRC, with a view to ensuring the better coordination of research and extension efforts and the delivery of effective policy outcomes.
That might sound a bit like a ‘program specificity’, which we have all heard about, but if you actually bring it down to plain language it is saying that we need the coordination by the CRC in farming, and that is important because that coordination will help get that information disseminated to the farmers of Australia to make them even better farmers. So put it in plain language and get away from the program specificity, but if you look into it deeply it is actually a very good recommendation.
Can I congratulate the committee on their work. They have done a great job and it has been a pleasure to talk on this issue.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Primary Industries and Resources Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I too congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker May, on your appointment to the Speaker’s Panel and wish you the very best in keeping members under control. It is interesting following the member for Barker. The member for Barker unfortunately did not follow the practice of the committee in its attempts to keep this pretty much a bipartisan issue. The member for Barker would have us believe that carbon in our atmosphere could be stabilised to below five per cent of our 2000 levels just by adopting the recommendations of the committee. It is an interesting concept because most of those recommendations are focused on research and development, in other words, bringing to a commercial stage many of the innovations we would all hope collectively to see in place in the future. So it is an interesting angle and approach that he chose to take on this occasion.
I am not a farmer, unlike the member for Barker, and, indeed, I am not a member of the committee. But I have represented farming communities for some 14 years in this place and on that basis it should not be a surprise to anyone to see me seeking an opportunity to provide some reflection and some comment on the committee’s work. The report entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change
is a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources. I agree with the member for Barker on one thing: this is a good report. It is a practical and pragmatic report, and I too congratulate the committee on its very good work.
As the member for Lyons indicated in his chairman’s foreword, the committee was less interested in arguing the toss over issues like climate change because, as he indicated, there is a diversity of views among committee members. Rather, the committee was much more interested in seeking practical solutions to some of the challenges that farmers face particularly as they relate to dramatic changes in our climatic conditions here in Australia. This approach underscores the great value of our parliamentary committee work. It is often underappreciated. It is an environment in which members can work in a bipartisan way towards the common good and, again, I congratulate the committee on doing so on this particular occasion.
Very much underappreciated in the Australian community also, I think, are the challenges that our farming communities face, for example drought, salinity, water allocation issues, declining commodity prices, rising input prices, and monopsony buyers, which is something close to my heart in terms of my own electorate. Then there are the difficulties in securing the services of skilled employees, and conflicting land use issues which are increasingly encroaching on some agricultural pursuits, and of course there is globalisation and industry rationalisation. In the wine industry, for example, oversupply is a big issue and of course for farming communities we also have isolation and all the social issues which go with that. I was particularly pleased to see the committee focusing more broadly on those social issues and not just looking at things which people would come to understand as issues pertaining directly to the challenges of tilling the soil and producing crops.
The committee took a year to make some 15 recommendations. During the year it considered 73 submissions and held 14 public inquiries. It also visited five states, looking at innovative farming practices in particular. The report very much focuses on the way in which climate change makes life more difficult for already challenged families. It highlights the need to provide greater counselling support and to listen more to what farmers are saying and to look more closely at their local innovation.
The report places great emphasis on the need for a greater investment in research and development, particularly in areas like soil carbon sequestration, something we have spoken about already; and soil water retention strategies and, of course, water efficiency. Carbon sequestration has the potential to both increase crop yields and, of course, reduce carbon in our atmosphere—really good news for food security and really good news for our environment, if we can get that technology to commercial use.
Those who produce our food are part of our most important economic sector. Yet they face all the challenges which I spoke about earlier in my contribution. I want very briefly to highlight one of those challenges, and that is land conflict. In my own electorate this is a big issue, particularly in the upper reaches of my electorate. While there is no lack of appreciation of the wealth that has been provided by the coal industry—and may it long continue to provide that wealth—there is also an increasing concern that unsustainable or limited-time industries like coal are increasingly starting to threaten sustainable industries in agricultural pursuits, particularly the wine industry and, in particular, horse breeding in the upper Hunter, which is an important economic driver in my electorate.
I believe, as the local member, those concerns are growing and those voices of concern are growing louder. Demand for our commodities—from China, for example—is driving, firstly, a greater investment. That, in many ways, is a good thing. But that demand is also driving further and further expansion of coalmining, particularly open-cut coalmining, in the upper Hunter. Our coalmines are getting closer to our horse-breeding studs, closer to our agriculture, to our farms, and also closer to those who produce the fruit for our very, very important wine industry. I think it is time for government to sit up and take a bit more notice of that and to work harder at getting the balance between these various pursuits right.
Interestingly, the New South Wales government recently took the very good decision to finally move forward with investment in new power generation in New South Wales. This is critical: if we do not get it, the lights will go out by 2015. One of those power stations will be in my electorate, around the Bayswater area in the upper Hunter. That is all good news.
What did surprise me was the decision by the New South Wales government to keep open the option of a new coal-fired power generator. I think that is a mistake. I think it is very important to put in place a gas-fired power generator in the upper Hunter. Not only would this be very good for the environment, it would provide the foundation for a new pipeline coming from South-East Queensland right through the Hunter and down into Sydney. This would provide, for the first time, competition in pipeline supply of gas in both of those areas. That would, in turn, provide greater opportunities for those seeking to invest in energy-intensive industries in the Hunter because they would then face the prospect of competitively priced gas—something industry in the Hunter has not had the opportunity to secure at any time up until this day.
I think also that the decision to pursue a gas-fired generator would send a good message to those people who have expressed those concerns I mentioned earlier—the growing concerns about land-use conflict and the impact of coalmining on those various agricultural pursuits in the valley. These issues are much broader than those covered by this report, but they are very important issues and issues appropriate to raise here in this debate.
Again, I congratulate the committee on its work. I see that Tony Windsor, the member for New England, is here. I know he is an active part of that committee and I know that these are issues in which he shows a great deal of interest. I commend the report both to the parliament and to the broader Australian community.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Primary Industries and Resources Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2010-03-17,"—It is with pleasure that I speak to the report of the House Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. I thank the member for Hunter for his comments. This is a very well thought out report which identifies a whole range of issues in relation to agriculture, climate change, climate variability, drought and rain. Irrespective of what people think or do not think is happening in terms of the climate, I think this document is quite valuable as a policy document in a whole range of areas relating to things like landscape management through to various types of land use, right through to the sequestering of carbon in the soil and all the other issues that revolve around the climate change or global warming debate.
I would particularly like to congratulate the chairman of our committee, Mr Dick Adams, for the way in which he has chaired the committee. As the member for Barker mentioned, I have been a member of this committee for some years now and he was a previous member of the committee. Irrespective of who has been the chairman—the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, did an outstanding job—if an individual came in, they would not be able to pick the partisan politics in relation to the issues. That is to the committee’s great credit and I think that is reflected in this report. I notice the member for Barker was trying to score a few political points in relation to some of the things that are mentioned in this report, such as biochar and some of the technologies that farmers have adopted. He saw that as an endorsement of coalition policy. That may be the fact but I think it says more about the committee than about partisan politics in that the committee has taken evidence from the community and made certain recommendations in its report as a result of those findings. In no way has anybody—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.

(Ms S Bird)—Is the member willing to give way?
—Yes.
—Firstly, is the complete absence of any reference to an ETS in this document the reason why it is bipartisan; and, secondly, does it reflect the fact that in the farming community there is almost no appetite whatsoever for an ETS?
—As I was saying, the committee reflected on the evidence that was given to us. If the member would like to go back through the whole range of evidence that was given, he will see that the issues of carbon emissions and nitrous oxide emissions are in the document. There is quite a lot about the sequestering of carbon dioxide and the way in which agriculture can play a role in reducing its emissions. As to various market mechanisms or preferred market mechanisms taking care of those particular issues, the great bulk of evidence was around technologies and how agriculture can have a significant influence on reducing emissions. But it raises an interesting point. Irrespective of whether there is an emissions trading scheme or whether global warming, climate change—whatever you want to call it—were to go away tomorrow, many of the technologies that are talked about in this document should be looked at very closely by both sides of the parliament. I have my own personal views in relation to carbon pollution reduction schemes and emissions trading schemes. I believe that, eventually, if the globe does go down the path of some sort of emissions trading arrangement, there will have to be a price on carbon. I do not think you can really come to grips with that. I say that as one who raised the issue of soil carbon some three or four years ago before the buzzwords ‘carbon pollution reduction’ had actually entered the building.

The significant findings of this report as they relate to climate change, particularly in relation to carbon and the potential to sequester carbon in the soil as a way of ameliorating some of the issues in the atmosphere, should be looked at very closely, irrespective of what stage the emissions trading debate happens to be up to. It relates to the accumulation of humus and organic matter in the soil, and thinking farmers have been doing this for many years. If you accumulate humus and organic matter in the soil, which is in fact carbon, there is debate on whether, if there is a long dry spell or a drought and the soil cracks, that carbon is again released into the atmosphere—obviously part of the cycle. There are techniques, whether they be grazing or farming techniques, where the amount of soil carbon, which in most cases has been depleted over the years through various farming methods, can be increased. That may have a positive impact on global issues. Personally, I have some doubts as to how it will fit in a market mechanism. There are now some arrangements in various parts of the United States and in Australia where soil carbon is being traded in a voluntary market.
As a farmer, I believe that the great benefits of the carbon debate will not be in the carbon market but will be in the increased productivity that will come about by accumulating humus and organic matter in soils and with other practices, whether they be pasture technologies, no-till farming, conservation farming or a range of other things. The combination of technologies will allow more moisture to be retained at depth in soils, technologies such as GPS and practising controlled traffic where the movement of tractors and headers takes place over one portion of a paddock, time in and time out, rather than trampling down the top soil, as traditional methods have done.
There are other policy issues which start to come to the fore. The document addresses those and I am sure there are members of the committee who personally do not agree with some. It is to the credit of the committee that they have built what the community is saying into the document rather than trying to politicise the document itself with partisan political positions. This is a very valuable document in terms of drought policy because it identifies a lot of the technologies which farmers are using, can use, can modify and can adapt, which will ameliorate drought. By using some of those technologies, I have seen in my own electorate, and in others, where drought starts and finishes on the boundary. Drought is not necessarily about a total lack of rain; it is about how you manage the water when rain occurs.
Further down the track, there will be some policy issues which we will have to look at very closely. For instance, the terms ‘interception’ and ‘diversion’ are very much part of the 2007 Water Act and as we speak the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is putting in place the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Could some of these technologies be interpreted or defined as being interceptions of water that would otherwise have run off into our river systems? For instance, because no-till farming is changing the nature of the topsoil and increasing the capacity of the soil to take in moisture when it is raining, that means, in effect, that there is additional storage in the better soils of up to six inches of available moisture—six inches of rainfall moisture, not six inches in depth.
Agroforestry is carbon positive and water run-off negative. Could that land use be interpreted as an interception? The Murray-Darling Basin Authority are currently looking at what is going to be the volume of water falling in valleys. How does groundwater relate to surface water? How much will there be at the end of it—how much for the environment, how much for farmers and how much for anybody else at the Murray mouth?
Could those very technologies that this document identifies that are carbon positive be in fact negatives in terms of water policy? There are a various number of collision courses that I can see happening throughout agriculture and the way it interfaces with policy making. Not the least is this issue of food security. There is this preoccupation that the world is running out of food and that we need all our agricultural land to go towards food production. That would be all right if you could make some money out of growing food, but we export 80 per cent of what we produce in this nation, so in a sense we produce too much of the stuff and occasionally we have to bribe an Arab or two to get rid of some wheat, as has happened in the past.
So the debate comes round to what is the best land use: is it necessarily agriculture? If we are talking about methane from animals as being a negative in terms of the carbon economy, and nitrous oxide, which is nitrogen fertiliser, and carbon emissions from heavy use of machinery, are we better off to look at other options for land use? What about agroforestry? It is carbon positive but it interferes with water policy. How do we reconcile those water budgets? What about third-generation biofuels where you actually plant a crop once and then annually harvest it? It has the capacity to sequester carbon at depth, which a lot of crops do not have. It is carbon positive with depth storage of carbon. It is soil erosion positive. It is a biofuel, so it ticks the boxes in terms of the carbon world again. If it was land that used to grow food, wheat for instance, all the negatives from Australia to our marketplaces are transport negatives, carbon negative, carbon negative—real costs.
This is what we should think about in terms of an emissions trading arrangement: how agriculture fits in that and where the interface of food from land use and energy from land use starts to collide. I do not think at the policy level we have really looked at that too closely. For instance, the major part of wheat, the starch in wheat, is carbon. If we are growing massive quantities of wheat using massive quantities of diesel and then massive quantities of transport fuels et cetera to create an export economy so that we can exchange that wheat for money and then buy fuel, carbon, and bring it back again to have the fellow going round in circles on his tractor again, would we not be better to consider the option of cutting the corner and saying, ‘Well, if we are only doing it to buy fuel, why not grow fuel?’ Why not grow a biofuel which sequesters carbon at depth? There are massive areas around Walgett through to Narrabri, vast areas of black soil in Australia that could be quite effective at sequestering carbon at depth, irrespective of whether there is a market for that or not.
I think this document raises a whole range of issues but it is very important in terms of the drought debate, it is very important in terms of the emissions debate and it is very important in terms of the water use efficiency debate and how that relates to the total system. What it does show very clearly, though, is that the farmers who have been at the cutting edge of technology are a long way in front of the researchers. I think government has got to start to take the leash off some of these researchers. Soil science has been ignored for 30 years, and here we are talking about the very basics of life: what makes up the soil, what makes it live, how that relates to carbon and what the interactions with the atmosphere are. We are starting to look at that again because of the climate change and global warming debate. It is a debate that we should have had years ago, irrespective of climate change, and it is something that government should take account of now.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—The report by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
is an important document for now and for the future. One of the great things about where my electorate is located, on the beautiful Central Coast—and I acknowledge the member for Robertson, who shares the beautiful Central Coast with me—is that there are many areas where residential suburbs interface with picturesque rural land. One minute you can be driving through typical suburban streets with brick houses, well-kept lawns and curbs and guttering and the next minute you can have expansive views of farmland with cattle grazing and undulating hills in the background. It is a very mixed area in terms of the environment.
We do not have extensive areas of farmland, unlike many other parts of New South Wales, but we do have some important agriculture on the Central Coast. For instance, the region has the largest kiwifruit farm on the eastern seaboard of Australia, and there are extensive properties specialising in cut flowers for both the domestic and overseas markets. In fact, I was recently talking to a Zimbabwean couple who picked out the Central Coast as having the perfect climate for roses. They were planning to set up a business and were looking at all sorts of countries around the world, looking at the temperature and so forth, and they have now set up a successful rose growing business on the Central Coast in my electorate. Following along the lines of selling coal to Newcastle or supplying champagne to the French, we actually have Japanese companies now buying green tea grown on the Central Coast. It is another important area of agriculture that we have. So, while the Central Coast is a relatively small agricultural area, it is a very diverse agricultural sector.
While the Central Coast is probably the most beautiful area of Australia, we are also an area that is susceptible to the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, the environment in this region is very fragile. We have a thin coastline with developments there. In the middle of my electorate there is a beautiful lake which is prone to flooding, as it has access to the sea. An issue such as rising sea levels affects everyone on the Central Coast, particularly those in my electorate. When I walked along the beach at North Entrance earlier this year inspecting the damage done by a major storm—the sorts of hazards that many of my constituents face living so close to the ocean—it hit home to me just how fragile our environment is. A whole street of houses had lost large chunks of their backyards. There were bits of fences overhanging the beach, concrete pathways sticking out going nowhere because the backyard had been washed away. There were broken rails and trees uprooted along the fence line. In the backyard of one of these houses there used to be a beautiful glass fence. The glass fence had been completely washed away. The residents had over four metres of their backyard washed away because of this storm surge. These storm surges are becoming more regular as our climate is changing.
Because of this issue I made a submission to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, which delivered a very comprehensive report to the House last year. One of the places they visited—in fact, the first place they visited—was the electorate of Dobell. Dobell has three areas in particular that have been hit hard by the storm surges. The beaches at Wamberal have been washed away on a number of occasions, as have the beaches at North Entrance, which I have just been talking about. These beaches have extensive development on them. The beach at Little Cove at Cabbage Tree Bay at Norah Head has been closed now for over two years because there are houses on the clifftops that are literally falling into the bay as the erosion has occurred around this area due to the storm surges, and it is dangerous for people to go on that beach in case these houses do in fact fall off the cliff.
My electorate bears the full brunt of the storm surges on the coast, but it also bears the brunt of storm surges that come up through The Entrance and into the Tuggerah Lakes system which they did in 2007, causing extensive flooding inland around the lake where most of the population in my electorate live. This resulted in over 1,000 people having to be evacuated and moved in a massive coordinated response that was undertaken.
As was the report on the impact on climate of coastal communities important, so too is this report on how we assist farmers with the impact of climate change. That report on the impact on coastal communities made many recommendations in relation to us being prepared, action that we would need to take to mitigate these natural disasters, and why we need to act in relation to climate change. It was a very important report that brought home to everyone who lives on the coast the need to act. We cannot put our heads in the sand and hope that this issue will go away. It is affecting my community right now.
The report we are talking about today, on how we can assist farmers when it comes to dealing with the impacts of climate change, should be commended and its many recommendations should be endorsed. I will not go through all the recommendations, but some of them are particularly relevant to my Central Coast electorate. Part of a recommendation, which deals with investing research funding, is an overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, and it recognises as a high-priority area soil water retention strategies and water use efficiency. I am happy to say that, on the Central Coast, water efficiency has become a very strong culture, especially amongst its residents.
Our region—the region that the member for Robertson and I look after—sank to a very low point in water storage only a few years ago. In fact, our main dam was down to about 11 per cent capacity. We also had a pipeline from the Hunter, piping water into our electorate to ensure that we did not completely run out of water. Thankfully, that is not the case now but, as the total water storage level currently hovers around the 30 per cent mark, we have to remind ourselves that in terms of water storage we are still 70 per cent empty.
One thing that the Rudd government has done—one of the promises that we have acted upon—is to build a pipeline between the coastal dam and the water storage dam which, hopefully, we will be turning the sod for in the weeks ahead. That will, over time, ensure that the Central Coast is drought-proofed because of this good infrastructure that the Rudd government has put in that affects those two seats on the Central Coast. The whole subject of water efficiency, from areas such as water harvesting and recycling to cutting evaporation rates on farms, is increasingly being embraced by businesses that include farms. I know of at least one hydroponic salad/vegetable farm which built new greenhouse structures, incorporating rainwater collection and storage, making themselves almost completely self-sufficient in water use. Quite a few orange and other fruit growers on the Central Coast have already adapted their fields so there is better water retention in the soil. They have certainly improved their water use efficiency.
The committee also recommended that the Australian government support further research efforts into the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. In another recommendation the committee said that the government should increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agricultural sector and the development of alternative energy and fuels on farms, particularly in the area of biofuels, biomass from agricultural waste and biochar.
There is another recommendation that is very interesting from the point of view of the Central Coast area. The committee recommended that the government:
… increase funding for research into improving the consistency and accuracy of weather and climate forecasting, especially at a seasonal and regional level.
Following that is the recommendation that the government develop an education and training scheme for farmers in the understanding and use of weather and climate information.
Currently, weather forecasts on the Central Coast are included as part of the larger Hunter area. Clearly, the Central Coast is not the Hunter area. One of the things that I am pushing for is to ensure that we have our own weather forecasts that are tailored to the Central Coast that will have the effect of giving greater accuracy and consistency in forecasting for the area. That is one thing this committee recommended: ensuring that there is greater accuracy and forecasting at a regional level. That is something that has a direct effect on my electorate. The committee also recommended that the government:
… maintain its commitment to climate change research pertaining to Australia’s agricultural industries, ensuring that the funding is committed, sustained and pays due attention to regional as well as national needs and priorities. Climate change research must reflect the changes affecting different regions, soils and topography—as all have an impact on changes in farming practices to deal with them.
I am certain our farmers on the Central Coast will welcome this recommendation, as they will many of the others in this report. Another recommendation is that the Australian government:
… develop a strategy to capture, evaluate and disseminate the range of farmer driven innovations that have a significant capacity to increase the resilience and productivity of farm enterprises.
The member for New England was making that point in his contribution and I think it is a point well made. It is not just in the area of research that innovative issues are developed; more often than not, it is through dealing with issues of a practical nature on farms where these innovations first take place. That is something this report acknowledged, and it recommended that we make the dissemination of those innovations that have grown up through practice on farms easier so that the farming community as a whole can benefit from some of those innovative practices.
The committee has also recommended that the government:
… ensures that there is an overall body to receive and analyse research and co-ordinate research across the nation in relation to climate change adaptation in agriculture, and that said body is given the necessary resources of staff and funds to carry out its role.
I would encourage our farmers on the Central Coast to become involved in any such organisation and make valuable input. It is further recommended in the report that the government:
… give greater consideration to better integration of local and regional organisations into its overall response to the issues affecting agriculture and climate change, and provide additional funding to support the management role of these local and regional organisations.
On the issue of incentives for industry in agriculture, there is a recommendation that the government:
… explore further opportunities to facilitate adaptation to climate variability and climate change through the use of targeted, industry and issue specific, incentives.
Recommendation 15 calls for the government to:
… place funding for local and community organisations engaged in the work of supporting farmers in adapting to climate variability and climate change upon a permanent and regular basis.
To sum up, I would strongly urge those involved in our rather small but very diverse agriculture sector on the New South Wales Central Coast to have a close look at the report by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources and its recommendations. While not all of the recommendations will be relevant to them, there are some very important ones there that will be. It is essential that the farming sector on the Central Coast work closely with the federal government to ensure that their voice is heard when it comes to implementing the measures to deal with the impacts of climate change on farming.
One of the key features of this report was the continual recognition of making sure that there are regional and local solutions. Where those solutions exist, they are adapted to the local environments of the various regions around Australia. In my area on the Central Coast, we have always felt that we get lumped in either with Sydney or with Newcastle and the Hunter. The Central Coast is its own area. It has its own particular and unique problems. It has its own challenges in relation to many issues, not least of which is climate change. The committee should be commended for the many recommendations in this report that focus on a regional approach and on looking at the particulars of regional difficulties. There are few areas in Australia that face the variety of challenges in terms of climate change that my electorate faces. From the eroding coastlines and the flooding of the lakes through storm surges to the lack of water, these issues have greatly affected the lives of people living on the Central Coast, none more so than those people seeking to make a living from the land, who are perhaps even more vulnerable to these issues of climate change. This report has recommendations that are important for now, but it also has important recommendations for the future. I commend the report and its recommendations to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Primary Industries and Resources Committee</title>,Committees,38,1

Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, a committee that I used to be a member of. I commend their work and the good people who make up that committee. This report is important to my electorate and there are some messages around climate change and farming that I would like to deliver to the House today.
People often think of farmers as being climate change sceptics and I appreciate that because, when I talk to the farmers in my area, they can be ambivalent about climate change and they can be concerned, curious and bewildered. It is not fair to say that they have turned their back on climate change. It is not fair to say that they reject the science out of hand. But, as they are very much at the cutting edge of what is going on and it is their livelihoods and families that are on the line, it is totally appropriate that they be healthily sceptical.
I think that when the government has responded to the challenge of climate change it has gone about in somewhat the wrong way. It has labelled many of the agricultural programs that we used to see in rural Australia as simply attaching to climate change. The issue of being soundly environmental—of saving energy, saving water and conserving soils—seems to take a secondary order of preference to climate change, and everything is up in lights under this big banner of climate change. The problem that farmers have with that is that they do not necessarily see the link between a grand, global strategic discussion and what they are actually doing in their back paddock—even though there very definitely is a link, and it is an important one.
So I have been disappointed to see some of the programs that the government has rolled out and the rebadging. When you look at the detail, I acknowledge that the content of some of those programs is valuable and useful to farmers. But what I noticed in a previous farming life and in the previous government where I had more contact with the agricultural portfolio is that we are losing a lot of our on-ground research extension and development. I note that recommendations 9 to 12 of the committee’s report focus on the research and extension—and I really want to commend that. That is a really good thing.
It is not just the role of federal governments to manage research and extension, but over the years we have seen the role of state departments of agriculture—which have often been rebadged as departments of climate change, too—their on-the-ground, practical role, vastly reduced. Consequently, there has been a vacuum and we have not really had enough agencies, enough funding or enough organisations to take the research and extension work up to farmers in the way that they really need to have that done.
I note the good work of the catchment management authorities in my area—the Murray Catchment Management Authority is one in particular, as is the Lower Darling and the Western Murray. The catchment management authorities have been left to pick up the ball and run with it on a lot of these projects. One of the ones that they are running in my area concerns some comparisons between different farms to try to evaluate the degree of climate change adaptiveness and the farming practices. What it comes down to is what the farming practices are that are being used and how they might best respond to climate change.
An example that I was told about recently concerns a selection of three different farms—one that would be using a rotational grazing and a mixed farming enterprise; one that would be using continuous cropping with stubble retention and minimum tillage; and another that might be using very old-fashioned plough, plough, plough farming methods—and looking at how soil carbon could be sequestered and the effect on the total farming enterprise from these different types of farming activities. You might think that this is something that we already know and that the science is already settled on, but it certainly is not because, in every different area of Australia, farming practices and responses are completely different depending on the soil types, the landscape, the rainfall and the level of technology that is employed.
By having these simple, practical demonstrations and experiments in an area and then publishing the results to all farmers and, most importantly, allowing farmers to actually look at the demonstrations, look at the on-site work and talk to each other about what is going on, you will spread the knowledge far better than grand plans and scientific programs. With all respect to the CSIRO and our other organisations, I do not believe that the work that they do is rooted sufficiently in practical farming. The response that many farmers have to multimillion dollar CSIRO studies and the glossy brochures that accompany them is, ‘What does this really mean for me? How does this affect my farming enterprise?’ I can hand any farmer that I know one of those glossy brochures and they can turn to any page in it and they can find a glaring error. That is because they know what they are doing and they understand what is required of them in their family farming business. And if they have survived the last 10 years of drought, I can pretty well say that they do what they do very well indeed.
Research and extension are the keys to helping farmers adapt to climate change. Because the state government has vacated the field to the extent that it has, the federal government has an obligation to step in. But, after the election of the current government, we saw a cut to the research and development corporations and the complete elimination of one of them: Land and Water Australia. That funding was and still is, though reduced, a very valuable source of funding direct from the federal government that receives a matching levy contribution from farmers—so they are strong stakeholders in it—and results in practical, on-the-ground projects that make a real difference to farmers.
There is a list of recommendations in this report and I am most attracted to the ones that relate to extension. I note that the previous member spoke about the risk of living on the coast and the problems with climate change and rising sea levels et cetera. That is something that nature may or may not produce, but in the area that I represent, the southern Murray-Darling Basin, other forces of adversity are at work. They consist of the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, the water buyback that she is imposing on rural communities and the complete lack of response to our urgent representations about looking after the social and economic effects of those water buybacks—the so-called triple bottom line—and the resulting devastation these Rudd government policies are generally having on farmers in western New South Wales.
When a committee such as this looks at farming for the future, and I know that they looked at the role of government in assisting farmers adapt, it is certainly appropriate to make some remarks about how governments could get out of the way in examples where farmers are struggling against drought, low or zero water allocations and the accumulated effects of 10 years of this existence on their bank balances when government policies are making it more difficult. And I do not want to just throw brickbats without throwing some bouquets. I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for extending exceptional circumstances across nearly all of my electorate and recognising that farmers simply cannot move into profitable situations once rain falls—and it has been patchy in some areas. Farmers do need that extended support, and that comes in the form of interest-rate subsidies and household support, which is a fortnightly payment through Centrelink. Without that we really would not have managed to get through the last five years. I appreciate the fact that the minister for agriculture accepted the recommendations of the National Rural Advisory Committee and extended exceptional circumstances for a further 12 months, starting on 1 April this year.
However, one area east of the Hume Highway, in what was the old Hume rural lands board but is now a livestock health and pest authority—it is hard to keep up with the changing names in the New South Wales government—has been taken out of exceptional circumstances. I met with the minister for agriculture and I have been encouraged by his willingness to have another look at this. Although he is not personally responsible for the inclusion or noninclusion of zones into exceptional circumstances—the National Rural Advisory Committee advises him on that—he said that if New South Wales comes forward with a case to his department then whatever can be done will be done.
We really do need that to happen, because that particular zone of my electorate of Farrer east of the Hume Highway, containing the towns of Holbrook and Tumbarumba—which is just outside my electorate; it is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro—has been badly affected by drought. There has been a very poor response to the small amount of rain we have had. The area has quite acid soils so it does not recover easily. The temperatures are about to get quite a lot colder—it is the upper Murray—and the area around Tooma was very badly affected by fires a few months ago and was completely burnt out. I appreciate that exceptional circumstances cannot necessarily respond to bushfires, but that has added to the significant load that farmers must bear in this situation. I do hope that some help and support can be given for that remaining zone of western New South Wales to be included back into exceptional circumstances and that we do get the support we need. Meanwhile, I commend the report

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I agree with many of the comments the member for Farrer has just made in relation to this overall topic and the object of this report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources,Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Like the member for Farrer, I hope that people find this report of use. I can say as a proud member of this committee that it was a real eye-opener to listen to the face-to-face submissions that were presented to us, to read a number of the submissions and visit many of the sites.
I will make a few comments in relation to the report, adding to what I mentioned yesterday at the media release and media event associated with it. Before I do, I congratulate all the members of the secretariat involved with the report. I have been on this committee for a number of years and I find them to be highly professional, very supportive and very good at their job.
Irrespective of the political, public debate that was going on, is going on and will continue to go on in regard to climate change—unless some people think that the issue has somehow disappeared because of Copenhagen—about the extent of human contribution to carbon dioxide levels and greenhouse gases, the majority of farmers that we met have been going about the practical business of adapting to changes in weather patterns. People argue about what has caused the changes in weather patterns—although personally I think the science has pretty well established what is going on there contrary to the contrarians, particularly in this place, and some of the conservative press. The major issue for farmers is that they have to go about adapting to changing climate conditions, and that is what they have done. We saw the full range, including those that essentially are unable to cope for a variety of reasons with these changing circumstances, and that has inevitable consequences for them individually, for their families and for their communities. Unless mitigating factors come into play then many of those enterprises will be uneconomical, will consequently become totally unviable and will fall over.
Right the way through there was a whole range of responses to climate change. This report highlights many of them, and they are very exciting. It shows that many of our farmers and farming communities are very adaptable, very innovative, very progressive and very good at what they do. What they seek is support wherever that is necessary and available to assist them to get on with the job of doing what they do best.
I mentioned before the tension between the political debate and the realities of climate change. The tensions that exist on farm are also highlighted in this report. In particular, I would recommend chapter 2, headed ‘Managing decisions on the farm’, which highlights the tensions not just in decision making but in who makes the decisions and what types of decisions should be made now and into the future. That became very evident during the inquiry. The report suggests that resources be put into counselling families and business owners in decision making and, particularly, change, including generational change.
People must think their food just pops onto their plate or into their cupboard—that they make it at the supermarket or in the truck that brings it to their place. The whole enterprise of food production and manufacturing in Australia exists outside the metropolitan areas. There is huge social and economic change going on out there, and there is a lot of tension. This report seeks various ways in which to support those producers of our product so they are able to keep doing that in the best way. Unless we support them—and I do not think I am being overly alarmist—our ability to feed ourselves will be greatly diminished.
That leads me to some other tensions that we discovered in this investigation. They are natural tensions, by the way; I am not suggesting for a moment they are not. There are those that find it very difficult to accept change. If you look at the full extent of the climate change argument, it becomes so overwhelming that you think that you cannot deal with it or solve it at an individual level and therefore you tend to reject it, whereas reality says you have to cope with the conditions that you have. So there is an overwhelming tension there. The other tension is between those who do not see it as so much of a challenge or a threat and those who see it as an opportunity, and there are many opportunities for farming the future that are highlighted in this work.
The other tension, which I referred to earlier, is in terms of the production of food. Some of the opportunities for our farming enterprises can in fact be contradictory to the production of food. We could be creating resources which mitigate carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and create renewable energy and regeneration. Those require land—which may well be suitable for the production of food. Farmers have to survive, so we as a community need to look at that situation and offer them avenues to reconcile these possible tensions, and they do exist. It is very enlightening to see some of those examples here.
Amongst many other things, I found of particular interest, on the social side, the work of Professor Frank Vanclay and Aysha Fleming of the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research. They are social researchers who look at change in relation to farming techniques and climate change. For the record, because I think it is well worth reflecting on, I would like to quote from their evidence to us:
Resistance to change is not just about individual reactions, it is a broader social issue. This means that resistance does not occur within an individual’s head, or because of an individual’s personal characteristics—education level, personal motivations or situation, skills or beliefs. Resistance is created by common perceptions, norms and values held in society. In our society currently, resistance is being created because climate change is perceived as being:
‘just’ another environmental or global threat,
too big to influence,
an unmanageable and inequitable financial burden, and;
too uncertain to warrant major action.
They go on to say:
Mitigation of climate change is seen by many farmers as a financial burden, rather than an opportunity. This can create anger and stress, because profit margins are further reduced and farmers risk viability.

They then go on to say:
Our research suggests that although the majority of farmers believe that climate change is occurring, there is widespread confusion about its causes, and they are not necessarily convinced by the suggested need for urgent adaptation and mitigation. As a result, we believe that:
1. there is an on-going need for clear statements that the science is decided and the government will act on climate change;
If you go on the nature of this place, there is no hope of that. I have to say that those opposite and the conservative press have done a great job on that. But I have got news for you: nothing is going to change. It is happening and there will be a lot more evidence to show you. I found it pretty interesting—the other mob reckon they are the mob for farmers and rural and regional Australia, and they were the very people against the attempts to provide sane, rational, scientific reasoning behind climate change—
—There is none!
—I have to say! Put it on the record: ‘There is no evidence of climate change.’ I ask you! Don’t talk on this report, mate! Don’t talk on this report, because you do not even believe in it. I and some of your colleagues from that side just wasted a few months on nothing? I ask you! Are you the spokesman for anything but nothing? If I may continue, they go on to say:
2. there is a need for more research into the beneficial actions agricultural industries can take, and active extension of this information to farmers.
The member for Farrer quite rightly pointed out that these extension programs should be practised on the ground so people can see them. If we can support that, that is much better for farmers than our acting in a vacuum. They respond very positively. They go on to say:
However, more than just information is necessary. Support for farmers to implement actions and to work together is needed. This needs to include financial incentives, opportunities for building social networks, collaborations, recognition and rewards;
Indeed, rewarding the work of our farmers is very important. They go on:
3. finally, the social value farmers hold and exercise as ‘stewards of the land’ needs to be recognised and encouraged.
Again, I would like to congratulate all my colleagues for spending so much valuable time on this report,
Farming the future. I again thank the secretariat for their excellent work. I hope all my colleagues will take the time to look through this, particularly the member opposite, who seriously needs some education in this.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Primary Industries and Resources Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak on the reportFarming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
and the issue in general. I think farmers are more aware what is happening with the climate than most of the scientists are, actually. They actually have to deal with it instead of just talk about it. I would like to start by congratulating the committee on tackling what is, for many people, not a sexy issue. Yet I strongly believe that food and water security will be—in fact is—the defining issue of the 21st century. On Monday, the member for Lyons, in handing down this report, said that the journey in front of us will take a ‘sustained effort on the part of government, industry and community over a period of decades.’ I wish to outline just how crucial the final two groups mentioned by the member for Lyons are when tackling this issue.
Before I get into the debate I would like to pose a couple of questions to the House: where do you think our food will come from in the future, and what is Australia’s greatest competitive advantage over its trading competitors? Those things certainly have been brought out by the debate on the importation of meat from BSE affected countries. The greatest threat to our agriculture in the next 50 years is not climate change but the policies put in place by governments to combat what they talk about as climate change variability. The Labor government’s emissions trading scheme legislation was, is and will be a debacle and it should be voted down once again. It is nothing but a tax on production that will drive businesses and jobs offshore. All it will achieve is a new export: carbon emissions. Electorates such as my electorate of Calare, which are exporting wealth-generating electricity, will bear the brunt of the cost of the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme, which is nothing more than a new tax on production with another name.
I was recently in Brazil and America and, with regard to the current global downturn, I was interested to note that Brazil, like Australia, has been relatively—and I stress the word relatively—unaffected. Why? For the same reason that the Midwest states of America are less affected than the east and west coasts of America: they are agricultural and mining states, just as we are base minerals producing countries—in other words, those involved in actually doing things rather than money shuffling, trading and services. They are the countries and the parts of countries that are dealing with this the best.
The effect of the legislation will be felt much more brutally in regional Australia than in the capital cities—in other words, in those parts of the country that are protecting Australia at the moment. The productive sectors are what the CPRS is going to hit the most. I do not believe excluding agriculture from having to purchase carbon credits is a huge win. In or out, agriculture will be almost the most affected industry in the country. The latest ABARE report on the cost of the Rudd government’s CPRS states:
Even if the agriculture sector is not a covered sector under the CPRS, agricultural producers will face increased input costs associated with the use of electricity, fuels and freight and may face lower farm-gate prices for their goods from downstream processors—
who will directly get all those carbon onsets—
These will have implications for the economic value of farm production.
The increase in the price of electricity is estimated to be almost seven per cent in 2011 and 24 per cent in 2015. Not long ago, that was the next decade; now it is this one. It is only five years away. That is without states whacking another 20 per cent on the price of electricity, as New South Wales did the other day.
Whether it is the current drought or future climatic change, the result is a dry weather cycle. What we need is government investment into research on practical, productive measures which will allow our farmers to increase productivity. A drought is exactly the same as the real or imagined effect of climate change—you have to produce more with less—and it needs investment in new plant varieties which are disease resistant and can tolerate dry conditions. Yet all we have had from this Labor government in its first three years in government is massive customer research and development. I was amused to hear the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, when he was asked recently what one of his notable achievements was, say ‘increases in R&D’. I was totally staggered. I am somebody who actually knows what happened to the R&D budget and what the department of agriculture has lost—yet he talks about increases. I would love to know where they are. Our farmers are already being forced to produce more with less, particularly with less water and less arable land—land because urbanisation unfortunately takes a lot of the best land closest to the best towns in the best country.
At a time when the world population is set to double within the next 30 years and the ravages of global warming or drought are meant to hit us there is a very real possibility of Australia becoming a net importer of food. The biggest issue arising out of global warming will be food security, how we increase food production and, indeed, where our food will come from. The Rudd government think so little about where our food will come from that agriculture and agricultural manufacturers and processors are the only sectors not receiving free permits—they do not have a $500 million clean coal fund or a $6 billion clean car fund.
Despite what the Prime Minister might believe, you cannot eat coal and if we are going to feed the nation then agriculture has to be put at the forefront of this debate. The Rudd government has no idea what its emissions tax will cost the mums and dads. It never engaged in an honest debate about the real cost of a carbon tax, but I think the Australian population have engaged in that debate and have made a judgment on it. Our comparative advantage in Australia has always been our relatively cheap energy and water costs, but both of these will be artificially increased under this great big new tax.
You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that just about every bit of food and fibre grown in Australia involves some form of processing, manufacturing and transport before it is eaten or worn. Yet none of our manufacturers will be eligible for free permits under the ETS. The food manufacturing sector is the last major manufacturing sector left in Australia, employing over 300,000 people, mainly in regional Australia. It is vital to our nation’s food security, and the coalition is extremely concerned about its viability. For example, we are extremely concerned that there will be only one frozen vegetable processing plant left in the country after McCains close their Tasmanian plant to move to New Zealand. That is a major concern and it has to be addressed.
The
Australian National Greenhouse accounts
and the
National inventory by economic sector, released in June, paint an interesting story. Agriculture, fisheries and forestry have been doing all of the heavy lifting in reducing the nation’s greenhouse gases. Emissions from agriculture, fishing and forestry have declined by well over 30 per cent since 1990. The agricultural sector has led the nation in reducing emissions, yet it is the food and fibre industries which will bear the brunt of Kevin Rudd’s proposed ETS. If global warming, because of carbon pollution, is a doomsday scenario—and many, including the government, are warning us that it is—then it needs an emergency response. I hope that the committee has highlighted the excellent work that farmers are already doing to combat climate variability.
One thing that simply cannot happen if we are serious about the long-term sustainability of the land and the industry is a cut in funds for research and development. As with any other industry, staying up to date with the latest technological and industrial improvements allows our Australian producers to keep ahead of the pack when it comes to the global agricultural market. Funding is absolutely essential. Cutbacks will harm the industry and there are no two ways about it. I urge the member for Lyons to speak to his colleagues, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry continues to hang an axe above these funds. Emerging countries are threatening Australia’s foothold in some of our major export markets. The dumping of cheap produce on the Australian economy hurts our producers. We cannot afford to compete with China, Indonesia or Brazil on labour costs.
As the driest continent on the planet we are already in a difficult situation. We need funding in research and development to ensure that Australia continues to lead the way as one of the cleanest, greenest producers in the world. We are known for that. The parliament should also be aware that people on the land are aware of the challenges they face and are, in most circumstances, taking action. To survive the worst drought in my lifetime, farmers have had to change their managing practices just to survive—not to make Kevin feel better but because economic and personal need make them do it. The story that the stereotype cocky is resistant to change and do not adapt with the stock they run because they are stubborn is simply not true. Anyone like that does not survive.
The industry as a whole is willing to do what it can to improve its profit-making ability and improve the product being provided. When it all boils down, no other industry stands to lose more in the event of climate change coming to fruition—as per the doomsday scenario or as predicted by those who sensibly understand that climate change does happen. That is a fact that farmers and producers are all too aware of. One thing, however, sets this industry apart: the great connection producers have with the land that they work. No other industry has such a reliance on land as the agricultural industry. That connection means that seldom do people know more about what has happened to the soil and feed than the person working the land themselves.
There is a great variation in the soil quality and crop and stock potential in my electorate of Calare, not to mention across the whole of Australia. That is why a one-size-fits-all solution is the most ridiculous option you could ever come up with. The standing committee were clearly aware of this when they canvassed producers from across the country; however, the point should be made very clear.
The second group mentioned by the member for Lyons on Monday was communities. We need strong regional communities for a strong agricultural industry. It should be made very clear that a strong community involves strong health facilities, water security and educational opportunities. All three of these factors are currently under threat, particularly in New South Wales, by a city-centric focus in government. Regional Australia cannot be administered in these three areas in the same way as Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or even somewhere like Newcastle.
There is great concern in my electorate of Calare about the shortage of regional health facilities, and the Prime Minister’s new health plan has done little to ease that worry. In fact, as a result of comments made by the New South Wales Premier, small communities are very worried that their local hospital will be closing because of Labor’s health plan. There is also concern about educational prospects, and the Deputy Prime Minister’s latest backflip on youth allowance has done little to ease them.
These are all issues which affect a farmer’s ability to know, to use and to educate his family to ensure the continuance that has always been there. Infrastructure has been poorly managed by the Labor Party at the state level, and without good railroad and port infrastructure farmers will not be able to shift their product. This government has to realise that strong facilities will help create a strong community, and a strong community will mean a strong agricultural sector.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Primary Industries and Resources Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak in support of the report,Farming the future, and particularly the 15 recommendations. I was very pleased that the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources took up this issue, which is about helping farmers with adaptation to climate change. It puts the farmers front and centre stage, as they need to be, as we as a nation grapple with the impact of climate change.
Before I turn to the report, and the 15 very specific and well targeted recommendations, I would like to say some things regarding climate change, the basis of the committee’s report to assist farmers. My seat is a rural seat. It has a long and beautiful coastal strip that goes from Ballina to Evans Head, Iluka, Yamba, Wooloweyah and Angourie, which has some of the best beaches and one of the world’s top surfing beaches—out of the top 50, it is No. 10. So it is a beautiful coastal strip and a rural seat. As members could imagine, it is a population that is concerned about climate change and has been very actively involved in those particular debates. Even when I was first elected as the member for Page, the mayors who have the coastal strips in their areas approached me and talked about the need to have some certainty around planning and development in the coastal areas. They were very pleased to see the report. They were also very pleased to see another report that came out of this place, the report on coastal areas and climate change.
I accept climate change as a fact and a lot do. I accept climate change and the current events that are happening to be as a result of human activity. And, yes, climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon and has been around for a long time. But the evidence is clear that the exponential rate of what is happening with climate change and the major events and more extreme events are due to human activity.
I know that this week there has been a lot of attention given to the fact that CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have said that global warming is in essence unquestionable—that is, it is resulting from human activity. That is not new. These institutions have been saying that for quite some time. It is on their websites; it is in their reports. In fact, they have been leading agents in this debate, and whenever I have been talking about climate change I refer to them. These two institutions are trusted by I would have to say nearly all Australians and they are ones that farmers turn to. Now that a lot of us, not all of us, are connected and on websites, we go to the Bureau of Meteorology website, or BOM, daily. It is a daily event in my office because I live in an area where we do have a few extreme weather events and we have floods and we have droughts; we have the extremes in the whole Northern Rivers and North Coast strip. So it is something that we look at all the time to see what is going on. They really are trusted. Farmers and people on the land and people everywhere go to those sites.
You have people like Dr Megan Clark, the head of CSIRO, saying this week that we are seeing significant evidence of a change in climate and saying:
If we just take our temperature, all of Australia has experienced warming over the last 50 years. We are warming in every part of the country during every season and as each decade goes by, the records are being broken.
We are also seeing fewer cold days, so we are seeing some very significant long-term trends in Australia’s climate.
Dr Clark further is reported as saying that scepticism is a healthy part of the scientific process and has been considered as part of the climate change debate. Indeed it has, but she says that we also know that the rapid increase that we have been measuring was at the same time as we saw the Industrial Revolution, so it is very likely that these two are connected. When we look at climate change and look at the scientific evidence, the whole basis of science and the scientific method is that it is not 100 per cent but it is something that is stronger than the balance of probabilities, and in a legal sense, which I can refer to, it would be something beyond reasonable doubt. It is beyond reasonable doubt that we do have climate change.
In referring to the 15 recommendations I will make some comments on particular ones. The first one is the committee’s recommendation that the Australian government support rural counselling and support groups such as Rural Alive and Well and place funding for such groups on a permanent and regular basis. That is a very welcome and important recommendation. Rural counselling and support groups do such a wonderful job in country Australia; in my area they certainly do. I can remember when they did not exist and I can remember that people lobbied for them to be set up. Some were set up as extensions of our local counselling that happened in our health services, one in particular in my area. It was very welcome. We also have rural financial counselling, which is very important, and they work closely with the rural counselling. They sometimes are the first port of call in engaging people who do need ongoing counselling support. Rural financial counselling is very important indeed. In fact, next week I am attending as a guest the annual dinner of the Rural Financial Counselling Service New South Wales, Northern Region, which will be held in Casino. It provides a very important service in non-metropolitan areas.
I would like to comment on recommendation 3, which calls on the government to invest in research funding in the following high-priority areas: soil carbon sequestration; soil stabilisation and pasture improvements; soil water retention strategies and water use efficiency; landscape planning and natural resource management; and risk management. I would like to see within recommendation 3—and I am sure it is meant to cover this—a broader definition of soil carbon sequestration, because the sequestration of carbon is not just in soil; it is in all plants. That is an important area of research and study—Plantstone, as we would refer to it with the old fashioned name, but I am aware that name has also been patented by a couple of people at Southern Cross University. So, when we look at soil carbon sequestration, we should look at it more broadly and include the plants.
As some members would know, bamboo actually has the highest take-up of carbon, followed by sugar—this is from research in one particular area with one particular farm. Some time ago, the honourable member for New England, Tony Windsor, and I jointly hosted a session in Lismore with Southern Cross University, people from industry and farmers on the particular issue of plant sequestration and soil sequestration to get more information into the particular communities and to have more discussion and debate. Some of that was covered by
The 7.30 Report, particularly the research aspects at the farm. I am sure that when the recommendation says ‘soil carbon’ it is broad enough to include looking at it in its totality with the plants.
The report also talks about rotational grazing. That is not new; that is something that farmers have been doing for a long time. In fact, it is a very ancient practice. I sometimes think that, with the advent of modernisation and different techniques, some of those tried and true practices fell by the wayside. Again in my area, I recently attended a day that looked at rotational grazing and biodynamic farming et cetera. It was organised by Trevor Wilson. It was a very good day that was well attended by over 100 people who came from a wide region and mainly from farming backgrounds. It was really informative for me because I was able to sit there and listen for a few hours to people who do this and who, by doing it, have not only improved their pasture but increased their income as well. They were not revolutionary techniques; they were the tried and true and tested techniques. So any more attention that we can give to this in this place—and we are making recommendations to government—is a good thing. But we only have to look to the farmers themselves.
Recommendation 6 is an important one. It states:
The committee recommends that the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agriculture sector and the development of alternative energy and alternative fuels on-farm, particularly in regard to:
Biofuels;
Biomass from agricultural waste; and
Biochar.
One of the things that would be really advantageous in Australia to help us in this area would be something like a biofuels institute and getting some more work done with CRCs. I have had some involvement with that with Southern Cross University, where I am on the governing council. Part of that debate is food versus fuel and I know that debate has to happen, but we do not have to get locked into either/or. There is room for all of it and that is a very important one to be looking at.
There is one other recommendation I wanted to turn to. Recommendation 15 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government place funding for local and community organisations engaged in the work of supporting farmers in adapting to climate variability and climate change upon a permanent and regular basis.
Hallelujah! Wouldn’t that be good? Often one of the problems people do face in local communities is ad hoc funding. That has been a feature of all governments, not any particular government. Some may do it more than others, but it has been a feature of all governments. To get the organisations that work, and that are deeply engaged in that area—
—It is one o’clock but I will let you go. You can have a minute and a half—go for it!
—I will wind up.
—I am going to be generous: you can keep going for a minute and a half.
—All right. I welcome that particular recommendation. I also welcome the government introducing the community organisational grants that go to Landcare groups and various other groups in the community. It would be really good to see a lot more work in that area. I think that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should be able to play a lead role in that area. I know that farmers have trust in that particular agency. It would be good if it could do that on a stand-alone basis and be able to take some lead. I know it is in certain other areas.
I look forward to the government’s response to this report, because as I read through the 15 recommendations, and as I also look at some of the initiatives that have been introduced by the government, I can see that there is a great deal of crossover already. Because it is about adaptation, because it relates to climate change, we do need to get some of these things on a standing basis, and this report really assists with that. I congratulate the chair of the committee, Dick Adams, the deputy chair and the rest of the committee for such good work that they have done.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—Madam Deputy Speaker May, may I congratulate you on your elevation to that position of high esteem.
An opposition member—Lofty esteem.
—Absolutely, and very well deserved. I look forward to being under your leadership in the chamber, Madam Deputy Speaker, in future times. I rise to talk about the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, which I was a member of for nine years before this parliament. I regret not being on that committee anymore, but with a largely agricultural seat like mine, the seat of Barker, I of course take a great interest in the work the committee does even though I cannot participate in it. So I was very interested to see this report,
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We all know that climate change is here; it always has been. We can argue about whether it is anthropogenic or not, but the fact is we do have climate change and farmers for centuries or millennia have actually been adapting to climate change. In fact, people in Greenland took up farming in the medieval warm period when it was about two degrees warmer than it is now. That is why it was called Greenland, because it became green with the warming that was happening there between the 11th and 14th centuries. So farmers do adapt, and it is important that as a committee and as a parliament we look at how we can help farmers adapt to climate change.
I think it is rather ironic that in the chamber on 19 February 2008 I talked about the importance of adapting. I have always believed that the more important strategy for adapting to climate change was always going to be through direct action, which the coalition of course have put down as their policy on climate change, and this report talks about adapting. On 19 February 2008 I talked about how important it was to adapt, so I was quite bemused when, a couple of weeks after that speech, the then environment minister, Mr Garrett, tried to make fun of that in answer to a question on 11 March 2008. He said:
The member for Barker went on to advise that the most sensible approach to climate change would be ‘to adapt’—
in inverted commas, as if this was some revelation that it was a really stupid way to go. That was very interesting because, a couple of questions later, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, mentioned the importance for farmers to adapt to climate change. It really did make a mockery of the then minister for the environment, Mr Garrett, suggesting that I was somehow a bit loony to suggest that we should be adapting. That is exactly what this committee report is about. I will give you the title again:
The role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. As a farmer myself, I have adapted all my life.
—A very good one!
—I would like to think so. Last year we had the best crops on record. That was not due to any work that I did; it was actually due to the fact that the climate gave us a great season. In fact, if you were writing a script for a season, in 2009 we had it in my area. So you do adapt. I remember in 2006 suggesting to my son that I had a feeling we were not going to get much more rain. That was in about June. The predictions from the Bureau of Meteorology were that we might have a little bit below average rainfall for the rest of the year. In fact, it forgot to rain after June. Normally, May, June, July and August are our wettest months in our Mediterranean climate. I am glad we stopped sowing crops because it was the driest year in 117 years of recording. So the crops were a disaster and my area, which is generally drought free, found it had a year like no other. As a farming family we adapted to those circumstances.
If you go through the recommendations, there are some very good ones. For example, recommendation 2 states:
… the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, take more effective account of the needs and decision making processes of farmers—
I have just given you an example of that—
and ensure that the delivery of adaptation programs—
please listen, minister for the environment—
is flexible and responsive to the needs of farmers and rural communities.
I think that is a good recommendation. I note the member for New England has been a long-serving member on that same committee, and we worked together very strongly for the nine years that I was on it—and I think that was six years for you; you are now in your ninth year.
—Yes.
—Recommendation 3 is also very important because it says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, invest research funding in the following high priority areas:

Soil carbon sequestration—
Hello: coalition direct action policy; great stuff—
Soil stabilisation and pasture improvements using methods such as perennial pastures, pasture cropping, rotational grazing, biodynamic farming, minimum/no till cultivation and controlled traffic farming;
I can say from my own experience that we have been using those sorts of programs on our farm. Some of them are very successful, depending on the soil, the climate and what you are trying to achieve. Another recommendation referred to soil-water retention strategies and water-use efficiency. I think there is no doubt that that is very important: to get more crop per drop—in other words, to use our water more efficiently. South Australia, I think, have a proud record of being the most efficient irrigator in Australia. They have upgraded their infrastructure, which unfortunately seems to have stopped in the last couple of years under this federal government. Even though there is $6 billion set aside for it, it actually has had proven effects in South Australia—for example, the Loxton irrigation rehabilitation scheme in my electorate, where it saved huge amounts of water. I think it was something like 44 gigalitres annually just by using pipes rather than open channels, which seep and evaporate. Unfortunately, the state government at the time, who I might add was Labor, decided to sell those savings of 44 gigalitres rather than return it to the river. It would have had a much greater effect if that water had through its savings been returned to the health of the river rather than being sold off for a cash supply by the state government at the time. But you can do those sorts of things, and quite successfully.
The report then refers to energy on farms, and recommendation 6 states:
… the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agriculture sector and the development of alternative energy and alternative fuels on-farm, particularly in regard to:
Biofuels;
Biomass from agricultural waste; and
Biochar.
Hello: coalition direct action policy. What a great committee this is! It is actually adopting the coalition’s direct action policy in just about every recommendation. What a fantastic committee!
Recommendation 7 recommends:
… the Australian Government increase funding for research into improving the consistency and accuracy of weather and climate forecasting, especially at a seasonal and regional level.
Well, can I tell you, as a farmer probably the most important knowledge you can have is about the upcoming weather, whether it is trying to avoid rain because you are spraying or making sure that you sow at the right time and you have got the right moisture. So it is very important that more money is spent on that research.
I found recommendation 8 quite interesting. The committee recommended:
…
the Australian Government develop an education and training scheme for farmers in the understanding and use of weather and climate information.
In my experience I am not sure that is necessary. Every farmer I know knows a lot about the weather. That is what controls their lives, and they use every bit of the latest technology, going onto the Bureau of Meteorology website to get long-term and short-term forecasts or sometimes to find out what is happening in just the next couple of hours. If you go onto the website you can find very accurate forecasts by looking at the radar—some of us would have seen that on the cricket forecasts—which shows the weather patterns and where the weather is coming from.. So I am not convinced that that recommendation is going to be all that necessary. I am not saying that it is a bad recommendation; I am just not sure that we actually need to do a lot in that area.
Recommendation 10 is good because the committee recommended:
… the Australian Government, as part of its ongoing strategy development to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, develop a strategy to capture, evaluate and disseminate the range of farmer driven—
and that is the important thing, that they are farmer driven—
innovations that have a significant capacity to increase the resilience and productivity of farm enterprises.
Farmers in this country have got a really good record of inventions and innovations, going back as far as the stump-jump plough, for example, or the Sunshine harvester, the first motor driven harvester. Certainly by today’s standards you would think: ‘An eight-feet comb?’, but it was better than what they had with the horse and dray. Of course now we have 40-feet combs and huge headers for reaping. From that original innovation they have expanded and obviously moved on to something better. That original innovation happened in Australia and of course it progressed from there as time went on.
Recommendation 11 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government ensures that there is an overall body to receive and analyse research and co-ordinate research across the nation in relation to climate change adaptation in agriculture—
that lovely word ‘adaptation’—
and that said body is given the necessary resources of staff and funds to carry out its role.
I think it is very sensible that we have some coordination of the information we are getting that can be disseminated to farmers—and the ability to take up the latest innovations and technology. Look at minimum till. When I grew up, 50 years ago, you had to plough the paddock at least four or five times to kill the weeds. Unfortunately, doing that you used up a lot of the moisture. You may have killed the weeds but you used a hell of a lot of diesel running the tractors to plough those paddocks and sometimes you just did not get it in time. Now with direct till you go straight in, you do not waste the moisture, you use a lot less fuel and, if you believe in problems with CO2, you are reducing the CO2. In fact, farming in Australia is the only industry that has actually reduced its CO2. Farmers have done it not because of climate change but because they want to save money and do their farming better. It is the only industry in Australia that has done it and they have done it without government help. So if we can help a bit that is good.
The last recommendation that I want to refer to is:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give further consideration to the analysis of government policy and outcomes in the submission to the current inquiry made by the Future Farm Industries CRC, with a view to ensuring the better coordination of research and extension efforts and the delivery of effective policy outcomes.
That might sound a bit like a ‘program specificity’, which we have all heard about, but if you actually bring it down to plain language it is saying that we need the coordination by the CRC in farming, and that is important because that coordination will help get that information disseminated to the farmers of Australia to make them even better farmers. So put it in plain language and get away from the program specificity, but if you look into it deeply it is actually a very good recommendation.
Can I congratulate the committee on their work. They have done a great job and it has been a pleasure to talk on this issue.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I too congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker May, on your appointment to the Speaker’s Panel and wish you the very best in keeping members under control. It is interesting following the member for Barker. The member for Barker unfortunately did not follow the practice of the committee in its attempts to keep this pretty much a bipartisan issue. The member for Barker would have us believe that carbon in our atmosphere could be stabilised to below five per cent of our 2000 levels just by adopting the recommendations of the committee. It is an interesting concept because most of those recommendations are focused on research and development, in other words, bringing to a commercial stage many of the innovations we would all hope collectively to see in place in the future. So it is an interesting angle and approach that he chose to take on this occasion.
I am not a farmer, unlike the member for Barker, and, indeed, I am not a member of the committee. But I have represented farming communities for some 14 years in this place and on that basis it should not be a surprise to anyone to see me seeking an opportunity to provide some reflection and some comment on the committee’s work. The report entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change
is a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources. I agree with the member for Barker on one thing: this is a good report. It is a practical and pragmatic report, and I too congratulate the committee on its very good work.
As the member for Lyons indicated in his chairman’s foreword, the committee was less interested in arguing the toss over issues like climate change because, as he indicated, there is a diversity of views among committee members. Rather, the committee was much more interested in seeking practical solutions to some of the challenges that farmers face particularly as they relate to dramatic changes in our climatic conditions here in Australia. This approach underscores the great value of our parliamentary committee work. It is often underappreciated. It is an environment in which members can work in a bipartisan way towards the common good and, again, I congratulate the committee on doing so on this particular occasion.
Very much underappreciated in the Australian community also, I think, are the challenges that our farming communities face, for example drought, salinity, water allocation issues, declining commodity prices, rising input prices, and monopsony buyers, which is something close to my heart in terms of my own electorate. Then there are the difficulties in securing the services of skilled employees, and conflicting land use issues which are increasingly encroaching on some agricultural pursuits, and of course there is globalisation and industry rationalisation. In the wine industry, for example, oversupply is a big issue and of course for farming communities we also have isolation and all the social issues which go with that. I was particularly pleased to see the committee focusing more broadly on those social issues and not just looking at things which people would come to understand as issues pertaining directly to the challenges of tilling the soil and producing crops.
The committee took a year to make some 15 recommendations. During the year it considered 73 submissions and held 14 public inquiries. It also visited five states, looking at innovative farming practices in particular. The report very much focuses on the way in which climate change makes life more difficult for already challenged families. It highlights the need to provide greater counselling support and to listen more to what farmers are saying and to look more closely at their local innovation.
The report places great emphasis on the need for a greater investment in research and development, particularly in areas like soil carbon sequestration, something we have spoken about already; and soil water retention strategies and, of course, water efficiency. Carbon sequestration has the potential to both increase crop yields and, of course, reduce carbon in our atmosphere—really good news for food security and really good news for our environment, if we can get that technology to commercial use.
Those who produce our food are part of our most important economic sector. Yet they face all the challenges which I spoke about earlier in my contribution. I want very briefly to highlight one of those challenges, and that is land conflict. In my own electorate this is a big issue, particularly in the upper reaches of my electorate. While there is no lack of appreciation of the wealth that has been provided by the coal industry—and may it long continue to provide that wealth—there is also an increasing concern that unsustainable or limited-time industries like coal are increasingly starting to threaten sustainable industries in agricultural pursuits, particularly the wine industry and, in particular, horse breeding in the upper Hunter, which is an important economic driver in my electorate.
I believe, as the local member, those concerns are growing and those voices of concern are growing louder. Demand for our commodities—from China, for example—is driving, firstly, a greater investment. That, in many ways, is a good thing. But that demand is also driving further and further expansion of coalmining, particularly open-cut coalmining, in the upper Hunter. Our coalmines are getting closer to our horse-breeding studs, closer to our agriculture, to our farms, and also closer to those who produce the fruit for our very, very important wine industry. I think it is time for government to sit up and take a bit more notice of that and to work harder at getting the balance between these various pursuits right.
Interestingly, the New South Wales government recently took the very good decision to finally move forward with investment in new power generation in New South Wales. This is critical: if we do not get it, the lights will go out by 2015. One of those power stations will be in my electorate, around the Bayswater area in the upper Hunter. That is all good news.
What did surprise me was the decision by the New South Wales government to keep open the option of a new coal-fired power generator. I think that is a mistake. I think it is very important to put in place a gas-fired power generator in the upper Hunter. Not only would this be very good for the environment, it would provide the foundation for a new pipeline coming from South-East Queensland right through the Hunter and down into Sydney. This would provide, for the first time, competition in pipeline supply of gas in both of those areas. That would, in turn, provide greater opportunities for those seeking to invest in energy-intensive industries in the Hunter because they would then face the prospect of competitively priced gas—something industry in the Hunter has not had the opportunity to secure at any time up until this day.
I think also that the decision to pursue a gas-fired generator would send a good message to those people who have expressed those concerns I mentioned earlier—the growing concerns about land-use conflict and the impact of coalmining on those various agricultural pursuits in the valley. These issues are much broader than those covered by this report, but they are very important issues and issues appropriate to raise here in this debate.
Again, I congratulate the committee on its work. I see that Tony Windsor, the member for New England, is here. I know he is an active part of that committee and I know that these are issues in which he shows a great deal of interest. I commend the report both to the parliament and to the broader Australian community.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2010-03-17,"—It is with pleasure that I speak to the report of the House Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. I thank the member for Hunter for his comments. This is a very well thought out report which identifies a whole range of issues in relation to agriculture, climate change, climate variability, drought and rain. Irrespective of what people think or do not think is happening in terms of the climate, I think this document is quite valuable as a policy document in a whole range of areas relating to things like landscape management through to various types of land use, right through to the sequestering of carbon in the soil and all the other issues that revolve around the climate change or global warming debate.
I would particularly like to congratulate the chairman of our committee, Mr Dick Adams, for the way in which he has chaired the committee. As the member for Barker mentioned, I have been a member of this committee for some years now and he was a previous member of the committee. Irrespective of who has been the chairman—the member for Hume, Alby Schultz, did an outstanding job—if an individual came in, they would not be able to pick the partisan politics in relation to the issues. That is to the committee’s great credit and I think that is reflected in this report. I notice the member for Barker was trying to score a few political points in relation to some of the things that are mentioned in this report, such as biochar and some of the technologies that farmers have adopted. He saw that as an endorsement of coalition policy. That may be the fact but I think it says more about the committee than about partisan politics in that the committee has taken evidence from the community and made certain recommendations in its report as a result of those findings. In no way has anybody—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.

(Ms S Bird)—Is the member willing to give way?
—Yes.
—Firstly, is the complete absence of any reference to an ETS in this document the reason why it is bipartisan; and, secondly, does it reflect the fact that in the farming community there is almost no appetite whatsoever for an ETS?
—As I was saying, the committee reflected on the evidence that was given to us. If the member would like to go back through the whole range of evidence that was given, he will see that the issues of carbon emissions and nitrous oxide emissions are in the document. There is quite a lot about the sequestering of carbon dioxide and the way in which agriculture can play a role in reducing its emissions. As to various market mechanisms or preferred market mechanisms taking care of those particular issues, the great bulk of evidence was around technologies and how agriculture can have a significant influence on reducing emissions. But it raises an interesting point. Irrespective of whether there is an emissions trading scheme or whether global warming, climate change—whatever you want to call it—were to go away tomorrow, many of the technologies that are talked about in this document should be looked at very closely by both sides of the parliament. I have my own personal views in relation to carbon pollution reduction schemes and emissions trading schemes. I believe that, eventually, if the globe does go down the path of some sort of emissions trading arrangement, there will have to be a price on carbon. I do not think you can really come to grips with that. I say that as one who raised the issue of soil carbon some three or four years ago before the buzzwords ‘carbon pollution reduction’ had actually entered the building.

The significant findings of this report as they relate to climate change, particularly in relation to carbon and the potential to sequester carbon in the soil as a way of ameliorating some of the issues in the atmosphere, should be looked at very closely, irrespective of what stage the emissions trading debate happens to be up to. It relates to the accumulation of humus and organic matter in the soil, and thinking farmers have been doing this for many years. If you accumulate humus and organic matter in the soil, which is in fact carbon, there is debate on whether, if there is a long dry spell or a drought and the soil cracks, that carbon is again released into the atmosphere—obviously part of the cycle. There are techniques, whether they be grazing or farming techniques, where the amount of soil carbon, which in most cases has been depleted over the years through various farming methods, can be increased. That may have a positive impact on global issues. Personally, I have some doubts as to how it will fit in a market mechanism. There are now some arrangements in various parts of the United States and in Australia where soil carbon is being traded in a voluntary market.
As a farmer, I believe that the great benefits of the carbon debate will not be in the carbon market but will be in the increased productivity that will come about by accumulating humus and organic matter in soils and with other practices, whether they be pasture technologies, no-till farming, conservation farming or a range of other things. The combination of technologies will allow more moisture to be retained at depth in soils, technologies such as GPS and practising controlled traffic where the movement of tractors and headers takes place over one portion of a paddock, time in and time out, rather than trampling down the top soil, as traditional methods have done.
There are other policy issues which start to come to the fore. The document addresses those and I am sure there are members of the committee who personally do not agree with some. It is to the credit of the committee that they have built what the community is saying into the document rather than trying to politicise the document itself with partisan political positions. This is a very valuable document in terms of drought policy because it identifies a lot of the technologies which farmers are using, can use, can modify and can adapt, which will ameliorate drought. By using some of those technologies, I have seen in my own electorate, and in others, where drought starts and finishes on the boundary. Drought is not necessarily about a total lack of rain; it is about how you manage the water when rain occurs.
Further down the track, there will be some policy issues which we will have to look at very closely. For instance, the terms ‘interception’ and ‘diversion’ are very much part of the 2007 Water Act and as we speak the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is putting in place the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Could some of these technologies be interpreted or defined as being interceptions of water that would otherwise have run off into our river systems? For instance, because no-till farming is changing the nature of the topsoil and increasing the capacity of the soil to take in moisture when it is raining, that means, in effect, that there is additional storage in the better soils of up to six inches of available moisture—six inches of rainfall moisture, not six inches in depth.
Agroforestry is carbon positive and water run-off negative. Could that land use be interpreted as an interception? The Murray-Darling Basin Authority are currently looking at what is going to be the volume of water falling in valleys. How does groundwater relate to surface water? How much will there be at the end of it—how much for the environment, how much for farmers and how much for anybody else at the Murray mouth?
Could those very technologies that this document identifies that are carbon positive be in fact negatives in terms of water policy? There are a various number of collision courses that I can see happening throughout agriculture and the way it interfaces with policy making. Not the least is this issue of food security. There is this preoccupation that the world is running out of food and that we need all our agricultural land to go towards food production. That would be all right if you could make some money out of growing food, but we export 80 per cent of what we produce in this nation, so in a sense we produce too much of the stuff and occasionally we have to bribe an Arab or two to get rid of some wheat, as has happened in the past.
So the debate comes round to what is the best land use: is it necessarily agriculture? If we are talking about methane from animals as being a negative in terms of the carbon economy, and nitrous oxide, which is nitrogen fertiliser, and carbon emissions from heavy use of machinery, are we better off to look at other options for land use? What about agroforestry? It is carbon positive but it interferes with water policy. How do we reconcile those water budgets? What about third-generation biofuels where you actually plant a crop once and then annually harvest it? It has the capacity to sequester carbon at depth, which a lot of crops do not have. It is carbon positive with depth storage of carbon. It is soil erosion positive. It is a biofuel, so it ticks the boxes in terms of the carbon world again. If it was land that used to grow food, wheat for instance, all the negatives from Australia to our marketplaces are transport negatives, carbon negative, carbon negative—real costs.
This is what we should think about in terms of an emissions trading arrangement: how agriculture fits in that and where the interface of food from land use and energy from land use starts to collide. I do not think at the policy level we have really looked at that too closely. For instance, the major part of wheat, the starch in wheat, is carbon. If we are growing massive quantities of wheat using massive quantities of diesel and then massive quantities of transport fuels et cetera to create an export economy so that we can exchange that wheat for money and then buy fuel, carbon, and bring it back again to have the fellow going round in circles on his tractor again, would we not be better to consider the option of cutting the corner and saying, ‘Well, if we are only doing it to buy fuel, why not grow fuel?’ Why not grow a biofuel which sequesters carbon at depth? There are massive areas around Walgett through to Narrabri, vast areas of black soil in Australia that could be quite effective at sequestering carbon at depth, irrespective of whether there is a market for that or not.
I think this document raises a whole range of issues but it is very important in terms of the drought debate, it is very important in terms of the emissions debate and it is very important in terms of the water use efficiency debate and how that relates to the total system. What it does show very clearly, though, is that the farmers who have been at the cutting edge of technology are a long way in front of the researchers. I think government has got to start to take the leash off some of these researchers. Soil science has been ignored for 30 years, and here we are talking about the very basics of life: what makes up the soil, what makes it live, how that relates to carbon and what the interactions with the atmosphere are. We are starting to look at that again because of the climate change and global warming debate. It is a debate that we should have had years ago, irrespective of climate change, and it is something that government should take account of now.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—The report by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources entitled
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
is an important document for now and for the future. One of the great things about where my electorate is located, on the beautiful Central Coast—and I acknowledge the member for Robertson, who shares the beautiful Central Coast with me—is that there are many areas where residential suburbs interface with picturesque rural land. One minute you can be driving through typical suburban streets with brick houses, well-kept lawns and curbs and guttering and the next minute you can have expansive views of farmland with cattle grazing and undulating hills in the background. It is a very mixed area in terms of the environment.
We do not have extensive areas of farmland, unlike many other parts of New South Wales, but we do have some important agriculture on the Central Coast. For instance, the region has the largest kiwifruit farm on the eastern seaboard of Australia, and there are extensive properties specialising in cut flowers for both the domestic and overseas markets. In fact, I was recently talking to a Zimbabwean couple who picked out the Central Coast as having the perfect climate for roses. They were planning to set up a business and were looking at all sorts of countries around the world, looking at the temperature and so forth, and they have now set up a successful rose growing business on the Central Coast in my electorate. Following along the lines of selling coal to Newcastle or supplying champagne to the French, we actually have Japanese companies now buying green tea grown on the Central Coast. It is another important area of agriculture that we have. So, while the Central Coast is a relatively small agricultural area, it is a very diverse agricultural sector.
While the Central Coast is probably the most beautiful area of Australia, we are also an area that is susceptible to the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, the environment in this region is very fragile. We have a thin coastline with developments there. In the middle of my electorate there is a beautiful lake which is prone to flooding, as it has access to the sea. An issue such as rising sea levels affects everyone on the Central Coast, particularly those in my electorate. When I walked along the beach at North Entrance earlier this year inspecting the damage done by a major storm—the sorts of hazards that many of my constituents face living so close to the ocean—it hit home to me just how fragile our environment is. A whole street of houses had lost large chunks of their backyards. There were bits of fences overhanging the beach, concrete pathways sticking out going nowhere because the backyard had been washed away. There were broken rails and trees uprooted along the fence line. In the backyard of one of these houses there used to be a beautiful glass fence. The glass fence had been completely washed away. The residents had over four metres of their backyard washed away because of this storm surge. These storm surges are becoming more regular as our climate is changing.
Because of this issue I made a submission to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, which delivered a very comprehensive report to the House last year. One of the places they visited—in fact, the first place they visited—was the electorate of Dobell. Dobell has three areas in particular that have been hit hard by the storm surges. The beaches at Wamberal have been washed away on a number of occasions, as have the beaches at North Entrance, which I have just been talking about. These beaches have extensive development on them. The beach at Little Cove at Cabbage Tree Bay at Norah Head has been closed now for over two years because there are houses on the clifftops that are literally falling into the bay as the erosion has occurred around this area due to the storm surges, and it is dangerous for people to go on that beach in case these houses do in fact fall off the cliff.
My electorate bears the full brunt of the storm surges on the coast, but it also bears the brunt of storm surges that come up through The Entrance and into the Tuggerah Lakes system which they did in 2007, causing extensive flooding inland around the lake where most of the population in my electorate live. This resulted in over 1,000 people having to be evacuated and moved in a massive coordinated response that was undertaken.
As was the report on the impact on climate of coastal communities important, so too is this report on how we assist farmers with the impact of climate change. That report on the impact on coastal communities made many recommendations in relation to us being prepared, action that we would need to take to mitigate these natural disasters, and why we need to act in relation to climate change. It was a very important report that brought home to everyone who lives on the coast the need to act. We cannot put our heads in the sand and hope that this issue will go away. It is affecting my community right now.
The report we are talking about today, on how we can assist farmers when it comes to dealing with the impacts of climate change, should be commended and its many recommendations should be endorsed. I will not go through all the recommendations, but some of them are particularly relevant to my Central Coast electorate. Part of a recommendation, which deals with investing research funding, is an overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, and it recognises as a high-priority area soil water retention strategies and water use efficiency. I am happy to say that, on the Central Coast, water efficiency has become a very strong culture, especially amongst its residents.
Our region—the region that the member for Robertson and I look after—sank to a very low point in water storage only a few years ago. In fact, our main dam was down to about 11 per cent capacity. We also had a pipeline from the Hunter, piping water into our electorate to ensure that we did not completely run out of water. Thankfully, that is not the case now but, as the total water storage level currently hovers around the 30 per cent mark, we have to remind ourselves that in terms of water storage we are still 70 per cent empty.
One thing that the Rudd government has done—one of the promises that we have acted upon—is to build a pipeline between the coastal dam and the water storage dam which, hopefully, we will be turning the sod for in the weeks ahead. That will, over time, ensure that the Central Coast is drought-proofed because of this good infrastructure that the Rudd government has put in that affects those two seats on the Central Coast. The whole subject of water efficiency, from areas such as water harvesting and recycling to cutting evaporation rates on farms, is increasingly being embraced by businesses that include farms. I know of at least one hydroponic salad/vegetable farm which built new greenhouse structures, incorporating rainwater collection and storage, making themselves almost completely self-sufficient in water use. Quite a few orange and other fruit growers on the Central Coast have already adapted their fields so there is better water retention in the soil. They have certainly improved their water use efficiency.
The committee also recommended that the Australian government support further research efforts into the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. In another recommendation the committee said that the government should increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agricultural sector and the development of alternative energy and fuels on farms, particularly in the area of biofuels, biomass from agricultural waste and biochar.
There is another recommendation that is very interesting from the point of view of the Central Coast area. The committee recommended that the government:
… increase funding for research into improving the consistency and accuracy of weather and climate forecasting, especially at a seasonal and regional level.
Following that is the recommendation that the government develop an education and training scheme for farmers in the understanding and use of weather and climate information.
Currently, weather forecasts on the Central Coast are included as part of the larger Hunter area. Clearly, the Central Coast is not the Hunter area. One of the things that I am pushing for is to ensure that we have our own weather forecasts that are tailored to the Central Coast that will have the effect of giving greater accuracy and consistency in forecasting for the area. That is one thing this committee recommended: ensuring that there is greater accuracy and forecasting at a regional level. That is something that has a direct effect on my electorate. The committee also recommended that the government:
… maintain its commitment to climate change research pertaining to Australia’s agricultural industries, ensuring that the funding is committed, sustained and pays due attention to regional as well as national needs and priorities. Climate change research must reflect the changes affecting different regions, soils and topography—as all have an impact on changes in farming practices to deal with them.
I am certain our farmers on the Central Coast will welcome this recommendation, as they will many of the others in this report. Another recommendation is that the Australian government:
… develop a strategy to capture, evaluate and disseminate the range of farmer driven innovations that have a significant capacity to increase the resilience and productivity of farm enterprises.
The member for New England was making that point in his contribution and I think it is a point well made. It is not just in the area of research that innovative issues are developed; more often than not, it is through dealing with issues of a practical nature on farms where these innovations first take place. That is something this report acknowledged, and it recommended that we make the dissemination of those innovations that have grown up through practice on farms easier so that the farming community as a whole can benefit from some of those innovative practices.
The committee has also recommended that the government:
… ensures that there is an overall body to receive and analyse research and co-ordinate research across the nation in relation to climate change adaptation in agriculture, and that said body is given the necessary resources of staff and funds to carry out its role.
I would encourage our farmers on the Central Coast to become involved in any such organisation and make valuable input. It is further recommended in the report that the government:
… give greater consideration to better integration of local and regional organisations into its overall response to the issues affecting agriculture and climate change, and provide additional funding to support the management role of these local and regional organisations.
On the issue of incentives for industry in agriculture, there is a recommendation that the government:
… explore further opportunities to facilitate adaptation to climate variability and climate change through the use of targeted, industry and issue specific, incentives.
Recommendation 15 calls for the government to:
… place funding for local and community organisations engaged in the work of supporting farmers in adapting to climate variability and climate change upon a permanent and regular basis.
To sum up, I would strongly urge those involved in our rather small but very diverse agriculture sector on the New South Wales Central Coast to have a close look at the report by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources and its recommendations. While not all of the recommendations will be relevant to them, there are some very important ones there that will be. It is essential that the farming sector on the Central Coast work closely with the federal government to ensure that their voice is heard when it comes to implementing the measures to deal with the impacts of climate change on farming.
One of the key features of this report was the continual recognition of making sure that there are regional and local solutions. Where those solutions exist, they are adapted to the local environments of the various regions around Australia. In my area on the Central Coast, we have always felt that we get lumped in either with Sydney or with Newcastle and the Hunter. The Central Coast is its own area. It has its own particular and unique problems. It has its own challenges in relation to many issues, not least of which is climate change. The committee should be commended for the many recommendations in this report that focus on a regional approach and on looking at the particulars of regional difficulties. There are few areas in Australia that face the variety of challenges in terms of climate change that my electorate faces. From the eroding coastlines and the flooding of the lakes through storm surges to the lack of water, these issues have greatly affected the lives of people living on the Central Coast, none more so than those people seeking to make a living from the land, who are perhaps even more vulnerable to these issues of climate change. This report has recommendations that are important for now, but it also has important recommendations for the future. I commend the report and its recommendations to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2010-03-17,"—I am very pleased to make some remarks on the
Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, a committee that I used to be a member of. I commend their work and the good people who make up that committee. This report is important to my electorate and there are some messages around climate change and farming that I would like to deliver to the House today.
People often think of farmers as being climate change sceptics and I appreciate that because, when I talk to the farmers in my area, they can be ambivalent about climate change and they can be concerned, curious and bewildered. It is not fair to say that they have turned their back on climate change. It is not fair to say that they reject the science out of hand. But, as they are very much at the cutting edge of what is going on and it is their livelihoods and families that are on the line, it is totally appropriate that they be healthily sceptical.
I think that when the government has responded to the challenge of climate change it has gone about in somewhat the wrong way. It has labelled many of the agricultural programs that we used to see in rural Australia as simply attaching to climate change. The issue of being soundly environmental—of saving energy, saving water and conserving soils—seems to take a secondary order of preference to climate change, and everything is up in lights under this big banner of climate change. The problem that farmers have with that is that they do not necessarily see the link between a grand, global strategic discussion and what they are actually doing in their back paddock—even though there very definitely is a link, and it is an important one.
So I have been disappointed to see some of the programs that the government has rolled out and the rebadging. When you look at the detail, I acknowledge that the content of some of those programs is valuable and useful to farmers. But what I noticed in a previous farming life and in the previous government where I had more contact with the agricultural portfolio is that we are losing a lot of our on-ground research extension and development. I note that recommendations 9 to 12 of the committee’s report focus on the research and extension—and I really want to commend that. That is a really good thing.
It is not just the role of federal governments to manage research and extension, but over the years we have seen the role of state departments of agriculture—which have often been rebadged as departments of climate change, too—their on-the-ground, practical role, vastly reduced. Consequently, there has been a vacuum and we have not really had enough agencies, enough funding or enough organisations to take the research and extension work up to farmers in the way that they really need to have that done.
I note the good work of the catchment management authorities in my area—the Murray Catchment Management Authority is one in particular, as is the Lower Darling and the Western Murray. The catchment management authorities have been left to pick up the ball and run with it on a lot of these projects. One of the ones that they are running in my area concerns some comparisons between different farms to try to evaluate the degree of climate change adaptiveness and the farming practices. What it comes down to is what the farming practices are that are being used and how they might best respond to climate change.
An example that I was told about recently concerns a selection of three different farms—one that would be using a rotational grazing and a mixed farming enterprise; one that would be using continuous cropping with stubble retention and minimum tillage; and another that might be using very old-fashioned plough, plough, plough farming methods—and looking at how soil carbon could be sequestered and the effect on the total farming enterprise from these different types of farming activities. You might think that this is something that we already know and that the science is already settled on, but it certainly is not because, in every different area of Australia, farming practices and responses are completely different depending on the soil types, the landscape, the rainfall and the level of technology that is employed.
By having these simple, practical demonstrations and experiments in an area and then publishing the results to all farmers and, most importantly, allowing farmers to actually look at the demonstrations, look at the on-site work and talk to each other about what is going on, you will spread the knowledge far better than grand plans and scientific programs. With all respect to the CSIRO and our other organisations, I do not believe that the work that they do is rooted sufficiently in practical farming. The response that many farmers have to multimillion dollar CSIRO studies and the glossy brochures that accompany them is, ‘What does this really mean for me? How does this affect my farming enterprise?’ I can hand any farmer that I know one of those glossy brochures and they can turn to any page in it and they can find a glaring error. That is because they know what they are doing and they understand what is required of them in their family farming business. And if they have survived the last 10 years of drought, I can pretty well say that they do what they do very well indeed.
Research and extension are the keys to helping farmers adapt to climate change. Because the state government has vacated the field to the extent that it has, the federal government has an obligation to step in. But, after the election of the current government, we saw a cut to the research and development corporations and the complete elimination of one of them: Land and Water Australia. That funding was and still is, though reduced, a very valuable source of funding direct from the federal government that receives a matching levy contribution from farmers—so they are strong stakeholders in it—and results in practical, on-the-ground projects that make a real difference to farmers.
There is a list of recommendations in this report and I am most attracted to the ones that relate to extension. I note that the previous member spoke about the risk of living on the coast and the problems with climate change and rising sea levels et cetera. That is something that nature may or may not produce, but in the area that I represent, the southern Murray-Darling Basin, other forces of adversity are at work. They consist of the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, the water buyback that she is imposing on rural communities and the complete lack of response to our urgent representations about looking after the social and economic effects of those water buybacks—the so-called triple bottom line—and the resulting devastation these Rudd government policies are generally having on farmers in western New South Wales.
When a committee such as this looks at farming for the future, and I know that they looked at the role of government in assisting farmers adapt, it is certainly appropriate to make some remarks about how governments could get out of the way in examples where farmers are struggling against drought, low or zero water allocations and the accumulated effects of 10 years of this existence on their bank balances when government policies are making it more difficult. And I do not want to just throw brickbats without throwing some bouquets. I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for extending exceptional circumstances across nearly all of my electorate and recognising that farmers simply cannot move into profitable situations once rain falls—and it has been patchy in some areas. Farmers do need that extended support, and that comes in the form of interest-rate subsidies and household support, which is a fortnightly payment through Centrelink. Without that we really would not have managed to get through the last five years. I appreciate the fact that the minister for agriculture accepted the recommendations of the National Rural Advisory Committee and extended exceptional circumstances for a further 12 months, starting on 1 April this year.
However, one area east of the Hume Highway, in what was the old Hume rural lands board but is now a livestock health and pest authority—it is hard to keep up with the changing names in the New South Wales government—has been taken out of exceptional circumstances. I met with the minister for agriculture and I have been encouraged by his willingness to have another look at this. Although he is not personally responsible for the inclusion or noninclusion of zones into exceptional circumstances—the National Rural Advisory Committee advises him on that—he said that if New South Wales comes forward with a case to his department then whatever can be done will be done.
We really do need that to happen, because that particular zone of my electorate of Farrer east of the Hume Highway, containing the towns of Holbrook and Tumbarumba—which is just outside my electorate; it is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro—has been badly affected by drought. There has been a very poor response to the small amount of rain we have had. The area has quite acid soils so it does not recover easily. The temperatures are about to get quite a lot colder—it is the upper Murray—and the area around Tooma was very badly affected by fires a few months ago and was completely burnt out. I appreciate that exceptional circumstances cannot necessarily respond to bushfires, but that has added to the significant load that farmers must bear in this situation. I do hope that some help and support can be given for that remaining zone of western New South Wales to be included back into exceptional circumstances and that we do get the support we need. Meanwhile, I commend the report
Farming the future
to everybody. It is an important contribution to the public policy debate in this area.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I agree with many of the comments the member for Farrer has just made in relation to this overall topic and the object of this report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources,Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Like the member for Farrer, I hope that people find this report of use. I can say as a proud member of this committee that it was a real eye-opener to listen to the face-to-face submissions that were presented to us, to read a number of the submissions and visit many of the sites.
I will make a few comments in relation to the report, adding to what I mentioned yesterday at the media release and media event associated with it. Before I do, I congratulate all the members of the secretariat involved with the report. I have been on this committee for a number of years and I find them to be highly professional, very supportive and very good at their job.
Irrespective of the political, public debate that was going on, is going on and will continue to go on in regard to climate change—unless some people think that the issue has somehow disappeared because of Copenhagen—about the extent of human contribution to carbon dioxide levels and greenhouse gases, the majority of farmers that we met have been going about the practical business of adapting to changes in weather patterns. People argue about what has caused the changes in weather patterns—although personally I think the science has pretty well established what is going on there contrary to the contrarians, particularly in this place, and some of the conservative press. The major issue for farmers is that they have to go about adapting to changing climate conditions, and that is what they have done. We saw the full range, including those that essentially are unable to cope for a variety of reasons with these changing circumstances, and that has inevitable consequences for them individually, for their families and for their communities. Unless mitigating factors come into play then many of those enterprises will be uneconomical, will consequently become totally unviable and will fall over.
Right the way through there was a whole range of responses to climate change. This report highlights many of them, and they are very exciting. It shows that many of our farmers and farming communities are very adaptable, very innovative, very progressive and very good at what they do. What they seek is support wherever that is necessary and available to assist them to get on with the job of doing what they do best.
I mentioned before the tension between the political debate and the realities of climate change. The tensions that exist on farm are also highlighted in this report. In particular, I would recommend chapter 2, headed ‘Managing decisions on the farm’, which highlights the tensions not just in decision making but in who makes the decisions and what types of decisions should be made now and into the future. That became very evident during the inquiry. The report suggests that resources be put into counselling families and business owners in decision making and, particularly, change, including generational change.
People must think their food just pops onto their plate or into their cupboard—that they make it at the supermarket or in the truck that brings it to their place. The whole enterprise of food production and manufacturing in Australia exists outside the metropolitan areas. There is huge social and economic change going on out there, and there is a lot of tension. This report seeks various ways in which to support those producers of our product so they are able to keep doing that in the best way. Unless we support them—and I do not think I am being overly alarmist—our ability to feed ourselves will be greatly diminished.
That leads me to some other tensions that we discovered in this investigation. They are natural tensions, by the way; I am not suggesting for a moment they are not. There are those that find it very difficult to accept change. If you look at the full extent of the climate change argument, it becomes so overwhelming that you think that you cannot deal with it or solve it at an individual level and therefore you tend to reject it, whereas reality says you have to cope with the conditions that you have. So there is an overwhelming tension there. The other tension is between those who do not see it as so much of a challenge or a threat and those who see it as an opportunity, and there are many opportunities for farming the future that are highlighted in this work.
The other tension, which I referred to earlier, is in terms of the production of food. Some of the opportunities for our farming enterprises can in fact be contradictory to the production of food. We could be creating resources which mitigate carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and create renewable energy and regeneration. Those require land—which may well be suitable for the production of food. Farmers have to survive, so we as a community need to look at that situation and offer them avenues to reconcile these possible tensions, and they do exist. It is very enlightening to see some of those examples here.
Amongst many other things, I found of particular interest, on the social side, the work of Professor Frank Vanclay and Aysha Fleming of the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research. They are social researchers who look at change in relation to farming techniques and climate change. For the record, because I think it is well worth reflecting on, I would like to quote from their evidence to us:
Resistance to change is not just about individual reactions, it is a broader social issue. This means that resistance does not occur within an individual’s head, or because of an individual’s personal characteristics—education level, personal motivations or situation, skills or beliefs. Resistance is created by common perceptions, norms and values held in society. In our society currently, resistance is being created because climate change is perceived as being:
‘just’ another environmental or global threat,
too big to influence,
an unmanageable and inequitable financial burden, and;
too uncertain to warrant major action.
They go on to say:
Mitigation of climate change is seen by many farmers as a financial burden, rather than an opportunity. This can create anger and stress, because profit margins are further reduced and farmers risk viability.

They then go on to say:
Our research suggests that although the majority of farmers believe that climate change is occurring, there is widespread confusion about its causes, and they are not necessarily convinced by the suggested need for urgent adaptation and mitigation. As a result, we believe that:
1. there is an on-going need for clear statements that the science is decided and the government will act on climate change;
If you go on the nature of this place, there is no hope of that. I have to say that those opposite and the conservative press have done a great job on that. But I have got news for you: nothing is going to change. It is happening and there will be a lot more evidence to show you. I found it pretty interesting—the other mob reckon they are the mob for farmers and rural and regional Australia, and they were the very people against the attempts to provide sane, rational, scientific reasoning behind climate change—
—There is none!
—I have to say! Put it on the record: ‘There is no evidence of climate change.’ I ask you! Don’t talk on this report, mate! Don’t talk on this report, because you do not even believe in it. I and some of your colleagues from that side just wasted a few months on nothing? I ask you! Are you the spokesman for anything but nothing? If I may continue, they go on to say:
2. there is a need for more research into the beneficial actions agricultural industries can take, and active extension of this information to farmers.
The member for Farrer quite rightly pointed out that these extension programs should be practised on the ground so people can see them. If we can support that, that is much better for farmers than our acting in a vacuum. They respond very positively. They go on to say:
However, more than just information is necessary. Support for farmers to implement actions and to work together is needed. This needs to include financial incentives, opportunities for building social networks, collaborations, recognition and rewards;
Indeed, rewarding the work of our farmers is very important. They go on:
3. finally, the social value farmers hold and exercise as ‘stewards of the land’ needs to be recognised and encouraged.
Again, I would like to congratulate all my colleagues for spending so much valuable time on this report,

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak on the reportFarming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change
and the issue in general. I think farmers are more aware what is happening with the climate than most of the scientists are, actually. They actually have to deal with it instead of just talk about it. I would like to start by congratulating the committee on tackling what is, for many people, not a sexy issue. Yet I strongly believe that food and water security will be—in fact is—the defining issue of the 21st century. On Monday, the member for Lyons, in handing down this report, said that the journey in front of us will take a ‘sustained effort on the part of government, industry and community over a period of decades.’ I wish to outline just how crucial the final two groups mentioned by the member for Lyons are when tackling this issue.
Before I get into the debate I would like to pose a couple of questions to the House: where do you think our food will come from in the future, and what is Australia’s greatest competitive advantage over its trading competitors? Those things certainly have been brought out by the debate on the importation of meat from BSE affected countries. The greatest threat to our agriculture in the next 50 years is not climate change but the policies put in place by governments to combat what they talk about as climate change variability. The Labor government’s emissions trading scheme legislation was, is and will be a debacle and it should be voted down once again. It is nothing but a tax on production that will drive businesses and jobs offshore. All it will achieve is a new export: carbon emissions. Electorates such as my electorate of Calare, which are exporting wealth-generating electricity, will bear the brunt of the cost of the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme, which is nothing more than a new tax on production with another name.
I was recently in Brazil and America and, with regard to the current global downturn, I was interested to note that Brazil, like Australia, has been relatively—and I stress the word relatively—unaffected. Why? For the same reason that the Midwest states of America are less affected than the east and west coasts of America: they are agricultural and mining states, just as we are base minerals producing countries—in other words, those involved in actually doing things rather than money shuffling, trading and services. They are the countries and the parts of countries that are dealing with this the best.
The effect of the legislation will be felt much more brutally in regional Australia than in the capital cities—in other words, in those parts of the country that are protecting Australia at the moment. The productive sectors are what the CPRS is going to hit the most. I do not believe excluding agriculture from having to purchase carbon credits is a huge win. In or out, agriculture will be almost the most affected industry in the country. The latest ABARE report on the cost of the Rudd government’s CPRS states:
Even if the agriculture sector is not a covered sector under the CPRS, agricultural producers will face increased input costs associated with the use of electricity, fuels and freight and may face lower farm-gate prices for their goods from downstream processors—
who will directly get all those carbon onsets—
These will have implications for the economic value of farm production.
The increase in the price of electricity is estimated to be almost seven per cent in 2011 and 24 per cent in 2015. Not long ago, that was the next decade; now it is this one. It is only five years away. That is without states whacking another 20 per cent on the price of electricity, as New South Wales did the other day.
Whether it is the current drought or future climatic change, the result is a dry weather cycle. What we need is government investment into research on practical, productive measures which will allow our farmers to increase productivity. A drought is exactly the same as the real or imagined effect of climate change—you have to produce more with less—and it needs investment in new plant varieties which are disease resistant and can tolerate dry conditions. Yet all we have had from this Labor government in its first three years in government is massive customer research and development. I was amused to hear the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, when he was asked recently what one of his notable achievements was, say ‘increases in R&D’. I was totally staggered. I am somebody who actually knows what happened to the R&D budget and what the department of agriculture has lost—yet he talks about increases. I would love to know where they are. Our farmers are already being forced to produce more with less, particularly with less water and less arable land—land because urbanisation unfortunately takes a lot of the best land closest to the best towns in the best country.
At a time when the world population is set to double within the next 30 years and the ravages of global warming or drought are meant to hit us there is a very real possibility of Australia becoming a net importer of food. The biggest issue arising out of global warming will be food security, how we increase food production and, indeed, where our food will come from. The Rudd government think so little about where our food will come from that agriculture and agricultural manufacturers and processors are the only sectors not receiving free permits—they do not have a $500 million clean coal fund or a $6 billion clean car fund.
Despite what the Prime Minister might believe, you cannot eat coal and if we are going to feed the nation then agriculture has to be put at the forefront of this debate. The Rudd government has no idea what its emissions tax will cost the mums and dads. It never engaged in an honest debate about the real cost of a carbon tax, but I think the Australian population have engaged in that debate and have made a judgment on it. Our comparative advantage in Australia has always been our relatively cheap energy and water costs, but both of these will be artificially increased under this great big new tax.
You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that just about every bit of food and fibre grown in Australia involves some form of processing, manufacturing and transport before it is eaten or worn. Yet none of our manufacturers will be eligible for free permits under the ETS. The food manufacturing sector is the last major manufacturing sector left in Australia, employing over 300,000 people, mainly in regional Australia. It is vital to our nation’s food security, and the coalition is extremely concerned about its viability. For example, we are extremely concerned that there will be only one frozen vegetable processing plant left in the country after McCains close their Tasmanian plant to move to New Zealand. That is a major concern and it has to be addressed.
The
Australian National Greenhouse accounts
and the
National inventory by economic sector, released in June, paint an interesting story. Agriculture, fisheries and forestry have been doing all of the heavy lifting in reducing the nation’s greenhouse gases. Emissions from agriculture, fishing and forestry have declined by well over 30 per cent since 1990. The agricultural sector has led the nation in reducing emissions, yet it is the food and fibre industries which will bear the brunt of Kevin Rudd’s proposed ETS. If global warming, because of carbon pollution, is a doomsday scenario—and many, including the government, are warning us that it is—then it needs an emergency response. I hope that the committee has highlighted the excellent work that farmers are already doing to combat climate variability.
One thing that simply cannot happen if we are serious about the long-term sustainability of the land and the industry is a cut in funds for research and development. As with any other industry, staying up to date with the latest technological and industrial improvements allows our Australian producers to keep ahead of the pack when it comes to the global agricultural market. Funding is absolutely essential. Cutbacks will harm the industry and there are no two ways about it. I urge the member for Lyons to speak to his colleagues, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry continues to hang an axe above these funds. Emerging countries are threatening Australia’s foothold in some of our major export markets. The dumping of cheap produce on the Australian economy hurts our producers. We cannot afford to compete with China, Indonesia or Brazil on labour costs.
As the driest continent on the planet we are already in a difficult situation. We need funding in research and development to ensure that Australia continues to lead the way as one of the cleanest, greenest producers in the world. We are known for that. The parliament should also be aware that people on the land are aware of the challenges they face and are, in most circumstances, taking action. To survive the worst drought in my lifetime, farmers have had to change their managing practices just to survive—not to make Kevin feel better but because economic and personal need make them do it. The story that the stereotype cocky is resistant to change and do not adapt with the stock they run because they are stubborn is simply not true. Anyone like that does not survive.
The industry as a whole is willing to do what it can to improve its profit-making ability and improve the product being provided. When it all boils down, no other industry stands to lose more in the event of climate change coming to fruition—as per the doomsday scenario or as predicted by those who sensibly understand that climate change does happen. That is a fact that farmers and producers are all too aware of. One thing, however, sets this industry apart: the great connection producers have with the land that they work. No other industry has such a reliance on land as the agricultural industry. That connection means that seldom do people know more about what has happened to the soil and feed than the person working the land themselves.
There is a great variation in the soil quality and crop and stock potential in my electorate of Calare, not to mention across the whole of Australia. That is why a one-size-fits-all solution is the most ridiculous option you could ever come up with. The standing committee were clearly aware of this when they canvassed producers from across the country; however, the point should be made very clear.
The second group mentioned by the member for Lyons on Monday was communities. We need strong regional communities for a strong agricultural industry. It should be made very clear that a strong community involves strong health facilities, water security and educational opportunities. All three of these factors are currently under threat, particularly in New South Wales, by a city-centric focus in government. Regional Australia cannot be administered in these three areas in the same way as Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or even somewhere like Newcastle.
There is great concern in my electorate of Calare about the shortage of regional health facilities, and the Prime Minister’s new health plan has done little to ease that worry. In fact, as a result of comments made by the New South Wales Premier, small communities are very worried that their local hospital will be closing because of Labor’s health plan. There is also concern about educational prospects, and the Deputy Prime Minister’s latest backflip on youth allowance has done little to ease them.
These are all issues which affect a farmer’s ability to know, to use and to educate his family to ensure the continuance that has always been there. Infrastructure has been poorly managed by the Labor Party at the state level, and without good railroad and port infrastructure farmers will not be able to shift their product. This government has to realise that strong facilities will help create a strong community, and a strong community will mean a strong agricultural sector.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2010-03-17,"—I rise to speak in support of the report,Farming the future, and particularly the 15 recommendations. I was very pleased that the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources took up this issue, which is about helping farmers with adaptation to climate change. It puts the farmers front and centre stage, as they need to be, as we as a nation grapple with the impact of climate change.
Before I turn to the report, and the 15 very specific and well targeted recommendations, I would like to say some things regarding climate change, the basis of the committee’s report to assist farmers. My seat is a rural seat. It has a long and beautiful coastal strip that goes from Ballina to Evans Head, Iluka, Yamba, Wooloweyah and Angourie, which has some of the best beaches and one of the world’s top surfing beaches—out of the top 50, it is No. 10. So it is a beautiful coastal strip and a rural seat. As members could imagine, it is a population that is concerned about climate change and has been very actively involved in those particular debates. Even when I was first elected as the member for Page, the mayors who have the coastal strips in their areas approached me and talked about the need to have some certainty around planning and development in the coastal areas. They were very pleased to see the report. They were also very pleased to see another report that came out of this place, the report on coastal areas and climate change.
I accept climate change as a fact and a lot do. I accept climate change and the current events that are happening to be as a result of human activity. And, yes, climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon and has been around for a long time. But the evidence is clear that the exponential rate of what is happening with climate change and the major events and more extreme events are due to human activity.
I know that this week there has been a lot of attention given to the fact that CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have said that global warming is in essence unquestionable—that is, it is resulting from human activity. That is not new. These institutions have been saying that for quite some time. It is on their websites; it is in their reports. In fact, they have been leading agents in this debate, and whenever I have been talking about climate change I refer to them. These two institutions are trusted by I would have to say nearly all Australians and they are ones that farmers turn to. Now that a lot of us, not all of us, are connected and on websites, we go to the Bureau of Meteorology website, or BOM, daily. It is a daily event in my office because I live in an area where we do have a few extreme weather events and we have floods and we have droughts; we have the extremes in the whole Northern Rivers and North Coast strip. So it is something that we look at all the time to see what is going on. They really are trusted. Farmers and people on the land and people everywhere go to those sites.
You have people like Dr Megan Clark, the head of CSIRO, saying this week that we are seeing significant evidence of a change in climate and saying:
If we just take our temperature, all of Australia has experienced warming over the last 50 years. We are warming in every part of the country during every season and as each decade goes by, the records are being broken.
We are also seeing fewer cold days, so we are seeing some very significant long-term trends in Australia’s climate.
Dr Clark further is reported as saying that scepticism is a healthy part of the scientific process and has been considered as part of the climate change debate. Indeed it has, but she says that we also know that the rapid increase that we have been measuring was at the same time as we saw the Industrial Revolution, so it is very likely that these two are connected. When we look at climate change and look at the scientific evidence, the whole basis of science and the scientific method is that it is not 100 per cent but it is something that is stronger than the balance of probabilities, and in a legal sense, which I can refer to, it would be something beyond reasonable doubt. It is beyond reasonable doubt that we do have climate change.
In referring to the 15 recommendations I will make some comments on particular ones. The first one is the committee’s recommendation that the Australian government support rural counselling and support groups such as Rural Alive and Well and place funding for such groups on a permanent and regular basis. That is a very welcome and important recommendation. Rural counselling and support groups do such a wonderful job in country Australia; in my area they certainly do. I can remember when they did not exist and I can remember that people lobbied for them to be set up. Some were set up as extensions of our local counselling that happened in our health services, one in particular in my area. It was very welcome. We also have rural financial counselling, which is very important, and they work closely with the rural counselling. They sometimes are the first port of call in engaging people who do need ongoing counselling support. Rural financial counselling is very important indeed. In fact, next week I am attending as a guest the annual dinner of the Rural Financial Counselling Service New South Wales, Northern Region, which will be held in Casino. It provides a very important service in non-metropolitan areas.
I would like to comment on recommendation 3, which calls on the government to invest in research funding in the following high-priority areas: soil carbon sequestration; soil stabilisation and pasture improvements; soil water retention strategies and water use efficiency; landscape planning and natural resource management; and risk management. I would like to see within recommendation 3—and I am sure it is meant to cover this—a broader definition of soil carbon sequestration, because the sequestration of carbon is not just in soil; it is in all plants. That is an important area of research and study—Plantstone, as we would refer to it with the old fashioned name, but I am aware that name has also been patented by a couple of people at Southern Cross University. So, when we look at soil carbon sequestration, we should look at it more broadly and include the plants.
As some members would know, bamboo actually has the highest take-up of carbon, followed by sugar—this is from research in one particular area with one particular farm. Some time ago, the honourable member for New England, Tony Windsor, and I jointly hosted a session in Lismore with Southern Cross University, people from industry and farmers on the particular issue of plant sequestration and soil sequestration to get more information into the particular communities and to have more discussion and debate. Some of that was covered by
The 7.30 Report, particularly the research aspects at the farm. I am sure that when the recommendation says ‘soil carbon’ it is broad enough to include looking at it in its totality with the plants.
The report also talks about rotational grazing. That is not new; that is something that farmers have been doing for a long time. In fact, it is a very ancient practice. I sometimes think that, with the advent of modernisation and different techniques, some of those tried and true practices fell by the wayside. Again in my area, I recently attended a day that looked at rotational grazing and biodynamic farming et cetera. It was organised by Trevor Wilson. It was a very good day that was well attended by over 100 people who came from a wide region and mainly from farming backgrounds. It was really informative for me because I was able to sit there and listen for a few hours to people who do this and who, by doing it, have not only improved their pasture but increased their income as well. They were not revolutionary techniques; they were the tried and true and tested techniques. So any more attention that we can give to this in this place—and we are making recommendations to government—is a good thing. But we only have to look to the farmers themselves.
Recommendation 6 is an important one. It states:
The committee recommends that the Australian Government, as part of its overall response to issues affecting agriculture and climate change, increase its investment and support for research into energy efficiency in the agriculture sector and the development of alternative energy and alternative fuels on-farm, particularly in regard to:
Biofuels;
Biomass from agricultural waste; and
Biochar.
One of the things that would be really advantageous in Australia to help us in this area would be something like a biofuels institute and getting some more work done with CRCs. I have had some involvement with that with Southern Cross University, where I am on the governing council. Part of that debate is food versus fuel and I know that debate has to happen, but we do not have to get locked into either/or. There is room for all of it and that is a very important one to be looking at.
There is one other recommendation I wanted to turn to. Recommendation 15 says:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government place funding for local and community organisations engaged in the work of supporting farmers in adapting to climate variability and climate change upon a permanent and regular basis.
Hallelujah! Wouldn’t that be good? Often one of the problems people do face in local communities is ad hoc funding. That has been a feature of all governments, not any particular government. Some may do it more than others, but it has been a feature of all governments. To get the organisations that work, and that are deeply engaged in that area—
—It is one o’clock but I will let you go. You can have a minute and a half—go for it!
—I will wind up.
—I am going to be generous: you can keep going for a minute and a half.
—All right. I welcome that particular recommendation. I also welcome the government introducing the community organisational grants that go to Landcare groups and various other groups in the community. It would be really good to see a lot more work in that area. I think that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should be able to play a lead role in that area. I know that farmers have trust in that particular agency. It would be good if it could do that on a stand-alone basis and be able to take some lead. I know it is in certain other areas.
I look forward to the government’s response to this report, because as I read through the 15 recommendations, and as I also look at some of the initiatives that have been introduced by the government, I can see that there is a great deal of crossover already. Because it is about adaptation, because it relates to climate change, we do need to get some of these things on a standing basis, and this report really assists with that. I congratulate the chair of the committee, Dick Adams, the deputy chair and the rest of the committee for such good work that they have done.
