The SPEAKER
 (10:01):  Members will recall that, on 30 November 2016, question time was interrupted by a group of protesters in the public galleries and on the following day further protests occurred outside of the building. At the time, I indicated that the matter would be investigated and I would continue to update the House as appropriate. 


I can advise the House that, following referrals by ACT Policing to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the two offenders who abseiled down the front facade of Parliament House were summoned to appear before the ACT Magistrates Court last year for the charge of behaving in a disorderly manner on Commonwealth premises. 


Both offenders pleaded guilty to the charge and the matter was adjourned on 13 February this year. Last week, Magistrate Glenn Theakston fined the pair $1,500 each, which amounts to almost half the maximum fine for such an offence.I will continue to apprise the House on the matter.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:04):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 38th AIPA General Assembly, held in Manila, the Philippines, from 14 to 20 September 2017. As leader of the Australian observer delegation to the general assembly, it was an honour to attend this important forum of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. Last year was a significant year: 2017 was the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It was also the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Parliamentary arm of ASEAN— the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. 


As was noted during the first plenary session, the common goal of establishing an ASEAN community by 2025 will require stronger coordination between governments and legislatures. In this context, the general assembly focused on how AIPA and ASEAN can work together to bring about inclusive change to the communities in the region. The assembly also dealt with important regional concerns, including: humanitarian situations in parts of the region; combating illegal drugs, terrorism and trafficking; and enhancing cooperation in the use of science and technology for peaceful purposes.


As with the previous general assemblies, maritime disputes were also raised and parties were urged to work towards a peaceful resolution in accordance with international law. All countries reinforced AIPA's important contributions to maintaining peace, security and stability in the region; promoting cultural exchange and understanding; enhancing cooperation on transnational matters and improving prosperity throughout the region.


One of the key meetings for the Australian delegation was a formal dialogue session with representatives of ASEAN member countries. The dialogue session was an important opportunity to discuss cooperation and engagement between our parliaments and our nations. Warm discussions with the regional colleagues centred on strengthening cooperation in the areas of disaster management and combating transnational crimes. In particular, our work together with these countries was noted in the areas of terrorism, combating violent extremism and combating trafficking in persons. One of the most common messages during the session was the extent to which our regional partners value and continue to value our friendship and cooperation. Similarly, the dialogue session gave our delegation the opportunity to renew ties with parliamentary colleagues overseas and reinforce Australia's commitment to the South-East Asian region.


In addition to representing Australia at their AIPA general assembly, the delegation also attended appointments to reaffirm our ties with the Congress of the Philippines. The delegation was pleased to meet with several of our parliamentary and legislative colleagues, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss defence cooperation between our two countries, the situation in Marawi and the shared concerns about transportation, congestion and economic development. Australia has a meaningful and a longstanding relationship with our neighbours. We have had our multilateral relationship with ASEAN since 1974. Our ongoing presence at AIPA general assemblies reinforces our ongoing commitment to engaging with South-East Asia. Our commitment to attending AIPA general assemblies is an important opportunity to demonstrate Australia's support for ASEAN, which is something I will continue to support in the future.


I want to pay great respect to the secretary that we had with us, who is here in the chamber, Peggy Danaee. She did a fantastic job in coordinating a member of parliament and a senator—it was a bit like herding cats sometimes. But she did it quite ably and very well. A highlight of the trip was meeting not only the House of Representatives Speaker in the Philippines and the President of the Senate, but also the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte. It was something that both I and Senator Gallacher, who was the other delegate, very much enjoyed. 


On behalf of the delegation, I want to record our thanks to the host of the general assembly and to the parliament of the Philippines for its excellent hospitality and a very well-run general assembly. Before concluding, I want to thank the Australian Embassy in Manila for assisting with arrangements for the delegation, particularly in the congress, which enhanced the visit's success. I would also urge the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to give their full assistance to future parliamentary delegations to the AIPA General Assembly. It is imperative that parliamentarians are properly briefed in order to maximise this important opportunity for Australia in the South- East Asian region.


Finally, I would like to acknowledge Senator Gallacher, whose interest in international affairs, good humour and cooperation made a valuable contribution to the visit.


I commend the report to the House.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:11):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


One of the constants in my time as a member of the federal parliament has been people contacting me, or my office, to express their frustration with telecommunications providers. Sometimes it's customer service and long waiting times to get an issue resolved on the phone. Sometimes it's lengthy delays in getting the NBN hooked up, which I'll talk about a little later. And, increasingly, it's complaints about the quality and speed of their broadband connection, particularly when that quality and speed is significantly worse than what they were promised and what they expected.


My office and I are seeing this over and over again, where customers were promised one thing by a telco but got something markedly different. For instance, one constituent says he's being charged for a 25 megabit per second download speed and a five megabit per second upload on NBN fibre to the home, and he's actually getting less than one tenth of that. In other words, people are getting worse than dial-up speed when they've been promised a whizz-bang, superfast NBN connection.


Of course, this is a complex matter and there are obviously a range of factors that affect speed and performance. No-one is denying that, and the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misleading Representations About Broadband Speeds) Bill 2018 doesn't seek to deny it. What it does do is stop telcos making misleading claims about quality and speeds that the average customer will never actually receive.


Our consumer law is generally pretty strong and there are laws already against making misleading claims about a product. But, despite this, misleading claims by telcos are slipping through the cracks because they don't, technically at least, fall foul of the law. For example, if a telco says that you'll get a 25 megabit per second download speed, you may get that speed some of the time in certain circumstances. But, overwhelmingly, they're misleading claims and customers are being hoodwinked by the big telcos.


That's why this bill seeks to amend the Competition and Consumer Act to finally enshrine in consumer law that telcos must be up-front and honest about what they're selling. Indeed, this bill requires that telcos, when they sell a broadband service, be prohibited from claiming the service is of a particular quality or speed, without also including certain other information.


The bill sets this required information out in three broad categories: firstly, the typical, not maximum, speeds that the average customer can expect to receive; secondly, typical busy periods and what impact this can have on average speeds; and, thirdly, other factors that might be reasonably expected to affect performance. Moreover, there's a penalty of up to $1.1 million for noncompliance with these requirements, which is consistent with other penalties in consumer law.


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is alert to this issue and made it clear to the industry what they should be doing. ACCC chair, Rod Sims, personally has been upfront that misleading claims by telcos are in the commission's sights for 2018.


At the end of the day, if the feedback from my community is anything to go by, then the problem is still out there. So this bill will give certainty for consumers and build on the good work the ACCC is already doing by giving them the power, and a firm legal basis, to go after businesses that do the wrong thing.


The NBN is a very complicated area of policy and it's very poorly understood. I can't tell you how many people have contacted my office over the years who are confused and sometimes even frightened about how it all works. People are worried that they can't keep their home phone and that they'll have to buy a computer. People are worried that they're going to be without a phone because they've received a letter or heard from neighbours that the phone lines will be switched off. And when they try and contact the telco for answers, they simply can't get them. No wonder so many people turn to their member of parliament for assistance. The situations that I've just described are when someone is lucky enough to get the NBN connected. But I've lost track of the number of people who've experienced delay after delay in getting the NBN even hooked up—missed appointments, often over and over again, installations that don't work properly or have damaged property or left a mess for the customer to clean up. 


These situations are annoying and frustrating for residential properties. But when someone's trying to run a business and they need the phone and internet, as you so often do in this day and age, an NBN stuff-up can mean the difference between a business staying afloat and going under. And don't even think about trying to get compensation, because the big telcos hardly ever take responsibility for their failures. 


I'm sure you can well imagine someone's frustration when they've gone through the arduous process of getting the NBN, waiting hours on the phone, staying home from work, sometimes again and again, because the technicians don't turn up, only to find that once it's switched on the speeds are nowhere near what they were promised. 


I make the point again: this isn't simply about individuals who want to have faster internet; it's also about small businesses who need certain speeds to do things like upload video. I can guarantee that, in some cases at least, these businesses simply would not have purchased the plan that they did if they knew the truth about the speeds they'd be getting. Let's not forget too the subpar copper network, which subcontractors tell me is in dire need of improvement.


The NBN was sold to Australians as being superfast and the answer to every internet problem under the sun. As Rod Sims said just recently, 'There is something lodged in the consumer mind that says NBN is coming here to provide you with fast speeds.' No wonder, when you look at the fanfare with which the NBN was announced. 


But the truth is that both the Labor and the Liberal governments have made a mess of the NBN, they've given customers unreasonable expectations and they've let the telcos continue to give people unreasonable expectations in order to make money. 


Of course, the detractors of this bill will say it's an excessive regulatory burden and too hard for the industry. But that's patent nonsense, because all this bill does is require telcos to tell the truth when they're selling broadband plans to customers. Heavens, it's not rocket science, but simply enshrining in law the industry guidance published by the ACCC. Remember: it's not the customers who have unreasonable expectations about broadband speeds; it's the telcos that are giving them these expectations, and this bill will put a stop to that.


In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the hard work of my colleague the member for Indi, who has heard about similar issues in her community and has been very active in this place in lobbying for reform. I'd also like to acknowledge and thank the member for Mayo for agreeing to second this bill and for her own tireless work on this issue. I invite the member for Mayo to make a short contribution in my remaining time.

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (10:19):  Yes. I second the motion. I'd particularly like to thank the member for Denison and I'd like to echo his concerns about NBN retailers advertising speeds far beyond what the average consumer is likely to achieve. For many, what is advertised is an unobtainable dream, and it's unacceptable. I think there could be no more misleading phrase than 'up to'. I do note that the ACCC has been investigating ongoing complaints about this very issue and has recently released a report which sets out six principles for internet service providers when communicating with consumers. Updated consumer guidelines are also expected in June. However, consumers need more than principles and guidelines; they need legislative protections. 


My electorate was one of the first areas to have the NBN through, and complaints about the network quickly became the No.1 constituent issue after I came to office in July 2016, including that households were not achieving the broadband speeds they expected and they were promised. I realise that there is a transition period during a rollout when NBN is turned down, for want of a better word, because it has to co-exist with other services. One household might achieve 80 megabits per second at peak times, when residents one street over are only achieving an average household download speed of 12 megabits per second—all that the NBN is required to deliver during the transition period. There is such a discrepancy between what is advertised and what is delivered by the service.


In closing, when constituents tell you that they were better off with ADSL—it was faster and more reliable—something needs to be done. This was supposed to be the greatest national infrastructure project of this century, and what we have is a fraud. It is 'fraudband', not broadband. I commend the member for his private member's bill. It will provide clarity and consumer protection.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:43):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the latest:


(a) waiting list for Home Care Packages (HCP) indicates that more than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for the package they have been approved for; and


(b) figures showed that the HCP waiting list grew by more than 12,000 between 1 July and 30 September 2017 and it is likely to continue growing without funding for the release of more packages;


(2) recognises that the majority of older Australians on the waiting list are those seeking level three and level four packages, who have high care needs including many with dementia;


(3) condemns the Government for failing to stop the waiting list from growing; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately invest in fixing the HCP waiting list and properly address this growing crisis.


I want to highlight the slow-motion disaster that is unfolding right before our eyes—and that is the government's failure to adequately address home care for older Australians. While the government is failing to act, its own figures released recently tell us that 100,000 older Australians are languishing, many of them in limbo, waiting for aged-care packages, for appropriate care or for the care they need. This includes around 80,000 older Australians with very high needs who are waiting. Some of those with high needs have dementia. This is absolutely unacceptable in our nation. As I have said before in this place, these are some of our most vulnerable people. These older Australians have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and built the foundations on which we stand today for the lives we lead.


This government's own website states that most of these vulnerable older Australians will be waiting more than a year for a package that is appropriate for them. Deputy Speaker, you may recall that last week in this place I told you about a constituent of mine—and one of the reasons I have raised this issue in a private member's motion today is the many constituents who have contacted my electorate office—Mr Middleton, of Seaton, a man in his 90s, who contacted me after trying to access a package for his wife. She was placed on a level 4, after an assessment back in 2014. Unfortunately, she passed away last year, in 2017, without any assistance from this government. It is a cruel thing for someone who has worked all their life and brought up a family and done everything by the book for this nation to ask for a bit of assistance in their last few years and have absolutely nothing given to them. That is a complete outrage. This government just walked away from Mrs Middleton. Again today I stand with Mr Middleton to highlight this issue.


The government's commitment in September to readjust the ratio of aged-care packages to create 6,000 additional packages has proven to be woefully inadequate. We know there is a prediction that, every quarter, 10,000 more people will be put on the waiting list. The waiting list has grown by 10,000 in just the last quarter, meaning that these additional packages won't even come close to reducing the number of older Australians waiting for care. I acknowledge that the Minister for Aged Care is here. I know that he is committed to this issue but, unfortunately, his cabinet, his own side, are letting him down with the many cuts that have taken place.


There is growing concern from across the sector about the waiting list. Aged Services Australia and Aged and Community Services Australia have both used pre-budget submissions to urge the Turnbull government to fix the crisis. We know there is a crisis and it needs to be fixed. The latest data was quietly released, a month after it was promised to be released, as parliament rose at the end of the year. The government must urgently make a genuine financial commitment to address this crisis. More than 100,000 aged Australians have been assessed to be eligible for home care, and the Turnbull government is absolutely letting them down. The government has known about this urgent situation for months but has yet to turn its attention to this growing issue. Older Australians and their families are being forced to wait months—and many are waiting well over a year—for carers. Mrs Middleton went three years without anything, and there are horror stories emerging across the country.


Older Australians awaiting home care packages deserve to know when they will get access to these vital services. We know that keeping people home, giving them the care they require and the things they need in their old age, gives them a better lifestyle and more happiness in those last few years. If we don't do this, they become frail, they get hospitalised and they get put into aged-care homes, which costs governments much more than what a bit of home care would cost.


The minister's commentary on this crisis to date has been to point out that some older Australians waiting for care are receiving an interim package. That might be the case, and it is better than nothing; but when they get assessed for a level 4 and they are receiving a level 2, the care isn't adequate; we know that. We need this to be fixed. It is not acceptable. These are some of our most vulnerable people who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and built this nation. We need to do better than what we are currently doing.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck—Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (10:49):  I thank the member for his private member's motion. This is a complex issue in respect of the number of ageing Australians who are now reaching a point in their life at which care is needed. But in the past, as I have indicated previously, what families used to do when they were assessed and allocated a package was list their names with a number of providers—and a number of providers would often tell you that they had a waiting list of a significant number. In transitioning to the national list, it became important that we looked at the number of people requiring the different levels of packages, and the report, which the member opposite points out, wasn't released on the basis of a delay at all; it was looking at the integrity of the data to make sure that the information we had was correct and accurate, because it gave us the basis for considering what were the next steps required in the provision of care for older Australians. Certainly that also required a drilling down on the ratio levels that were introduced into the legislation under Living Longer Living Better. In looking at what the ACAT assessors were assessing, we've taken that into consideration as well.


The Turnbull government hasn't failed. It's working through a number of measures that will address the growing need. But I think this is a challenge for all governments in the future, whether on this side of the House or the other side. The baby boomer generation will reach 80 in another seven years time, and the numbers are significant. The release of home care packages encourages people to remain at home for as long as possible so that they remain independent and their mobility and way of life are built around family and being within their community and not isolated.


Our work on dementia builds on the work of the Rudd-Gillard government in recognising the importance of giving serious consideration to the needs of Australians who have been diagnosed with dementia. What we're seeing is a model of dementia programs and services that are community based. We see the incredible initiative in Tasmania, where there is now a community that will provide independent living within a community where they're not isolated. I see the use of technology, with which we are able to have people living at home and being provided with a level of care from a provider. Innovation in aged care is important, but I would still encourage people who are assessed at level 4, if they receive a lesser package than they anticipated and expected, still to take that package. It provides you with access to the levels of care that you need to remain independent and living in your home longer.


There are ways in which we also harness other resources. For any member in this chamber who brings to me issues relating to people within their electorates, I certainly work with my agency and key officers to look at how we use the range of aged-care services to enable people to have access, to ensure some certainty around their independence and also to ensure that they receive services that will meet their needs and provide for the health circumstances that they find themselves in.


Certainly there are instances where I'm advised of the progression of an illness. In one incident recently, a member in this chamber came to me about a couple where the husband was dying of liver cancer. We worked with his wife, who needed support as a carer because of the pressure, but we also made sure that there were other services wrapped around him in order to allow the journey that he was on to be lived with some degree of comfortability, and that included palliation.


We are working to look at how we progress what is required for the future. Aged care has always had a bipartisan approach, because both sides of this chamber recognise the incredible endeavours that senior Australians have put into building the nation that we have built. They are due recognition and support, and I will work to make sure that that happens. I certainly look forward to working in a bipartisan way on this issue.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:54):  I'm pleased to be able to rise and speak on this important motion moved by my colleague the member for Hindmarsh this morning, because waiting lists around home care packages have become one of the critical issues in my electorate of Newcastle. My electorate of Newcastle is not unique in this regard; I know this is an experience shared around the country.


I thank the minister for his contribution. I was horrified when I walked into this chamber and saw that not a single government member was listed to speak on this motion. Fortunately, the minister was on duty and so happened to be in the chamber, saw the opportunity and took it. I thank you for that, because you are the only member on your side—the government—who thought it worthy enough to invest their time and speak on this motion this morning. That is shocking. 


I note at this point that the very reason we are able to have this debate today is the result of Labor reforms that were put in place before we lost government. The fact that we have waiting lists now is because of action taken by a former Labor government. Whilst I acknowledge the minister's genuine efforts, I am sure, around seeking bipartisan support when it comes to aged-care reforms in Australia, we are not joining him on a race to the bottom on this one. We can't sit and wait any longer. Tomorrow is in fact the 12-month anniversary of the waiting list being known to the Australian government, so the minister has, as has all his colleagues, had access to this information for 12 months now. That is why Labor have brought this motion to the table today. We are not prepared to wait any longer, in the same way that older Australians should not have to wait any longer. 


If there is anything that demonstrates the Turnbull government's total disregard for vulnerable Australians, it is this very issue—the lack of action on addressing what is a looming crisis in aged care in Australia. There are now 100,000 Australians waiting to access packages—packages which they have been assessed as being eligible for but maybe can't get the right level or maybe can't get any package whatsoever in their area. Eighty thousand of those people have high care needs, including dementia. The government has had data on these people for 12 months and has failed, failed, failed to do anything. They are the people we are talking about here. This isn't some kind of esoteric group of Australians who are somehow not known to us. 


Recently, the government announced an additional 6,000 packages—but that is clearly woeful. There are 100,000 Australians who need these packages and 80,000 of them have complex needs like dementia, and we have on the table an offer from the government of 6,000 additional packages. Not good enough. This is a competition that no-one wants to win. New South Wales, which tops the list, has close to 35,000 Australians who are unable to access packages. The terrible shameful truth about aged care in Australia is that people will literally die as a result of waiting for these packages. As I said, these are packages for which people have already been approved as being eligible. 


In my electorate of Newcastle, too many constituents are reaching out to me in desperation after waiting fruitlessly for support packages to become available. One gentleman who contacted my office was totally at his wits end after waiting close to a year for a high-level package for his 90-year-old mother to be approved. This package would have allowed her to maintain her independence by providing in-home support for things like cleaning and personal care. My constituent said that, in the time he had been battling to get an outcome for his mother, he had logged more than 300 hours on the phone to My Aged Care and Centrelink to no avail. The only satisfaction he got was when my office became involved and was eventually able to resolve this for his mother. Why should people like him and his mother continue to suffer as a result of a government that is floundering? It is so busy with its own problems that it can't resolve issues for older Australians.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (10:59):  I'm obviously up on my feet because, as the member for Newcastle indicated, there has been only one government speaker on this motion. It appears that not enough of those on the other side care about older Australians waiting for home care packages. I must say I am flabbergasted that they have no speakers for this motion other than the minister, who just happened to be here on duty. But I do thank the minister for his contribution.


As the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Newcastle have pointed out, Labor is very concerned about this waiting list. This government has followed through with Labor's reforms—the Living Longer Living Better reforms. Indeed, it is these reforms that, for the first time, have given us a national priority queue for people waiting for home care packages. But what the minister hasn't said is that this queue started 12 months ago tomorrow. On 27 February last year these reforms were implemented, so the government has now been collecting this data of people waiting for home care packages for a year. Indeed, we've only had two releases of data about the numbers on these packages and, in between those, in that three-month period, the waiting list grew by 10,000. So not only do we have 100,000 people waiting on the list; we know that last time it grew by 10,000. We're expecting another release of data, the December quarter, so we can find out how many people are waiting now, because we don't know how many more older Australians were added to that list last year.


I am particularly concerned that this list continues to grow. To date the government's only response has been to add another 6,000 packages, and that has been by adjusting level 1 and level 2 packages to create more level 3 and level 4 packages—that is, the high-care need packages. But what we're really concerned about is that our offices are being inundated by people contacting us because their parents are too frail to contact us themselves directly. They're saying, 'Please help me help my parents. Please help me.' We heard from the member for Newcastle that one of her constituents had spent over 300 hours talking to My Aged Care, desperate to get help for their parents.


As the shadow minister for ageing, I am inundated daily by requests from people saying, 'Please help me help my parents.' People want their older parents to receive the care they need. We are a wealthy nation. We should be able to fix this. The government should be able to fix this. After all it is cheaper for the government to fix this than to let older Australians languish in their own homes without the support that they need, because the alternatives to this are, of course, the acute hospital system—where many older Australians end up if they're not getting the care they need at home—or residential aged care. Many older Australians who want to stay at home—and, with the right supports, could—end up in residential aged care when they don't want to.


It is simply not good enough for the government and the minister to come into this place and say, 'We'll cobble together some support—just a little bit—for them while they wait for what they actually need.' In this nation in this day and age that is not good enough. If we can afford $65 billion in tax cuts for big business, we can afford to look after older Australians. It is not good enough that we have 100,000 older Australians, many with dementia, at home, waiting for care. Their children are coming to our offices absolutely desperate to get help for their parents, and this government is sitting by. They had options last year; they had MYEFO last year, and we're hearing, 'We'll fix it in the budget.' Well, they'd best be fixing it, because I will not stand by while older Australians continue to suffer in their own homes and while their children ring our offices desperate for that help and care for their parents.


It is not good enough, and to have just the minister come into this place and say, 'We'll cobble together some support; that'll be alright for a little while till we fix it,' is not good enough. That waiting list continues to grow, more older Australians are added to it every day, and the government needs to do something to fix it. It needs to act, and it needs to act today—not in May, not in July, not later in the year, but today. It can do something about this. It should have done something about it last year. I will continue to get on the government's case and the minister's case until they do something about it.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (11:04):  We are here to talk about the motion today, because the coalition government are doing a range of excellent things in the healthcare space, including giving people more choice over the sort of care that will best suit them, their families and their needs. In February last year we transitioned to a new home care system which gives consumers—individuals and families—more choice and control over the care that best suits their needs. The new system means that packages are released directly to consumers rather than to providers, and people who have the most urgent needs or have been waiting the longest receive care packages first. We know that there is a strong demand for the higher levels packages, and it's important to note that people needing these packages are receiving interim support packages which allow them to access services while they wait.


In September last year we announced the release of an additional 6,000 level 3 and level 4 home care packages over the year 2017-18. This more than doubled the planned growth of high-level packages this financial year, and a number of these have already been assigned to people. The minister and the government are releasing almost 2,500 home care packages on a weekly basis. In addition to this, in the 2017 budget, the government provided an investment of $5.5 billion to extend the Commonwealth Home Support Program for a further two years to June 2020.


I want to note some other very important points that relate to the care that we provide to all members of our community but which are particularly important to the older members of our community. We have record rates of bulk-billing under this government. Something like 85.9 per cent of all GP visits are now bulk-billed. That's a remarkable achievement that helps many people, particularly our older community members and our pensioners. We have added more than 1,500 new and amended medicines worth $7.5 billion to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which means greater access to medicines for people who need them most—often our older citizens.


Also, under the coalition government, the funding for public hospital services, which is also of course of great importance to our older citizens, has increased from $13.8 billion in the year 2013-14 at the end of the failed Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government to a record $22.7 billion for 2020-21. This is a 64 per cent increase in funding. This means more doctors, more nurses, more surgeries and fewer wait times in hospitals across the nation but particularly in my home state of South Australia.


Just a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Health announced some really exciting news at the COAG meeting about an additional $30 billion for public hospital funding, which would provide almost $128 million over the five years from 2020. But unfortunately this was apparently not enough for the Premier of South Australia, who is only interested in cutting funding to public hospitals and shutting them down. One of the most important and iconic community hospitals in my electorate of Boothby which particularly serviced a lot of my older residents was the repat hospital, and the state Labor government have shut it down. It is one of the most disgraceful things the state Labor government have done. My community remain terribly distressed about this, and I am really pleased that when we see the state Liberal Party elected on 17 March they will reopen a number of key services at the repat hospital including things such as orthopaedic surgery, which for a lot of our older residents is just absolutely a critical service that they use quite a lot. The repat hospital was built for our returned service men and women, and they are many of the people who are suffering from the fact that this hospital has been shut down.


Providing these sorts of services, particularly through the repat hospital, is how we look after the older members of our community, working with the support that the government is providing through home care packages which give people choice over their care.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:09):  This is an important motion, and I congratulate the member for Hindmarsh on moving it. Already what we've seen that it's having an impact because previously there were no government speakers listed at all. The minister just happened to be sitting around doing some paperwork and went: 'Oh, my God! It's my portfolio. I might start talking.' Now the government have sent backbenchers in to read out random dot points and press releases.


I was going to take a point of order on relevance, because most of what the previous speaker talked about was not to do with home care; it was about hospital funding and the PBS and whatever other random pages she'd had shoved into her hand to come here and read to the House. But let's make an important point: I didn't take a point of order, because I think she is digging a hole for the government here. The point of properly funding home care is that it saves money, because people can stay in their own home instead of having to spend more on hospitals. That is an important point.


This is a growing crisis, by anyone's measure. There are more than 100,000 senior Australians right now sitting at home without proper care. This includes 60,000 people with absolutely nothing—no care whatsoever. Forty-thousand people are on a lower level of care than they actually need and 80,000 people need high-needs care, including people with severe dementia. It's important to remember that these are people—human beings—not just numbers. We often bandy around statistics—we need that many billion and there are this many thousand people—but these are human beings: senior Australians who have served our country, worked for decades, built the country and paid taxes, in most cases, and they deserve decent treatment. 


This is especially important in my electorate. My electorate has a much older demographic than the surrounding areas in south-east Melbourne, with over 35,000 people aged 60 and over. There is the despair and pain, as the member for Franklin said, of people calling our offices, usually sons and daughters, saying, 'Please, can you do something to help my aged parents, who are living in despair at home without proper care and with no time line as to when this will be fixed?' 


The government should not see this as a surprise. It's been raised before by the shadow minister, by local governments across the country, by aged-care peak bodies and by many Labor MPs. But we've had zero action from the minister. In fact, it's worse than zero action. Despite the minister's polite waffle—he told us it's complex—it's actually not that complex: find the funding and you clear the backlog. He admitted that when he was asked only a few months ago, 'Why is this backlog there?' he said, 'There are budgetary and fiscal pressures.' So, that is the truth of it. He's already said what the problem is: the government have not prioritised funding for senior Australians. That is the fact of it. 


They have prioritised, as the member for Franklin aptly said, a tax cut—a $65 billion tax cut for big business. The other thing they prioritised in their budget was a tax cut for everyone in this chamber. The top two per cent of Australians, those earning over $180,000, got a tax cut from this mob in the budget. They got a tax cut—




Mr Falinski:
  Are you kidding? That was not a tax cut—




Mr HILL:
  Oh, sorry. 'We removed the deficit levy.' Is that what we're hearing? You removed the two per cent deficit levy—which is a tax cut—and guess what? The budget is still in deficit. Maybe we should have kept the deficit levy there. I'll put my hand up and say, 'I, for one, would be happy to pay an extra two per cent tax.' I don't think anyone in Australia would begrudge senior Australians decent care and a decent home care package to put that levy back on. 



Government members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  The member for Mackellar will be quiet. So will the minister.




Mr HILL:
  I encourage you to just take what you can get. I encourage people on waiting lists to—whatever level you're offered—just take that offer. Like it or leave it. It doesn't actually matter if you need four days a week of care and you can't shower yourself. If you can get someone to come for two hours a week and clean the kitchen, well, that's good enough. Just take that. That's what the minister said. That's a direct quote. 


What about the government? The minister's not up to it. He's a lovely man and I speak highly of him. I would speak more highly of him if he'd come and visit the Dandenong and District Aborigines Co-operative in my electorate, but we are living in hope. He says he'll come one day. But what about the government? They've obviously been to the Christensen school of courage, haven't they? They're courageous; they're brave. Look at all the speakers here willing to stand up for their reforms.




Ms Brodtmann:
  They're coming in at the last minute!




Mr HILL:
  That's right. It's not a complex issue. For my final point, I need to call the minister out on something. He said in dulcet tones, 'Aged care is generally a bipartisan issue.' It's not a bipartisan issue right now. Those hundred thousand people are not a bipartisan issue. This is your mess. It's your shame. The $3 billion cuts to residential aged care are not a bipartisan issue. This is your mess to fix.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The time allotted for this debate has expired. There being no further speakers, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (13:30):  Cheryl McDonald lives in Lindsay. She is a constituent of mine who called my office. She's a mum, she's a wife, she's a retired office worker and she's a nanna. I want to thank her for allowing me to get up and tell her story in here. 


She is an amputee and is in need of a pump for her leg. She has a prosthetic leg. In the past, she has been independent and able to drive, walk and play with her grandson. Without a working pump to drain her stump she is virtually housebound—housebound due to a simple, ineffective pump. Her NDIS plan says that she has an assistive technology budget of about $1,000. Her request for a new pump is currently again under review, because there is not enough allocated in the budget. Normally, a review would take two weeks. The plan has now been referred to another review committee with no time frame given. Cheryl is articulate and can advocate for herself, but her need for a new pump has cost her dearly. Delays and inaction in providing this new pump have resulted in a haematoma in her stump. Now she needs a new prosthetic leg and will possibly require surgery. 


This uncaring government is fumbling the NDIS rollout for constituent after constituent day after day, in my electorate and in electorates all over this country. There are major problems with plan reviews, and, in this instance, the delays have cost this constituent her independence and caused considerable pain and distress, not to mention the additional costs that will now burden the health system. This government is obviously unacceptable. The way that she has been treated by this government is outstandingly terrible. (Time expired)

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (14:19):  My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Documents available on the official climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au website state:


Southwest Western Australia has already seen reductions in rainfall due to human influence, and further drying in winter is a particularly confident projection.


The time in drought will increase over southern Australia, with a greater frequency of severe droughts (high confidence).


However, in your first speech only a few years ago, you said that, just because there is less rain:


It does not mean we all need to listen to a government grant-seeking academic sprouting doom and gloom about climate changing irreversibly.


Then, a couple of years later, you referred to it in parliament as 'so-called climate change'. Deputy Prime Minister, are you still a climate-change denier?



The SPEAKER:  The member for Melbourne has been in the House long enough to know that he needs to ask ministers about issues for which they are responsible, not about first speeches, not about any other speeches. The member for Melbourne can resume his seat. The Deputy Prime Minister, as far as I am aware with the tabling of the new ministerial responsibilities, is still the Minister for Veterans Affairs and he is the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, and that question in no way goes to his responsibilities. We will go to the next question.




Mr BANDT:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.



The SPEAKER:  If the member could resume his seat. The member for Melbourne is seeking to raise a point of order about a question which I have described as clearly out of order.




Mr BANDT:
  The parliament currently has an inquiry underway on the effects of climate change on infrastructure.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Melbourne will resume his seat. I'm going to be very clear for the member for Melbourne. I've made my views known on this particular standing order before. The Leader of the Opposition has heard me on this issue. The Leader of the Opposition gets 30 seconds for each question. The crossbench get 45 seconds. You had 45 seconds and you couldn't relate the material to his ministerial responsibilities. It is clearly out of order. I am not going to argue and waste the time of the House on issues that are black-and-white in the standing orders.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:26):  The Labor Party, purely for the purpose of trying to ingratiate itself with Greens voters in the seat of Batman, is putting the whole Murray-Darling plan at risk. They're seeking to vote down the Northern Basin Review, which the member for Watson initiated. He set it up when he was minister for water. It was part of the plan, and they want to vote that down in the Senate. As a consequence, we've seen the governments of New South Wales and Victoria—Liberal and Labor governments—raising the question of whether they will continue to be part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is recklessness on a grand scale.


Nobody on that side of the House knows how reckless it is better than the member for Watson. He knows because he was minister for water—he understands the politics of it—but he has been overruled by the green Left in the Labor Party, who are pursuing inner-city votes at the expense of the jobs of farmers, irrigators, cities and towns right down the Murray-Darling Basin. This is a disgraceful abandonment of jobs, farmers, production, and the environment by the Labor Party as they pursue Greens votes in the seat of Batman. It demonstrates their utter failure to have regard to the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In that context, I want to say that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the member for Maranoa, has been doing an outstanding job in endeavouring to keep the plan on track despite the wrecking activities of the Labor Party and the Greens.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (15:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.




Mr Burke:
  Leave is granted. And I should state that the committee I referred to earlier in my question to the Speaker does not draw a monetary allowance. So I should advise the House of that immediately.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for that correction.




Mr HASTIE:
  I am pleased to present the committee's advisory report on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017.


This bill is one component of the establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio that commenced on 20 December 2017. Substantive changes to government have already been implemented to date through amendments to the administrative arrangements order and a substituted references order. This bill addresses several specific matters that could not be dealt with administratively.


The bill will amend four existing acts: the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and, finally, the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The amendments proposed in the bill are intended to give to the allocation of ministerial powers, including a heightened and strengthened role for the Attorney-General as announced by the Prime Minister in July 2017. 


The committee has made four recommendations in its report. Firstly, upon considering evidence from the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security the committee has recommended that the bill be amended so that only the Prime Minister has the power to direct the inspector-general to undertake an inquiry under section 9 of the IGIS Act. In making this recommendation, the committee has supported changes that will allow the Attorney-General to request the inspector-general to undertake such an inquiry. The committee has also supported amendments that provide for the inspector-general's reports to be provided to the Attorney-General.


Secondly, to more clearly reflect the government's intent concerning a strengthened oversight role for the Attorney-General, the committee has recommended that the bill be amended to replace references to the minister in the INSLM and IGIS acts to the Attorney-General where such references refer to the minister administering the act. The committee considered that explicit reference to the Attorney-General on the face of the legislation assists in providing public assurance about the government's intentions.


The committee noted that, in addition to the four acts addressed in this bill, 33 other acts will be amended to implement the Home Affairs portfolio. The committee was informed that drafting of these legislative amendments is well advanced, and considered the amendments should be brought forward as soon as possible. In particular, the committee has recommended that amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act to facilitate the Attorney-General's ongoing role be introduced to the parliament prior to the conclusion of debate on this bill.


Finally, the committee has recommended that, subject to implementation of these recommendations, the bill be passed. I commend the report to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:16):  by leave—I thank the member for Canning, in his role as the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, for those remarks on the tabling of this report.


The first important and significant matter arising from this report is that the concern that was expressed to the committee and the government by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has been heeded. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is an important government agency. It's at the heart of assuring the Australian people that there is adequate oversight of our intelligence community. It is one of the integrity agencies. As a former Federal Court judge, the Hon. Margaret Stone has spent many, many years in public service, and that public service continues in her role as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.


The concern that she had expressed was with the way the bill as drafted might be seen by some members of the public, including—and she made this point in her evidence to the committee—those members of the public who are perhaps not as informed about the way in which our intelligence services operate or about the way in which the legislation operates. Her concern was that their confidence might in some way be lessened if a particular power of not merely request but direction were to be given to the Attorney-General. That power is already held by the Prime Minister. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security accepts that that power is appropriately held by the Prime Minister, but her concern was that the power not be given, in addition, to the Attorney-General as part of this rearrangement for our intelligence services and the rearrangements in relation to national security that the Department of Home Affairs represents. So I'm very pleased that members of the committee have agreed with this, I'd have to say, very unusual concern being expressed by a senior intelligence or integrity officer, and that report will now go forward to government. It's a touchstone of the work that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security does that, when we legislate or amend existing legislation, it be done in a way which builds public confidence in our intelligence agencies and builds public confidence in ensuring that there is integrity, that there is oversight and that the extraordinary powers that are exercised by our intelligence agencies will be exercised according to law.


The second point raised by this report goes to the fact that the government has made it a centrepiece of its introduction of this new home affairs department, and the rearrangements, that the Attorney-General will continue to exercise the warrants power in relation to warrants that are sought by ASIO in the exercise of ASIO's powers. Because it is such a centrepiece of the government's reforms, it perhaps could have been expected that this particular preservation of the Attorney-General's power over warrants would be found in the first bill being presented by the government to the parliament, in relation to the establishment of the Department of Home Affairs. It has turned out that that is not the case. This particular bill, although it is entitled 'home affairs', only deals with some four of what it is now clear are the 37 acts of parliament that will need to be amended in order to establish the Department of Home Affairs in the way in which the government wishes to do it. It is for that reason that the committee, noting the importance of the preservation of the Attorney-General's warrants power, said that the bill in which that will occur, namely the bill to amend the ASIO act, ought to come forward for the examination of the parliament before this particular home affairs bill proceeds. That is certainly a sensible approach and, again, I hope that the government accedes to that recommendation of the committee.


Finally, I want to note that this process of setting up the Department of Home Affairs is proving to be a somewhat larger exercise and a larger undertaking than the government's statements about it to date might have indicated. The revelation that there are some 37 acts of parliament potentially affected, and that only four are being dealt with in the bill that is currently before the parliament and that is the subject of this report, suggests that it is a much more substantial exercise. We'll wait and see what amendments are needed to these 33 further acts. I hope that that legislation to make those amendments can be brought before the parliament expeditiously so that the legislation can be looked at equally expeditiously by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I commend this report to the House.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (15:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.




Mr Burke:
  Leave is granted. And I should state that the committee I referred to earlier in my question to the Speaker does not draw a monetary allowance. So I should advise the House of that immediately.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for that correction.




Mr HASTIE:
  I am pleased to present the committee's advisory report on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2017.


This bill is one component of the establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio that commenced on 20 December 2017. Substantive changes to government have already been implemented to date through amendments to the administrative arrangements order and a substituted references order. This bill addresses several specific matters that could not be dealt with administratively.


The bill will amend four existing acts: the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and, finally, the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The amendments proposed in the bill are intended to give to the allocation of ministerial powers, including a heightened and strengthened role for the Attorney-General as announced by the Prime Minister in July 2017. 


The committee has made four recommendations in its report. Firstly, upon considering evidence from the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security the committee has recommended that the bill be amended so that only the Prime Minister has the power to direct the inspector-general to undertake an inquiry under section 9 of the IGIS Act. In making this recommendation, the committee has supported changes that will allow the Attorney-General to request the inspector-general to undertake such an inquiry. The committee has also supported amendments that provide for the inspector-general's reports to be provided to the Attorney-General.


Secondly, to more clearly reflect the government's intent concerning a strengthened oversight role for the Attorney-General, the committee has recommended that the bill be amended to replace references to the minister in the INSLM and IGIS acts to the Attorney-General where such references refer to the minister administering the act. The committee considered that explicit reference to the Attorney-General on the face of the legislation assists in providing public assurance about the government's intentions.


The committee noted that, in addition to the four acts addressed in this bill, 33 other acts will be amended to implement the Home Affairs portfolio. The committee was informed that drafting of these legislative amendments is well advanced, and considered the amendments should be brought forward as soon as possible. In particular, the committee has recommended that amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act to facilitate the Attorney-General's ongoing role be introduced to the parliament prior to the conclusion of debate on this bill.


Finally, the committee has recommended that, subject to implementation of these recommendations, the bill be passed. I commend the report to the House.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:16):  by leave—I thank the member for Canning, in his role as the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, for those remarks on the tabling of this report.


The first important and significant matter arising from this report is that the concern that was expressed to the committee and the government by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has been heeded. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is an important government agency. It's at the heart of assuring the Australian people that there is adequate oversight of our intelligence community. It is one of the integrity agencies. As a former Federal Court judge, the Hon. Margaret Stone has spent many, many years in public service, and that public service continues in her role as Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.


The concern that she had expressed was with the way the bill as drafted might be seen by some members of the public, including—and she made this point in her evidence to the committee—those members of the public who are perhaps not as informed about the way in which our intelligence services operate or about the way in which the legislation operates. Her concern was that their confidence might in some way be lessened if a particular power of not merely request but direction were to be given to the Attorney-General. That power is already held by the Prime Minister. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security accepts that that power is appropriately held by the Prime Minister, but her concern was that the power not be given, in addition, to the Attorney-General as part of this rearrangement for our intelligence services and the rearrangements in relation to national security that the Department of Home Affairs represents. So I'm very pleased that members of the committee have agreed with this, I'd have to say, very unusual concern being expressed by a senior intelligence or integrity officer, and that report will now go forward to government. It's a touchstone of the work that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security does that, when we legislate or amend existing legislation, it be done in a way which builds public confidence in our intelligence agencies and builds public confidence in ensuring that there is integrity, that there is oversight and that the extraordinary powers that are exercised by our intelligence agencies will be exercised according to law.


The second point raised by this report goes to the fact that the government has made it a centrepiece of its introduction of this new home affairs department, and the rearrangements, that the Attorney-General will continue to exercise the warrants power in relation to warrants that are sought by ASIO in the exercise of ASIO's powers. Because it is such a centrepiece of the government's reforms, it perhaps could have been expected that this particular preservation of the Attorney-General's power over warrants would be found in the first bill being presented by the government to the parliament, in relation to the establishment of the Department of Home Affairs. It has turned out that that is not the case. This particular bill, although it is entitled 'home affairs', only deals with some four of what it is now clear are the 37 acts of parliament that will need to be amended in order to establish the Department of Home Affairs in the way in which the government wishes to do it. It is for that reason that the committee, noting the importance of the preservation of the Attorney-General's warrants power, said that the bill in which that will occur, namely the bill to amend the ASIO act, ought to come forward for the examination of the parliament before this particular home affairs bill proceeds. That is certainly a sensible approach and, again, I hope that the government accedes to that recommendation of the committee.


Finally, I want to note that this process of setting up the Department of Home Affairs is proving to be a somewhat larger exercise and a larger undertaking than the government's statements about it to date might have indicated. The revelation that there are some 37 acts of parliament potentially affected, and that only four are being dealt with in the bill that is currently before the parliament and that is the subject of this report, suggests that it is a much more substantial exercise. We'll wait and see what amendments are needed to these 33 further acts. I hope that that legislation to make those amendments can be brought before the parliament expeditiously so that the legislation can be looked at equally expeditiously by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I commend this report to the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (19:30):  Last week I spoke with Michael. Michael is not his real name; I'm using that name to protect him. I spoke with him just after he withdrew cash from a machine located in a retail shop in one of my local shopping centres. The cash dispenser was not an ATM; rather it was a machine that spits out cash loans. The process did not require Michael to indicate what he plans to do with the cash or demonstrate a capacity to repay the loan. It did, though, require him to hand over his bank account details so that the lender could access his account to secure repayments and any interest or late payment penalties. Worse, the interest rate he will pay can be anything up to 30 per cent. Penalties, of course, can be punitive. 


It was obvious to me that Michael did not fully understand what he had committed himself to in accepting this short-term loan. It was also obvious that he did not enjoy the benefits of a sound education. Michael is on a disability pension. I don't know why he's on a disability pension, but I know that every circumstance is different.


If Michael takes $100 from the machine, he will eventually pay at least $130. That's what will be taken out of his account. I asked him what sort of money he has withdrawn in the past and he said, '$300.' I asked, 'What would you repay?' He said, '400 and something dollars.' That was the repayment on his $300 short-term loan.


Michael may have needed the money for many reasons. I didn't ask him. But, before jumping to conclusions, I thought of a constituent called Mary—and that is not her real name. She desperately turned to a similar process when her refrigerator broke down. Mary has children, and her family can't live without a fridge, so Mary entered into a contract with a local retailer who provided her with that new fridge. The fridge retails for $498. Her repayment plan will result in her paying three times that by the end of the loan period, and that's if she pays on time every time. Again, no-one assessed Mary's capacity to repay the loan or fully explained to her the consequences of her actions.


In recent years the growth in what have become known as payday loans has been scary. Basically, firms providing these loans are exploiting vulnerable and often desperate people. Yes, interest rates must reflect the level of risk for the lender, but lending to people without regard to their circumstances and their capacity to repay is irresponsible and the penalties for late payments are often bordering on criminal.


In 2009 the then federal Labor government introduced reforms which implemented a national regime for the regulation of consumer credit for the first time. In 2012 further enhancements were introduced, including additional protections regarding small-amount credit contracts and consumer leases. So we have a framework for addressing this serious problem, but time has demonstrated that more needs to be done. Governments can't and shouldn't make lending illegal, but there are some things we can do to catch those treading the fine line between the lawful and the unlawful. 


There are alternative microloans for people in trouble. It's not as if this is their only choice. It's just too easy. I asked Michael whether there were often other people accessing cash from the machine in my local retail shop. He said: 'Yes, often. I came down one day and they were queued up outside the shop.' Charitable organisations that run these other microloan options do so responsibly, apply much lower interest rates and of course have the welfare of the borrower in mind. So there is no argument that these circumstances must be available because people don't have other choices.


The government now must act urgently. The loan sharks are circling the most vulnerable people in our community. We have had the review of the small-amount credit contract laws. It was subject to some debate in question time today. If there is ever a case for a bipartisan approach, this is it. We need to act and we need to act very quickly. The government have been too slow. I won't criticise them tonight, but I just want to make an appeal to the government to address this very serious issue. I met with the Samaritans, including their financial counsellor, in Toronto last Friday to discuss the issue. They assist people in trouble. Some of the stories they told me were just horrific. We must act, and very quickly.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (10:30):  It's a very sad fact that we are currently facing a crisis in the Tasmanian health system. I recently brought to the attention of the House the story of a constituent of mine, Anna. Anna suffers chronic pain on a daily basis and is unable to stand for any period of time. Despite representations to the Tasmanian Minister for Health, Anna is continuing to face a waiting period of eight years before surgery. Anna is just one of thousands of Tasmanian patients suffering on a public waiting list. This is entirely unacceptable.


In my home state and across Australia, whenever the Liberals get the chance they cut health funding whilst denying that fact. The Leader of the Tasmanian Liberals, Mr Hodgman, cut $210 million from health in his first budget, and the Turnbull government cut $1.1 billion from Tasmania's health system—cuts that result from not keeping pace with healthcare inflation, increased populations and increased presentations at our overworked public hospitals. These cuts have also meant that there are simply not enough health professionals to meet demand. Thanks to a leaked COAG document, we know of the Prime Minister's secret pre-budget hospital plan, which will lock in more health cuts. This five-year deal offers no new money for public hospitals and leaves the states locked into their current inadequate funding arrangements until 2025. No new money for health locks in years of underspend on health.


A Rebecca White majority Labor government will make health their priority in Tasmania. Labor has a better healthcare plan to keep Tasmanians healthier for longer, get treated faster and go home to their families sooner. Labor will invest in health infrastructure: more beds, more nurses, more ambulances and more doctors. Tasmanian Labor chooses to fix the health system and treat health workers with respect.


Belatedly, the Liberal government of Tasmania has decided that investment in health care is important, but its promised $700 million spend is a delayed response, assuming that a re-elected Liberal government in its third term will be able to invest significant amounts of money to employ additional professional staff. Rebecca White's health plan will be rolled out sooner with more done earlier to address waiting times—waiting times in emergency departments; waiting times to see a specialist or to have elective surgery. So, too, the plan involves recruiting more staff to the health and hospital system and investing in health infrastructure to meet future demands.


I'm privileged to have served in a health governance role. I know how complex healthcare organisations are and how demanding management is at the best of times. It is obvious that the Liberal state and federal governments are not prepared to spend the money to properly resource our Tasmanian public hospitals. Rebecca White and Tasmanian Labor have a plan which properly respects the hard work and skill of our health workers.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:00):  Today I am proud to stand in this place and take up the fight against the Turnbull government's severe job cuts to Public Service jobs in Townsville, and I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that ongoing cuts to public sector jobs in regional cities like Townsville have had a detrimental impact on the local economy and include:


(a) the relocation of Royal Australian Air Force's 38 Squadron King Air fleet from Townsville to East Sale in Victoria resulting in the loss of more than 40 aviation jobs in Townsville;


(b) the Government's change of process in second division resulting in the loss of up to 10 Townsville Australian Public Service defence support staff;


(c) Townsville having 50 fewer defence staff in June 2017 than it had in December 2012;


(d) 19 jobs having been cut from CSIRO in Townsville over the last few years;


(e) regional Queensland Customs staffing being cut by 50 per cent with 30 job losses from Gladstone to Thursday Island with Townsville being one of the hardest hit; and


   (f) the consolidation of the Australian Taxation Office in 2014 resulting in the loss of 110 jobs in Townsville;


(2) acknowledges that maintaining public sector jobs is important in regional Australia and notes that job cuts are harmful to regional cities like Townsville; and


(3) calls on the Government to ensure the coming federal budget puts a moratorium on these regional jobs cuts in public sector agencies.


I am here to say loudly and clearly: enough is enough. I will fight against these job cuts, and I will fight for the workers of Townsville. I will stand up for both white- and blue-collar jobs because, without a shadow of a doubt, Townsville needs and deserves both. I have had enough of the Turnbull government's job cuts, and I want real action that delivers jobs for everyone, not just a few.


I am on the ground talking and meeting with regional Queenslanders, unlike this completely out-of-touch Turnbull government, and I can assure you that the impact of the job cuts delivered by the Abbott-Turnbull government has been nothing short of devastating to my community. These cuts directly affect jobs in the heart of Townsville's CBD, and the flow-on effect from these cuts has been widely felt in the broader community. It has been felt in businesses that have thrived in the Townsville CBD, like Batik Bazaar, a small business that has traded for more than 34 years, which has just closed its doors. This is a business that thrived under prime ministers like Hawke, Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard and is now being forced to shut its doors under the Turnbull government. This is a clear indication of the effects that the Turnbull government is having on the ground on small businesses in my community. They are closing their doors, and jobs are being lost.


As reported in the Townsville Bulletin, business confidence in Townsville continues to nosedive. A strong presence of government departments and government jobs brings confidence to our region and particularly to our city. When we have a strong government presence in terms of public sector jobs, the take-home message on the ground is that the government believes in our community and that we are a safe place for investment, and that does create jobs and grows small-business opportunities. However, this has not been the case under the Turnbull government, because this government doesn't care about public sector jobs. They are being cut, time and time again, and the people of Townsville are tired of it.


The Turnbull government took a 'jobs and growth' slogan to the last election. Well, let me tell you, the people of Townsville have seen that for what it actually is: a political slogan and nothing more. Under the Turnbull government, the only growth that we have seen is in our unemployment and underemployment figures. Under the Abbott-Turnbull governments, unemployment has doubled in our community. While industries have gone, jobs have also gone. This is the coalition's track record in Townsville.


But I must say that the government needs to be aware that the people of Townsville have very long memories, and they will voice their memories when it comes time to vote at the next election, because we deserve better, and our young people deserve opportunities for jobs, particularly in the public sector. So I call on the Turnbull government to immediately reinstate the hundreds of jobs that have been cut from the Townsville public sector. The public sector has been the backbone of our community for decades and decades, and it is absolutely essential that the government pays attention to this fact and stops the vicious cuts to our public sector. We have been flat out recovering from the Newman era, and we've walked straight into the same opportunities and job cuts that the Abbott-Turnbull governments have delivered us.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:05):  I thank the member for Herbert for raising this in the parliament today because it gives me an opportunity to speak about what's happening in my community of Parramatta. We are the geographical heart of Sydney. We are the centre of the workforce; we're the centre, geographically—the middle, literally—of Sydney itself.


We think of ourselves as a community that has a large public sector. We have the Jessie Street Centre there; the tax office is there; Medicare is there. We have quite a strong public sector presence—at least, we did, because, in the last year, between 2016 and 2017, the number of Public Service jobs in Parramatta halved. The number actually dropped from 3,078 in 2016 to 1,567 in 2017. That is nearly 1,500 jobs gone in a year. They are solid, full-time, safe, secure jobs. Those jobs are the ballast; full-time, secure employment in the community acts like a ballast. They are less responsive to upturns and downturns in the economy. Those workers are still going to get their hair cut. So other business actually survive on the stable employment base that you get from your public sector—and from other full-time jobs, but particularly from the public sector. So it has been an extraordinary blow to Parramatta. But it is really just the tip of the iceberg.


When you look at what has happened in the six years of this government, you can see that the Public Service has essentially been gutted. In the years from 2013 to 2017, there have been 14,000 jobs slashed from the public sector. That is 166,000 down to 152,000—nearly 10 per cent of the public sector. You might remember that, when the member for Warringah first became the Prime Minister, he cut over 8,000 public sector jobs in just his first year. And we are well and truly seeing the results of that. People are waiting, on average, for over 15 minutes to speak to someone at Centrelink—up from the previous year. Young people are waiting over half an hour to speak to someone about youth allowance. People are phoning about disabilities and waiting just under 30 minutes. This is unacceptable. In my electorate, I know of cases where people have waited over three hours to speak to someone at Centrelink. I know people who have rung every day and hung up and, over a two week period, have been unable to get through because they didn't have the time to wait on the phone for that long.


It's not universal, though. The cuts aren't spread evenly. Jobs are actually moving into the CBD. In the Sydney CBD, for example, the number of jobs increased by 2,000 in the last year. Fifteen hundred jobs have gone from Parramatta; 2,000 jobs have gone into the CBD, from an already high base of 13,700 employees. In other areas of Sydney, the number of public sector jobs has roughly stayed constant, although it has significantly declined across the west of Western Sydney as well.


So we are seeing not just a cut across the board but the moving of the public sector from the outer regions or the centre of Sydney city into the CBD, and those of us who live in Western Sydney or further out know how long the travel times are, and we know that those workers actually come from where we are—that workers get on the train and travel sometimes an hour or an hour and a half into the CBD to take up those jobs. It actually doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense in the days of high-speed internet—though not so much in Parramatta; we're not even on the rollout, but, you know, the government departments have high-speed internet. In the era of people working from home and people being able to work remotely, it makes no sense whatsoever to be moving the public sector from outer regions into the CBD. It makes no sense at all, and it makes no sense to cut 1,500 jobs from the geographical centre of Sydney's workforce and move them to a place which is essentially on the edge of it. It makes no sense at all. We've lost 1,500 secure, stable jobs from Parramatta in the last year alone.


It's not okay. It's really not okay. It's not okay to slash our Public Service generally by this amount and it's not okay to slash the amount in my electorate. The member for Herbert is absolutely right; there are communities that depend on the stability that Public Sector jobs give their communities, and mine does too. I call on the government to rethink this move into the main centres. You can see the increase in Melbourne and in Brisbane, but declines virtually everywhere else. It's turning back a tide which was moving in the right direction. In the last years we've seen it completely reversed. It's the wrong way to go, and they should rethink.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (11:10):  The member for Parramatta talks about turning back the tide. Under this government, we have turned the nation around. This motion is a phoney motion. Never before in the history of this nation have we seen such strong jobs growth. In January, 16,000 new jobs were added. Last year, in 2017, 403,000 jobs were added. That is an absolute record since records began. We have now had 16 consecutive months of jobs growth, the longest run of jobs growth ever recorded in this nation. As I say, this is a phoney motion.


Labor is grappling with what to do, because this government is delivering. It is delivering in spades, building a stronger economy and creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs and new opportunities right across this nation, in metropolitan centres and in regional Australia. This builds on the many other investments that we are making. Our business tax cuts are helping small businesses invest, hire and grow. Our school funding reforms are improving results; the best and record school funding we've seen in this nation. We're making child care more affordable, where we've guaranteed Medicare. We're keeping Australians safe. We are delivering for Australians when it comes to jobs.


This motion's very disappointing, and I want to put the facts on the record. Contrary to claims made by the opposition and their CPSU mates, the number of Public Service jobs in regional Australia has increased under the coalition. In December 2012, there were 20,163 public servants in regional locations. This is compared with 21,572 Public Service jobs in December 2016, an increase of seven per cent. Fourteen per cent of Australian Public Service staff are now located in regional Australia, up from 12 per cent under Labor. We are not only delivering jobs in spades across this nation but also increasing the number of Public Service jobs in regional communities. As I say, that is why this is a phoney motion.


I reflect on what's happening in Geelong, an area that I proudly represent as the member for Corangamite. We are building the National Disability Insurance Agency headquarters, which will bring hundreds and hundreds of Public Service jobs to our region. That builds on the incredible investment that we are making. We've also, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, brought the Australian Bureau of Statistics national data centre to Geelong—again, hundreds of new Public Service jobs. This builds on the 403,000 jobs across the nation, with 100,000 new jobs in regional Australia.


It is regrettable that the member for Herbert has initiated this motion. I think it's probably through some degree of embarrassment, because the Townsville City Deal, Australia's first, was signed by our government and the Queensland government on 9 December 2016. The Commonwealth is making more than $250 million of funding contributions to Townsville through the city deal, including the construction of the North Queensland Stadium, which will employ over 2,000 people. What a shame that the people of Townsville do not have a champion in the member for Herbert. What a shame that, in this member, they do not have someone celebrating this investment, leveraging this investment and looking at other opportunities. All we hear from the member for Herbert is whingeing and complaining, when in fact the unemployment rate in the 12 months to December 2017 fell from 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent, so not only are we driving hundreds and thousands of new jobs into Townsville but also we are seeing a significant decrease in the unemployment rate, driving confidence, investment and a new wave of absolute fervour for Townsville, and it's all absolutely due to the hard work of the Turnbull government.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:15):  I begin by thanking the member for Herbert for raising this motion this morning. She is a great local member, and I completely understand her frustration with this government, because I feel it too. The Prime Minister is looking down on Australia from corporate boardrooms and a harbourside ivory tower. When you do that, you don't see what's happening in the regions. Sure, the white-collar suits that he surrounds himself with are doing well. Company profits are up, big businesses are thriving and for the most part the capital cities are doing fairly well, but this prosperity hasn't made its way to the regions. As the member for Herbert explained a little earlier, areas like Townsville are struggling. In my role as the chair of Labor's Australian Jobs Taskforce committee, I've seen this firsthand. The committee travelled to Townsville last year, where I saw countless 'for lease' signs in the windows of buildings on Flinders Street Mall and throughout the CBD. The member for Herbert drives past and sees new ones regularly. It feels not too unlike my local area of Caboolture.


These regions have so much potential. The people are friendly and incredibly hardworking. The natural environment is beautiful. You don't have to go too far from Townsville and the Strand or the Centenary Lakes in Caboolture to know that the regions are beautiful areas. The locations are perfect for businesses and for public sector opportunities. One fatal element is holding these regions back: the absence of a government that cares. A government who cares, like a Labor government, would be standing up for the regions, not letting them down. Just last week—a prime example—Labor's leader, Bill Shorten, visited a number of towns in regional Queensland that have been all but ignored by the coalition. While the Liberals have been focusing their efforts on giving a $65 billion handout to big businesses, Labor has been hard at work announcing significant infrastructure projects that will create thousands of jobs and truly benefit the regions.


People in Caboolture, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville are not interested in the private lives of members of parliament, I can tell you that. They're not interested in the coalition's continual infighting; they're simply interested in jobs. The people in the regions want to know that decent and secure work is available to them, where they're renumerated fairly and the EBA agreed to by their employer isn't thrown out the window just for the sake of switching to a dodgy labour-hire company. That's what they want. Wherever possible they want to know that their jobs will benefit their community, not the interests of some huge foreign business.


The member for Herbert and I have been continually standing up for our regions in parliament. We've been holding the government to account and calling on them to support Queensland's regions. This is unlike government members in the regions, like the member for Dawson or the member for Capricornia. The member for Dawson knows just how badly the Liberals have been treating Queensland. He has threatened to cross the floor a number of times but in the end always votes with the Liberals to benefit big businesses. Instead of doing any meaningful work to strengthen Queensland, he has been doing a photo shoot that makes light of the recent gun violence, and I think that's absolutely appalling.


As I mentioned before, what I've heard from people all over Australia in my role as the chair of the Australian Jobs Taskforce is that they feel that they've been let down by the government. Instead of listening to them, the only discussions that the government have been involved in have been in the shadows, in corporate boardrooms, hidden away from average, hardworking Australian people. I've heard this wherever I've gone right across the country. What I also hear is hope—hope that at the next election Australians will vote in a government that cares. The Australian voters will take a really good, hard look at the ballot paper and know that when they put pen to paper only Labor will stand up for the regions, for jobs and for hardworking Australians.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (11:20):  This government has a very proud record and, in fact, a very exciting tale to tell on jobs at the moment, with 403,000 new jobs created in the economy last year, and 75 per cent of those being full time. That's a record job creation package. It's a great performance and we should be very proud of it.


To the motion, let me say it highlights lots of government jobs that have gone missing from Townsville, particularly in defence, but it also mentions CSIRO, Customs and the ATO. Firstly, let me say that I am not aware that any of those jobs have been moved for anything other than operational issues. Would we as taxpayers and as a nation expect anything less than that these departments should run themselves in the most efficient manner? What else should we do? Defence will decide where their resources need to be, as will the ATO and the other government departments.


The second issue I'd like to raise is that the member's motion carries the implication that government employing people is a way of fixing unemployment problems. It is not. That is a clear misunderstanding of how our economy runs. Basically governments tax businesses and individuals to raise money to provide services. Those services result in people being paid and getting jobs. Really it has only shifted a job out of the business that generated the income in the first place and therefore paid taxation. It's right and proper that that should be done—I'm certainly not suggesting that we don't tax businesses and individuals in Australia and provide government services; of course we should, and we do—but we should provide the services where the services are needed.


This comes back to something I have spoken of many times in the House, for instance, with the paucity of doctor supply in rural and regional Australia and the fact that largely their incomes revolve around the public purse, if you like—the subsidy scheme—but we seem to have no mechanisms for actually controlling where they deliver those services. That is a digression from this particular motion, but I just make the point that what we should be focusing on is growing jobs for businesses and individuals to grow employment in the communities.


Of course when you've got bigger communities you will need more government workers. Unfortunately in so many of our communities—particularly in South Australia, I must say; the good people of South Australia have the ability to pass judgement on their current state government in just a couple of weeks' time—those jobs have been reducing in regional and rural areas and not growing. But that's not because the government jobs have disappeared; it's because the primary jobs have disappeared.


I would love to speak on this subject in my electorate in three or four weeks, by which time, I'm very hopeful, we will have announced the recipients of the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages around the Upper Spencer Gulf, which was a government action to move in when we had the very tough times in Whyalla and Port Augusta with the closure of the power station there to generate economic outcomes to employ more people. There are three possible ways people can apply that $20 million worth of funding. There can be public infrastructure, and I know some councils have put some bids in along those lines; there is education and training; and, of course, there is support for businesses to grow their businesses to employ more people.


That is certainly where I hope the bulk of that money goes. It will be up to the minister of course and the department to make those decisions, but I'm hoping that's where it will go. I know some of the bids that are in the mix. For instance, there is crane company looking to purchase a mobile crane that at this stage is not available in Australia and is tall enough to reach the latest of the new windfarms going into my electorate and into others. There is another company looking to grow their kingfish operation. They are breeding kingfish fingerlings, feeding them up and capturing premium markets overseas. It is a wonderful fish. I recently toured their facility. I am looking forward to that package. We've got a good story to tell, but we need to be focused on those primary jobs, the jobs in private enterprise that feed the rest of the economy. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:25):  I would like to reflect on a couple of remarks made by the people on the government side, first of all the suggestion that this government has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in Townsville. Are they going to start asking primary school and high school children to work? There are just under 200,000 people that live in Townsville, so I encourage members when they get excited in this place just to be careful of the language they are using. They might cause a bit of a mad stampede to Townsville if this government has been so successful in creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It's just not true.


I also want to pick up on something that the previous speaker said about how we need to make sure that our public sector jobs are where they are needed. There is no greater case than northern Queensland for us to have a strong Public Service. Melbourne is almost closer to Brisbane than Townsville is. Townsville is a long distance from Brisbane, and what we are seeing happen under this government is a consolidation of our Public Service and the frontline services in our metro cities. So it is really rich of this government, which claims to represent the regions, which claims to be the voice of the regions, both the Liberals and National parties, to say to the people in Townsville, the people in Cairns, the people of Mackay: 'You know what? Your shopfront, your ability to talk to the Public Service, is in Brisbane.' You might as well say it is in Melbourne. In my part of the world, we too have suffered under job cuts, since this government got elected, in the Public Service.


The other point I would like to make is what this government has engaged in is not job creation in the regions but job transfer. It shut down the Bendigo ATO office, which serviced north and central Victoria. We are now basically down to about three shopfronts where people can go to get face-to-face support in Victoria. There is a Geelong office that is in the member for Corio's electorate, there is Dandenong and there is Melbourne CBD. So everybody in the north, if they wish to have a face-to-face meeting about tax—and our tax is complicated—whether they be individuals or whether they be small businesses, have to go to Melbourne CBD. It is simply unacceptable. That is what this government has done.


This government has also shut down the Australian Emergency Management Institute on Mount Macedon. The government will say it was for operational reasons. No, it wasn't; it was a land grab. It was the former Attorney General's Department and the razor gang in the 2014 budget that looked at the property prices of Mount Macedon and said, 'Beautiful, we can make a profit,' without engaging with the local community, without even talking to the local real estate agents, who are members of their own political party, who would have told them that the bushfire overlay would make it impossible to build on this land. So they shut down the Australian Emergency Management Institute, a world-class facility training people to have expertise on how to deal with emergencies, whether they be floods or whether they be bushfire risk. They transferred it to an online virtual institute run from Canberra. We are lucky that the state government bought the facility off the government and has in the last few weeks reopened it as the Victorian Emergency Management Institute so at least the Victorian firefighters and at least the Victorian people involved in emergency management will still have access to that facility and the training they require.


What has happened to Centrelink? It is another disgrace of this government. Rather than directly employing people, rather than engaging their casuals and getting them on full-time jobs and onto a pathway to a career, what this government has done is keep them on contracts. What this government has done is keep them as casuals. I have a smart centre in my electorate, just like the member for Herbert does in Cairns. They are based in regional areas. That happened under a former, Labor government. But what this government has done, rather than continue to give the casuals the training they require so they can become full time and can help people when they call and as they need it, is outsource it. This government's waste on consultants and waste on contractors is an example of how it just doesn't understand how to deliver a quality Public Service that Australians can depend upon.


Whether it be Townsville, Bendigo or Ballarat, the government have dropped the ball. They talk about what they're doing in Geelong in relation to the NDIA—which, again, was started by the former Labor government, which made Barwon Heads in Victoria the home of the NDIS and NDIA. That is not the case with the current government. They've just slowed the rollout of the NDIS. The government have let the regions down when it comes to public sector jobs, and that money being lost from our communities hurts. It hurts our regional economies and it hurts our regional communities.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (12:12):  People don't contact their federal member of parliament very often to say that everything is great. They call us when they feel there is nowhere else to go because a system of some sort is failing them. And that is what we are seeing at the moment with families and spouses struggling with home care packages and it is why I am very pleased to speak in support of this motion. At my recent mobile office in Hazelbrook in the Blue Mountains, Noeleen O'Beirne and her daughter Siobhan came to see me. Noeleen's husband, Patrick, died last year at the age of 90. Patrick, who had a love of politics and a wicked sense of humour, had been assessed more than 12 months earlier as needing in-home care. He was frail. Noeleen's own health wasn't up to the up to the heavy work involved in assisting him and, of course, while the rest of the family did what they could, support was sorely needed. Patrick was assessed as needing level 4 care, the top level of care.


Let's be clear what that assessment would have shown. Level 4 home care packages are intended to support people who have high-level care needs. He may have been eligible to receive assistance with showering, dressing, home cleaning, help to use aids and appliances, some social support, meal preparation, medication management, nursing care, allied health support like physio, help with shopping, transport to get to appointments, and support with any changes to memory or behaviour. That was the package that he was judged to be eligible for. He also would have had such high-care needs that he most certainly would have been eligible to enter residential aged care, but both Patrick and Noeleen, like so many elderly people, preferred to remain living in the home that they had called their own for so many years. Sadly, the help did not come in time. Their approved package only started to be delivered shortly before Patrick died. And what it did was reduce the quality of his and Noeleen's last months together. It increased the anxiety and the distress—and that is a disgrace. Noeleen tells me that in some ways, though, she feels lucky, because a friend of hers received his package six weeks after his death.


Similar calls, about long delays and packages not delivered, received by my office and also backed by the data that we're seeing show that Patrick and Noeleen are not alone. The latest numbers show that, in the three months to September, the waiting list grew by more than 10,000. We still don't have the December figures to know how much it grew in that period, but, with 100,000 older Australians, many of them frail, waiting for this government to provide the care they need, the wait is simply too long. Seventy-eight thousand people on that list are waiting for high-care packages so they can avoid moving into aged care, which carries an even bigger cost burden to the taxpayer and brings with it such an emotional and financial burden to their spouses and their families.


Of course, not all the people waiting for home care packages are very elderly. Some have early onset dementia, and the ability of their partner to keep on working, to keep some control of one part of their life, depends on there being an adequate level of in-home care. Many people are forced to accept packages at a lower level than they're eligible for, just to get something. In fact, the minister encourages this. He said:


I would encourage people on waiting lists that whatever level you are offered initially, take that offer.


He cites budgetary pressures and an underestimation of demand as the problem. I don't underestimate his empathy for those impacted and I do acknowledge the 6,000 additional packages that came online, but it really is time he stood up to those in his government who hold the purse strings, because the only answer is a lot more packages. It's not good enough to tell people to make do. People who are assessed to be eligible for level 3 home care packages are more than likely eligible to enter residential care. Those on level 2 may also be eligible. Only level 1 packages are really designed to help people who would benefit from having a minor level of support—and they simply don't meet the needs of the 78,000 people on that waiting list.


There is urgency to this situation, just as there should be urgency when someone is assessed as being eligible for in-home support. They don't have all the time in the world, and we have a responsibility to ensure that people whose lives have often shrunk to revolve around their home get the care they need—because, right now, they're dying before the care they deserve even arrives.

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (12:17):  I particularly want to address today the private member's motion on home care packages as I have a special focus on health care and health facilities in Dunkley. With the support of my neighbour the member for Flinders, who is now Minister for Health, I've fought extremely hard to secure a number of improvements to our local assets, including, for example, a fully funded Medicare licence for MRI at Frankston Hospital, which has now been in place for over a year, saving Dunkley locals thousands of dollars every year. Another example is Total Care Medical Group in Karingal, who were one of the trial participants in the Health Care Homes stage 1 trial. I have a record of fighting and will continue to fight for the best facilities, best programs and best access to health funding for residents in Dunkley.


Home care packages are another way that the Turnbull coalition government is providing consumers with greater choice and control over their own care. Freedom of choice comes back to the core ideology and vision of the Liberal Party, and we—the coalition government and I—absolutely support Australians having the choice to remain in their homes and in their communities, if that is their choice, yet still receive the care that they need. Retaining independence is one of the most important considerations in these situations, and we are working to support that consideration wherever possible.


This funding was formerly under the Home and Community Care program, whose recipients were of geographic variety and differing focus. While these providers do a brilliant job, these changes achieve much-needed visibility and accountability. I note the other speakers' comments about timeliness and dramatic growth of the waiting list; however, part of the transition from the HACC program to our new home care system includes a refocus on how the packages are distributed. Packages are now released directly to consumers, rather than to providers, and consumers who have the most urgent needs or who have been waiting the longest receive packages first.


The aged-care planning region within which Dunkley falls—Southern Metro, Victoria—had 916 packages assigned to it according to the latest report, with its data catchment concluding on 30 September 2017. Over the same period there were a reported 4,188 consumers in care across the Southern Metro region and 53 approved providers. In the Southern Metro region the majority of people queuing for packages are waiting for level 2 packages, a lower level of care than the member for Hindmarsh suggested is reflected across the country. I acknowledge that Dunkley may be in the minority in this regard; however, one aspect that may have been overlooked by the member for Hindmarsh is that many of the people who have been waiting for level 3 and 4 packages are receiving interim packages, allowing them to access services while they wait.


When a new program such as this home care system is released, there will always be an increase in demand, and we are better able to understand the extent of demand for home care packages nationally now that the distribution of home care packages has direct interaction with consumers. In light of this I commend the Turnbull government and Minister Wyatt for the release of an additional 6,000 higher care packages over 2017-18. In addition to this the 2017 budget provided for an investment by the Turnbull government of $5.5 billion to extend the Commonwealth Home Support Program for a further two years to June 2020. Even before this, approximately $461,000 was made available to deliver home support services, pending contractual agreements with service providers in Dunkley. We are committed to supporting our older Australians.


On a weekly basis 2,500 home care packages are released, an astounding figure. We are aware of the sheer number of older Australians who are waiting for a home care package; however, we are working to address the backlog of demand that existed even under the former Labor government's Living Longer Living Better program, whose problems we are still having to fix. It is absurd that other speakers are trying to condemn the government for working to fix aged-care funding problems of their own making; however, Australians will be glad to know that these changes and our new home care system are part of the Turnbull coalition government's commitment to quality care for senior Australians, whether they be in care or choose to stay at home in their community, surrounded by their loved ones.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (12:22):  We just heard a sanctimonious speech by the member for Dunkley, saying that we can now understand the demand and we now have choice, and speaking of all the good things that this government somehow want to be recognised for. That's right: we can recognise demand, we can have choice—but the government is not funding. This government is so out of touch, and members in marginal electorates like Dunkley need to get their heads out of the sand and start understanding that a crisis is unfolding. They want pats on the back while 10,000 vulnerable and older Australians are added to the wait list, and then they have the cheek, the absolute gall, to somehow say, 'It's not our fault.' They have been in government coming up now to six years—



Mr Ramsey interjecting—




Mr DICK:
  The member for Grey says, 'Six years?' You're entering your sixth year of government. Work it out. The election was in 2013. You're in 2018. That's five years. You're entering your sixth year of government.



Mr Ramsey interjecting—




Mr DICK:
  He says, 'You're right.' I say to those opposite: stop the blame game, because vulnerable Australians aren't copping your nonsense. Those frail Australians in my electorate and other electorates right across Australia have had a gutful of a government that is so out of touch, so far from reality, that when we are talking about a crisis in the aged-care sector it wants to get up and be congratulated for its work. Have the guts to acknowledge there is a problem in the system. Have the guts to go to my community. I acknowledge the member for Hindmarsh, who is here today, and thank him for putting this on the agenda and having the guts to get up and call the government out, to hold them to account. As the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I know he's been a constant champion for older Australians. 


We know there are approximately 80,000 to 90,000 home care packages available in this nation, but the latest figures reveal there are now 101,508 elderly Australians waiting in the queue for appropriate home care packages. Of these, more than 60,000 have no package at all and 40,000 have a package at a lower level than they need. It may comfort the government to talk about how great they are, how out of touch they are and how a government back in 2011-12 is somehow the reason we're in this. That doesn't cut it. That's just political spin. That's just rubbish and that's insulting to people in the community. The member for Dunkley and other members opposite like the member for Forde need to work out that there is a crisis in the system.


We heard the minister say that there are financial constraints to keeping people at home. I listened to government members speak today, and they talk about a refocus and reprioritisation—all mumbo jumbo, all rubbish when it comes to actually tackling the issue. No-one's getting up here and calling out the government. No-one's getting out here and calling on the government to take action. They simply want to waltz back to their offices, put their feet up, put the kettle on and not worry about what is happening across the aged-care sector in Australia. We know what the government's priority is. We know that government members like the member for Dunkley and the member for Forde, who were in the chamber today, are not interested in fixing this crisis. They're not interested in tackling this issue. They're here for one reason and one reason alone: to deliver major tax cuts to millionaires and multinational companies. We know that that's their special interest. We know that they are more worried about what's happening at the top end of town, what's happening to those who least need a hand as opposed to those who are in trouble and those who are in a vulnerable situation.


Today I'm calling on the government to start addressing this crisis. I'm calling on the government to make sure that it's listening to the aged-care professionals, those in the sector who are demanding that the government take action on this crisis. We know that time and time again, when it comes to dealing with the tough issues—and I know the government has a lot on its hands with such a dysfunctional and chaotic that we're dealing with, with Liberal-on-Liberal violence, National-on-National violence, Liberal versus National, blowing themselves apart, but who are the losers? It is the people who require aged-care support in my community.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:27):  I'd like to thank the member for Hindmarsh for bringing this motion to the House, because it provides me with the opportunity to speak about what I think is a very important issue for constituents in the electorate of Forde. As we are seeing across all of our electorates, as Australians are getting older and we're having the bulge of the baby boomers starting to enter retirement, as they get older they'll want increased healthcare services because they've reached a standard of living that they expect to retain through to when they pass away. But all of that comes at a cost, and somehow this has to be paid for.


I have no issue with the argument that we should be taking care of people and looking after them in their old age and in their frailty. Having family members directly in this situation, I am well and truly aware of the necessity and importance of ensuring that we have a sustainable system for older Australians to ensure that their healthcare needs can be met.


Where possible, the best place for people to be cared for is in their own home if for no other reason than that moving into an aged-care facility incurs enormous cost and dislocation from community and from friends and neighbours. In a lot of cases, people may have lived in those homes for 30, 40 or 50 years. The value of providing in-home care on that basis is incalculable.


I acknowledge the work that the previous Labor government did. The importance of that work is that we now have a true understanding of the requirements of the system. Before that, we had no idea, and that's where the changes that we brought in in February of last year give us a much, much clearer picture of the requirements in the system. I acknowledge that there are people on waiting lists. Everyone would like to think that we could make the waiting lists disappear overnight, but the reality is that that is not financially feasible. We have to look at how, through responsibly managing the budget—those opposite have carried on about tax cuts for business and whatever, but I'd remind them that back in November 2016 they voted against a package of multinational tax reform measures that have resulted in this government collecting an extra $4 billion in revenue that they voted against. That figure is heading towards $7 billion. So it is this government that has taken the steps necessary to ensure that businesses in Australia, whether they are multinational or purely Australian businesses, pay the appropriate levels of tax necessary to ensure that we can continue to afford to provide the services that Australians have come to accept, whether they are in education, health or child care or in a range of other areas.


This government is working very hard to ensure that we can continue to provide these services and grow the number of packages available to older Australians. Currently, some 2½ thousand packages are released on a weekly basis. In September last year we released an additional 6,000. We know that there is still much to be done in this space. We will continue to do it. We will continue to work with older Australians to ensure that, in the interim, if they can't get their full package they have a package of assistance to at least help them until they receive the full package that they are eligible for. That is what this government is continuing to do through any number of measures, some of which those opposite have voted against.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",NXT,2018-02-26,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (12:32):  What I'm hearing from the government members today is that mediocrity wins. I rise to support the motion on home care moved by the member for Hindmarsh, because there are unacceptably long waiting lists for home care packages, and they impact on my electorate more than many. The population of my electorate is the oldest in South Australia and the eighth oldest in the country. The median age is 46 years, and 22 percent of the people in my electorate are aged over 65.


The problem with growing waiting lists is clear to see. I was  contacted by a 75-year-old constituent who'd been receiving assistance with his gardening through the Commonwealth Home Support Program. He was receiving just three hours of support a week, but that was scaled back to just one hour per fortnight because they'd had an influx of people in the program and couldn't provide any more support to him. What is the point of one hour per fortnight? It's a false economy, because what happens is that, if people don't get the assistance, they do things themselves, they fall over, they break their hip, they are in hospital for an extended period of time and then they need even more support. It's ridiculous. Over a hundred thousand people are waiting for a home care package. It is not good enough, and I can't believe that there would be a single member of the government who would stand up and champion this. You have got to be kidding! You're the party that older people vote for. The fact that you don't support them is astounding.


I had a whistleblower in my electorate—a woman who works in this field. She was so embarrassed to tell me—she was absolutely gutted and ashamed to tell me—that they had a person who had been on the waiting list for so long that, by the time a package was available and they rang up and said, 'Dear sir, a package is available for you,' he couldn't come to the phone because he had died. That's the kind of thing that we provide in this country. The minister is well aware of the problem. He was quoted on 2 February as saying, 'On the waiting list, whatever level you're offered, initially take that offer.' What kind of system do we have where the minister promotes that a person shouldn't get what they need—'Just take it. Be grateful for whatever you get'? I think it's about priorities. Clearly, providing support to our elderly Australians is not a priority of this government and I am deeply ashamed that we cannot do more in this parliament about it. We need to be smart and this is a smart thing to do, because the more we support people in their home, where they want to be, the less requirement there is for them to be moved into an aged-care facility. People do not want to be in those aged-care facilities if they can manage their needs at home. People want to be in their home. So I would say to government: 'Make this a priority. Make this a priority over tax cuts to multinationals. Make this a priority.'


I've spoken before in this place about my community of Strathalbyn, after the Kalimna aged-care facility closed, and I want to reiterate that this community is experiencing immense stress because we don't have the packages. The current data reveals that only 30 home care packages are currently being delivered in this region and yet, by 2021, there will be demand for 97 packages. Sixty-seven extra packages need to be found and this government needs to find them. That's just one town in my community. I dread to think what this is like right across Australia. Without these home care packages, more and more people will rely on nursing homes for support, but even aged-care beds are not keeping up with the growing demand. The township of Strathalbyn is going to see a 190 per cent increase in residents aged over 70 in the next 13 years. We need more support for older Australians. Older Australians and younger Australians must be the priority for us in here.


I concur with the member for Hindmarsh: this is an issue that doesn't make headlines and it should. We have an ageing population and we are a nation that is wealthy enough and smart enough to know how to properly care for our most vulnerable people. We cannot let these waiting lists go on forever. For the government to stand here and say that they're doing a good job and they're ticking this off, they've got to be kidding.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (12:37):  Last week I had the great pleasure of having the aged-care minister in my electorate. We visited Ceduna and Peterborough. I'll come back to that in a moment. Let me say that, having spent a bit of time closely with the minister, I don't think we could get a man more up to the task, a minister more up to the task or anyone more engaged with the things that need to be done in aged care in Australia. That comes back to the changes that happened in February this year, which the minister explained in his speech on this matter in the main chamber. To the member for Hindmarsh, who I know cares about these issues, I suggest that, if he weren't there to listen to the minister at that stage, he should get a copy of the Hansard to see what he had to say. If he still doesn't fully understand what the minister said about the changes in circumstances that came about in February then he should seek an audience with the minister, because I know he would be granted it. What the minister told us was that, prior to February this year, the demand for home care packages was hidden within the providers' numbers. People who ran these institutions ran their own lists and, largely, the Commonwealth did not know how many people were on them. That all changed and now they are assessed independently and the Commonwealth knows what the demand level is. No significant change in numbers happened between December and March, so what this has identified is the backlog that has been there for quite some time. Of course, this is a challenge for the government to meet in a short time, but we've really only had those figures for fewer than six months. The minister's made a fair effort and over 6,000 new places were granted.


And let me say that home care packages are one of the great advances of aged care around Australia, because, regardless of the cost, virtually everyone—including me when I get to that stage—I'm sure would rather live in their own house, would rather live in the place where they have enjoyed their life, surrounded by the artefacts, the photographs, the memories, of what their life has been. So it's a great move. It's a very good move, and it's where government and governments will continue to expand the effort.


But there is this backlog that we have to deal with, and it's not easy. I'm pleased with the response that the government's made at this stage, but we're going to have to keep working in that area. We understand that. We know that. That is why the minister has said: 'If you can't get the package you want at the moment, take something and get in the system, because then you will be monitored regularly, and, as your demand builds up, it can be reregistered.' It helps the argument. It helps us deal with that issue at government level.


I said I'd come back to Minister Wyatt's visit. In Ceduna, we visited the aged-care facility one evening with the local auxiliary group there, who have raised tens of thousands of dollars to refurbish rooms, and then the next morning we came back with the hospital and aged-care CEO. It's a very, very fine facility. Let me tell you: the views at the aged-care facility in Ceduna are second to none. Then we went on to the Ceduna Koonibba Aboriginal Health Service, and later in the day we went to Peterborough, on the other side of the electorate, in the east.


Peterborough is a symptom of something I've spoken about in this House before. Prior to coming to parliament, I served on local hospital boards in the late eighties and nineties. In our wisdom, in our smaller communities, we had hospital boards and we had hostel boards. In our wisdom, we decided to amalgamate those institutions because it made sense—and I still think it did—little anticipating that in the 2000s the state government at the time, being a Labor government, would decided to sack all those hospital boards and take over the running of those facilities themselves. That meant the state government inherited a whole swag of aged-care facilities that they did not want, do not have particular interest in and find it very difficult to get grants for because they sit on state government land. It has really messed up the cake, if you like.


I took Minister Wyatt there so we could try to address those problems directly in Peterborough and deal with this issue that's been troubling the community for some time. Let me say that the community have over $1 million that they have raised, and they are one of the lowest socioeconomic communities in my electorate. I look forward to working with them and dealing with the issues I've covered in this speech.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (12:42):  Ongoing inaction by the Turnbull government is jeopardising the progress made in aged-care services since Labor's historic Living Longer Living Better reforms. These reforms provided a 10-year plan to build a better, fairer and more sustainable and nationally consistent aged-care system. Unfortunately, the instability and inaction of the Liberal Turnbull government are threatening the continued progress of these critical reforms.


More than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for a package. The release of the latest data on the Turnbull government's home care packages has revealed that more than 100,000 people are languishing in limbo and, of those, more than 10,000 are in Western Australia alone. The government says that those numbers had been hidden from it until the last six months. Well, did the government ever think of asking the sector to find out? No.


The data shows that 80 per cent of older Australians waiting to have a package have high needs. Many have dementia. Currently, around half of people living in aged care have dementia, depression or another mental health or behavioural condition. The proportion of older people requiring high care for complex needs, which includes assistance with all activities of daily living, such as eating and bathing, has quadrupled from 13 per cent in 2009 to 61 per cent in 2016. The most concerning part is that these people are being told that they may have to wait more than 12 months before they even get a look in.


We are clearly now at a crisis point. The Turnbull government's commitment in September to readjust the ratio of places to create 6,000 additional packages has been proven to be woefully inadequate. This wouldn't even clear the queue in Western Australia, let alone across the entire nation. Without intervention, the waiting list will continue to grow, with more and more vulnerable older Australians forced into limbo without care. Meanwhile, many older Australians are instead presenting to hospitals around the country for acute care, are discharged into inadequate care and are then re-presenting at hospitals again and again. This is ultimately costing our community far more than if the government had just delivered the packages that were required.


The Turnbull government has known about this urgent situation for many months but is yet to turn its attention to this growing issue. I have heard horror stories from constituents in my electorate—indeed, even from constituents in the minister's electorate—who are anxiously waiting for their elderly relatives to be able to access an aged-care package while missing out on vital treatment and care. We have called time and again for the Turnbull government to fix this crisis as these waiting lists continue to grow. The minister's only commentary to date on the crisis has been to point out that some older Australians waiting for aged care will receive an interim package. An interim package is not good enough. It may be a start, and I heard the minister say this again in the House today, but it isn't good enough.


In late 2015, the Turnbull government cut almost half a billion dollars from the aged-care funding instrument which allocates funding to residential care. The government did this on the basis of what it labelled 'higher-than-expected growth and expenditure' but without consulting with the people who would be affected and without any concern, clearly, for its impact. Then, less than six months later, the Liberals cut a further $1.2 billion from future residential care funding in their 2016 budget. The Turnbull government has refused to release any detailed modelling around these cuts, raising concern that it had no idea of what the impact of these measures would be on the provision of care for vulnerable older Australians.


Labor have consistently pushed this government on the issue, and in December 2016 we were successful in forcing it to back down on the harshest components of these measures. But the growing pile of work that is unanswered includes the Aged Care Legislated Review, which was led by David Tune. The only action the government has taken to date in response to that has been to roll out two of the 38 recommendations. The government has also not responded to 43 recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on elder abuse released last year—instead, in recent weeks it's kicked off further reviews and consultations. Equally concerning is the lack of response to the 19 recommendations of the committee on community affairs report into the future of Australia's aged care sector workforce released in June. There is no sense of urgency coming from this government when it comes to responding to the 10 recommendations of the Review of National Aged Care Quality Regulatory Processes. To date, the only accomplishment is that the government has accepted one recommendation, which Labor had proposed six months earlier. The two reports, the Applied Aged Care Solution review and the Wollongong report on the cost of care, are now collecting dust in the minister's office. Older Australians and their families deserve much better than this. We now have 100,000 people waiting for a package, which is not only meaning that they are without care but also putting further and further strain on our hospital sector to look after them. The government needs to fix this problem now.

Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (12:47):  I rise to speak to this motion because I know from many older aged constituents in my electorate of Chisholm that they want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. They also want a practical and pragmatic solution to enable them to remain in their own homes. Mental health, as we know, is so important to longevity, wellbeing and quality of life, and the overwhelming majority of people desire to remain in their own homes for this very reason. They want to stay somewhere they feel comfortable and where their quality of life can remain. They want a home care package that works, and that's why I'm so delighted about the Turnbull government's reforms that we introduced.


Labor think that the panacea to any issues in relation to this are Labor's Living Longer Living Better reforms, but under Labor the ratios set for the release of their home care packages were inadequate and severely underestimated the real demand. The waiting lists for home care packages are not new. They existed under Labor, and there was no way to determine the extent of the waiting period. Labor like to spin this as the solution, but it isn't. We have introduced practical, pragmatic solutions to the home care package system. All Labor did was uncover a number of problems that existed under their watch that this government is having to fix. Australians were still waiting for home care packages under Labor, and they did nothing to fix the problem. The introduction by the Turnbull government of the new national prioritisation queue has uncovered the extent of the problem left by the former Labor government, which this government is working on to fix. We inherited a home care system from Labor with predetermined ratios that didn't work. Our 2017 aged-care reforms and commitment to transparency have exposed the extent of the home care mess left by Labor, and we are working to fix it.


How are we fixing this? In September 2017 we announced the release of 6,000 additional level 3 and 4 home care packages over 2017-18. This more than doubled the planned growth of high-level packages this financial year already assigned to consumers, and we are releasing almost 2½ thousand home care packages on a weekly basis. In addition to this, in the 2017 budget the Turnbull government provided an investment of $5.5 billion to extend the Commonwealth Home Support program, CHSP, for a further two years to June 2020. The Turnbull government is committed to quality care for senior Australians, including a record $18.6 billion aged-care investment in 2017-18, the first part of a near-$100 billion commitment planned for the next five years. Previously home care waiting lists were administered by aged-care providers, but the Turnbull government's new national queue system is a pragmatic and practical solution which has brought much-needed visibility and accountability, providing consumers with greater capacity to plan for their aged-care needs. With this greater transparency, people can see where they are on the queue, and it has a practical reality rather than dealing with the great unknown.


The Turnbull government remains committed to older Australians and to keeping them at home, and this is what senior Australians continue to tell us—certainly the older constituents in my electorate of Chisholm and, indeed, their families who are dealing with the situation at this time in their lives. That's why in September 2017 we announced the additional packages. The $5.5 billion investment in the continuation of the CHSP actually provides a range of essential services to support older Australians who wish to remain living in their homes. This range of services includes Meals on Wheels, community transport, personal care, nursing and allied health, domestic assistance, cleaning, shopping, home maintenance and modifications, and a range of respite services. All of these services are essential to all of our daily lives, but they become particularly acute in older age. To stay at home rather than to go into institutionalised care is always the preferred option for older Australians, certainly in my electorate. So I'm very, very proud of the Turnbull government's commitment to quality care for senior Australians.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:00):  Yesterday I attended a very special church service led by Father Maher Gurges of the St George Chaldean Church in Campbellfield. I joined hundreds of my local Iraqi Chaldean parishioners in a very special ceremony recognising the efforts of our young Chaldean Iraqi students. Some 20 students were recognised, a combination of VCE graduates and university graduates. Amongst the university graduates, we congratulated a doctor of medicine, an environmental architect and a number of teaching graduates. With the VCE graduates, I want to particularly mention Miriam Hurmez Hani, who ended up being in the top 10 in the state of Victoria in the subject of English, and Saoresho Hurmez Hani, who ended up being in the top 10 in the state of Victoria for mathematics. Both of those students were students at Essendon Keilor College. I had the opportunity to meet with them yesterday to congratulate them and, of course, share the excitement and pride with their families. Father Maher told us at the congregation yesterday that, 'We are producing a new generation of doctors, lawyers, architects and teachers here in our new homeland.' I want to congratulate the community for the incredible amount of work that they do for their young people.

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (16:45):  I ask leave of the Federation Chamber to amend notice No. 3, private members' business, in the terms as circulated.


Leave granted.




Mr CREWTHER:
  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


   (a) genocide is a crime under international law, which has been enacted into Australian law through Division 268 of the Australian Criminal Code; and


   (b) the Iraqi Council of Ministers, United Nations institutions, and many parliaments have recognised that ISIL's crimes against the Yazidis constitute genocide;


(2) welcomes the Government's decisive action in resettling Yazidi refugees;


(3) condemns the genocide perpetrated against Yazidis by ISIL;


(4) calls for continued support for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIL and efforts to liberate Yazidis in ISIL captivity;


(5) recognises the importance of justice for Yazidi victims and survivors of ISIL and calls on the Government to continue to support accountability for the perpetrators of serious international crimes against the Yazidis, including, where appropriate, in Australian courts and in other jurisdictions, where these are consistent with international standards;


(6) calls on the Government to continue supporting the formation of an Investigative Team pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2379 (2017) and, once established, to support it in the collection, preservation and storage of evidence of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide; and


(7) supports the:


   (a) continued efforts to defeat ISIL militarily and ideologically via de- radicalisation and countering violent extremism programs;


   (b) continued consideration of the plight of the Yazidis in the development of Australian humanitarian policies and programs;


   (c) continued provision of psychological and other social support services for Yazidi refugees living in Australia;


   (d) right of the Yazidis and all minorities to live in peace, safety and freedom in Syria and Iraq and to participate in relevant political processes; and


   (e) protection of Yazidis, Christians and other minorities in Iraq, under United Nations supervision and in cooperation with relevant authorities and minorities.


Today, I want to speak about the recent events that have occurred in Syria and Iraq with respect to the Yazidis. The recent military defeat of ISIL allows for some reflection on the atrocities inflicted by Islamic extremism over the past four years in Syria and Iraq. In particular, the Yazidi people of north-western Iraq have been subjected to extraordinary violence inflicted by ISIL. The Yazidi were actively hunted by ISIL. Massacres of civilians, including women and children, were widely reported as ISIL assaulted Iraq in 2014. They surrounded fleeing Yazidi on Mount Sinjar and attempted to starve them out. There have been many reports of surviving women and children also being abducted by ISIL forces and sold into slavery. The violence and horror of these stories appal me, as they should every member of this chamber. They include a 20-year-old woman being beaten and raped multiple times a day for months, ISIL taking entire villages and shooting all but the young women, who were then sexually assaulted by ISIL fighters, and women and, indeed, young girls being sold and traded amongst ISIL fighters like objects. Survivors managed to flee any way they could, and some who have since resettled in Australia have told their story.


I encountered a human face of one of these stories last year when I met and spoke with a Yazidi survivor, Nihad. At the age of 15, she was captured on the way to Mount Sinjar, fleeing from ISIL fighters. Her sister was raped in front of her and she was sold to an ISIL fighter. She was then raped and beaten repeatedly. When the fighter died in combat, she was sold to a man she referred to as a monster, who kept her and other Yazidi girls as slaves. Nihad was further raped and beaten and then fell pregnant. Nihad gave birth to her son in July 2015. When she managed to escape, she was unable to take her young baby with her and the baby was forced to remain with the father, a member of ISIL. She's never seen the baby again.


Since listening to the horror inflicted on Nihad, I've also learnt of other stories of some Yazidi victims who have also settled here in Australia. Khudeeda Omar Qoolo now lives in Toowoomba, but in 2014 his village was assaulted at 2 am by ISIL. He and his family had to flee 25 kilometres to Mount Sinjar while being fired upon. His brother and their family also fled but did not arrive at the mountain. They have not been heard from since. Khudeeda and his family were trapped on Mount Sinjar for nine days with little food or water. Due to their desperate situation, in order to escape they decided to attempt to walk from Mount Sinjar to Kurdistan. Luckily, they came across a Kurdish convoy, who were able to ferry them to a refugee camp. Furthermore, his daughter and two of his grandchildren were captured by ISIL and sold to a terrorist. Khudeeda spent months negotiating with the terrorists to free his daughter and grandchildren and had to pay a ransom in order to free them. He then had to pay smugglers to rescue his daughter and grandchildren.


Sadly, Khudeeda's story is not unique. Another man, now living in New South Wales, fled from an assault on his village with his wife and children. They spent four days trapped on Mount Sinjar with very little food and needing to walk eight hours to get any water. To escape, they had to travel through ISIL controlled areas to another town, Kursi, past victims and people dying from starvation and dehydration. After staying in Kursi for three days, this family tried to escape from Kursi into Syria. Thousands of Yazidi walked for hours in darkness with injuries, illness and bleeding feet to a Kurdish-controlled area. Such was their fear that, when they first found Kurdish forces, people screamed in terror as they thought they had been found by ISIL. Instead they finally received food, water, shelter and transport to freedom.


Sadly, these stories are from survivors—those who have managed to escape from ISIL. Moreover, these are a small sample of the horrors suffered by the Yazidi. The Yazidi were specifically targeted by ISIL, forced from their homes and, if captured, often executed or sold into slavery. Many have labelled these crimes genocide, and this is what this motion here today presents to this parliament. I look forward to further debate on this motion.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:50):  I second the motion. I thank the member for Dunkley for bringing attention to this very important issue. Last September I brought forward a similar private members' motion and I spoke strongly against the use of sexual violence in conflict and the need for the perpetrators of such violence and evil to be held to account. I am a strong supporter of UN resolution 1325 and the subsequent women, peace and security resolutions that have followed in recent years. I recently spoke at an event run by the Gender Institute and Centre for Military and Security Law for the 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' campaign. I welcome the architect of the 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' campaign, Susan Hutchinson, who is in the chamber with us today as we speak about this important issue that she has a very committed view on. She's been a strong advocate on this issue for many years.


The 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' campaign calls on governments to investigate and prosecute the sexual violence perpetrated by their own nationals who fought with Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Members of Daesh have committed sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and these crimes are classified as such because sexual violence, as perpetrated against the Yazidis, is with the intent to destroy in whole or in part the Yazidi community—in other words, genocide.


At the 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' event last year we were joined by Shireen and her friends and family, who have recently settled in Australia as refugees from northern Iraq. Shireen's family are from a village called Kocho, where Daesh undertook a sweeping campaign, killing thousands of Yazidis in August 2014. They kidnapped hundreds of women and girls, who were sold into sexual slavery, and buried the dead in mass graves. Shireen told her family's story in this very building as part of the official celebrations of World Refugee Day last year. She told how she'd been lucky to escape Kocho before Daesh came but how some of her family, including her sister, her sister's husband and their children were captured or killed.


From the back row of the event at the ANU I spoke at last year Shireen and her friends and family—and there were many of them—were weeping not only for the pain of hearing about the part some Australians played in the suffering of their community and from the ongoing trauma of missing loved ones but for the call to action that was very strong in that room—for their desire for recognition and for justice for what they experienced.


Last year I passed that motion calling for the investigation and prosecution of Australians who perpetrated sexual violence as war crimes and crimes against humanity while fighting with terrorist groups like Daesh in Syria and Iraq. And today we pass this motion. We speak on this motion which condemns the genocide perpetrated against the Yazidi people by Daesh and calls for continued support to investigate Australians who have allegedly perpetrated war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, including through the use of sexual violence; to prosecute them as appropriate; and to support international efforts to gather evidence, investigate and prosecute those responsible for international crimes perpetrated by Daesh in Iraq and Syria.


The 2016 UN independent commission of inquiry on Syria recorded the gruesome details of crimes against the Yazidis. We know that women and girls have suffered terribly throughout the genocide and that survivors, including those now living in Australia, continue to grieve over their lost relatives and suffer flashbacks from their own torture. Australia has criminalised sexual violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, but the last time an Australian court heard a case of war crimes was in 1951. That's a long time ago.


This parliament has updated Australia's legislation on war crimes to ensure that it applies to members of organisations such as Daesh. When we ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, we took on the responsibility of investigating war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and prosecuting them in our own courts. Now is the time to take up that responsibility. We must gather the legal testimony of victims and witnesses to this genocide committed by Daesh including their heinous use of sexual violence against the Yazidis who now call Australia home. We must include such evidence in investigations conducted by Australian authorities and share it with the international investigative mechanisms established in Syria and Iraq. I hope this motion acts as the next step towards Australia pursuing victims of Daesh's heinous crimes.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (16:55):  May I start by commending the member for Dunkley for this motion. I'm very happy to stand up and let my voice to this motion. I also echo the member for Dunkley in recognising the Prosecute; Don't Perpetrate campaign and Susan. It is a sad and unfortunate fact that the most vulnerable victims of conflict are women and children. It is a fact that women and girls suffer disproportionately during and after war. They are vulnerable particularly to sexual violence and exploitation as well as other war crimes. It was the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which was the first to recognise rape and sexual violence as a crime of genocide. The tribunal found that sexual violence was a constituent element of genocide in Rwanda. The UN Human Rights Council asserts that Daesh sought to destroy the minority Yazidis through killing, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture and other war crimes, confirming that Daesh's crimes against the Yazidis do indeed constitute genocide.


It is easy to dismiss this as something far away that has no impact on us here in Australia in our safe haven, but there are implications here. Australia ratified the Genocide Convention which requires us to enact legislation to penalise persons guilty of genocide. In 1995, genocide became illegal in Australia. Our National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security is a vehicle for us to implement UN Security Council resolutions around sexual violence against women and girls. But we also have a more direct responsibility.


We have a responsibility to prosecute those who return from fighting in foreign conflicts in Iraq and Syria. We have a responsibility to prosecute those who have fought for Daesh for war crimes involving sexual violence, crimes against humanity and genocide. We cannot let this slide. We need to send a strong message that those who return to Australia after fighting with Daesh will not get away with the sexual violence they have perpetrated in conducting their heinous acts in Iraq and Syria.


I echo the sentiments previously expressed by the member for Canberra about the importance of ensuring that any prosecution that we conduct in relation to those who have returned as foreign fighters from Iraq and Syria should include an element of recognition of the sexual violence they perpetrated there. The other responsibility we have is to provide a safe haven for those persecuted minorities through our humanitarian policies, through supporting resettlement, and through an effective and comprehensive settlement program that includes a recognition of the significant trauma that many of these minorities, particularly Yazidi women, have had to endure at the hands of Daesh. We have heard so far today from previous speakers personal accounts of those tragic stories.


In regard to recent comments by the coalition that reflect a pattern of dog whistling against migrants and refugees, this has a broader impact on the wellbeing and successful settlement of those who have already suffered unspeakable trauma. I would caution those who use arguments about population, arguments about immigration and arguments to draw attention to the others within our community who have, as our national anthem says, 'come across the seas,' to seek safe haven here in Australia. I would caution them to understand the broader impact of their words and understand the broader impact of their political opportunism in drawing attention to immigration and refugees. We cannot talk about genocide and prosecuting the guilty if we aren't prepared to support the persecuted. This is why the 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' campaign is so important. I urge all members in the House today to listen with open minds, open hearts and open ears to the tragic tale of these women who have come here and to support the 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate' campaign.

"Zimmerman, Trent, MP",LP,2018-02-26,"



Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (17:01):  I firstly congratulate the member for Dunkley for moving this important motion. We've heard during this debate some very moving and tragic accounts of some of the acts of horror and genocide that were perpetrated against the Yazidis. I think it is important that this parliament consider these issues. It has been a long campaign by many in the international community, including Australia, to make sure that these horrors are properly recognised, but, more importantly, dealt with. Thankfully, the Australian government has already acted to help the Yazidis. The first part of this was through our contribution to the global coalition to defeat ISIL, as well as seeking to liberate Yazidis who may still be in captivity. Additionally, we've sought to help those who have been targeted. As such, hundreds of Yazidi survivors have already been settled in Australia—as part of our resettlement program—as part of the cohort of 1,200 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Further, the Australian government is also seeking to fight slavery more broadly through the creation of the Modern Slavery Act. I commend the member for Dunkley, as chair of the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee, on his work in this regard.


However, the stories of horror that we've heard today cannot alone bring perpetrators to justice. The immediate aftermath of the defeat of ISIL should lead to an examination of these atrocities in concert with the formation of an investigative team, as already identified under UN Security Council Resolution 2379. The individual perpetrators of these crimes must be identified, investigated and brought to justice. I know that this is what 'Prosecute; don't perpetrate', and other organisations working on behalf of Yazidis, are trying to do. Such an investigation must be far-reaching in its conduct. While these are unspeakable horrors, to dismiss a fair and thorough investigation will not achieve justice for the Yazidis. As such, significant international support should go towards ensuring that the investigation has the resourcing it needs to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide against the Yazidis.


Furthermore, this investigation will require an international component. There have been widespread reports of foreign fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq to assist ISIL, and unfortunately these have included some Australians. As ISIL is defeated militarily, it is likely that the surviving fighters will either flee to other conflicts or, potentially, attempt to return to their countries of origin. We cannot allow this to occur. This must also extend to those Australians who have fought for ISIL and who seek to return to Australia. These are people who have betrayed Australia and sought to represent a foreign force actively engaged in combat against Australian forces. Moreover, these people may very well have been complicit in some of the outrages inflicted upon the Yazidis. I have every confidence that the Australian government will investigate and prosecute any Australian involved in committing crimes against the Yazidis to ensure justice for victims and survivors of these atrocities.


With the end of the conflict and the fall of Raqqa late last year, there is now an opportunity for both justice and recovery. Properly investigating and prosecuting these atrocities will create a vehicle to assist the Yazidi community globally and will take a step towards rebuilding their society. By ensuring that Iraqi and international organisations investigate and prosecute those who have committed these terrible crimes, we can go some way to assisting in this process. Justice needs to be delivered for the Yazidi, and those who undertook these atrocities must be brought to account, no matter where they are in the world.


I think it is important that this parliament recognises genocides such as those that the Yazidi have suffered. It's an important message to the world community that the international legal and global order will not ever tolerate these types of actions. I look forward to the day when this parliament can consider a similar motion in relation to that long and deeply felt genocide that was perpetrated against the Armenians a hundred years ago.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-02-26,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (17:05):  I thank the member for Dunkley for bringing forward this motion on genocide in Iraq. It is important, not only for us as global citizens, for what has been done to the Yazidi people but also the dimension that conflicts with Australia's responsibilities in relation to its own citizens, as has been referred to. This in effect ticks the main boxes for the crime of genocide as defined by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide: any 'intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group', not only by killing the members of that group but also by deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about their destruction and by imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. The extent to which some of the more heinous activities that were committed against the Yazidis in the Sinjar region in Iraq went to prevent future generations of Yazidis almost defies belief.


The Yazidis' problems went back to 2007, well before even this started, with some of the more radical senior elements under al-Qaeda in Iraq, but it particularly picked up pace when the Daesh forces took over the region where the Yazidi resided in August 2014. The activities that they perpetrated there were not only mass killings, particularly of men at the beginning of their operations, but they moved to a position where they tried to create forced conversions.


Of course, the consequence of not agreeing to a forced conversion was death. Many hundreds of Yazidi men were rounded up, taken away, gunned down, buried alive and abandoned in mass graves. The women and girls were rounded up and examined by a gynaecologist to  determine whether they were virgins or pregnant. If they were virgins they were immediately put into a slave market and handed off to the IS fighters. The pregnant women had forced abortions performed on them. It's completely incomprehensible to us sitting in this room what those circumstances must have been like for them, and then to have to move into the situation of sexual slavery, being passed from person to person—in fact the slave market was conducted largely online or through the use of apps like Telegram, Facebook and WhatsApp. All of these were used as part of this market. It is estimated that something like 3,000 women were subjected to this as sex slaves. For example, the cost of a virgin was around $10,000, and other women would go for $2,000 and $3,000.


It is horrifying to contemplate that this was also done under the guise of adherence to a religious belief. It not only identifies the fact that there was this horrific genocide going on, but it is good to see that after all these decades of saying 'never again' there was a reasonably quick response, not only to bring relief to the Yazidis who were trapped on Mount Sinjar but also to participate in the coalition, an international effort, to destroy Daesh, an effort that has largely been successful in the conventional sense. It is also good that we didn't weasel-word our approach to this. It was accepted as a genocide quite early on. In fact, the US House of Representatives voted 393 to 0 to accept that definition, in March 2016, which contrasts greatly to what happened in Rwanda.


So I'm pleased to see that we are being a bit more forceful, more proactive, but I would add my endorsement to this concept of making sure there we're doing all we can to ensure the prosecution of those who return and to choke off the ideology and ideological efforts and propaganda that happen in this country to promote our young people to go over to countries like this to commit these crimes.


Lest we think this is all just on the Islamic side, I'd like to also point out that we have groups like Antipodean Resistance. Just this very morning, a poster was placed upon my electorate office in Bega, a sophisticatedly produced poster by the fascist group Antipodean Resistance, with swastikas and caricature portraits of Jews, describing 'Jewish poison'. Part of their program is to pursue the legalisation of the killing of Jews. My wife is Jewish, of course, so that also added extra poignancy to it. This is happening in our country, as well as what we've seen manifesting overseas. We have to be very proactive and forceful on this, and I commend the member for highlighting that prosecutorial aspect of this crime.

Mr Fletcher:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) Under the Mobile Black Spot Program, each funding agreement with the carriers sets a funding cap for the agreement. The agreements also include mechanisms to enable any savings achieved under the program during the rollout to be retained in unspent pools. 


If agreed, these savings can be used to fund additional base stations, meet overspends at other base stations or returned to the Commonwealth at the end of the program. Any material cost increases to a base station requires Commonwealth approval on a discretionary basis.


As per these arrangements, the carriers have used some savings to meet increased costs at other base stations. 


The reported amounts in the unspent pools represents the net savings achieved during the rollout i.e. total savings less any additional build costs.


At 24 May 2017, the Commonwealth's component of the unspent pool for Telstra under round 1 was $2.1 million.


As at 14 February 2018, the latest figures currently project the Commonwealth's component of the unspent pools for each carrier under rounds 1 and 2 at:


Telstra: $4.1 million


Optus: $0.06 million


Vodafone: No savings


(2) (a) and (b) As at 14 February 2018, no funding from the unspent pools has been allocated to additional base stations under the Mobile Black Spot Program.
