"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-03-02,"—On 7 April 1998 this government launched a vicious assault which destroyed the trust of the nation. Never again could any Australian worker feel totally safe in their job. The cherished Australian ideals of fair play and good faith in the workplace were swept away in a sea of balaclavas, armed thugs and german shepherds. Since its first day in office in 1996, the Howard government had promised that the law of the jungle would come into effect in Australian workplaces. That day had finally come. On this occasion the government's brazenness sealed its own fate. The Australian community rallied to the side of the Maritime Workers Union of Australia and its members. While the government had lost all semblance of moral responsibility, the Australian community had not. When future generations look back at the Howard government, this despicable attack on its own citizens will forever colour their view.
But it is by no means an isolated incident: this government has always been at war with working Australians. The incidents have not always been as spectacular as the waterfront dispute, but they have been happening all the same. When Peter Reith was the minister for workplace relations, he was quite open about his desire to be an employer advocate. The current incarnation, however, doggedly clings to a ridiculously flimsy veil of falsified impartiality from behind which he attacks the conditions, rights and security of working Australian families. What are his favourite targets? They are the voice of working Australians, the trade union movement, and the cornerstone of the industrial relations system: the impartial umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002 is nothing more than another component of this antiworker campaign initiated by Peter Reith, continued—albeit in a haphazard, fragmented and unsuccessful manner—by Tony Abbott and now in the hands of another rabid ideologue, Kevin Andrews. Having been unable to push the Orwellianly titled `More Jobs, Better Pay' omnibus bill through the Senate, the government thought no-one would notice if they split it up and snuck it through separately. On the surface the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002 may seem relatively benign to the casual observer. It proposes three main amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. First, it seeks to introduce a provision that the commission must, as far as practicable, hear and determine an application for a section 127 order within 48 hours. Second, it proposes a new provision giving the commission explicit power to make interim orders if it cannot come to a final decision within 48 hours. Finally, it looks to introduce new considerations for the commission to take into account in considering whether to make an interim order. But, while this bill may seem nothing more than an administrative fiddle around the edges of one section in an entire act, it is in fact a serious attack on the right of working Australians to stand up for their jobs and their working conditions. 
So what is this bill really all about? It is about implementing the coalition's extremist industrial relations agenda, no matter what the cost is to our community. This government wishes to remove the right of working Australians to bargain collectively, hamstring the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that there is no fair and independent umpire to resolve disputes, and obliterate the concept of good-faith bargaining. The evidence is right here before us. First, there is no way that this bill is actually aimed at assisting the IRC to do its job, as the previous minister erroneously claimed. Let us take the attempt to introduce a strict 48-hour period in which the IRC must hear and determine section 127 matters. Is this indicative measure really necessary? The IRC already has the power to hear section 127 matters as quickly as practicable. Why amend the act to specify a 48-hour period? Why become obsessed with the process rather than look at the practicality of the issues? Currently the commission is doing its job in a very timely and efficient manner. A Senate committee report found that over half of section 127 applications were already decided within 48 hours. The previous minister himself said:
The latest figures show that some 85 per cent of section 127 applications are first heard within four days of lodgement.
Why is the government so keen to introduce what in fact is a redundant measure?
Putting aside for a moment the irony of a right-wing ideologue arguing in favour of greater intervention in the industrial relations process, I am assuming that it is not because this government is in favour of indicative time frames. In 2002 the government howled down a Labor proposal to introduce a time frame in which unfair dismissal claims should be heard. While the miners of the Blair Athol coalmine, who waited nearly five years for their unfair dismissal case to be heard, thought it was a very sensible idea, this government did not. Apparently such a proposal was impracticable. Obviously, in the addled minds of the Tory brains trust, things have changed.
There is only one answer. By enforcing the 48-hour time frame, the government is attempting to curtail the ability of trade unions to prepare and present evidence and argument against a section 127 order. This government is trying to shut down the right of workers to act collectively in order to ensure that they receive a fair deal at the hands of their employers. This becomes more evident when we further examine this redundant measure in the context of the bill's remaining elements. The government seeks to encourage the commission to make interim orders within 48 hours if they have not had time to hear all the evidence and submissions required to make a final ruling. The commission would not be required to hold a hearing or to form a view about whether the action would be protected under the act. Instead, the IRC would be forced to consider set factors when deciding whether to grant an interim section 127 order, again putting the focus on process rather than on the practicalities and industrial realities of the situation. These factors are heavily weighted towards the concerns of employers and include damage to industry and the undesirability of unprotected action.
The commission already makes interim orders on a regular basis. However, it only uses this power after conducting a hearing, during which it considers a wide range of evidence and argument, and after considering whether the action is protected action. Again, the government's aim becomes transparent. Removing the requirement to hold a hearing or to form a view about whether the industrial action is protected would expose unionists and employees to financial penalties without an opportunity to be heard. It would also undermine the right of employees to take protected action during an enterprise bargaining period. 
This amendment is like a red rag to a bull. At the first sign of any industrial action from employees, the intimidation machine—militant, anti-unionist employers—will roar into life. Lawyers will be sent into the commission to ask for interim orders to serve on employees and their union. Such an order would be enforceable in the Federal Court and backed by fines. How many times does this government have to go back to the future to find out that the full use of penalties is not the most effective way of conducting the industrial relations system? Instead of leaving the commission to make its decisions free from outside interference and in a measured and professional manner as it has always done, this bill thrusts the government's bias towards employers onto its unwilling shoulders. The end result sees the commission boxed in by an indicative and, may I say, prescriptive time frame and a set of guidelines that force the organisation to become a de facto cheer squad for employers who do not like the idea that their employees may want to stand up for themselves.
The government talks about respecting the umpire and the importance of the Industrial Relations Commission. What this bill really does is strike at the heart of the commission's discretion to make reasoned and considered judgments. The government considers the commission as nothing more than a potential weapon in its unrelenting war on the trade union movement. Looking back on the history of this bill, we see that the government has decided to escalate its campaign. A previous incarnation of this bill explicitly applied to lockouts as well as strikes. The recently departed minister removed any such mention from this legislation and made no mention of this practice in his second reading speech. This is a clear indication of the government's mind-set. Not once does it stop to consider the effects lockouts have on working Australians and their families.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I note that under standing order 187 it quite clearly says, `A senator shall not read a speech.' It seems to me that Senator George Campbell is reading absolutely verbatim a speech from a lectern—word for word, not making any attempt to refer to copious notes or whatever. It is not just something that Senator George Campbell does; it is something that is creeping into the Senate. I genuinely say that if senators are not going to respect that standing order then sadly it may be time for the Senate to reconsider that standing order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I am quite happy to give a copy of my notes—my copious notes, as Senator Ian Campbell has referred to them—to Senator Ian Campbell to compare with the Hansard. He may well see that, whilst I have used quotes from the notes, I have also been using comments all through the speech to point out to the Australian public just how negative and conservative this government is in its approach to dealing with industrial relations.
 (Senator Watson)—Yes, that is a debating point, Senator. Presidents have traditionally ruled that senators are able to use copious notes. You have given an assurance that you are using copious notes and I am sure Senator Ian Campbell will be very happy to receive copies of those copious notes to compare with the Hansard if he wishes to pursue the matter. Apart from that, there is no point of order.
—I would appreciate that, thank you.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. When I was interrupted by the point of order, I was talking about the fact that what this government is seeking to do is essentially hamstring the Industrial Relations Commission in its capacity to act as an independent arbitrator, act as an honest broker in the industrial relations system and ensure in that context that both workers and employers get a fair go from the system and are able to pursue genuinely negotiated agreements between themselves without the direct interference of government in that process. What this government is seeking to do, not only by this bill but by other bills it has introduced, is de facto put its hands up the back of the commission and use the commission as a puppet to deliver its industrial relations agenda. 
The government's industrial relations agenda has always had one particular aim: to destroy the trade union movement. They have made no secret of that. They said when they came to power in 1996 that four unions were their target. Those four unions were the maritime workers, whom they attacked in 1998; the building workers, who have been the subject of a royal commission and the greatest kangaroo court we have ever seen in this country, quite frankly; the metal workers, who presumably may be next on the list after they have gone through that process; and the transport workers. Why are those four unions singled out? Because historically in this country they have been the most effective unions in protecting the interests of their members and in promoting the interests of workers generally in our economy.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Unfortunately Senator George Campbell has now contravened standing order 193(3), which is quite explicit in saying that a senator shall not use offensive words against a judicial officer. I think he should be asked to withdraw references to the judicial officers involved in the royal commission into the building industry, the Cole royal commission, a judicial inquiry involving judicial officers. I think he should also be asked to withdraw any inferences against judicial officers at the Industrial Relations Commission.
—The officers are not executive officers as you are referring to them, Senator Ian Campbell, so there is no point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a further point of order. I think Senator George Campbell is giving an excellent speech.
—What is your point of order?
—I think it does deserve more attention. I hereby call your attention to the state of the chamber.
—There is no point of order but there is not a quorum.
(Quorum formed)
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and thank you to Senator Ian Campbell for providing us with an audience so that I can complete my comments. Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was talking about the fact that from this bill, unlike in other bills and a similar previous bill produced by this government on this issue, this government has deliberately excluded the issue of lockouts. We know how effectively lockouts are used against working Australians to deny them income in an industrial relations environment. Whilst this government considers strike action to be undesirable, it obviously does not consider lockouts by employers in the same category or as constituting strike action. At the first hint of a strike the government's attack dogs are all over the press demanding that industry take the strongest possible action to end the industrial action. However, when workers are locked out or when strike action is taken against workers or employees, it is remarkable how strangely silent this government is in its response to the actions of those employers. We have never heard previous ministers, whether Minister Andrews, Minister Abbott or Minister Reith, commenting on lockouts. Where were they when the recent lockout occurred at Geelong Wool? Where were they when the recent lockout occurred at the ACI Box Hill plant? Strangely silent, strangely not to be found. However, when there is industrial action taken by employees they cannot get into the press quickly enough to condemn it and to condemn their organisation. 
It is just another clear demonstration of the blind ideological intransigence this government has when it is dealing with industrial relations issues. Every piece of legislation it brings into this parliament promotes confrontation and industrial unrest. All of its industrial relations agenda, its industrial relations approach, is predicated on conflict and destroying the other side. There has not been the slightest hint by this coalition or this government to put balance into the industrial relations system and to provide the platform upon which both parties are given a fair go. The government has never had any interest in providing for bargaining in good faith, and certainly nothing in this bill or in other bills that are currently before this chamber goes anywhere near demonstrating that it even understands what bargaining in good faith means.
If one wants to go and look for a classic example, it is the McMahon dispute in Sydney recently where women who had worked for a company for over 20 years without ever taking industrial action were locked out for something like 12 to 14 weeks. The minister eventually got himself cornered where he had to go down to the picket line and grudgingly admit that they were within their rights to do what they were doing, despite the fact that there had been consistent press statements and arguments made by speakers on behalf of this government condemning those workers in taking that industrial action.
—What has happened on the waterfront? There are now 28 containers an hour on the waterfront.
—We hear Senator Ferris chirping away in the background like a budgie. She wouldn't know an industrial relations environment if she fell over it. She has probably never been in a factory in her life.
—I've been to more factories than you, George.
—Certainly she wouldn't know where the arbitration commission was. It would probably do her good, it would expand her knowledge, if she went and sat in the Industrial Relations Commission for a few days or a few hours and actually observed how it works in practice. She might actually get the meaning of good faith bargaining. She might actually get the meaning of balance in industrial relations if she went and observed the system and how it works. 
The reality is that Labor cannot support this bill. Nor can we support this government's destructive agenda. Not only do we not support the bill but in fact we condemn the government for its failure to provide the Industrial Relations Commission, as the independent umpire, with adequate powers to settle industrial disputes and to ensure parties bargain in good faith. We condemn its inflammatory and confrontationist rhetoric during industrial disputes and its threats to withdraw car industry assistance unless employers implement its divisive industrial relations agenda. We all remember the demand it put on the auto industry: if you want the ACIS scheme you have to take a big stick to your employees. That was the proposition that it put on the table in negotiating the future support mechanisms for the auto industry—an absolute shame. It was almost as disgraceful as what Malcolm Fraser did in 1976 when he demanded that workers at Newcastle put up liabilities to get work in the shipbuilding industry so if the ship was delayed for any reason they would be directly subject to penalties for any delay.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-02,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002. This is one of many bills currently before the Senate from this government to make significant changes to the Workplace Relations Act. Despite what the government says, all of these bills have a singular purpose. They are designed to undermine the capacity of workers and the unions to look after the legitimate needs of working Australians. Both this bill and subsequent bills should be rejected in their entirety, and the Greens intend to do that.
This bill seeks to repeal section 127(3) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and to replace it with a harsher and more complex regime. Section 127(3) of the act currently states in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission:
The Commission must hear and determine an application for an order under this section as quickly as practicable.
The government seeks to replace this section with a requirement that applications must be heard within 48 hours, otherwise the employer can seek interim orders on the basis of a set of criteria—and later I will go into the skewed nature of that criteria in favour of the employer's situation. 
The Greens will not accept this legislation. We recognise that there is an imbalance, that the Howard government and some actions of the previous Labor government have skewed the industrial relations system so far in favour of the employer that a change is needed to take us back in a direction where the rights of working men and women are protected by our industrial relations system, rather than the industrial relations system continually being used to create more opportunities for employers to diminish the rights of working men and women in Australia.
The Greens do not support moves through amendments or deals—we saw one last night, and I am not quite sure what we are going to see today—that seek to find a middle ground in relation to the government's industrial relations agenda. This government has skewed the balance so far in favour of the employers that there is a non-existent middle ground that some deals and amendments seek to find to put what it perceives as some balance back into this government's industrial relations agenda. The government's agenda is unambiguous. It cannot be mitigated with minor changes and amendments; it needs to be rejected.
There is a sense of deja vu in many pieces of industrial relations legislation that come before this parliament. We have seen many of the provisions in this bill in particular before. The government tried to enact these kinds of provisions in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs) Bill in 1999, and the Senate at that time rightly rejected the proposals. The government tried again to make similar changes with its Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000, and the Senate again knocked it back. They were rejected and they should be rejected again.
The Australian people do not want the kind of antiworker and anti-union legislation that the Howard government continually proposes. They look to their representatives in the Senate to ensure that their views are listened to, because the Howard government has not listened to the views of the Australian people in relation to industrial relations. The Greens will certainly listen, and we hope that all senators will, in rejecting this consistent agenda of industrial relations reforms from the government. 
Let us make no mistake: this is another of the government's tired attempts to attack workers and unions by enacting biased and draconian industrial relations legislation. It is part of their ideological attack against working people. They are running out of puff and they have run off course, but there is a federal election on the agenda so the Howard government are attempting to ramp up this attack on workers and on industrial relations. We know that recently the Liberal Party wrote to big business across the country warning of the industrial relations agenda of opposition parties and arguing that only a coalition government would defend and institute industrial relations laws that employers could use against employees. At the same time the Liberal Party asked these companies for big corporate donations to their Millennium Forum fund—their election war chest. The government may have the backing of big business when it comes to their crusade against the working men and women of Australia but they certainly do not have the backing of the Greens or any other people on this side of the chamber.
The government has sought in the past to whip up hysteria around these issues in the lead-up to an election. We saw that with the royal commission into the building industry which was instigated just before the last federal election. It did not work and yet the government is still trying to whip up hysteria around this particular issue. To start this first full week of parliament with six industrial relations amendments on the agenda is a clear indication that, in the lead-up to the election, the Howard government is again trying to whip up hysteria around industrial relations. Australians will not fall for it, the Senate will not fall for it and the Greens certainly will not fall for it. It needs to be seen for what it is: an unjustified, electorally motivated attack on Australian workers.
I want to look more closely at the provisions of the bill. This bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act to require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to hear and determine applications for orders under section 127 within 48 hours as far as practicable. It seeks to enable the commission to make an interim order if it is satisfied that the action is unprotected, if it has not formed a view and is unable to determine the application within 48 hours or if the action is likely to commence within 48 hours. It also seeks to amend the act to specify the matters the Australian Industrial Relations Commission must take into account when deciding whether or not to make an interim order.
At the outset let me say that there is clearly no need for this legislation. There is no difficulty, particularly for employers, in being able to seek section 127 orders from the Industrial Relations Commission. Most applications for section 127 orders are made by employers rather than by unions. This is despite the fact that industrial action such as lockouts by employers is on the rise. The University of Sydney looked at Australian Bureau of Statistics data in relation to this issue and concluded that industrial action such as lockouts is on the rise. They concluded that the proportion of industrial disputes which are lockouts is currently five times greater than it was in 1998. Previous changes to the Workplace Relations Act, such as allowing the use of lockouts to pressure employees to sign individual contracts, have facilitated lockouts by employers, so it is not surprising that we are now seeing the results of the Sydney University study saying that lockouts are on the rise. 
Employers will be the ones to benefit from changes to section 127 applications. The provisions contained in this bill have been rejected before, so it is fair that we ask the question: what has changed that the government believes we need to look at this again? Has there been increasing industrial action in this country? Has there been an increasing number of section 127 orders requested of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? The answer to both of these questions is no. There has been no increase in industrial action in Australia. In fact, the opposite has occurred. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of working days lost through industrial disputes continues to decline. In the 12 months to March 1996, 86 working days were lost per 1,000 employees and by March 2003 this fell to 31 days lost per 1000 employees.
Are the number of section 127 orders on the increase? According to uncontested evidence provided by the ACTU to the Senate inquiry into this bill, they are not. The ACTU looked at Industrial Relations Commission decisions over several years and found that 33 orders were issued in the year 2000, 26 in 2001, 35 in 2002 and, at the time of their evidence in September, only 25 in 2003. According to the ACTU's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:
Many are concerned with reaction to employer unilateral action in the workplace, where workers take action on issues like termination or redundancy, roster changes, refusal to reemploy workers after a period on workers' compensation, payment of entitlements, safety and the like.
Issues which affect their daily lives, or those of their fellow workers are likely to be felt deeply in the workplace, and workers often feel that it is only by taking action that they can get attention to the issues from their employer.
In other words, industrial action, whether legally protected or not, is usually a legitimate response to genuine workplace grievances. The figures of declining industrial action and the small number of section 127 orders show how successful the government has already been in removing the rights of workers and undermining unions' ability to represent their members. No change as outlined by the government in this bill is needed. The change that is needed is for workers to be returned their full rights to organise and to strike. The industrial imbalance wreaked by the Howard government needs to be redressed in favour of the working women and men of this country.
I want to look now at the requirement in this bill to hold a hearing within 48 hours and whether this is necessary. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission's annual report for 2002-03 shows that 85 per cent of section 127 applications are first heard within four days. According to people who regularly appear before the commission, a large proportion of these are heard within a day or two days. This is down from 2000-01, when 85 per cent of the first hearings were held within five days. The commission already endeavours to hold hearings as quick as possible, as it is required to do in the act. Section 127(3) of the act already requires the Industrial Relations Commission to hear and determine section 127 applications as soon as practicable.
If the government is really that concerned about increasing the speed with which applications get to a hearing, it should be increasing the resources of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—not forcing through an unrealistic and unnecessary requirement of 48 hours. Hamstringing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with a 48-hour requirement will only undermine the effectiveness of the Industrial Relations Commission in resolving disputes by removing its discretion to prioritise its work and to address applications in the most appropriate manner in each circumstance. 
It is when we look at the proposal for interim orders in this bill that the Howard government's industrial relations agenda becomes clear. Changes to the act would effectively enable employers to seek an order immediately ending strike action or other industrial action before an adequate airing of the facts and reasons for the dispute has taken place. Employers would use this legislation to attack the right of workers to strike by obtaining interim injunctions and avoiding having to address the issues at the heart of the dispute. Section 127(3A) would allow the commission to make an order for industrial action to stop or not occur even if it had not yet formed a view on whether the action was protected and that an application cannot be heard within 48 hours.
The unbalanced criteria in this bill that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would have to give consideration to when deciding to make an interim order favours employers and enables them to obtain immediate orders against their workers. Section 127(3C) would mean an employer could argue industrial action should stop if, for example, industrial action might damage their industry and the action was ongoing or a sequence of action.
Workers do not take industrial action because they think it will help the employer's bottom line. In fact, that is the very point of taking industrial action—so that issues raised in a dispute are resolved in the heat of industrial action. Sections 127(3A) and (3C) would enable employers to stop industrial action before having a full hearing on all the relevant matters related to the application and would undermine workers' capacity to effectively ensure the problem that caused the industrial action is addressed. Employers would be quite happy to discuss the issues under dispute forever as long as the industrial action is called off.
Employers will always try to get legal weapons to use against their work force, but this does not mean the government or the Senate should support them in doing so. The agenda of this government, backed by big business, has already divided this country and entrenched inequality. Precarious and casual work is expanding while employment security and full-time work is declining. People are working harder for less as government services in the form of health and education services are starved of funds and decline in quality. Meanwhile, we see executive salaries skyrocketing and big business profits increasing.
The Greens recognise that we need to turn this around. Rejecting this legislation and the government's ongoing campaign to increase industrial relations powers for employers is a significant first step in turning this around. We need a decent and fair industrial relations system that is centred on conciliation and arbitration—not the division and conflict that is becoming the signature of the Howard government. The Greens are the only party in this parliament that unequivocally support workers' right to strike in our party policy platform. The withdrawal of one's labour in protest is a fundamental human right. The Greens are proud of their support of workers' rights and proud to have a policy that supports the rights of unions and unionists to take industrial action to protect and promote their legitimate industrial interests without legal impediment.
The lack of necessity for this bill reveals the government's real agenda in putting it forward. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission already has the capacity to make orders promptly and, if appropriate, to make interim orders. This bill is not about enabling the Industrial Relations Commission to work more effectively; rather, it is about removing its discretion and forcing it down a route favourable to employers at the expense of employees. The Australian Greens reject this bill. We see this, like so many attacks from the Howard government, as an attack on the rights of working women and men. It tips the scales of our industrial relations system even further in favour of employers. The Greens will not stand by and watch this happen. We will be opposing this bill. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVED REMEDIES FOR UNPROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-02,"—I remind the Senate that we are debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002. In other words, we are dealing with activities which are deemed to be illegal. What we have just heard from the previous speaker is that the Australian `Extremes' do not believe that there is such a thing as an illegal strike. We believe that there is. As a result, if a strike or industrial action is illegal then certain consequences need to flow.
This bill will strengthen the legislative intent of section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Section 127 gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to order a return to work when unprotected and illegitimate industrial action is taking place. The bill will enhance this remedy by giving the commission another tool, interim orders, and by guiding the commission's discretion. The bill will provide that the commission should deal with applications for orders to prevent unprotected industrial action within 48 hours. The bill will provide an express power to issue interim orders where a final decision is not possible within this ideal time frame. Interim orders would be made in accordance with guiding factors contained in the bill. Interim orders will provide a very useful short-term stopgap measure while the commission properly considers the application. The bill will provide factors for the commission to take into account in considering whether to make interim or final section 127 orders.
Senator Collins said that the effect of the bill would be that the consideration of the effect of a dispute on an employer would become paramount. Senator Buckland said that the government is hoping to stack the odds in favour of the employers. This is not the case. The same rules will apply whether a section 127 order is sought by an employer, an employee or a union. There is no uncertainty about that. The same rules will apply—
—Why did you exclude lockouts?
—Senator George Campbell, who has, according to former Prime Minister Paul Keating, 100,000 jobs around his neck because of his outrageous industrial disputations whilst he was a union leader, is of course interjecting. He does not want to be reminded of the fact that there were 100,000 Australians without a job who were unable to feed their families because of the sort of industrial thuggery that Senator Campbell personally undertook whilst he was a trade union leader. Then, of course, the Labor Party rewards that sort of thuggery by making him a senator and putting him on the front bench.
We make no apology for the fact that we believe there are such things as illegal industrial activities, illegal strikes and illegal lockouts. That is why under section 127 an order can be sought by an employer—let me make it very clear—an employee or even, as Senator Campbell will be very happy to hear, a union. What can be fairer than that? Certain ex-trade unionists in this place want everything to go in a particular direction. There is no inherent bias in the factors for the commission to consider when determining section 127 matters. They are factors that have previously arisen in section 127 cases and they are consistent with matters the commission already takes into account. Rather than restrict the commission's discretion, the bill will give the commission a clear additional option when considering section 127 applications—that is, the option of making interim orders where the complexity of the case prevents a quick final decision. The bill emphasises the undesirability of unprotected action. The bill would reinforce the integrity of the agreement-making system. 
Senator Collins said that the commission should be given power to settle disputes because that is what the commission was designed to do in 1904—some 100 years ago. A workplace relations solution that was appropriate in 1904 is not necessarily appropriate in 2004. This government has delivered a modern and effective workplace relations system for the 21st century that emphasises the importance of agreement in the workplace. It was interesting to listen to Senator Nettle's contribution. She recognised that over the past eight years, during which this country has been under the stewardship of the Howard Liberal coalition government, industrial disputations have gone down.
Increasing the arbitral role of the commission would not be consistent with the system. Certified agreements already contain dispute resolution processes that suit the parties' situation. This should be the way that parties resolve their disputes. Parties can and often do choose to give the commission a key role in resolving the matter. In any event, resorting to industrial action is not appropriate. The commission has sufficient powers to deal with disputes consistent with a workplace relations framework that is focused on the direct negotiation of terms and conditions of employment by the parties involved, with as little third party intervention as possible. The government's proposed amendments to section 127 are consistent with this broad objective.
It is important to remember that this bill should not detract from the significant legal immunity granted to protected industrial action. Legitimate industrial action taken during the bargaining process will continue to be protected action. The measures will only affect industrial action that is taken outside the legitimate bargaining process. The bill does not explicitly apply to lockouts. Senator Campbell's argument, which we heard in his interjections, is that the government system causes lockouts. The bill does not specifically mention lockouts, that is true, but what this ex-trade unionist fails to tell the Australian people is that the bill does not specifically mention strikes either. Of course, that is where all the rhetoric of Senators Campbell and Nettle becomes unravelled. It sounds very good to ask, `Why don't you mention lockouts?' but the fact is that we do not mention strikes either. All we talk about is unprotected action, and that is why it applies equally to the employer and the employee—and, of course, unions have a right to become involved in the process. The bill refers to industrial action and that means it will apply to all unprotected industrial action, whether unprotected strikes by employees or unprotected lockouts by employers. That is the case that needs to be made, given the misrepresentations made by Senators Nettle and Campbell earlier in this debate.
Earlier today I was walking in the corridors and came across my good friend and colleague Senator Rod Kemp, the Minister for the Arts and Sport. He provided me with a badge to recognise National Jockey Celebration Day, which is on 13 March. To those of them in Parliament House, I wish them well and all the best in their endeavours. It made me think of the trifecta, and I suppose it is every jockey's desire to win a few races. For those who put money on races—and I am not one of them, I must confess—I understand that to win the trifecta is something pretty special. I think the Howard government have in fact won the trifecta in relation to employment in this country. We have reduced unemployment. More and more Australian men and women are in jobs because of our policies. Unlike the situation under the Hawke-Keating government, under the Howard government real wages have increased above and beyond the rate of inflation. We have done that in a low inflationary environment. To achieve those three factors, I think, is like winning the trifecta, because it is great for our economy, it is great for the mums and dads of Australia and it is great for social unity within Australia. What the Australian Labor Party and the extreme elements that are represented by the Australian Greens cannot understand, cannot comprehend or do not want to admit is that our sound economic policy has delivered this country a low inflationary environment where real wages have in fact increased and unemployment has come down to historically low levels. Indeed, if you were to win four races that would be a quadrella, I think, and we also have, in this total context, the lowest rate of industrial disputation since records were kept, beginning in the 1940s. 
Those who assert that they look after the interests of workers are confronted with a government that actually does look after the interests of workers. Having been in government now for eight years, we have seen the unemployment rate come down, the industrial disputation rate come down, real wages increase and a low inflationary environment. That is the record of this government and we will continue to seek to reform the economic infrastructure of this country. We will seek to reform the industrial relations infrastructure of this country to ensure that these wonderful achievements continue to be built on. We are not happy that the unemployment rate is down to 5.6 per cent or thereabouts; we believe it should be driven down even further. So we want to achieve more for the workers of this country. We are not happy with the high inflation rates that the Labor Party presided over. We are not happy with the high unemployment rates that the Labor Party presided over. That is why we have taken the tough decisions in industrial relations and tax reform—you name it. We have taken the tough decisions, but we have taken them in a fair and even-handed way, as is shown by this legislation. It does not refer to lockouts. It does not refer to strikes. It simply refers to unprotected industrial action, and of course that applies equally to the employer and employee side of the equation.
I understand the Australian Democrats may have an amendment to move in the committee stage, and we as a government are of a mind to support that. I thank senators for their contributions in this debate and urge the passage of this bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-02,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003 is much akin to the other bills we have dealt with this week. In fact, one thinks of Senator Abetz's trifecta when one considers this bill. The extent to which the government are prepared to relinquish what they are seeking to pursue in order to allow some matters to pass the Senate makes one ponder why we are exercising so much time on some of these bills. One obvious reason is that the government's lack of preparedness in their business agenda is bringing forward bills of lesser priority that have been sitting on the Notice Paper for quite some time. The government have decided to progress what Senator Abetz referred to a moment ago as begrudging small changes that the Senate has allowed through. Senator Abetz may indeed get his trifecta, but the real content of them is very far from the government's real agenda. But let us deal with this bill as it stands. 
The stated aim of this bill is to amend section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act and to codify the contempt provisions as they apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, but there are already provisions in the Workplace Relations Act which, in conjunction with the common law, ensure that any contempt of the commission is an offence and is subject to penalties. This is in existing section 299. The former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, acknowledged this when he said, `There is a law prohibiting contempt of the Industrial Relations Commission.' These were the member for Warringah's own words in an interview in a publication called Human Capital Australia, published in March last year. That the then minister could be acknowledging this but at the same time pursuing this type of legislation again makes one wonder about its worth.
In Labor's view the Senate should not pass unnecessary legislation that has been introduced merely to progress an ideological agenda. There is no demonstrated or practical need for this bill. In light of the lack of policy basis for this bill, it seems clear that the real aim of the bill is to find another avenue for the government to spout anti-union rhetoric, some of which we have been hearing yet again from the minister today. This is most evident in the provisions of this bill that would have the effect of jailing participants in industrial action. As was noted at the Senate inquiry, threatening to imprison people because of their industrial activity is hardly the path to a cooperative industrial relations system. In the minority report of that inquiry we make precisely that point. What is wrong with this bill is that it uses imprisonment as a primary remedy for the taking of industrial action. Anyone who has any conception about how these things should operate would understand that a primary remedy of imprisonment is hardly appropriate.
Let us look at the government's reasons for the bill. The stated reasons for this bill do not stand up to scrutiny. The explanatory memorandum suggests that we need this bill because of a 1987 Law Reform Commission report. However, the Law Reform Commission report did not recommend the introduction of the disobedience contempt that is proposed in this bill, and the contempt provisions in the industrial relations legislation in 1987 are not the same as the ones in section 299 today. They were substantially added to and changed in 1993 following the High Court case of Nationwide News v. Wills. For this government to prop up its case, it is going back to a 1987 Law Reform Commission report and takes no account of the changes that have occurred subsequently to deal with these issues.
Since the changes in 1993, no actions—and I stress no actions—have been brought under section 299. Not one witness to the Senate's inquiry into this bill presented any evidence of the use of section 299. The only group that raised concerns about the operation of the current provisions was the Australian Industry Group. But the Australian Industry Group claims that there were delays in enforcing orders in the court which, even if valid, were not addressed by this bill. So it would be absurd for the government to suggest that actions have been brought and failed because of some problem with the current legislative provisions when in fact they are just not used at all. Instead there is one reason and one reason only for this bill: the consistent theme of the Prime Minister liking provocative, conflict-driven workplace relations bills. Even if there is not a problem that needs fixing, the government continues to bowl up legislation like this, which leads us to Senator Abetz's trifecta we have today. 
The Prime Minister continues to use bills such as this one to pursue his anti-union zealotry. He proudly told the Business Council of Australia in October last year that one of his greatest achievements was the de-unionisation of Australia's work force. We are talking not about industrial disputation but about de-unionisation as his objective. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister must not realise that even in the face of anti-union legislation like this bill and many before it there are still 1.8 million proud union members in this country.
Bills such as this one and several others that have been debated in the chamber in past weeks, and will be debated this week and in future weeks by this government, are aimed squarely at reducing the bargaining rights of working Australians and the capacity of their unions to represent them. The point of difference here is that the government argues that it is implementing a bargaining system. Yet it continues to find way after way, means after means to tie workers' hands behind their backs when they need to bargain. This government, going back to 1996, has never acknowledged that there is an unequal bargaining relationship between worker and employer. The only area where the government seeks to address that relationship is where the worker, through the characteristics of the industry, the sector or the time in which they are operating, has a glimpse of the industrial power that can address the imbalance in the relationship between the worker and their employer. It is then that we get the government wanting specific measures for the maritime dispute. It is then that we get the government wanting specific measures for the construction industry. It is then that the government wants to intervene and interfere. But it does not interfere when it needs to deal with the fundamental issue of having an adequate and fair bargaining system—that is, to understand and acknowledge that there will be a power imbalance between the employer and the worker and that the system should deal with that.
Many provisions in these bills may not be needed and they may never become law, but the Prime Minister is insisting that they continue to be bowled up. Almost none of the government's workplace relations bills have passed the Senate and those that have have been severely modified to contain the agenda that this government keeps promoting. Why have these bills not passed the Senate? Because they are poorly conceived and poorly developed. For those very strong reasons we will continue to oppose such legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CODIFYING CONTEMPT OFFENCES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-02,"—I rise to speak to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003. According to the government, the aim of the bill is to modernise certain offences that relate to the proceedings of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to enhance certainty about, and accessibility of, criminal law that operates to protect the integrity of the commission's proceedings. The Democrats strongly believe that the rule of law must apply in Australia. If the law is being flouted we support stronger law, but increased powers are only justified where there is sufficient evidence that a real and significant problem exists. I might say that if a law is being flouted it is often not necessary to introduce stronger laws; it is necessary to enforce existing laws with the right resources and the right inspectorates and the right regulators to do so. 
The government argues that this bill's codification of the general contempt provision implements the approach recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on contempt. It argues that the recommendations included that `deemed contempt' provisions like the current section 299(1)(e) should be replaced with specific statutory offences that identify contemptuous conduct. However, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, the ACTU argued that there is no indication that section 299 has ever been intended to include failure to comply with a court order or undertaking given to a court, which is disobedience contempt. The ACTU argued that there was nothing in the Australian Law Reform Commission report way back then which gave support to creating additional offences relating to contempt where these are already the subject of a specific statutory offence.
The ACTU further argued that, while recommending that deeming provisions should be removed, the Law Reform Commission specifically recommended:
No new offence covering false allegations of misconduct against tribunal or commission members for non-compliance with orders should be created unless there is a specific need for it to protect a particular tribunal or commission.
The ACTU correctly noted that the inquiry did not have evidence that there was specific need for a new offence. What we have actually seen with this bill and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003, possibly to be discussed later this week, is evidence for an independent national workplace relations regulator, not new laws. What we have seen is a need for existing laws to be enforced.
Section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act, `Imposition and recovery of penalties', already provides for a general offence of failing to comply with the terms of an order. A number of people can sue for a penalty for a breach of an order of the commission. They are an inspector, a party to the order, an employer who is a member of an organisation and is affected by the breach, and an organisation or an officer or employee of an organisation that is affected by the breach. We all know that `organisation' means registered organisations under the act. Section 356 of the Workplace Relations Act provides that a monetary penalty imposed under the act may be paid into consolidated revenue or to a particular person or organisation. The court will often direct that the penalty it has imposed be paid to the applicant, with reference to the applicant's costs and expenses in bringing the proceedings.
However, I understand that two problems exist. The first is that it can be costly for an employer and the employer organisation to pursue such cases, especially given that fines are paid into consolidated revenue. Secondly, once disputes have been settled, employers are reluctant to pursue offenders for fear of creating disharmony and further disputes. I do not think that those fears should be lightly dismissed. Like the ACCC and ASIC, an independent national workplace relations regulator would be responsible for pursuing such breaches. The minister, in a press release on 19 December 2002, referred to a list of 22 breaches of industrial court orders—including alleged breaches—since 1999 by four unions. This amounts to approximately five or six breaches a year. I understand that three of those cases, through the use of section 178, actually resulted in significant pecuniary penalties. 
I found the following extract from the Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution's prosecution policy interesting:
Sir Hartley Shawcross QC, then Attorney-General, stated to the House of Commons [in the United Kingdom] on 29 January 1951:
“It has never been the rule in this country—I hope it never will be—that suspected criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution. Indeed the very first Regulations under which the Director of Public Prosecutions worked provided that he should ... prosecute `whenever it appears that the offence or the circumstances of its commission is or are of such a nature that a prosecution in respect thereof is required in the public interest.' That is still the dominant consideration.”
This statement is equally applicable to the position in Australia. The resources available for prosecution action are finite and should not be wasted pursuing inappropriate cases, a corollary of which is that the available resources are employed to pursue with some vigour those cases worthy of prosecution.
Further, in Australian Paper Ltd v. Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia 1998, North J. in the Federal Court commented on the nature of the court's power to issue injunctions to restrain breaches of section 127. His Honour stated that, although a Federal Court injunction often operates to enforce a section 127 order, the power to issue such an injunction is an independent power with particular ramifications, and the court will not automatically issue such injunctions just because there has been a breach of a section 127 order. Breach of the court's order could result in a fine, sequestration or imprisonment, and it was important for the court to keep this in mind when considering whether to issue an injunction.
It seems that the government is trying to enforce an ideology of 100 per cent compliance that is just not supported by the tradition of common law, by the commission or by the courts. I should also note that the ideology of 100 per cent compliance on behalf of the government is, it seems, pursued primarily in terms of unions, not primarily in terms of employers—and I am referring to the construction industry specifically—where we have seen little effort made to address what we are told is massive undercompliance with awards. Of course, it is hard to know or be sure of the scale of this noncompliance but, if we just look at some of the evidence presented by unions at the Senate inquiry into the building and construction industry of the millions of dollars that they have recovered in underpayment of wages, we can assume that noncompliance is occurring without penalty. This is an important point. Some of the position taking in the parliament is very much political and dedicated to achieving a particular political perception, but the general view is that this government is not union friendly and is very employer friendly. Whether that is accurate or not, the government needs to be aware of that perception and therefore needs to attend with as much rigour and vigour employer noncompliance as employee noncompliance. It is just a question of being balanced and even-handed.
I do not want to get too far off track. Clearly, section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act addresses the problem of breach of commission orders and could be enhanced by a national workplace relations regulator. In addition, it is critical to note that section 178 is a civil offence and that the proposed new provision in this bill would create a criminal offence resulting in 12 months imprisonment. It is important to point out that the commission orders not only are orders that can be enforced by courts but also can be fairly minor and deal with procedural and administrative matters. That has been a matter of concern in the committee deliberations. 
With respect to the proposed new provision to make publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission a criminal offence, given the history of section 299 I have some doubts about its prospective usefulness. The Bills Digest notes that section 299 was amended in 1993, in the predecessor act, following a finding that a previous paragraph, which made it an offence to use words `calculated to bring a member of the Commission or the Commission itself into disrepute', was invalid. That case was about whether the section covered too much, such as a genuine exercise of a right of criticism. I suspect the current provision would face a similar problem. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in their submission to the inquiry into this bill, have argued that maintaining confidence in the commission must be balanced with freedom of expression, public accountability and open justice. Those were very good opinions for them to put on the record. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry sought a qualification to the proposed amendment that a person `held a genuine belief that was based on reasonable grounds that misconduct has occurred'. I think we would find that anyone could argue that they held a `genuine belief' and therefore the provision would become redundant.
Of greatest concern for me was the fact that evidence presented at the inquiry found that section 299(1)(e) has never been used in prosecution. In fact, a search of the DPP database revealed no cases where action was brought under section 299. Further, there has been no evidence nor call from the AIRC that a new offence of disobeying an order is required. Of further concern is that the current section 299(l)(e) under discussion is based on the same provision then and now applying to tribunals under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The government has not seen fit to change the contempt provisions applying to these tribunals. I think that is an important point. Where governments take a view as to what needs to be changed, generally speaking they make those changes across the whole of government and not just in one particular area of law.
I note the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, in their submission to this bills inquiry, state that when the opportunity arises such provisions in other Commonwealth legislation will be drafted in a similar way to those being proposed in this bill. So perhaps the government is contemplating that avenue. Might I be so bold as to suggest that the government create the opportunities to amend all legislation and that, if the government were serious about redrafting the general contempt provisions to enhance certainty and accessibility of the criminal law to protect commission and tribunal proceedings, it would be simultaneously trying to amend all acts with this provision, based on a thorough review and the recommended wording which I think would be drafted by the Attorney-General's Department. 
The Democrats would definitely feel more confident in supporting more specifically defined contempt provisions, if the process I suggested above were undertaken. At the moment it appears that the two new suggested provisions are there to deal with matters concerning the government with respect to industrial relations and union behaviour. For example, there is no new provision to deal with dishonest conduct, conspiracy to defraud and bribery of Commonwealth public officials, which are also contempt provisions under the Criminal Code.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-02,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. It is nice of him to join us. Does the minister agree with the conclusion of the joint intelligence committee that pre-emptive military action is:
... only sanctioned under international law where the danger is immediate, so the immediacy of the threat was crucial to the argument. The existence of programs alone does not meet that threshold.
Is the minister aware that, of the 19 separate ONA or DIO intelligence assessments outlined at paragraphs 4.80 and 4.81, not one appears to advance the view that weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq in sufficient quantities to pose a clear and immediate danger warranting pre-emptive action? Prior to the commencement of military action inside Iraq, did the Howard government receive any credible evidence from the Australian intelligence community that Iraq's WMDs posed a clear and immediate threat? If not, why did Australia support pre-emptive action?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-02,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. What action does the government propose to take to clarify with our allies, particularly the United States of America, just what circumstances will dictate whether Australia supports pre-emptive military action in the future? To be precise, will Australia only join in such action where there is clear intelligence advice about the immediate nature of threat as defined by the United Nations?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-02,"—I answered that question yesterday. Obviously Senator Faulkner was not listening so I will go through it all again.
—It wasn't the one that was asked.
—Yes, it was asked. It was in a slightly different form but basically the same question was asked. The Australian government did not rely on self-defence in terms of the UN charter to justify joining the coalition of the willing. The Australian government relied on the terms of UN Security Council resolutions, which are the alternative way of legitimately participating in such an action. The Australian government relied upon the resolutions of the Security Council that indicated that Saddam Hussein had failed to disarm in terms of previous resolutions and therefore was in breach of those resolutions and, to paraphrase the expression, would suffer the consequences if he did not comply. So Senator Faulkner is making a fundamental error when he looks at the basis of the justification.
If the government had relied on self-defence and, in terms of Senator Faulkner's claim, taken pre-emptive action, then it would have had to show that there was sufficient immediacy. The argument as to what amounts to sufficient immediacy is part of an interesting international legal debate in terms of terrorism and threats associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, because the doctrine was developed when those particular types of threats were not under consideration and when there was a much longer period of build-up before a time of conflict. I am sorry that Senator Faulkner does not understand these things. I tried to help him in that regard yesterday, but if he wants to resort to the international law text I think he will find that I am right.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-02,"—We have never sought to define pre-emptive action other than in terms of self-defence. There are certain requirements that are necessary therefore to meet the criteria for self-defence, and some immediacy is one of those. We are not in dispute on the question of principle; the problem is that the legal basis for Australia's action against Iraq is not the legal basis to which Senator Faulkner is referring.

Minister, can you confirm as correct a report on ABC radio this morning that twice in the last week of negotiations in Washington Australia's top trade negotiators told the Minister for Trade that he `would damage Australia's long-term agricultural objectives, damage Australia's long-term stand in the WTO and your leadership of the Cairns Group', if the government signed such a poor trade deal with the US?

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-03-02,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-02,"—That certainly does not sound right to me, because what has been achieved by Mr Vaile through his negotiation, with the help of the trade officials to which Senator Conroy refers, is a very good deal for Australia. It is an opportunity for further access to the largest market and economy in the world, and for Australia as a trade nation that has to be a very good outcome. The challenge now, of course, is to turn the opportunity into material benefit. That will be the challenge before the Australian business community.
In terms of a government responsibility to provide that access, this government can be very proud of its achievements. It can look to the new opportunities that it has provided through a free trade arrangement with Singapore, the new opportunities through a free trade arrangement with Thailand and now huge new opportunities through this agreement with the United States. What was the alternative of Labor? `Multilateral or nothing' was the cry of Labor and they are still saying it. Senator Cook, from the back bench now, continues to say it. He is the last adherent of putting all the eggs in the one basket. `Multilateral: take the benefits on the global scene or do not take any benefit at all.' 
This government has a different approach. It wants to take the benefits of both methodologies. If we can get increased access through the multilateral round, we will do so; if we can do it bilaterally, we will do that as well. I know it is a harder task and it is more work, but Mr Vaile has been prepared to take up that challenge and has achieved a very fine outcome for Australia. The responsibility now, I would respectfully suggest, is for the parliament to as quickly as possible pass the enabling legislation, enable the agreement to be brought into effect as quickly as possible and get the benefits and opportunities flowing to Australian business.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-03-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States of America.
Once again we saw today this government not wanting to face up to or admit what it has actually done. It continues to try to misrepresent Labor's position. It continues in the other place; it continues here. Labor have consistently said that we will examine this deal, that we will examine the detail and that we will use the Senate select committee which we have established to look at it. We are not just going to roll it through the Senate as Senator Hill would like us to do. The US Congress gets a minimum of three months to examine the deal but Senator Hill would be happy if we just rolled it on through the chamber, therefore having no chance to examine the detail. Labor have said, `If it's a good deal, we will support it; if it's a bad deal and it undermines the PBS then we will vote it down.' Labor have taken a very consistent position on that.
I want to address another piece of hyperbole by Senator Hill and Senator `Big Bucks' Macdonald—`It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'. How many times have you heard `it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'? Let us just run through the record. In the past 20 years, on at least three occasions Australian governments have had discussions with US governments. In 1985 the US government approached the Hawke government to talk about a free trade agreement and it was decided that it was not in Australia's interests then. George Bush Sr announced in his campaign speeches that he would pursue bilateral deals, including with Australia. In the event, he pushed ahead with the Uruguay Round and NAFTA. So George Bush Sr offered us a deal. And again in 1999 the Clinton administration raised the possibility of a trade deal with the Howard government. So let us stop with this pretence that is a once-in-a-lifetime unique opportunity and that only the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, could get a deal out of the US for us. Let us just put it away and start looking at the facts. When we finally get the text released—hopefully today or overnight—we can put that to bed. On all of the previous occasions Australia did not proceed with the US FTA because it was not considered to be maximising Australia's opportunity. It is a fiction that this government continues to maintain that it is a free trade agreement. As the NFF president, Peter Corish, said in a letter to the editor of the Australian on 13 February: 
This is not a free trade agreement and it fails to secure open access for Australian agriculture, but it offers improvement in access for some farm products.
So there it is: `not a free trade agreement'. That was from one of the doyens of the organisations that campaigned for free trade in the world—the NFF.
As reported on the Australian on 25 February, it is now becoming clear—as the information is slowly seeping out about what happened in Washington in those last couple of weeks—that Australia's senior trade officials, the hard-nosed negotiators, recommended the deal not be signed. That is right; they said: `This deal is not good enough. This deal will damage us in the WTO; it will damage our leadership of the Cairns Group.' Australia has been the third force in world agricultural politics and world trade politics because of our leadership of the Cairns Group. What this deal does—and Mr Vaile did not deny it this morning—is damage Australia's position. When we go to Japan and say, `Open up your rice market!' they will say, `Yeah, just like you got the US to open up its sugar market.' When we go to the EU and say, `Open up your dairy market!' they will say, `Yeah, just like you got the US to open up the sugar market.' This is a deal which does not deliver free trade in agriculture so let us stop the pretence—
—What do you know about it?
—We can hear the banshees on the other side! Let us stop the pretence that this is a deal that delivers free trade and simply have a look at the facts and use the Senate inquiry to get some information. Instead of baying from the other side of the chamber, Senator Ferris, you will get an opportunity to examine the facts. You will actually finally have the chance to read the document.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-02,"—The trouble with Senator Conroy is that he cannot figure out whether he is a rooster or a dog. One day he is a rooster trainspotting at Sydney airport, plotting the re-emergence of the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, as the leader—
—Trainspotting—at the airport?
—Okay, planespotting. There is a train at Sydney airport, thank God. The next day he is being a dog in the manger on policy. The reality for Australia is that the FTA, the free trade agreement with the United States, is an absolutely outstanding and historic opportunity to increase trade—to increase the sale of goods and services to the biggest and most successful free enterprise economy in the history of mankind. Ninety-seven per cent of non-agricultural exports to the United States, which excludes textiles and clothing, worth $6.48 billion will be duty free from the first day of the agreement. A significant number of important agricultural products will be free of tariffs. Those that are not totally free of tariffs will be phased down—some, no doubt, at rates that we would have preferred to be shorter. There is no doubt that we would have liked to have got a better deal on beef. But for many other industries—very important industries with huge potential for Australia—the access to that massive market is a phenomenal result. 
I happen to think that many Australians sitting in their homes or going through their supermarkets are yet to understand the absolute opportunity that this agreement can deliver to this country. The dog in the manger approach of the opposition—the `because we did not do it we are not going to let you have it' approach—is one that will be seen for what it is in the fullness of time as Australians begin to understand that the opportunity of opening up the market in the United States to our goods and services is just so good. It says to those parents who are taking their children along to grade 1 classes for the first time this year or to preschool or into high school that the economic and job opportunities for Australia are just phenomenal. For the mums and dads of Australia it means that there are more jobs. Just in your home state of South Australia, Senator Chapman, you have the Port Lincoln tuna cannery.
—You are stealing my thunder!
—I will let you expand on that. I will move to an area that I know a little bit more about—that is, the financial services marketplace. There has been virtually no attention paid to the tremendous gains this agreement, which was signed by the trade minister a few days ago in Washington, will achieve in financial services. When I was in that portfolio a few months ago I pushed very strongly for an Asia-Pacific free economic financial marketplace. In my speeches about the APFM, I said that the US FTA would provide a huge springboard to create a free market in financial services in our region and across the Pacific with the US. Countries could bring their corporate governance, corporate regulation and financial sector management regimes in line to bolt on economies such as Hong Kong, China, Korea and Indonesia to a free market in financial services, which would be of enormous benefit to Australia.
After watching the negotiations from the sidelines and keeping a close watch on the financial services side of the negotiations, my view is that what was achieved by Minister Vaile was far and away above the expectations that I had for financial services. Those who understand how closely kept the US financial services market is and how closely they like their own rules—for example, their accounting rules and US GAP—would know that what this incredible liberalisation to financial services means for Australian firms seeking to raise capital is just phenomenal. That area is yet to be focused on. It holds great hope. It would be a very sad day if the Australian Labor Party took their dog in the manger attitude all the way to the vote on this. I hope wiser minds, like Senator Peter Cook, who looks like he is about to leap to his feet and make a speech, overcome the eager young pups and roosters and ensure that the FTA does go through and that Australia can benefit from these enormous opportunities.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2004-03-02,"—I wish the government would not praise me. It does me no good on my side to be praised by Senator Ian Campbell. Three weeks ago Mark Vaile, the Australian Minister for Trade, told the National Press Club that the government itself is guilty of overselling the US free trade agreement, and that is true. A lot of nonsense has been said about the free trade agreement. We have just heard some now from Senator Ian Campbell. This thing is being sold as if it were the secret elixir for everything. It is not. In fact, on what we know—and we have not yet seen the text some three weeks after it has been negotiated—it is certainly a dud deal.
Australian trade officials, it was reported this week, advised the government not to accept the package. They did so because of concerns about agriculture. That is entirely understandable. The agricultural liberalisation elements of this package are at best pathetic. They are certainly miniscule. We know that they were overruled by the government because the government wants a deal. It wants a deal at any price and it wants a deal now. It insisted on having these negotiations conclude at this time when Australia was in the weakest bargaining position it would be in by virtue of the US presidential campaign and when the President of the United States had the smallest amount of latitude conceivable to make any concessions to Australia. 
As we watch the unfolding of the US presidential campaign and the vying for the Democrat party nomination, trade protection has become an issue in the United States. We know that some of the key seats—particularly Florida, Minnesota and other seats where sugar is a major industry—are swing seats in this year's presidential election. We know that at this moment the US President has virtually no latitude for making a trade concession that he may believe in. He has no latitude for political reasons. Therefore, he will not make the concession. We know that our Prime Minister, John Howard, agreed with the US President to complete these negotiations now, at the weakest possible time for Australia to succeed. This is a dud deal because John Howard wanted the negotiations completed when we had no leverage, when we had no bargaining power and when the political climate in the United States conspired against us to prevent the United States making any concessions that they may have believed in.
Therefore, this deal has to be hung around his neck. Every farmer, every fisherman and every small business man in this country who has missed out can blame the Prime Minister of Australia and his electoral vanity for it. Do not take my word for it. The respected Nelson Report, a newsletter on trade matters in the United States, says:
What no one expected was that Howard would direct his negotiators to accept the U.S. hard line on sugar, and to swallow very tiny U.S. concessions on beef and dairy.
That is American commentators talking to the American public about the quality of the deal. Let us go to a few other quotes. Mr Sherman Katz, an international business expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in the United States, said:
... the just concluded U.S.-Australia FTA is so riddled with major exceptions to protect U.S. agriculture that it sends a gloomy signal about U.S. capacity to open our markets.
He is saying that the US made these exceptions because, whatever happened, they were going to protect their agricultural industry at this time. I will go further and read you a quote from Mr Dennis Olson of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in the key politically sensitive state of Minnesota. He said:
The Bush administration is worried about losing states, like Florida and Minnesota ... which are key swing states in the upcoming election. So, based purely on politics, they were unwilling to open the sugar market up. It's a big issue here. That's an example of the hypocrisy the U.S. trade and agricultural policy (follows). It's `do what I say not what I do.'
By insisting that these negotiations conclude now, the Prime Minister guaranteed two things: a dud deal for Australia and a `peace in our time' type paper he can wave around, pretending he has done a good deal for the Australian electorate. He hopes to gull everyone into believing it is a good deal and to try to roll this through without proper scrutiny. I can say this: the Senate will provide the scrutiny.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2004-03-02,"—It ill behoves the Labor Party, in the persons of Senator Conroy and Senator Cook, whose remarks we have just heard, to come in here and, as Senator Conroy did, condemn the government for being guilty of `hyper bowl'. I think he has got his games mixed up. I think he might have been referring to the Super Bowl. If anyone is guilty of hyperbole, it is the Labor Party in the remarks we have just heard from Senators Cook and Conroy about the free trade deal. Apart from the Labor Party, everyone else—the industry sector and the community generally—has hailed this as an exceptionally good deal that the government has achieved in negotiations with the United States government. 
The Labor Party's opposition to this deal, which they continue to express, shows how far backwards the Labor Party have gone in the last 20 years. Twenty years ago, or thereabouts, Alan Oxley was a senior adviser to ministers in a previous Labor government and was subsequently the Australian Ambassador to the GATT. What has he said about the free trade agreement? A former Labor ministerial adviser, he said:
... the impact of this FTA will be historic.
...	...	...
At first glance, it's about expanding trade and investment with the US. But it will also underpin Australia's economic security for the next half century.
—He's just a sell-out.
—Anyone who disagrees with Labor now is a sell-out. He is a man who has developed particular expertise in trade issues and, as I said, was a senior adviser to a previous Labor government. Of course, it is not only Alan Oxley who has spoken favourably about this free trade agreement. The deputy chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, described the free trade agreement as a good deal. She said:
In terms of automotives, our utes will be able to go in there and be relieved of the 25 per cent tariff duty ...
I ask Senator Cook, who was wailing about the free trade agreement a few moments ago, to go to Elizabeth. Go to Elizabeth in my state of South Australia, in the new seat of Wakefield, and tell the people of Elizabeth, where Holden is located, that this is a bad deal for Australia and for them. Go to Port Lincoln and tell the fishing industry there that it is a bad deal for Australia.
—What about the wine industry?
—Senator Ferris interjects about the wine industry. Again, tell them that it is a bad deal for Australia. Tell grain producers that it is a bad deal for Australia. Tell sheepmeat and lamb producers that it is a bad deal. Every one of those groups will derive enormous benefits from the free trade agreement. Over 97 per cent of Australia's exports to the United States—which, it is worth noting, were worth $5.84 billion last year—will be duty free from day one of this agreement. As I said, that includes lamb and sheepmeat, where, in most cases, tariffs will be reduced to zero immediately and completely abolished within four years. The situation will be the same for wine producers. There is already a $1 billion market in America for Australian wine. The tariffs there will be reduced over an 11-year period. There will be no tariffs on cereal, flour mixes and wheat. Seafood, which is currently worth $140 million, will immediately become tariff free. That includes the removal of a 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna, giving Australian tuna producers access to a $650 million a year US market.
All of those groups are beneficiaries of this remarkable deal. It certainly was not a cave-in on the part of the Australian government, as the Labor senators have suggested. Indeed, it was quite the contrary. This was probably the one window of opportunity in Australia's history to successfully negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. The governments and leaders on both sides of the Pacific were determined, because of the close relationship that they have had and the continuing close relationship between our two countries, to ensure that this was the year that this deal was achieved, to the benefit of both countries but in particular to the benefit of Australia. It is important to note that in the context of that deal our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is entirely protected and our single desk arrangements for particular agricultural commodities—most notably wheat, rice, barley and sugar—are not detrimentally affected by this agreement. Again, the Australian government stood up for those producers in ensuring that those single desk arrangements were retained. We stood up for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by ensuring that that was not affected by this agreement. That gives the lie to the negative claims made by Labor senators in this debate. We have also ensured that we have the right to retain local content— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-03-02,"—Again we hear today government senator after government senator getting up and singing the praises of an agreement that they have not yet seen and have not yet read. It is an agreement that has not yet been released and it really beggars belief that the government senators are able so confidently to say what is in the national interest. What is happening is that they are confusing their political interest with the national interest, and we on this side of the chamber will not do that. Labor's position is simple and clear. We will analyse the agreement and make a considered determination on whether or not this proposed free trade agreement is in the Australian national interest.
Government senators seem to be relying on an initial study done at the height of the free trade agreement negotiations that indicated that a full and free trade agreement—one that provided absolutely free and total and immediate access to all markets both ways—may deliver up to an extra $4 billion a year for the Australian economy. Of course, when that study was undertaken the Australian dollar was worth around 50-odd US cents, and that has changed considerably since then.
We have seen how quickly the government realised that they had oversold the benefits of this agreement, because we did not get anything like full and immediate free access to both markets. The author of the report, Dr Andy Stoeckel, said on ABC radio on 11 February:
There is a whole series of unders and overs that you have to look at and recalculate to get any sensible number on that U.S. agreement. We really should get away from that estimate.
He was referring to the estimate of $US4 billion. Even further, a significant proportion of the $US4 billion came from the elimination of the Foreign Investment Review Board, the abolition of restrictions on new investment in Telstra and Qantas, and the abolition of the four-pillars policy of our banking system—that did not occur. And 25 per cent of that $4 billion was derived from free access to sugar, and we all know that sugar was not included in the US free trade agreement.
The government is really just resorting to the spin that the deal will generate big bucks. That is the best they can come up with: big bucks. That is a nonsense. It is a nonsense for them to get up here and propose that the Senate should consider passing enabling legislation without even having seen the agreement and without even having any real understanding of what the impacts of this agreement will be on this country. 
We even see Mr Vaile now backing away from his earlier claims about the size of the benefits to this country. At the Press Club on 12 February Mr Vaile said:
I'll put my hand up and maybe we, as a government, did that, maybe industry themselves in selling it to constituent members; that this was a good thing to pursue; maybe it was oversold.
Indeed this has been oversold but the government, rather than actually considering the benefits when they have seen the agreement, continue to want to push the agenda because they have been seduced by the notion of `free'. This government thinks that they are getting something for nothing, and without even reading the agreement they will tell us that a free trade agreement, which this is not, is going to be good for us. It is possible that at the end of the day the agreement could produce winners all around, but until we see the agreement we cannot determine that.
I just want to go to something that I consider very important. Being a senator from Victoria, where the manufacturing base of this country is located, I would like to go to what the Office of the United States Trade Representative say in their public information when they refer to the manufacturing industry. Their document, `An FTA for America's manufacturing sector', says:
More than 99 percent of U.S. manufactured exports to Australia will become duty-free immediately upon entry into force of the Agreement. This is the most significant immediate reduction of industrial tariffs ever achieved in a U.S. FTA, and will provide benefits for America's manufacturing workers and companies; U.S. manufacturers estimate that the elimination of tariffs could result in $2 billion per year in increased U.S. exports of manufactured goods.
That is $US2 billion in extra exports into this country. How many jobs is that going to create? How many jobs is it going to potentially destroy? (Time expired)

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-02,"—At the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett, and pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Bartlett moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 776.
I have put this motion not to be smart but because it is something we feel strongly about. We felt that the recent changes to parliamentary superannuation agreed by the government, following a change of position by the opposition, made this an apposite opportunity for this matter to be addressed. For well over a decade, the Democrats, a few Independents and a number of members of the major parties have recognised the need for, and have indeed called for, parliamentarians' superannuation to more closely match community standards. The life gold pass is another anachronism whose time is up. All that my motion does is to ask the government to review it, although of course it does have a little bit of gratuitous politics in it as well.
The life gold pass is a taxpayer funded free air and rail travel perk for qualifying retired parliamentarians and their spouses costing, at the last time it was evaluated, up to $2 million a year. Apart from retired members of some private sector air or rail corporations and federal and some state politicians, retirement travel benefit schemes are non-existent in the Australian community. The Australian National Audit Office told a Senate inquiry that entitlements similar to the life gold pass retirement travel benefits had never been available to public servants either past or present. They confirmed that retirement benefits for bureaucrats were composed solely of superannuation. The Department of Finance and Administration told the committee that it understood that life gold pass entitlements were ahead of the field with regard to retirement benefits available for members of parliament internationally.
Some submitters to the Senate committee, including the Association of Former Members of Parliament, argued that retirement travel benefits are legitimate compensation for the lower rates of salary that sitting members receive while in office and for the difficulties and stresses associated with being a member of parliament. I do not agree that rates of salary are too low now and, if they were low in the past, the proposition we have put to the parliament and to the government is that this measure be prospective, not retrospective. Even if the argument about low pay were true for some ministerial posts, and many backbenchers are not paid badly for the work they do, instead of providing for compensation after their service, members of parliament should be paid an appropriate salary for the work they do while in office. Except for transitional arrangements on leaving office, retirement benefits should be confined to superannuation at levels in accordance with community standards. 
Former parliamentarians who wish to continue to provide public service or to perform official duties, if part of the functions of government, should be funded as such and not slip through via a parliamentary perks regime. The argument that the continuation of these retirement travel benefits is necessary to fund pro bono community or charity work is self-serving. Why is it acceptable for a former parliamentarian or spouse to select his or her own worthy cause on unknown criteria to be funded at public cost? Either the organisations themselves must fund such travel or government must decide in the public interest to make grants to charities for such services.
One of the good principles followed by both this coalition government and the previous Labor government is that hidden subsidies should be transparent. There should be, in our view, one exception: former prime ministers do have justifiable official engagements post retirement, and continued travel entitlements for them are appropriate. Their expenses, however, should be funded as an executive cost and not as a parliamentarian's benefit.
There are, essentially, three categories of entitlements afforded to members and senators. These are their salary package, what they need to do their job and their retirement package. The first includes matters such as salary and fringe benefits, car and other benefits. The second includes electorate allowances, office expenses and staff allocations. The third includes superannuation and retirement and travel benefits, including entitlements available under the life gold pass. Great improvements have been made in accountability measures to better audit, control and manage what parliamentarians use and need to do their jobs. Now the long and justified public attack on excessively generous retirement benefits is at last bearing fruit, and we think that the life gold pass should be added to the redundancy list.",SENATE,<title>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT: LIFE GOLD PASS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,10,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-02,"—I listened with interest to Senator Murray's speech. He has indicated to the Senate—and I am pleased to hear it—that he has put this proposal up, to use his words, `not to be smart'. He then went on to tell us that the motion does ask the government to review the life gold pass, which in part it does. Then Senator Murray said that it contains some gratuitous politics as well. When I see the gratuitous politics I realise that Senator Murray really is not serious about this at all. I do not think these sorts of issues are appropriate for half smart general business notices of motion. That is my view. I do not think they are appropriate for that sort of political approach. I would commend a more thorough and professional approach to dealing with these sorts of issues. On more than the odd occasion Senator Murray has applied a different approach to these entitlements issues, which are always difficult for parliamentarians to grapple with, no matter which side of the chamber they come from. That is one of the reasons that I have consistently and repeatedly argued, as every senator in this chamber knows, that these issues of parliamentarians' entitlements are best left out of the hands of the politicians. This motion we have before us at the moment tends to support that argument.
I know that there has been a lot of community concern in recent years about the entitlements of parliamentarians. There has been a particular concern, of course, about politicians' superannuation arrangements. The Labor Party have consistently acknowledged that concern. I think any fair person would acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, has acted upon that concern in recent times. Is this the appropriate way to deal with this sort of issue—in this piecemeal fashion, through this half smart notice of motion? What we have got at the moment is an arms-length, independent tribunal which is responsible for scrutinising, deliberating on and determining a range of entitlements. That is the Remuneration Tribunal. I do accept that the question of this particular entitlement, the gold pass, needs to be considered in the context of the entire remuneration package of parliamentarians. I do accept that point; it is a valid point. 
We have certainly made it clear, in relation to Labor's proposal on superannuation reforms for parliamentarians—and not only parliamentarians but also judges and the Governor-General—that those schemes should be closed for future entrants. Of course eventually under our policy, when we all die out, the schemes are going to have no members at all. But the issue of other entitlements is important as well. It is important to bring entitlements into line with community standards. That is an important principle. Ensuring a reasonable mix of salary entitlements which reflect the proper working conditions of the parliamentary vocation is a real challenge for all concerned. But let us treat it seriously. Let us deal with this seriously. It will be misunderstood, I think, if this chamber votes for or against this particular motion. It deserves and warrants a more serious motion. It deserves and warrants a debate which does not include the gratuitous politics, and I commend that approach.

"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2004-03-02,"—We will not be supporting Senator Murray's motion to suspend standing orders. I support most of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. My own perception is that there are two issues. Firstly, when politicians start debating and making decisions about their own remuneration and non-salary benefits—and perhaps Hansard could render that word in parentheses because most people travel a long way to get to this place, and I do not really think you could regard travel as a benefit; in fact it is probably a negative on both your health and your wellbeing—a very cynical public become even more cynical. It is very hard to get good policy emerging from those who have, by the nature of their position, a clear interest and therefore a potential conflict of interest in determining those issues. This government has indeed already reviewed and revised the approach to the life gold pass. It was in fact this government that restricted the use of the life gold pass. The truth about why that happened is that some former members—and you could probably count them on the three fingers of your left hand—abused it.
—Four fingers, was it, Senator Murray. I forget who those characters were and it does not matter. The important point to make here as we discuss the suspension motion is that, if you have the time and inclination to go through the tabled documents which reveal all of the travel of retired members and prime ministers and senators with the life gold pass, you quickly see that most retired members never use the pass at all. Those who do use it would only use it very infrequently—sometimes once a year. Of course, some of the former prime ministers use it a bit more often. I think that is a special benefit for prime ministers, and I do not even know whether it is called a gold pass—I think they get it anyway. But the reality is that 99 per cent or thereabouts of retired members and senators use it very sparingly; only a few use it more often. Those people who have abused it in the past have brought the whole scheme into disrepute in the public mind, and that is easy to do. That point needs to be made. With those remarks, I indicate that the coalition will vote against this motion.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-02,"—The Greens support the motion. You have to only look at the Constitution, section 48, to see that a lot of points that Senator Faulkner and then Senator Campbell put forward do not in fact have a leg to stand on. It says:
Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and each member of the House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat.
The Constitution was set up so that parliamentarians, if they were to go outside the 400 a year, were totally empowered under the Constitution to set the terms and conditions in which they did that. Of course, over the last hundred years that is what has happened. Processes were in place, when this came under scrutiny and criticism, for putting it at arm's length through independent tribunals and so on. But none of us can say anything other than we are the ultimate arbiters of what the terms and conditions and the payment and remuneration—both while we are in office and after we have left it—will be, and we are totally responsible for it.
I for one do not want to be responsible for the gold pass system which provides travel expenses at the taxpayers' expense that now come to more than $1 million a year. We do know that these are not equally used by members who have retired; some use them a great deal and others use them very little at all. I think that the very generous retirement benefits that parliamentarians get should cover it. I am very aware that my fellow Green in the House of Representatives, Michael Organ, the member for Cunningham, has introduced legislation to do what Senator Murray's motion would do here in the Senate—that is, to get rid of the life gold pass system. I think we should be agreeing that it should go. 
As far as this being a situation in which it is half smart for Senator Murray to bring this in—not at all. Nor do I think it was half smart for the Leader of the Opposition to raise the matter of parliamentary superannuation outside this parliamentary arena for public debate. It led to the cascading effect whereby the Prime Minister very quickly followed suit—within two days, as I remember—and that system is being drawn right in now. That was not half smart. That was responding to public concern. I think that is what Senator Murray's motion does and that is what Mr Organ's bill does in the other place. 
I think we should debate this matter. I know the opposition has a policy which, in the main, has said that if we bring up matters of international significance there should not simply be a vote on them; there should be a debate. The process today of denying formality on this motion has put this particular issue of parliamentarians' entitlements after retirement in the same category. Why on earth should we not be debating this? It is our constitutional responsibility to do so. Of course we should be debating it. If there is a better motion or a more seemly way of putting it than the way Senator Murray has presented it, where is it from the opposition?
—But, Senator Faulkner, there have been years of opportunity to address this matter and the opposition has not done so. It is a bit too cute then, when somebody from the crossbench does move a motion of this variety, to say, `Wrong process.' What is the right process? The right process is for it to be brought in and debated here. I congratulate Senator Murray. I congratulate Michael Organ, and also Mr Andren, who has supported the bill in the other place. It must be dealt with. We should be dealing with it. Let us have a debate and have it voted down if a majority of members do not like it, but I support this motion.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-02,"—This morning when I saw this motion was on the Notice Paper I thought I would look up the patron saint of the day, and of course it was the patron saint of opportunism, Saint Andrew. I thought that was most apt, because what this debate is really about is: should we debate this issue now? Not the principles of the issue but: should we debate it now or should it go onto the normal general business list? That is what is at stake, and not one speaker has addressed that today. The fact is that this will go on the Notice Paper. If you want to give up your general business time when your turn comes around then by all means move it on that occasion. But we are not willing to carry a motion like this without the proper debate surrounding it so that we can put our point of view. We are not going to have it declared formal and we are not going to waste the rest of the day simply because minority parties can always rely on a bit of cheap-stunt publicity if they mention an emolument going to a member of parliament. It is a certain winner. I would love to be as certain of backing the Melbourne Cup winner as Senator Murray can be of getting a bit of cheap publicity out of this.
Of course, you do not have to take the gold pass, Senator Murray. Only one Democrat has ever qualified for it, and the reason I had to alter the scheme in 1988 was because he and two others were abusing it. They were using it to get on the speakers circuit, where they were paid. In fact, they used to get extra money for that because the person sponsoring them did not have to pay their airfares.
So where there is abuse it should be cut down. The fact is, ironically, that the gold pass is being used less now than it was 10 years go. The cost every year is now going down in real terms rather than going up. Senator Murray himself has said that it was part of the original salary package. So if you want to review it in any particular way—and I am talking out of self-interest here; I will put it straight on the table—it will have to be grandfathered into the future because it was always part of the package. The appropriate body to review this is, I think, the Remuneration Tribunal. It is appropriate for Senator Murray to put his submission to the Remuneration Tribunal and get their response. What I would like to at least say is that every time you cut back on some benefit, some remuneration, for parliamentarians you might expect the general public to give you some brownie points for it. Never. All they do is move on to the next territorial demand. We do not always do things to get credit—I admit that—but you will never get their support. Most of my constituents would like me to walk to Canberra with a cut lunch and a thermos of tea. That would suit them. That stretches credibility, I admit.
—I don't think they'd want you to have that cut lunch.
—They probably would not even want me to have the cut lunch. But if we are determined to adopt community standards, I look forward on Friday morning to Senator Murray travelling to Perth in economy class. Most of the community do. He can set the example and so can all his colleagues. Funnily enough, I usually sit next to him or behind him. I do not sit in front of him, generally. Why don't you get out there and set the example? Why don't you cut back on the amount of staffing you have? I think that would be a terrible idea—but set the example. Don't just pick out one benefit that only one Democrat has ever qualified for in their 27 years in this parliament, because that is basically what you have done. We did debate these issues last year. Senator Abetz brought in changes and we had a full debate then, so you cannot say we never debate these issues. If you want to bring it up in general business, bring it up. 
But I congratulate Senator Murray; he is on an absolute winner. Anyone who is as stupid as I am to get up and say, `Maybe I would contemplate that there is some merit in the gold pass,' just gets scarified in the media. I do not really care. I have nothing to lose in politics per se. I am willing to get up and say that the gold pass has been part of the salary package. Whether it was right or wrong at the time, other salary levels, other emoluments, were reduced because of it. It was part of the balance, and I believe it should continue into the future until the salary package is changed. The same thing applies to superannuation. It may well be that the salary of some parliamentarians will be adjusted because they no longer have a generous superannuation scheme. Not for me; I have a generous one. Anyway, congratulations to Senator Murray for another good, opportunistic move: you put this down in the Senate and you get a bit of publicity. Minor parties always thrive on these things when they have nothing else to say.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-02,"—I present the 116th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Possible improper interference with a witness before the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate endorse the finding at paragraph 28 of the 116th report of the Committee of Privileges.
On 2 December 2003, the Senate referred to the Committee of Privileges a matter arising from the inquiry of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee into the administration of Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. The Committee of Privileges was required to investigate whether there was any attempt improperly to interfere with a witness before the RRAT committee and whether any contempt of the Senate was committed in that regard.
The facts of the matter are briefly as follows. Mr Alix Turner, a wool grower, made a submission to the RRAT committee in which he made certain remarks about Mr Colin Dorber, the inaugural CEO of Australian Wool Innovation. When Mr Dorber gave evidence before the committee on 26 June 2003 he had not yet seen Mr Turner's submission. But two days later he rang Mr Turner at home on a Saturday evening and invited Mr Turner to repeat his remarks without the benefit of parliamentary privilege. Mr Dorber also apparently indicated that he would be campaigning for a reduction in the levy paid by wool growers to support the research and development activities of AWI, thus, in Mr Turner's view, threatening the demise of AWI.
The following week, Mr Turner brought the RRAT committee's attention to this telephone conversation by way of a supplementary submission but stated that he was not formally alleging any misconduct by Mr Dorber. Some two months later the RRAT committee received a letter from a wool growers organisation alleging that the telephone call did, indeed, constitute intimidation of Mr Turner and inviting the committee to investigate the matter. 
The RRAT committee conducted preliminary inquiries and received further evidence from Mr Turner and Mr Dorber about the telephone conversation and any consequences. As Mr Turner was now of the view that Mr Dorber's conduct amounted to an offence under subsection 12(1) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, the chair of the RRAT committee wrote to the President raising it as a matter of privilege and the President gave precedence to a notice of motion referring the matter to this committee. Along with the reference, the Committee of Privileges received copies of the relevant submissions and correspondence with the parties involved. As is often the case, the committee was able to conduct its inquiry on the basis of the papers before it.
In cases of alleged interference with a witness, the Senate has a choice of prosecuting the alleged offender for a criminal offence under section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, or proceeding against the alleged offender for contempt of the Senate. Although the RRAT committee's preliminary inquiries were directed at discovering whether there was a prima facie case against a person for an offence under section 12 of the act, the Senate, in referring the matter to this committee, determined to exercise its own jurisdiction to investigate whether a contempt of the Senate had occurred.
The committee found that the accounts of the telephone conversation given by Mr Turner and Mr Dorber did not conflict in any major respect. As there were no significant points of dispute between the two accounts, and it was unlikely that the committee would be able to independently substantiate either account, it chose not to pursue further evidence about the conversation.
The issue for the committee was whether Mr Dorber's telephone call constituted an improper interference with Mr Turner. Paragraphs (10) and (11) of Senate Privilege Resolution No. 6 provide that actions relating to interference with and molestation of witnesses may be treated as contempts. There are at least two elements of interference with witnesses. The first is whether improper interference was exerted in respect of evidence given or to be given by a witness, and this includes any inducement for a witness not to give evidence. The second is whether any penalty was imposed on a person, not necessarily a witness, on account of evidence given.
The Committee of Privileges considered that Mr Dorber's action did not interfere with Mr Turner's evidence. Mr Turner did not alter or withdraw any part of his evidence. Indeed, following the telephone call, Mr Turner augmented his evidence, stating to the committee at the time that he did not wish to make any formal allegations against Mr Dorber. With respect to whether any penalty was imposed, the committee found no link between Mr Dorber's position regarding the reduction in the wool levy and Mr Turner's evidence. The committee noted that the apparently robust exchanges between various players in the wool industry were not an uncommon feature of Australian democracy and that the exchange between Mr Turner and Mr Dorber should be seen in that context.
The committee made two observations that I wish to highlight here. The first is that it is highly undesirable for any person to confront a witness about evidence given to a parliamentary committee. There is too great a risk of committing a contempt, either wittingly or unwittingly, in these circumstances. 
The second is that since 1988 the Senate has had procedures in place that require committees to invite responses from persons adversely commented upon in evidence. These provide for exchanges to occur under the committee's supervision and the guarantee of procedural fairness. The Committee of Privileges takes this opportunity to remind all committees of the importance of these adverse reflection rules and their obligation to follow them.
On the basis of the evidence before it, the Committee of Privileges concluded that a contempt of the Senate should not be found. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-02,"—I move:
That the Fuel Quality Information Standard (Ethanol) Determination 2003, made under section 22A of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, be disallowed.
This disallowance motion seeks to disallow the Fuel Quality Standard (Ethanol) Determination 2003 under section 22A of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. Section 22A, which was inserted into the act by way of an amendment bill passed by the Senate in November last year, allows the minister to make a determination requiring that a label be displayed at the point of sale where fuel blended with ethanol is sold. It also provides that the minister may determine the form that this label will take. When the fuel quality standards amendment bill was debated in the Senate last December, the government promised that the labelling scheme would be informative but would not further damage consumer confidence in ethanol. They promised that the label would not contain alarming warnings that would frighten motorists off this alternative fuel.
I have spoken at length in this place about the advantages of ethanol and done my bit to improve confidence in this fuel. It is fair to say that this fuel is able to reduce enormously the pollution that we currently see from petrol. It is an oxygenate—that means it allows the fuel to burn more thoroughly—and it reduces monoxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate and other pollution. That having been said, it was a surprise to discover that the label which the Commonwealth is now saying it requires at the point of sale of E10, or 10 per cent ethanol blended petrol, will carry, effectively, a warning. I will later be seeking leave to incorporate two labels in Hansard. The first is the label which was recommended by the ministerial task force working group on ethanol—the working group set up for the purpose of looking at measures which would improve confidence in ethanol. That is figure one. Figure two shows the label as determined by the minister. As those who look at Hansard in the future will see, these are very different beasts. The recommended label says: 
ETHANOL BLEND
PETROL
Contains up to 10% ethanol
For automotive use
Check your handbook or contact your manufacturer regarding use of this fuel in non-automotive applications.
But the label which is now required to be applied to fuels says:
ETHANOL BLEND PETROL
Contains up to 10% ethanol
For motor vehicle use
Suitable for most post-1986 vehicles
Check with your manufacturer before using this fuel in your motor vehicle, motorcycle or in small engines such as chainsaws or outboards.
May cause a small increase in fuel consumption.
DO NOT USE in any aircraft.
The Democrats argued that, instead of a labelling system like this, we should have waited until we had some sort of rating system for all fuels so that we could warn the users of petrol that many of the ingredients in petrol are likely to be harmful to the atmosphere. We could compare, for instance, ethanol blended petrol with petrol which was not ethanol blended. Consumers could look at some of the new petrol products which are better for the environment and weigh up whether they are prepared to pay a little extra per litre for those fuels in return for knowing that their efforts in this respect would help improve air quality. But the government has taken a different view and some would guess, as I would, that this is the only label that we will ever see—we will not see the labels being required on fuel to tell consumers exactly what they are getting for their money. The fact that the minister has not taken the advice of the working group set up for this purpose is an indication that this government is not serious about improving confidence in this fuel. It is disappointing that the ALP will not join the Democrats today in disallowing this label because I think it is going to do a great deal of harm, if it has not already done so since the date by which this label needed to be applied was 1 March, which was yesterday.
Another document which I will table, not incorporate, is a reproduction of the label which was provided to us from Caltex. This is the one applied to the pilot E10 project, which has been under way in Queensland for some time. This label for E10 unleaded says:
The E10 unleaded labelled nozzles on this pump dispense unleaded petrol that contains 10 per cent ethanol which is a renewable fuel.
There we have it: a positive statement—`a renewable fuel'. That will encourage those people who know that fossil fuels will eventually, in the not too distant future, run out. The label indicates to motorists that this is a renewable fuel so that they can do their bit in supporting an energy source which is not a fossil fuel and therefore does not add to our CO2 from this source. The label continues:
The E10 unleaded sold at this site contains ethanol from a Queensland grown sugarcane.
So there again a promotion for Queensland sugar farmers. In this place we know, as we have said earlier today, that sugar is in deep trouble. The minister during question time today indicated that the world price for sugar is below the cost of production in this country. Ethanol offers some hope for sugar producers; their waste material can be turned into ethanol in order to provide another income stream for farmers. So consumers would know (a) it is a renewable fuel, so that is good, and (b) it comes from Queensland grown sugar cane. The label goes on to say: 
By using E10 unleaded you will be helping to support regional Queensland. 
Important: please read before purchasing this petrol. The fuel is not suitable for use in marine craft, aircraft, ultralites ... and Caltex recommends that you consult with your vehicle or equipment manufacturer.
That label will need to be taken off in favour of a label that looks like one you would find on a tobacco product. In other words, we are going from one which encourages use to one which is about warnings. In fact, it is probably more alarming to many people than even tobacco warning labels. This label says E10 may cause a small increase in fuel consumption and people are going to look at that and say, `Yes, this fuel is going to be more costly because I won't get as much by way of energy out of it.'
The fact of the matter is that the difference in fuel consumption between petrol which does not have ethanol in it and petrol which does is so minimal as to be almost undetectable. Ethanol in fact adds to the fuel efficiency of petrol by making sure that all or most of the elements in it are burned. It is an oxygenate. That will mean that whatever loss there is in fuel consumption by virtue of its energy content will be more than likely made up for by the way in which the petrol will burn. It is a sad day and a great pity that we have come to this point where labels are going to be seen as warning labels, not as an indication to motorists to encourage them to use E10 blends. I seek leave to incorporate the two labels that I mentioned and to table the former Caltex E10 label.
Leave granted.

DO NOT USE in any aircraft.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY INFORMATION STANDARD (ETHANOL) DETERMINATION 2003</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-03-02,"—The fuel quality information standard ethanol determination 2003 sets new requirements for labelling petrol containing ethanol. The requirements are made under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which established a regulatory regime for activities involving fuel and fuel additives and, along with the Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2001, provide the framework for making and enforcing national fuel quality standards and national fuel quality information—that is, labelling standards. Labor previously announced a policy that fuels containing ethanol must be appropriately labelled to enable consumers to be informed about what they are buying. Labor believes that consumers not only have a desire to know what they are putting in their cars but also have a right to know what they are putting in their cars. We also see this aspect as being vital to restoring consumer confidence in the ethanol product and, therefore, vital to building a self-sustaining market for ethanol. 
There is heightened consumer concern about ethanol in fuels, following extensive media coverage last year about the dangers of ethanol in some vehicles and which, I might say, was contributed to by the government's delays in finalising the appropriate legislation. Although the Democrats contend the details required on the label are onerous, the proposed label is broadly consistent with Labor's view on the rights of the consumer and the need for consumers to have confidence to build the ethanol market. We do not say that this label is perfect, but it does provide much of the key information required. It tells the consumer that the fuel contains ethanol. It tells the consumer that such blended fuel is predominantly for motor vehicle use. It tells the consumer that most post 1986 vehicles will not be adversely affected by the use of the blended fuel. It warns consumers that they may see a small increase in fuel consumption when they use blended fuels. It tells consumers to check with their manufacturer should they have concerns which, I might say, is a pathway providing consumers with confidence and ultimately a stronger market for ethanol.
Although I understand that the industry has undertaken voluntarily to introduce labelling for ethanol, should this motion be successful, and whilst new labels were negotiated, we believe the legislation provides consumers with the necessary surety and allows them to make an informed choice about their fuel usage. We do not support this motion because, if this disallowance motion were to be successful, labelling of ethanol would not be guaranteed and, therefore, consumers and ethanol producers would be back to square one—that is, consumers would not necessarily know if they were buying fuel containing ethanol. Whilst the Caltex example is no doubt quite a positive example for the ethanol industry, there have been many examples which are not so positive, and those examples have substantially affected the consumption of ethanol fuels. Until quite recently the limit on the content of ethanol in fuel to 10 per cent has been a great disincentive for consumers to buy fuel that they suspect might contain ethanol, because they have no legislative certainty that that component of the fuel which ethanol formed would not exceed what was generally accepted to be, for vehicles operating in Australia, the maximum which should be allowed.
I am certain that the industry, based on its experience of these labels in the market—and that will be the test—will reapproach the government, with modifications along the way if needed. That is an approach which ought to be acceptable to any government where there are unintended consequences of a labelling regime which could be demonstrated attributable to the regime and not to any inherent risk in the product. Modification would be, and quite clearly could be, contemplated by the appropriate minister at the appropriate time. In that regard, Labor will of course consider any changes the government brings, just as we will in government consider approaches from the industry with regard to matters which might be brought forward by the ethanol industry and by the fuel industry generally on merits of labelling.
I was somewhat disappointed that Senator Allison seemed to be implying that somehow the ethanol industry can be a saviour for the sugar industry in Queensland. The government has peddled that myth for some time. Sugar is a potential alternative fuel stock for ethanol, but we all know that the overwhelming majority of ethanol used as a fuel additive in this country is produced from grain. Indeed, a number of the proposed new ethanol plants propose to use sorghum—another grain—as a feedstock. While there are some proposals in relation to sugar cane being used as a fuel stock, the reality is that, if we were to have a substantial industry based on sugar cane, we would not be using sugar cane—or very little—to produce the type of ethanol which might be targeted for widespread use throughout the motor vehicle fleet in this country. The ethanol industry would be a purchaser of cane, were it to substantially take up that opportunity, but it would be looking at the opportunity costs of that cane, as against alternative markets for the cane. It would make the sugar industry unviable if cane producers switched from being sugar producers to ethanol producers, because without cane the sugar mills in Queensland would shut and one suspects in the current environment would be unlikely to reopen any time soon. 
This hoary old myth that the sugar industry can be saved by the ethanol industry is just that—a hoary old myth. There may be some minor benefits and opportunities at the margin for the industry to source product surplus to the needs of the mills in Queensland. It may be that the world price of sugar will be such that producers could do no worse than sell it to the ethanol industry, but I suspect that would mean the demise of the mills through the sugar belt in Queensland. We should be very careful about holding out ethanol production as a saviour to the cane growers and sugar communities in Queensland. It will not be. It may provide some minor assistance but I suspect the reality is that the majority of ethanol produced in this country for some time to come will be produced from fuel stocks other than sugar cane. The history of production to date has shown that. Around 97 per cent of the ethanol produced for fuel consumption is produced from wheat. A significant number of the additional contemplated processing facilities in southern Queensland and in New South Wales, for example, are talking about producing fuel from grain, either wheat or sorghum. Indeed, investigations are being conducted into the establishment of a sugar beet industry for the purpose of producing ethanol in Tasmania. I am not saying that that will happen, but there are so many potential feedstocks for the ethanol industry that it is fanciful to suggest that suddenly sugar cane growers are going to get some magical benefit from the ethanol industry.
The government made some promises to the ethanol industry, and I am certain that the ethanol industry feels those promises have not been honoured in the proposed labelling regime. I am aware that there is significant disappointment as to the government's approach on this issue. We are more than hopeful—we are confident—that the environmental benefits of ethanol can be sold by the ethanol industry. I do not understand there to be any limitation on additional signage which deals with issues such as the positive benefits of ethanol. It is incumbent upon the ethanol industry and those retailers who seek to sell product containing ethanol to extol its virtues and to compete in the marketplace with fuels not containing ethanol. As a consumer, I would be far more confident purchasing a fuel where I was made aware of the inherent risks and would be more likely to do it upon taking advice rather than, on the other hand, feeling that there were inherent risks, that things had gone bad, or that a neighbour or a friend who had purchased the fuel had found problems with a motor vehicle or a small engine which, according to mechanical advice, were due to the use of that fuel.
We now have labelling, which may not be absolutely perfect but it is a step in the right direction. We are not prepared, at the end of this debate, to see that labelling removed, because we believe that would be a backward step for consumers and for the ethanol industry. We will need to revisit the argument again at some stage. It has been difficult enough to get the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, to promulgate this regulation. We certainly are not going to see it disappear and wait months or years for another one. The opposition will not be supporting this motion. ",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY INFORMATION STANDARD (ETHANOL) DETERMINATION 2003</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-03-02,"—Just as the opposition, we oppose this motion to disallow these regulations and are somewhat surprised that the Democrats would move a motion to disallow this determination. I concur with many but not all of the arguments put forward by Senator O'Brien. I particularly reject his unfair and unjustified criticism of the government, certainly of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, and his proposition that we are peddling a myth about ethanol saving the sugar industry. They are diversions from the core issue—the core issue being that the government has issued this determination in relation to compulsory labelling for ethanol blended fuel. 
I am surprised by Senator Allison's motion, because this has been motivated by the government's sincere and concerted attempt to restore confidence in ethanol blended fuels. That confidence had been shattered by scare campaigns deriving from a number of sources, and there had been a buyer strike in relation to ethanol blended fuels. For that reason, the government introduced the E10 limit, the 10 per cent limit. Consumers then knew that anything they bought with ethanol in it would contain no more than 10 per cent, which is the generally accepted upper limit for fuel used in most vehicles on Australian roads, and that they would not be subject to scare campaigns stating that it contained anything in excess of that because the government would require labelling to that effect. What a compulsory label should do is give consumers the essential information they need when buying a product of this kind.
I think the label does provide that essential consumer information, and it does so in a way which should restore confidence by making the point most clearly. The clear statement on the label is that the fuel is for motor vehicle use and that it is suitable for most post-1986 vehicles. That is the critical thing that consumers need to know to purchase the product with confidence. It is essential that the label goes on to advise consumers that they need to check with their manufacturer before using enthanol-blended fuel in a motor vehicle, particularly in motorcycles and in small engines like chainsaws and outboards, because ethanol is not necessarily safe in small engines, particularly in ultralight aircraft. These can use normal bowser fuel, but there is the severe risk that the engine can cut out if the fuel contains ethanol. The ACCC has advised the government that there must be such a warning on the label in relation to aircraft. Certainly it is critical for people who go to sea with a two-stroke outboard motor to know they need to check with their manufacturer before putting an E10 blend in it.
I think the government has done exactly what is required of it, both to restore confidence in this fuel and to ensure people have essential safety information. I thought Senator O'Brien made the point well—with one exception. There is nothing to stop the retailer or the fuel supplier providing additional information by way of additional labels as to the other benefits of this fuel. Of course, the limitation is that they must be consistent with the requirements of the Trade Practices Act and not mislead consumers in any way. As I understand it, what Caltex are doing would not run counter to that. If Caltex or anybody else want to put a separate label on indicating the other benefits of the fuel then they are entitled to do so within the law as it regulates consumer information. 
I think what the government has done is proper. I am surprised that the Democrats would move a motion to disallow this. As Senator O'Brien said, it is only going to cause more delay, more confusion and more difficulty for this industry and I think it is counter to the interests of the industry. I should say that I have taken a particular interest in this, both as industry minister and as finance minister. While we want to see ethanol have its opportunity, I would point out to Senator Allison that there are mixed views on the total environmental benefit of ethanol. I have done quite a bit of research on this. There is work in the United States which suggests that if you take the life cycle approach to ethanol—that is, from the very outset of production the tractor is required to plough the fields to grow the grain to produce the fuel; as Senator O'Brien says, ethanol is mostly made from grain in this country—then the net environmental benefit is not quite as clear cut as Senator Allison has suggested to this chamber. Nevertheless, we have said that fuel can contain up to 10 per cent and we have given consumers the essential information. It is up to those who now believe that this fuel has clear environmental benefits to make their case to consumers and convince them that they should buy the E10 blend, albeit they need to know that with certain uses there is a risk and they need to check with their manufacturer.
I totally support the minister's determination and the label that has come out of that process. I think it is completely and utterly consistent with the government's policy intent of ensuring this fuel is available, that we restore consumer confidence in the blend up to the limit that is, generally speaking, appropriate for most vehicles on Australian roads but that the essential safety information is there for consumers. I would suggest to Senator Allison that she rethink her position on this issue. Unless she is going to withdraw the motion, we will vote on it. I am pleased the opposition will support the government in this matter, but I think Senator Allison's disallowance motion is unfortunate. If it were to succeed, it would cause more significant difficulty for those promoting the use of ethanol in our fuels.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY INFORMATION STANDARD (ETHANOL) DETERMINATION 2003</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-03-02,"—I indicate to the chamber that One Nation will support the Democrat disallowance motion. In supporting it, I would like to speak about several different aspects of ethanol. Firstly and primarily, we need to address the issue on which the industry participated in this process. From speaking to the ethanol producers in Australia, it is my understanding that there was an agreement between the industry and the government on the basic framework for the notice that would be attached to or displayed on the bowsers. You can inevitably predict the outcome if you put something to a committee. On lots of occasions if you are looking for a horse you will end up with a camel.
This is why we have an objection to this notice. If this disallowance motion is not successful, a very negatively focused notice will go onto each and every bowser that pumps fuel with an ethanol content. I want to put it very clearly on the record that One Nation's support for the ethanol industry is 100 per cent. I will go into the reasons why we should do that, both health wise and in relation to the government's clean air standards, which it is locked into achieving by 2010.
The primary objection to this notice is from the industry. When the ethanol industry signed off on what they believed would be the notice, it merely referred the person to the manufacturer's data on the vehicle into which it was going to be pumped. The proposed sticker says very clearly: `May cause a small increase in fuel consumption. Do not use in any aircraft'. I would like to bring it to the attention of the chamber that avgas is used in aircraft. Its equivalent in our normal, everyday use is unleaded petrol. So where is the sign on every unleaded bowser in this country saying: `Do not use this product in an aircraft'? The signs do not exist. They are not there. I apologise to senators—I cannot reproduce all of the examples that I have here—but in California, Chevron's ethanol blend is 10 per cent, and there is absolutely no warning on its bowsers. None whatsoever. In Nebraska, Mobil fuel is labelled `E10 with ethanol added'. British Petroleum's service stations, again in Nebraska, advertise `E10 with 10 per cent ethanol'. We can go through as many as you like—Shell, British Petroleum. Right throughout the States there is no requirement for a label that cautions the use of E10. Where is the parallel with the oil companies? They have one set of rules for the US and a totally different set here in Australia. 
Last year, over 10 per cent of all gasoline in the United States contained ethanol. Fuel with 10 per cent ethanol has been certified by the Environment Protection Agency as reducing carbon monoxide emissions by up to 30 per cent. Since 1981, over 152 billion gallons of ethanol blend have been used in the United States. In the United States, the only notification is that the fuel contains 10 per cent ethanol. Why does Australia have a totally different set of standards from those that are widely accepted in the United States?
Let us compare ethanol with the unleaded fuel that is sold within Australia today. Our normal unleaded fuel contains 42 per cent aromatics, and our premium unleaded fuel contains 48 per cent aromatics. It is my understanding that the Commonwealth government has made a commitment to reducing the content of aromatics to 40 per cent by 2010. If we are to continue to have premium unleaded in Australia, eight per cent of the octane rating has to be found from somewhere else. Clearly, ethanol is the only fuel that can provide this at this point in time. The structure of ethanol is such that each carbon molecule has attached to it two hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule. Ethanol is the product that will bring the octane rating of our unleaded fuel up to the clean air standards that the government has committed to.
So what is the government doing? Is the government going out and progressively encouraging people to fill their vehicles with ethanol? I do not believe that it is, because, when this sign is attached to every pump containing ethanol in this country, it is going to be a disincentive for people to use it. As senators well know, in the area where I live, up on the tablelands, Caltex is running a trial with ethanol. I definitely find that the vehicle I drive performs better with the 10 per cent ethanol blend in it. The clear indication is that the odour from that vehicle is considerably better. If you look at the kilometres that you get from a tank of fuel, it is most definitely better. One of the most dramatic examples of the benefits of ethanol came to light at the Mareeba go-kart facility—an international standard go-kart facility—where they ran a trial with the 10 per cent ethanol blend. Believe me, you would only want to do this on a closed track. It took the top speed of these vehicles from 150 to 180 kilometres an hour with absolutely no adjustments to them. It clearly showed that, on a high performance go-kart motor, the ethanol performed extremely well.
The problem that One Nation has with what the government is proposing is that the sign that has come out of this process is contrary to what the industry understood it was going to be. One Nation believes that the wording of this sign is negative. Rather than encourage people to use ethanol, it will act as a disincentive. If there is an industry that needs all of the assistance that it can obtain at present, it most definitely is our sugar industry. Ethanol can and would breathe new life into our sugar industry. We should be supporting it 100 per cent and not indicating to the Australian people that there are dangers in using it. With those few words, I indicate that One Nation will support the Democrats on this disallowance motion. 
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Allison's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FUEL QUALITY INFORMATION STANDARD (ETHANOL) DETERMINATION 2003</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-02,"—I rise to continue my remarks on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003. The Democrats have less concern with the two new proposed offences, relating to witnesses giving false evidence and to inducing a person to give false evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission. There are currently no provisions in the Workplace Relations Act that cover these issues, and they reinforce offences under the Crimes Act 1914. Concerns were raised during the Senate's inquiry that the proposed provision regarding false evidence, unlike section 35 of the Crimes Act, does not require that the false evidence touch on matters material to the proceedings. The offence also applies to all evidence regardless of whether it was given under oath, which again is contrary to the High Court's interpretation of the Crimes Act. We will be moving amendments at the committee stage to address these issues. The Democrats support the government's aim to ensure the integrity of the Industrial Relations Commission is maintained, but we perhaps differ from the government on how best to achieve that.
The Australian Democrats have a long tradition of supporting the commission having an independent discretion to determine industrial relations matters on their merits. Discretion, of course, is never open-ended, but it has long been our view that wherever possible such discretion is a better guarantor of fairness and flexibility—which is a repeat of something I said earlier today with respect to another bill. The Democrats also believe that one of the weaknesses of the current system is the lack of powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate and conciliate disputes. The Democrats argue that the capacity for the Industrial Relations Commission to resolve disputes on its own motion should be increased and that resources to the Industrial Relations Commission should be increased to ensure the timely resolution of disputes. With respect to increasing penalties, the Democrats support tougher civil penalties for those who purposely ignore commission and court orders, and we will be supporting those provisions in the bill. We have circulated a set of amendments on sheet 4132 and we look forward to debating them at the committee stage.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-03-02,"—On the face of it, codifying offences so that what constitutes an offence is always clear seems to be sensible policy. It is too often the case that you find that those who would argue against codification—say, on the grounds that it limits or is too prescriptive of judicial responses—are those who are seeking to find some excuse for people to continue to flout the law. No-one would want to limit judicial reasoning or trespass on the sound jurisprudence that almost always flows from learned judges applying their minds and their training to problems of the law, but in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003 no such action is proposed. Indeed, except at one remove, it does not even impinge on the freedom of thought of judges at all.
According to the opposition spokesman on workplace relations, the member for Rankin in the other place, this is `a vacuous piece of legislation'. He said that in his speech on the bill in the House of Representatives. It is not the legislation that is vacuous; the member for Rankin's comments were in fact vacuous. The member for Rankin's comments are often the very model of Labor Party vacuity when they are not just barefaced expositions of his and his party's preference for a return to the union closed shop and special privilege for the union movement. Amongst the dross that the opposition spokesman delivers, there are sometimes little shafts of light that illuminate his thinking. He said in the same speech on this bill in the House of Representatives:
For 100 years Australia has supported an Industrial Relations Commission as an independent umpire being able to arbitrate on disputes.
He can get 10 out of 10 for history there. Both sides of Australian politics have always supported the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The essential difference, which is clear in this bill—and it is clear why Labor is opposing it—is that the side of politics that supports an independent Industrial Relations Commission is this side. We support an Industrial Relations Commission that is armed with effective weapons against union thuggery and provided with a clear mission statement by the legislature with regard to what it may order.
Labor prefer to keep things obscure. They use the smoke and mirrors method of hiding things. I talked about smoke and mirrors last night when debating another bill. They say they are all for independent arbitration but they really mean they are all for unions and their operatives being able to continue to get away with flouting the law. There is no intention in this bill or by this government to undermine the basic rights of anyone. The opposition suggest that doing so is the Prime Minister's passion and the fixation of the former minister, my friend and the present Minister for Health and Ageing. 
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am reluctant to take this point of order but, given the precedent that was set this morning by Senator Ian Campbell, I have to take a point of order on Senator Santoro who appears to be reading his speech word for word contrary to the provisions of standing order 187.
 (Senator Kirk)—There is no point of order.
—Obviously, I am speaking—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not want to take issue with the chair, but it is obvious to anyone who is sitting in this chamber that Senator Santoro is reading his speech word for word, which is contrary to the provisions of standing order 187, as was pointed out succinctly before lunch by Senator Ian Campbell.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on the point of order. The second point to which Senator George Campbell rose was not a point of order; it was in fact a challenge to your initial ruling. It is quite obvious to all in the chamber that Senator Santoro is reading from copious notes, which is well within the standing orders.
—I was about to say that, actually.
—There is no point of order, Senator Campbell. I understand that Senator Santoro is referring to copious notes.
—This was going to be a considerably briefer speech than it is about to become, because I am quite happy to depart from my copious notes—as you quite correctly have determined they are—and take up a point that Senator Murray made in his speech. I was going to make this point anyway in the course of referring to my prepared copious notes. The point I wanted to make in response to Senator Murray is that this government, of which I am a member, are not anti-union.
—Absolute rubbish!
—What we are is anti the irresponsible leadership of the party of the senator opposite me who seeks to frivolously interfere in the delivery of a contribution that is technical in nature and does require significant preparation and explanation—at least from my point of view. And we have people like Senator George Campbell—
—I didn't kick the first ball.
—Senator Campbell, you should be treating people the way that you would like to be treated. The point that I make in response to one of the points made by Senator Murray is that we are not anti-union. In fact, successive Liberal governments, including the Fraser government and the Howard government, have been elected by people who have abandoned you. Those non-Labor governments have been elected by voters who abandoned the union movement, who have been walking out on you in droves. Quite honestly they resent the ugly attitude and the ugly face of unionism that you represent in this place. They resent the fact that when you were a union leader, as one of my learned colleagues mentioned—I think it was Senator Abetz—close to 200,000 people associated with your union lost their jobs.
—Maybe you should go back into the history of your party.
—I do not go back. I read union history and I lament the fact that people like you existed and you led the movement to the shameful situation that it is in at the moment, declining membership— 
—You can laugh and you can smirk: `Yeah, we got Senator Santoro going.' You just got what you deserved: a reminder, on the public record, of your absolute blind commitment to ideology that to the vast majority of Australians is worth absolutely nothing anymore. We are not anti-union; we represent more Australian workers than you ever will. When you come up with frivolous interventions such as the one you just did, you deserve to be treated with the contempt that you and your union movement are treated with. They just do not like people like you. That is why you are heading south in terms of union membership and votes.
The intention of this bill, and the policy position of this government, is to ensure that no-one can make a monkey out of the Industrial Relations Commission, as members opposite constantly seek to do. Codifying what constitutes contempt of the commission is a sensible step that makes it crystal clear to everyone exactly what constitutes contempt. It is not the Prime Minister's hidden policy to decimate the union movement as the member for Rankin alleged in the other place. The union movement has decimated itself and is now belatedly waking up to the fact that to be useful and therefore attractive to Australian workers who want to pay union fees for service—service, Senator Campbell, not ravings and rantings and ideologically blinkered contributions—unions actually have to provide a service. The workplace is not a place for politics.
These days the union movement is trying to muscle into all sorts of things. It has failed in the area of industrial relations. Because Australian workers do not wish to be represented in the industrial relations arena, the ugly face of unionism—not the ugly face of union members, because the vast majority of those members have been good enough over successive elections to actually elect non-Labor governments—is now muscling in on workplace occupational health and safety issues and training areas. Again, it is trying to bring into all sorts of areas—
—What do you mean we're muscling in? We've always been involved in the movement!
—Yes, but what you are doing—
—For 200 years we've been involved in the movement!
—There you go; you are not listening. I am talking about the politics of the workplace. You have lost the political battle in the area of industrial relations.
—You're talking absolute rubbish!
—It is not absolute rubbish and you know that. You just do not like it.
 (Senator Kirk)—Senator Santoro, your remarks must be addressed through the chair.
—Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: the workplace, as I am trying to convince Senator Campbell—rather unsuccessfully, I must admit—is not a place for politics.
—He's a dinosaur.
—That is perhaps putting it a bit too kindly, Senator Abetz. It is not a place for politics; it is a place where employers and employees alike work to generate profit—another word that you do not like obviously. Australian industrial relations history is replete with examples of unions that have taken the law into their own hands, which have manufactured disputes for political purposes and which have held the country to ransom. I believe and this government believes—and on all evidence the Australian people believe—that those days are gone. The Labor Party clearly does not, and we have heard here again this afternoon a clear manifestation of that belief. The Labor Party clearly believes that it can take this country back in time. It is a little surprising that the member for Rankin apparently wants to drive the bus that would take us there. 
When the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations introduced this bill into the House of Representatives on 19 August last year he said:
The bill seeks to codify and strengthen provisions in the Workplace Relations Act regarding contempt of the commission. A number of members opposite pointed out in the course of debate: `As far as we are aware, contempt of the commission has been a dead-letter issue. There have been no prosecutions for contempt of the commission.' But I regret to inform the House that there have indeed been plenty of contempts of the commission; it is just that there have been no prosecutions. The reason there have been no prosecutions is that the existing provisions are not entirely clear and do not contain sufficient penalties. I repeat: there have been numerous contempts of the commission over the years.
This takes up another point that was made by Senator Murray and other senators opposite—that is, there is nothing wrong with the law; it is simply not being enforced. The point the minister made in his second reading speech was that the reason the bill is back before us is that we want to make the law clearer so that contempts of the commission can be properly addressed. That is why the bill is back here. It is not a matter of its not being enforced because of deliberate intent; we are just simply trying to finetune and amend a law. It is not an anti-worker law; it is a very sensible law. Even the Labor Party, including the senator opposite who continues to interject, in full symbiosis with the union movement would have to concede the point. Do you concede the point?
—No. The law is already there; the provisions of the law are already there and they haven't been used.
—I am glad you have gone on the record because—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—you again prove not only your ignorance but also your political and ideological obstinacy. Those opposite may choose to argue that it is sometimes valid to be in contempt of the commission. There would indeed be some intellectual validity to their argument, no matter that it is entirely wrong, were they to come clean on that point, but they cannot argue that no contempt has ever taken place, as they regularly do.
Without going back over the full history of the union movement—and I again want to make it clear at this point that it is only a minority of unions and union organisers and bosses who regularly and wilfully flout the law—for the record, we are not anti the union movement. I hope that Senator Murray is listening to this. We respect the vast majority of union members, shrinking though the number is. We have only to go back to the Cole report—the report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry—to find evidence of numerous contempts of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or numerous actions and events that would be in contempt of the commission if evaluated on any reasonable understanding of the law. The former minister made reference to one such instance reported by the royal commission: the Patricia Baleen industrial dispute in Victoria in late 2002, a strike that ran for almost two months, despite—indeed, in the face of—two section 127 return to work orders being issued by the commission. If that is not contempt, I just do not know what in fact can be defined as contempt. 
The bill before us has one objective: to ensure that the commission is respected. The Labor Party and others can only vote against this bill if they are prepared to countenance continued contempt of the commission. The argument the Labor Party put forward over this bill is a political argument. If they were genuinely arguing it on administrative grounds, or on grounds of support for the rights and duties of the commission, they would not be arguing at all. They would be rushing to pass the bill.
It would be instructive at this time to take the Labor Party through the actual provisions and intent of the bill. The bill amends section 299(1)(e) of the Workplace Relations Act which makes `contempt of the commission' a criminal offence. The new offences clearly identify each type of conduct that constitutes contempt and the bill increases the level of penalties for such offences. There are three key elements to the government's overall compliance policy in relation to breaches of the court and commission orders: contempt proceedings for breaches of Federal Court orders, which are to be initiated either by the Attorney-General or the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations where there is evidence of defiance and where instituting the action is in the public interest; civil proceedings for breaches of commission orders under section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act, which will be investigated and enforced by inspectors appointed under the Workplace Relations Act; and criminal proceedings under the statutory contempt provisions in part XI of the Workplace Relations Act, which will be investigated by Workplace Relations Act inspectors and prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
—He is reading from his copious notes.
—If the honourable senator actually listened, he might learn something. This bill concerns criminal proceedings for contemptuous behaviour in relation to the commission. It clarifies the scope of the offence relating to conduct that amounts to contempt of the commission contained in existing section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act. In other words, while it does create new offences, it actually codifies what constitutes contempt on a basis that I believe most people would already clearly understand to be contempt and enforces action and appropriate penalties against such contempt. It means that union organisers would no longer be able to thumb their noses at the commission with impunity or, indeed, immunity.
The government believes this bill is necessary to ensure that the law, and in particular the application of criminal law, is clear; that it is accessible to those who believe they have a case; and, further, that it is capable of delivering legislated remedies for unlawful action. In this it is no different from any other bill that supports the criminal justice system. The industrial landscape is not one that should be quarantined from the force of the law, as senators opposite would want. Industrial disputes are not some sort of game, as the Labor Party apparently believes. They are not necessarily minor or momentarily diverting arguments between friends. 
We should perhaps again go through all of the other reasons why this bill is necessary and should be passed. This bill amends Workplace Relations Act offences relating to contemptuous behaviour against the Australian Industrial Relations Commission so that it is clear and unambiguous. It codifies section 299(1)(e) of the Workplace Relations Act, which is currently a catch-all provision, prohibiting any offence that would, if the commission were a court of record, be a contempt of that court. It deals with the problem that this kind of `deemed contempt' provision imports the common law of contempt with all its uncertainties and complexities. As contempt of the commission is a criminal offence, it should be stated with certainty—with certainty that currently does not exist. It is the responsibility of the parliament, this Senate, to ensure that its laws are as clear as possible. 
The bill clearly sets out specific forms of contemptuous behaviour which will attract criminal sanctions under the legislation. This implements the approach recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission that `deemed contempt' provisions—such as the current section 299(1)(e)—should be replaced by specific statutory offences that identify contemptuous conduct. Existing offences in generally-applying legislation such as the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code already prohibit some contemptuous conduct in relation to the commission. This bill only creates a new offence to prohibit conduct not already adequately covered by the existing offences. The bill also updates penalties for a range of offences under part XI of the Workplace Relations Act, many of which have not been substantively revised for more than 15 years, and of course the world has moved on considerably in those 15 years.
The proposed new offences are: engaging in conduct which contravenes an order of the commission, publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission, and inducing a person to give false evidence to the commission. These would, I am sure, be viewed by most Australians as offences against which the law should act rather than stand idly by while offenders treat it with contempt. It is this sort of contemptuous behaviour that has hitherto escaped penalty. I do not believe that there is any reasonable Australian out there who would not see the sense that exists in the provisions of this bill that we are debating here today.
Like most Australians, most union members and officials are sensible people who understand that the law must be obeyed. I did not need the prompting of the honourable senator opposite for me to have considered my contribution and included those comments in my prepared statement. I did not need you, or indeed Senator Murray or anybody else in this room, to force me to say what I said. You have no monopoly over caring for people and workers, Senator. 
—Oh, dear, dear!
—Don't shake your head and give me a gentle clicking, because it just does not make sense. You have no monopoly; you are not the only politicians, senators and worker representatives with the hearts. You simply are not, and people are voting with their feet, as we have said before. This bill will prevent contempt of the commission and any reasonable Australian would be supporting that, as you should. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CODIFYING CONTEMPT OFFENCES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-03-02,"—Madam Acting Deputy President—
—Chalk and cheese.
—It is chalk and cheese, Senator Abetz, that is true. I was amazed at the character of the speech made by Senator Santoro, who I understand was a minister for industrial relations in the fine state of Queensland, to show such ignorance of the issues that the chamber has before it. The reality is that, if we were debating this issue on its merits, this debate would have been long over. We would not have wasted five minutes on it, because there is no merit in the legislation that is before the chamber—absolutely no merit whatsoever. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003 is just another piece of mischievous legislation designed to satisfy this government's vitriolic hatred of the trade union movement and to vilify the achievements and proud history of an organisation that has looked after the rights and conditions of working Australians for well over 100 years. Anyone with any sense of fairness who reads history objectively would know that the living standards that we all enjoy in this country today—whether you be a worker in a factory, a senator sitting in this chamber or a high-flying business executive—go back to the role played by the union movement over the past 100 years in arguing for and promoting the rights of ordinary Australians to better working conditions, better standards of living, better wages and better conditions. We all know that—and, if there was any sense of fairness on the other side of the chamber, Senator Santoro would get up and admit it and Senator Abetz when he closes this debate would get up and admit it. But we know they will not, because they have never been able to bring themselves at any stage in history to admit that the trade union movement has played an effective role on behalf of workers in this country. 
This legislation is just another piece of Orwellian doublespeak. If you look at the industrial legislation that the government have brought into this chamber since 1996 and compare the language used in the titles of those bills with the actual intent behind them, then you would have to say that the government studied well George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. They understood clearly the message that was exposed in that piece of literature, because they have used it very effectively in all the industrial legislation they have been promoting. Those bills have been referred to, I think, as `the dirty dozen' reform agenda—the dozen bills that are about trying to neuter the effectiveness of the trade union movement by pretending to promote the interests of ordinary Australian workers.
This bill is simply a part of this broader picture of industrial relations reform—part of a series of bills which have been developed on ideological grounds. We know where the ideology comes from. It was there in 1996, it was there in 1998 when Peter Reith ordered the men in balaclavas and the dogs onto the wharves to go after the Maritime Union of Australia, it was there in the royal commission into the building industry when they sought to get at the building workers; and it will be there in future actions undertaken by this government in its approach to dealing with the trade union movement. It is unfortunate that it has confused the concept of reform with the politics of regression. This legislation and many of the other bills that we have before us are based on nothing more, as I said, than bland ideological hatred of the trade union movement and the collective ideal.
If this legislation were to get through this chamber in the form that is being promoted by this government, what would it achieve? It would lead to the creation of industrial turmoil out in the workplace. Workers and unions would be driven into a position of having to take direct industrial action to defend their living standards against the attacks that are clearly designed in this legislation. The legislation is designed to ensure that Australian workers will suffer, that Australian businesses will suffer and that conflict in the workplace will be inflamed. We have seen the example in Victoria with Jeff Kennett—which I was reminded of last week—when over 100,000 workers marched up Bourke Street in protest at his industrial laws. That is a clear example of what happens when you overstep the mark. In the same way that Kennett overstepped the mark in Victoria, this government has been attempting to overstep the mark since its election in 1996, but it has been prevented essentially by the actions of people in this chamber. It has been saved, some would say, from itself in its approach on industrial relations. 
Let us look at some of the Orwellian titles of the dirty dozen. In many cases the intent of the bill is diametrically opposed to its title. Take the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, which allows small businesses to dismiss their employees with impunity and leaves sacked workers without recourse to unfair dismissal laws. Where is the fairness in that bill? Yet the government have deliberately used the term `fair dismissal bill'. What about the Workplace Relations (Award Simplification) Bill 2002? It simplifies the responsibilities of employers by removing matters such as limits on the minimum and maximum hours for part-time employees and payment of accident make-up pay, but it creates chaos and uncertainty in the lives of Australian families who find the safety net protecting their pay and conditions has been shredded to bits. The reality is that these ham-fisted class warriors of the Howard government are having themselves and working families on with this legislation—and this bill is no better. 
On the surface, the bill sounds fairly innocent and fairly reasonable. It seeks to amend section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act relating to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission including the offence of contempt. The bill also increases fines for contempt and related offences. For some offences imprisonment terms will be increased. These are all provisions in the current act. They are not new; they are in the act and have been there since 1993. However, the reasons given by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, for introducing this bill that the Industrial Relations Commission is somehow not respected and that its judgments are regularly flouted just do not add up. Of course the decisions of the independent umpire should be respected, but what has this government sought to do since 1996? It has sought to take the whistle off the umpire. If you look at the legislation across the board, you can see that much of it has been targeted at gagging the umpire's ability to blow the whistle and restricting the capacity of the umpire to play an effective role in running the industrial relations game. That is what the government has sought to do since 1996, yet it expresses concern that somehow or other the Industrial Relations Commission has not been respected. 
If anybody holds the Industrial Relations Commission in disrespect, it is people on the other side this chamber—in fact, that is the very point. Issues of contempt in the commission are dealt with appropriately. As I have said, the act already contains numerous provisions which allow prosecutions for contempt of offences against the commission to be brought. Section 299 sets out a range of offences in relation to the commission, and they are very specific. In addition to section 229, there are other related provisions in the act, namely the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code that cover a wide range of offences, including the threatening, intimidation, coercion or prejudice of witnesses and non-compliance with commission requirements to appear, swear or make affirmation. These provisions also provide for significant penalties, including up to six months imprisonment for some offences. 
The current system is clearly comprehensive, detailed and properly and effectively thought out. All parties operating under our industrial relations framework, whether they are unions or employer groups, understand their obligations to the commission. Noone in the industrial relations field is in doubt about what their commitment is to the commission and how they have to act within it and respond to it. The reality is that the current laws are working effectively, and the reality also is that the minister knows it. The minister knows the laws are working effectively. 
So what is the government's real agenda with this legislation? It cannot be that actions brought under the section are proving problematic or ineffectual because there has not been an action brought under the section since 1993 when the contempt provisions of the act were significantly added to and changed. You would have thought, having listened to Senator Santoro's speech, that there was mayhem and chaos out there, that people were regularly holding the commission in contempt by ignoring its decisions. 
—Senator Collins, I do not think they want to go as far as `tough love'. `Gentle love' might be more appropriate in these circumstances. If the commission had been subjected to the type of activity you would have thought they were being subjected to were you to believe Senator Santoro's speech, they would not have acted under the current provisions of the act to have protected their rights. The reality is that they did not. Non-compliance with commission orders are generally resolved in the Federal Court either directly between the parties involved in the dispute or with the assistance of the court. 
We have to ask ourselves: why does the government feel it necessary to amend Section 299 when not one action has been brought under the section for over a decade? At the same time, you have to pose the more baffling question: why is the government not moving to make changes to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, which contains a number of provisions largely equivalent to section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act? The answer is that the government is not really concerned about the commission being held in contempt at all. It simply wants to create a set of circumstances in the public relations environment to try to demonstrate that somehow or other the trade union movement are being big baddies out there: `We are dealing with them. We are going to make them pay. We are going to send them to prison. We are going to fine them double what they used to be fined.' 
This morning Senator Abetz, in berating a comment I made on another bill, trotted out the old line that Paul Keating once used about my having the jobs of 100,000 metalworkers around my neck as a millstone. Two hours later, Senator Santoro had doubled that amount to 200,000. We have a number of industrial relations bills listed for debate in this chamber this week. By Thursday, the number of jobs that I will be accused of having around my neck will be around a million. Again, the truth does not seem to have much relevance for the other side when we are debating industrial relations.
I want to take a couple of minutes to identify what I think is the real government agenda. That real agenda is to say to working families in Australia, `Either you will play it our way or you will pay.' If you look at the evidence that was given to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which examined a number of the government's proposed workplace relations bills, including this one, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations themselves summed up the agenda. They said in short to the committee that the government considered that amendments to the act such as this one were necessary because they brought the law into line with government policy. The government use the term `policy', but of course we use the term `ideology'. They said they brought the bills in line with government ideology. That is what this agenda has all been about. This ideology, this hatred of the trade union movement, is not new to the Howard government. I have been in the industrial relations field for a long time and successive Liberal-National Party governments from Menzies right through have consistently put laws into the federal parliament aimed at attacking or restricting the capacity of the trade union movement to defend workers' rights. You can go back and see them. The legislation of 1975, the Viner amendments of 1983 and the bills that have been put through this chamber over the last six or seven years by the Howard government are all consistent in their objective, which is to restrict the capacity of the trade union movement to work on behalf of ordinary working Australians to improve their working conditions, their living standards and their pay. 
At the end of the day, that is what is truly shocking about this bill and the other bills that we have in front of us this week. They simply demonstrate, once again, the paranoid fantasy that this government has about its imagined ideological enemies—its preparedness to set aside the rights of ordinary Australians and what it sees as the big bogyman in being able to attack the trade union movement. This bill, like the others, is sneaky, unnecessary and cynical. It demonstrates again the government's fanatical hatred of trade unions. That has never, and will never, be a sensible approach to industrial relations reform. I simply take this opportunity to say that I condemn the bill. I trust the Senate will treat this bill with as much contempt as this government treats the Industrial Relations Commission.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CODIFYING CONTEMPT OFFENCES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-02,"—Who said dinosaurs were extinct? We have just heard from one and it seems to be back to Jurassic Park days with Senator George Campbell's contribution. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate and, if I may, I will deal with some of the comments that have been made along the way and then remind the Senate of the legislation before us.
Despite all the rhetoric that we heard from the other side, there was one contribution that stood out—and that was from a former distinguished minister for industrial relations in the Queensland government, Senator Santoro. He made a very worthwhile contribution in this debate, and I thank him for his contribution and his commonsense approach to the issues. He set out the government's position very well.
During the debate we heard the lament about the deunionised work force. If the work force is being deunionised it is because workers are deciding not to join trade unions. You may wonder why the workers are leaving the trade union movement in droves. But it is no wonder when we have to listen to the sorts of contributions that have just been made in this place by Senator George Campbell on the other side. It would be somewhat embarrassing to have somebody like Senator George Campbell represent you if you were a worker. Senator Campbell made sure that his job was so much easier by ensuring that 100,000 people in the industry that he was allegedly representing lost their jobs. That is not my statistic, that is not Howard government rhetoric; that is the accusation made against him by former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. 
When people from your own side of politics accuse you of having lost 100,000 jobs in a particular industry whilst you were the head trade union official, there is merit in analysing and examining that allegation. Unfortunately, there are 100,000 Australians who know that to be a fact because they lost their jobs because of the activities of Senator George Campbell who, for his efforts, has now been promoted to the front bench of the Australian Labor Party. The people of Australia need to realise that if later this year there is a change of government it would be the likes of Senator George Campbell who would be deciding the industrial relations policy of this country. At the end of the day, there is only one group to blame for the work force being deunionised, and that is the union leadership for driving away the workers. It was the workers— 
—Don't contradict the Prime Minister.
—I am not contradicting the Prime Minister. Senator Collins, in her contribution, lamented the deunionised work force. The work force is being deunionised because of the sort of behaviour that we are witnessing now from a former trade union official. They are all former trade union officials over there, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, as you would well know. Workers nowadays, because of this government's policies, actually have a choice about whether or not they want to be members of a union. And we believe that that is a very important choice that each and every individual Australian worker should have. Once they were given that choice they left in droves.
Another contributor to this debate suggested that every workplace relations bill that has come before the parliament from this government over the past eight years has been designed to be provocative towards unions and the workers. If that is the case they might like to explain to the Australian people why we have enjoyed the lowest rate of industrial disputation in this country, ever. If we were so provocative and if we were wrecking the industrial infrastructure within this country, one would imagine that the workers would be outraged and there would be industrial disputation every day of the week. The simple fact is that as a result of our policies the workers of this country are enjoying not only more job opportunities—because we now have more people in employment—but also an increase in real wages. We are still in a period of strong economic growth with employment growth and, as a result, employment opportunities.
A suggestion was also made that there was some sort of imbalance of power. If there were an imbalance of power, one would imagine people would be getting lower and lower wages. I remind those opposite of the proud boast of the former Labor Prime Minister that real wages had gone down. We in the Liberal-National Party government are proud of the fact that real wages have increased under our regime.
—What about the social wage?
—I accept Senator Collins's interjection. The greatest social wage we can give is an actual wage or an actual job—which the Labor Party were unable to deliver because of their policies. We have now delivered jobs not by the thousands or hundreds of thousands but by the million for the people of Australia. That is why the unemployment rate has come down to below six per cent. Sure, we have a long way to go. Whilst 5.6 per cent is a good figure, it should be even better—and we are working hard to achieve that. But when the people of Australia come to compare the Australian Labor Party with the Liberal and National parties in this area they will see that it has been our policies that have delivered these very exciting results for the working men and women of this country. People have jobs, their wages have increased in real terms, and that provides them with real and genuine security.
Senator George Campbell gave us a very interesting discussion. I will not seek to deal with everything that was mentioned by Senator Campbell. Suffice to say that his defence of the building industry in the face of the findings of the royal commission that highlighted the corruption, the thuggery, the standover tactics is just beyond belief—and that remark comes from a frontbencher. I remind the Senate and the Australian people that, if the Labor Party were to win at the next election later this year, Senator Campbell would be serving as a minister in the Australian government and, by implication, condoning the sorts of activities that were found to be illegal by the royal commission. Of course, with those sorts of activities we would have a government that would be overseeing yet again an increase in unemployment and a decrease in real wages—and they claim to be the champions of the worker.  
The workers of this country expect their government to have a regime in place whereby the rule of law does apply to industrial matters. That is exactly what this bill seeks to do. It seeks to codify the contempt offences in the Workplace Relations Act. It is as simple as that. The nearly hysterical opposition, put forward by the Australian extremes and the Australian Labor Party, is just mind-boggling. It goes to show what their ideology is and what their methodology would be should they ever be given the Treasury benches in this place.
The proposed amendments to this bill are essentially technical amendments that are necessary to ensure that the legislation operates effectively and that the obligations it imposes are clearly understood. The contempt provisions of the act are intended to protect the integrity of the commission and to support commission proceedings and orders. If you genuinely believe in the Industrial Relations Commission—as those opposite claim—one would imagine that they would therefore support provisions that ensure that people cannot act in contempt of its orders. The Workplace Relations Act already prohibits contempt of the commission, but it does so through a deemed contempt offence that imports the uncertainties and complexities of common law contempt. All we are seeking to do, as the bill says, is to clarify that. The average person does not necessarily understand what conduct amounts to contempt. The bill takes this broad and potentially confusing offence and converts it into a number of offences that clearly spell out what conduct breaches the law. It makes the law clear; it makes the law accessible. 
The bill has four main components. Firstly, the bill sets out specific offences that are a contempt of the commission. These offences are already substantially covered by the current catch-all offence. Secondly, it draws attention to existing offences under the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code that apply to the commission. Thirdly, it provides for a new specific offence of giving false evidence to the commission. Fourthly, it updates the penalties to more accurately reflect the seriousness of conduct that would undermine the integrity of the commission, which is what those opposite are opposing.
 The opposition has focused its criticisms on proposed new section 299(3), which provides for an offence to prohibit the contravention of an order of the commission. This is disobedience contempt at common law. Unlike the existing provision, the new offence is very clear about what sort of conduct can result in a court imposing criminal sanctions on a person. There is a penalty of imprisonment, which has been referred to by Senator Collins. But contrary to what she suggested, this bill does not use prison as a primary remedy against industrial action. That is an absolute misrepresentation of the amendments. No-one will be penalised for taking protected, legitimate industrial action which is allowed under the Workplace Relations Act. 
Before a person is exposed to a penalty under this bill, in connection with taking industrial action, the person would need to have (a) taken the unprotected industrial action and (b) be the subject of an order by the commission that the industrial action cease or not occur and (c) have intentionally failed to comply with that order or been reckless as to whether they complied with the order. One wonders why the Australian Labor Party is so trenchant in its opposition of such a provision. There are three aspects that need to be satisfied. If all three are satisfied then it seems reasonable that in those circumstances a substantial penalty ought be applied.  
The current act already includes a sentencing option of six months imprisonment for breaching section 299(1)(e), which could apply where a person breaches orders of the commission, but the current provision is not clear that this sort of conduct could result in such a sanction being applied. This bill makes it clear. It is appropriate that there are effective sanctions that can be imposed where a person who is bound by an order intentionally breaches that order. Courts are protected by criminal sanctions for contempt, as are other Commonwealth tribunals, and the government's policy is that the commission warrants the same degree of protection. It is obvious that the Australian Labor Party does not believe that the commission warrants that degree of protection. We happen to disagree; we believe that the commission is worthy of that protection.
The opposition has asserted that there is no evidence that the incidence of industrial action or noncompliance with orders has increased or is so prevalent that systematic changes are required to deal with these issues. However, even the ACTU conceded in its submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References committee that orders of the commission are sometimes breached. The ACTU submission referred to a number of excuses for such breaches. They were either minor or trivial or the industrial action did not continue for too long after the order was made, or the action ceased after the federal court followed up the commission's order with an injunction. Responsible union officials, one would have thought, should always respect orders of the commission. The government's view is that there are no excuses. If a union does not agree that the commission should have made an order, it should appeal against the order. The government agrees with the president of the commission, when he said:
The act provides for the manner in which decisions and orders are to be challenged and that process is to be preferred to a practice of selective observance based on a perceived interest.
Other commissioners have noted the seriousness of failing to comply with its orders. For example, Senior Deputy President Acton noted in the Calsonic case last year:
It is clear that the AMWU failed to comply with all the terms of the section 127 order I issued on 28 May 2003. The AMWU's failure in this regard is a serious matter and is to be condemned, not the least because it undermines the rule of law and the objects of the act.
Can somebody remind me which union Senator George Campbell was associated with? It would not have been the AMWU, by any chance? 
My friend and colleague from the Democrats Senator Murray was concerned that the government was seeking to prosecute every example of noncompliance. This is not the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent officeholder and he will decide if a case is to be prosecuted under the Commonwealth's prosecution policy. Under this policy, a prosecution can occur only where the DPP decides that it is in the public interest, taking into account all the relevant facts. Knowing who the DPP is, might I say that Senator Murray should have no fear—the DPP is a Tasmanian. 
The suggestion was made by a number of contributors that there was no evidence that section 299(1)(e) has ever been used. Senator Collins suggested that this meant there was no need for any amendment. There are a number of likely reasons for the existing offence not having been used to date: (a) the very low penalties that may be imposed; (b) the lack of clarity about which conduct amounts to contempt of the commission; and (c) that it has not previously been a key government priority to investigate possible breaches and seek compliance with orders. These are the very factors the government is trying to remedy through this bill. The bill would ensure that the sanctions for contempt of the commission are effective. It does this by replacing the existing offence, which is unclear and out of date, with offences that are clearly drafted and supported by adequate penalties.
There are other matters that I would like to pursue during the committee stage. While I thank all honourable senators for their contributions, I think the approach being taken, especially by the Australian Labor Party, is to be regretted. If they genuinely believed in the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, they would want to see its orders being observed. If they believed in the commission being the umpire, it would be appropriate for both sides of the equation to abide by the decisions and there would not be selective observance of the commission's orders. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2004-03-02,"—I rise tonight to report on a very worthwhile initiative in the area of GP services in my own region of the Hunter Valley which is now spreading state-wide. It has been recently announced that the after-hours GP service, which started with a seven-year pilot program in my area in the Hunter, is now to be expanded to cover the whole state of New South Wales. There are plans to open 48 new after-hours clinics in hospitals across the state, and it is a terrific step forward in relieving the pressure on hospital emergency waiting rooms. Late last year I reported to the Senate on the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice after-hours scheme, which has been operating in the Hunter for seven years.
When we came into government, general practitioners in the Hunter region identified what they termed a `rapid disintegration' of the services available to help people who required urgent medical treatment out of hours. There was mounting pressure on hospital waiting rooms in the region and doctors were reporting that a great percentage of the cases filling hospital emergency waiting rooms could have been attended to by a general practitioner. To tackle this issue, the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice started working towards achieving an improved system of after-hours care for patients who live in the Hunter region. I would like to pay a special tribute to Dr Arn Sprogis, whose visionary leadership has brought about this scheme in the Hunter.
In July 2003 the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice expanded the service from the initial pilot in Maitland to a Hunter-wide service with five after-hours clinics across the valley. In its first six months of operation 20,000 patients have been seen in one of the five centres, and a further 20,000 patients have accessed telephone advice from a registered nurse. When the after-hours clinic opened near Maitland Hospital, demand for emergency room resources dropped by 60 per cent. When a similar clinic opened near the much larger John Hunter Hospital, the main hospital for the Hunter Valley, medical staff reported a 15 per cent drop in emergency demand.
The GP after-hours service benefits all patients, nurses and doctors. Medical providers are saved from having to be constantly on call. If there is an after-hours clinic available to the public, it dramatically reduces the amount of doctor call-outs. The scheme has also resulted in a massive reduction in pressure on hospital emergency rooms. During the Christmas period alone, after-hours clinics were catering for over 250 patients per day that would have otherwise clogged up precious emergency room resources. The after-hours GP service pools all funds from the federal and state governments and uses them from within existing infrastructure to ensure a sustainable, high-quality medical service. Most of the after-hours clinics are actually located within hospital walls.
A number of weeks ago I had cause to use the after-hours GP service. I entered the clinic on Hunter Street in Newcastle at about 10 o'clock at night. The first step in the process is that you are asked for details at the desk by a registered nurse, and then the nurse asks what the nature of the complaint is and whether it is urgent enough for immediate medical help. This process is important as it prevents people stopping in for repeat scripts and small complaints that could be attended to during normal hours by GPs. I was then taken to an assessment room where the nurse assessed my ear infection. A GP then attended to me and an appropriate course of treatment was recommended. I was very impressed with the professionalism displayed by the staff in the after-hours clinic, and the whole process took under an hour. This was in marked contrast to my previous experience when I arrived at the outpatients of a hospital late at night, and by the time I had been through the process and left the sun had come up. This new after-hours service is far more efficient and provides for the people a much better service, particularly outside normal GP hours. 
In addition to the clinical services, it runs a toll-free telephone line for people who live in remote areas or would rather self-treat in the privacy of their own homes. These call centres are serviced by registered nurses and they have proven to be very popular and inexpensive as a source of medical advice. Perhaps the most important factor in the GP after-hours service is that it is entirely bulk-billed. Patients are not charged any cash up-front, and in this way the general practice after-hours service is a working example of Medicare reform. The pooling of funds from the federal and state governments and the utilisation of existing infrastructure has enabled the establishment of a sustainable, high-quality after-hours medical service at little additional cost. This shows what can be done by utilising infrastructure and using better organisation and ingenuity.
The general practice after-hours service makes full use of the skills of registered nurses, and patients are only referred to a doctor if their illness is deemed urgent enough. Patients are charged nothing up-front; it is bulk-billed. If this scheme is adopted state-wide, we can expect the demand on emergency waiting rooms to drop considerably. This in turn will mean better access for cases that require emergency casualty care and more precious hospital beds for those who need them. It truly makes me proud that such an innovative scheme was born in my area of the Hunter. It goes to show what can be done with existing resources and infrastructure when the needs arise. The demand for such a service appears, at the moment, to be only on the increase. 
I am very interested to see the outcomes that will stem from the state-wide implementation of this general practice after-hours service. It will diminish emergency waiting room times, it will reduce ambulance queues and the general demand on hospital and emergency room resources will drop. It will no doubt relieve much of the pressure that has been placed on our hospital system. The patient is also more comfortable with a quick service and a course of action that alleviates their discomfort. I anticipate that at some time in the near future, this initiative could be adopted nationwide. I believe the Australian medical system in general would greatly benefit by this introduction. It is a very simple, well-planned and well implemented scheme that has already revolutionised medical care in the Hunter region, and it holds the promise of doing this across all of New South Wales and eventually across Australia.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health: Services</title>,Adjournment,16,1,speech

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-03-02,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)-(6) Australia has strict privacy laws which limit the disclosure of information held on individuals by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. As replies to questions on notice are published in Hansard, and as such placed on the public record, providing an answer to the question asked by Senator Brown would amount to a breach of the department's obligations under the Privacy Act 1988. While the Privacy Act prevents me from discussing details relating to individuals in immigration detention I can however, provide information of a general nature regarding the care of persons in detention.
If Senator Brown was to obtain the permission of the person in question to have such information released, I would be happy to arrange a private briefing for this purpose.
The provision of detention services is set out in the Immigration Detention Standards (IDS), which have been developed by my Department in consultation with the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. Detention services are subject to both administrative and judicial review, and are subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and accountability. In fact, the immigration detention process is among the most closely scrutinised Government programs.
The IDS underpin the provision of the detention function and the standard of care to be provided and ensure that the individual care needs of detainees are met. 
Departmental policy and the policy of our Detention Service Provider is that no detainee is refused mail. Once through the initial entry screening process, detainees are free to send and receive mail within Australia and overseas. No evidence has been found of detainees' mail having been denied in the circumstances described. If Senator Brown can provide any further information regarding this alleged incident it will be investigated.
The health care needs of all detainees are identified by qualified medical personnel as soon as possible after they are taken into immigration detention. All detainees are provided with necessary medical or other health care, including psychiatric care and referral to specialists, when required.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,18,1,answer
