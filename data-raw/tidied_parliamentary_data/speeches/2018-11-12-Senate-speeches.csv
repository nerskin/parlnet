Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:02):  I am speaking in continuation on this private senator's bill, the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, which I suspect we might even vote on this morning. It seeks to draw attention to the issue of inequality in our country. Before I get to the substantive matter of whether or not there are or are not rising levels of inequality in Australia, I think it's important to revisit the issue of whether the technical elements of this bill are, in fact, correct or flawed. In my earlier contribution some weeks ago, I drew the attention of the Senate to my observation that the technical elements of this bill were flawed, for two primary reasons.


First, I think it is important—and the bill does draw this out—to recognise the great work that the Productivity Commission does in our country quite generally. Later today, perhaps even this morning, the Senate will debate the government's legislation that seeks to reform the goods and services tax distribution arrangements in our country. That is a debate that I know you, Deputy President, are very familiar with, coming from Western Australia—and I see Senator Sterle in the chamber as well. When we think about the elements over the last few years that led to such a significant revision in our GST distribution arrangements, it was because of the very, very good work that the Productivity Commission had done, both in its interim report and in its final report, which provided a pathway to what was once regarded as an intransigent issue with regard to federal-state financial relations in our country. Where Senator McAllister's private senator's bill is correct is in recognising the important work that the Productivity Commission does—indeed, the transformational work that the Productivity Commission does. I, for one, along with many other senators, I am sure, am someone who does believe that the Productivity Commission can be trusted with significant jobs of inquiry using at its core the importance of an evidence based approach to coming up with alternative policy propositions that governments and, indeed, oppositions might like to take up.


The second element, of course, is that the bill also proposes that the Productivity Commission be charged with the task of doing the inquiry with regard to inequality and that it be given the responsibility to do that review over a significant period of time. But I do want to highlight one particular point in this debate: that the recent independent review of the Parliamentary Budget Office which was done as part of an inquiry that was established by the JCPAA made a very powerful recommendation—one that I think the government should embrace over the next six or seven months, and one that I hope future governments might give time to consider. That is whether or not the intergenerational report that is done by governments every five years should, in actual fact, be entrusted to the Parliamentary Budget Office and not to executive government or the government of the time.


The reason why I say that inquiry is one that is worthy of very, very detailed consideration is that, when we think about the importance of the intergenerational report for our country and shaping future policy decisions around population issues and future taxation issues, I think it's a fair observation to say that often the good work—the very important work—that the intergenerational report does and the evidence it paints for our country often gets lost because it is a document that is owned by government rather than being independently owned by an office like the Parliamentary Budget Office. If it were to be owned by the Parliamentary Budget Office, I think that the information that's contained in that intergenerational report would be more readily used by stakeholders across the Australian community and would be more readily used and endorsed by governments and opposition parties in framing a more comprehensive policy approach to a whole variety of issues that confront our country not over the immediate term but over the medium and longer term. That is something that, while not specifically addressed in this private senator's bill, is a matter that I think does deserve careful consideration, perhaps again by the JCPAA, which is the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and most certainly by this government. I hope it's something the new Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will put his mind to over coming months. I think it's an important way to shift the focus from what parliaments, governments and politicians often get criticised for, which is having too short-term a focus on policy development and policy implementation, and shift it to a more medium- to longer-term policy approach.


But the substantive issue that we're discussing this morning is whether or not inequality in our country has been increasing or whether or not inequality in our country has actually remained stable. I will talk about the issue of inequality briefly in a moment, but, in discussing whether or not inequality has remained stable or perhaps even decreased in our country, that is not to excuse the very important work that does need to be done to make sure we are constantly addressing issues of workforce participation, making sure that young people get jobs in our country and making sure that women have an opportunity to participate in the country. So debating the point of inequality is not to excuse the very real issues and very real challenges that exist in our economy. We should make sure that Australians, irrespective of where they come from, irrespective of where they live, irrespective of their age and irrespective of their gender, have an opportunity to participate to the fullest extent in the Australian economy. We know that if people get to participate in the economy—that is, they have a job; they're able to save—then they're able to enjoy much of the prosperity, they're able to raise families and they're able to start businesses. And that, of course, is a critical element in what we're discussing.


If we turn to the substantive point—whether or not inequality in our country has been increasing or has remained stable, or whether or not it might just be part of the sloganeering that we hear from the Australian Labor Party as we move closer to a general election next year and whether or not the evidence actually supports the sloganeering—I will be arguing briefly, in the short time available to me, that the sloganeering is not substantiated and not supported by the evidence. I think the first evidence base, if you like, that I'd like to turn to is the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, commonly known as the HILDA survey. The HILDA survey, released in July 2018, just this year, found that relative poverty is at the lowest point in the history of the survey, whilst absolute poverty remains close to record lows. That's the evidence. Whether or not inequality is on the rise in this country or has remained stable—the answer to that question is in the evidence. It's in the HILDA survey released in July 2018. It said that relative poverty in our country is at the lowest point in the history of the survey, whilst absolute poverty remains close to record lows. Again, that's not to say that we shouldn't be mindful of issues of inequality in our country, but, in terms of what the current position is, what the current challenge is, the HILDA survey has been quite conclusive. 


The survey goes on to say that in the period from 2001 to 2016 the percentage of the population in absolute poverty decreased by approximately 70 per cent, from 12.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent, while the percentage in relative poverty—that is, with a poverty line set at 50 per cent of median income—fell from 12.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent. I'll be the first to recognise that it didn't say that poverty has gone, that poverty has been eradicated in our country, because, of course, we know that wouldn't be a true statement. But what it does say and what it makes very clear—the evidence makes it very, very clear—is that poverty has been on the decline in our country, and that's something that should be rewarded. It goes on to say that recent data supports the notion that some income inequality measures in Australia have stabilised since the global financial crisis. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Gini coefficient for income inequality fell from 0.33 in 2013-14 to 0.32 in 2015-16, after growing in the lead-up to the global financial crisis, peaking at 0.33 in 2007-08. So, the most important and reliable source of evidence, the HILDA survey, makes it very, very clear to us that poverty remains close to record levels in our country. 


We can think about why that is. What are the structural features in the Australian economy that allow that to happen? I think it's fair to say that there are a number of elements that have given rise to that very, very stable outcome. The first and most obvious is the sustained growth that has been delivered significantly to Australians over the last 30 years. Sustained episodes of strong economic growth have allowed Australians across the community to enjoy high levels of prosperity. Importantly—and I think it's something that most people in this chamber would agree with—Australia's progressive tax and highly targeted transfer system have substantially reduced inequality, meaning that those who are asked to pay tax in our country are those who are most able to earn and accommodate that tax. But, also, our social security system arrangements are very well targeted, meaning taxpayers' money goes to support those who are most in need in our community. Another structural feature of the Australian economy that I think has helped to stabilise and even decrease those levels of inequality has been the fact that economic mobility in our country is very high, meaning that Australians, during the course of their lifetimes, during the course of their working lives, have been able to move across income distribution scales. That's an important structural feature of the Australian economy that allows issues of inequality to be constantly managed and constantly addressed.


As I said earlier, that doesn't mean we should be blind or ignorant to the fact some Australians might find themselves in periods of economic disadvantage or dislocation as the economy changes, but we can have a mature, sensible, evidence based conversation about inequality while, at the same time, recognising that for some Australians, at particular points in their working life, things might get a little bit difficult. And we have a transfer system or social security system that allows those people to be properly looked after and hopefully return to work.


Of course, there's been a significant development in the time that we've been debating this private senator's bill, which has been probably over the last few months. The Productivity Commission itself, in the last few months, released its own report to say that inequality in our country was not the problem that some people were trying to make it out to be. Indeed, the Productivity Commission report was conclusive. It received a tremendous amount of publicity through The Australian newspaper, The Australian Financial Review and other media sources. It was very, very clear about inequality in our country. The evidence of the HILDA survey was released in July 2018, but the survey was conducted in the period before that. But then, of course, added to that were the comments by the Productivity Commission chairman, Peter Harris, who has since retired, when he said that inequality in our country was not the issue that some Labor members of parliament had tried to make it out to be. What that means is that the parliament's attention is focused on issues where there is no evidence. It means the parliament's attention is not focused on the areas where there does deserve to be greater conversation, greater discussion and greater ideas with regard to possible policy improvements.


I want to quote briefly, if I may, from The Australian Financial Review. It was an opinion piece published on 4 September 2018 in The Australian Financial Review by Mr Brendan Rynne, who is the chief economist at the KPMG, a renowned consulting firm in Australia. I want to read into the Hansard not only what he had to say with regard to the issue of inequality in our country and what he had to say with regard to the Productivity Commission report but also what he had to say with regard to the KPMG's Economics and Tax Centre report that it released in April 2017, which specifically looked at the issue of income inequality in our country. Mr Rynne said in his opinion piece of September 2018 that, like the Productivity Commission report, KPMG's own report, the Economics and Tax Centre report of April 2017 titled Financial stress in Australian households: 'the haves', 'the have-nots', 'the taxed-nots' and 'the have-nothings', 'found that inequality in Australia has been relatively stable, and our tax and transfer system does a good job in equalising incomes between rich and the poor across the nation.' He went on to say:


Both of these studies have shown the proportion of Australian households living in poverty has not materially worsened over the past three decades; the economic prosperity we as a nation have enjoyed since then has been shared between everyone, and not just captured by the wealthiest.


Depending on how you measure it, growth in income inequality in Australia has, at worst, been equal to the OECD average, or at best, been virtually zero.


That's worth repeating: the chief economist at the KPMG—not a Labor senator, not a coalition senator but an independent—said:


Depending on how you measure it, growth in income inequality in Australia has, at worst, been equal to the OECD average, or at best, been virtually zero.


He went on to say:


This means income inequality has stayed constant in Australia while in the—

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2018-11-12,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (10:19):  I rise to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. Inequality has become the new rallying cry of the Left as they continue to peddle the politics of greed, envy and division. We've got a Labor Party here in Australia who have looked across to what Jeremy Corbyn is up to in the United Kingdom, with his politics of envy, with his views on British society and the British state, and they've gone, 'Yes, we'll have some of that; we'll bring that here to Australia.' 


It's ironic that the Labor Party preach to us about inequality while they oppose government measures that give Australians the hand up they require. With Bill Shorten's Labor Party it's always about the handout, not the hand up. It's always about having another review, another study. It's not about what we can do to grow the economy. This modern Labor Party, under Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, is not like the Labor Party of Bob Hawke or Paul Keating. It is a different beast. I may not have liked Paul Keating as Prime Minister when I had reached the dizzying heights of president of the Griffith University Liberal Club—our rallying cry back in 1993 and 1996 was about kicking out Paul Keating, and we finally did that in 1996—but under Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating Labor did focus on market based reforms to improve the Australian economy. It is sad that we will not be able to say the same about Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and the current Labor Party. 


With Labor it's always about taxing the rich, but now it's also about taxing the elderly. We've got a Labor Party who want to tax those who want an investment property. We've got a Labor Party who don't want to give out tax cuts. They want to make the poor poorer. They want to make sure the poor take a handout from government. They don't want the poor to get on that aspirational ladder, to start and grow a business, to start and grow a family, to help grow Australia. What they want to do is protect the trade unions in Australia. This is a segment of the community whose membership rate, increasingly, is going down. In the private sector, just over one in 10 workers are members of a trade union. Why is that? It is because workers recognise that the way to get ahead is not by having this third-party industrial organisation, these dinosaur-era trade unions, trying to negotiate on their behalf. They recognise that unions have forgotten what they're there for. Unions have become just a campaign arm of the Labor Party. They are not standing up for the workers. They use money from the workers to try and get Labor elected and try and keep Labor in power. That is very sad. 


The Productivity Commission, funnily enough, has just done a stocktake of the latest and most complete evidence on inequality. They have found that inequality has decreased since the global financial crisis. One of the main reasons for this is that this country has had 27 years of consecutive economic growth. That is a world record for a developed economy. For 27 years since 1991, since the recession we had to have—when Paul Keating drove the economy into the ground—we've had an economy that has been growing. It has largely been thanks to the economic stewardship of Mr Howard and Mr Costello, in terms of the work they did building on many of the reforms of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. But the work of the John Howard-Peter Costello government between 1996 and 2007, for 11 years, is something that all Australians, regardless of their political allegiance—whether they're a member of the Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, the Labor Party or a troglodyte party that I don't know the name of—should be proud, in terms of growing the Australian economy. 


We were able to have that economic growth notwithstanding the best efforts of those economic troglodytes in Labor. It was when we had Wayne Swan, that noted economist/thespian/union official, who was Treasurer of this country for a long period—notwithstanding his best efforts to ruin the economy. We should not forget that, when Mr Howard was asked by the Australian people in 2007 to update his CV, Australia had no debt whatsoever. In fact, we had money in the bank. It took Labor just under six years to spend all the money in the bank and also rack up over $500 billion of debt. Notwithstanding those efforts, because of the work of Mr Howard and Mr Costello we still had economic growth.


Since the 2013 election, which Mr Abbott and the coalition won, we have been able to continue that economic growth. We've done that through making sure we try to live within our means and making sure that government, where there is a need for government, is small but good; it shouldn't be large and wasteful. We also need to make sure that taxes are as low as possible. We on this side of the chamber believe that the individuals, families and business owners know best how to spend their money, and they will act in the interests of themselves, their families, their business and their communities in terms of how they spend that money. We think that they know best in terms of spending the money rather than allowing government to spend money and continually increase taxes.


The Productivity Commission found that there is a high degree of economic mobility in Australia, including a high degree of economic opportunity. This economic growth has delivered significantly improved living standards for the average Australian in every income segment of the economy. We've all been growing; as the Australian economy has grown, we've all grown. In fact, economic mobility in Australia is higher than in most other OECD countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. This is because our progressive tax system and our broad social safety net, our welfare system, are working together to drive inequality down.


The government's plan for a stronger economy is working, and it is helping to deliver a stronger economy for all Australians. How is it doing this? It is doing it through tax relief or, as I prefer to say, tax cuts—tax cuts to encourage and reward working Australians, tax cuts that keep backing businesses to invest in and create more jobs. We should not forget that, since 2013, a million jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We all want to decrease inequality and we all want to get rid of poverty, and the best way to do that is not by having the Productivity Commission do another study, which is effectively what this bill would propose, but by creating jobs. It is about people working for money. It is about people actually paying taxes that then go back into helping that social safety net. By doing that, it guarantees the essential services Australians rely on.


We're also growing this economy by keeping Australians safe. We are making sure that our borders are secure. We are making sure that we have an immigration system in which we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come. We decide who comes to this country, what skills they have and how they can help grow Australia.


We've also got to make sure that the government lives within its means. The government is delivering on its plan to get the budget back into the black sooner, with the reforms we've made, and also to start paying back debt. One of the biggest roadblocks to inequality in Australia will be government debt. Money we're spending on interest repayments is money that is not going into essential social services. Money that is going into paying interest on government debt is money that is not cutting taxes. We should never forget what Labor did to this economy in the period they were in power between 2007 and 2013. We went from zero debt in 2007 to almost half a trillion dollars of debt in 2013.


The core function of the Productivity Commission is to conduct public inquiries at the request of the Australian government on key policy or regulatory issues bearing on Australia's economic performance and community wellbeing. There is nothing preventing the commission from research and investigation into inequality or its impacts upon community, wellbeing or economic performance. In fact, that's what it's just done. Australia has a progressive tax system. It has a broad social safety net, and our welfare system is one of the most targeted in the world. There's also been wide reform of our age pension system to give more to those on the lowest incomes. We know that the best way to help Australians get ahead is to ensure that every Australian who can work is able to get a decent job. That is why our entire plan is targeted at growing the economy, getting more Australians into work and seeing incomes increase right across Australia.


In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and Labor believe that for some to do better others must do worse. We do not believe that. We think we can all do better. We think that by growing the economy all Australians can rise. Bill Shorten and Labor want to increase taxes and punish the job-creating parts of our economy, and that is a tragedy. The main thing we're doing to improve income inequality is jobs generation, because nothing helps people more than getting a job. The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, called 'HILDA' for short, released in July this year found that relative poverty is at its lowest point in the history of the survey, while absolute poverty remains close to record lows. From 2001 to 2016 the percentage of the population living in absolute poverty decreased by approximately 70 per cent, from 12.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the percentage living in relative poverty—and that's with the poverty line set at 50 per cent of the median income—fell from 12.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent.


Recent data supported the notion that some income inequality measures in Australia have stabilised since the global financial crisis. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Gini coefficient, which is used to gauge economic inequality, fell from 0.33 in 2013-14 to 0.323 in 2015-16, after growing in the lead-up to the global financial crisis and peaking at 0.336 in 2007-08. In case Labor has forgotten, in that instance lower is better. The HILDA survey estimated that there has been little change in income inequality between 2001 and 2016, with the Gini coefficient remaining at approximately 0.3 over the 15-year period. In 2016 the Gini coefficient was at its lowest level since 2005. In 2015-16 a total of 3.6 million Australian households received more in government payments than they paid in income taxes. Therefore, around 40 per cent of households do not pay any net tax after benefits. By contrast, in 2015-16 the top 10 per cent of taxpayers paid 45 per cent of total personal income tax.


It's disappointing coming to this debate, because Labor lack credibility on this topic. They have abandoned any pretence of fairness and of taking real action to reduce poverty in Australia. They want to play politics with it. They fail to understand that the best way to address inequality in our society is by economic means. It's not by doing another study, it's not by raising taxes, it's not by taxing one element of the population to subsidise another element of the population and it's not by adopting the Venezuela model of just taxing and taxing and taxing. The best way to decrease inequality is to make sure Australians have an economy that is growing, an economy where businesses will put on new workers, an economy where workers can decide that they want to start their own business.


In Australia we sometimes forget that every large business in Australia started off somewhere small. We forget that businesses like Qantas, in my home state of Queensland, started off in a shed in Longreach when it was the Queensland and Northern Territory Air Service. We forget that that is how that massive business started off. We forget that Coles started off with a single corner store and is now one of the giants of the Australian retail sector. We forget the same with Myer, which started off with a single store. So many Australian business names started off with someone who had been a worker deciding they wanted to start their own business, and they wanted to start their own business because they wanted to a get ahead. They wanted to get ahead for themselves, for their families and for the community. By doing that, they employed more people. By employing more people, we get them out of the poverty trap. We get them out of being reliant on welfare from the government. Even though we do need welfare, we do need to have that safety net for people, we want to make sure they can get ahead and have a job.


Labor's alternative plan for growing the economy is to put $70 billion of extra income tax on Australians. They don't want to have tax cuts for businesses. They will come to the table when they get shamed into it before the election. But let's see, if they ever win an election again in this country, what they will do. We got a pre-taste with what they did between 2007 and 2013. And, heavens forbid, if we fail to win the next election, and Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister, we will have all these economic giants who sit on the opposition frontbench, all these people with their extensive business experience! This might be a fun fact for people to know who might be listening at home: the number of people in the Labor frontbench—there might be an exception here—or indeed on the backbench with business experience is very limited. And that is sad because small businesses and those who work for big, small or medium-sized businesses—but particularly small businesses—do so much for Australia. My fear is that Labor do not understand that small business is the best way for people to get ahead, for that person who has that dream, who sees that empty shop in the main street. My office is in Nambour in Queensland. There are people always wanting to see an empty shop and start a small business and grow it, to make sure they can get their family ahead. And it is tough. But doing another study, doing another report, raising taxes or getting Canberra to tell people what is best for them are not the ways to do it. The best way to do it is to empower people to get ahead.


It was Labor who opposed our tough measures to crack down on multinational tax avoiders when they opposed the 2015 multinational anti-avoidance legislation. One of their many great shames—they have a lot of great shames—was to have voted for leaving $2 billion in the pockets of multinationals instead of supporting our efforts to deliver it to the budget bottom line, funding essential services for Australians. It is Labor who, by voting against the enterprise tax plan, is opposing the Liberal-National government's efforts to boost investment, increase earnings and grow the economy. It is a Labor who have a plan for higher taxes and higher deficits. At the 2016 election, the Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed that Labor's election commitments would have resulted in higher deficits to the tune of $16.5 billion. Higher taxes, higher debt and higher deficits are the worst prescription you can write for the Australian economy. Labor are a AAA threat to our AAA credit rating:


Labor do not have one policy that would help one business invest one dollar or create one job. On housing, Labor's only plan is for higher taxes. We all know that higher taxes don't build houses. Labor's plan is to tax more so they can dole more out for their welfare spending increases, and that is wrong. The best form of welfare, the best way to fight income inequality, is actually a job.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:39):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. I sat here and listened to senators, most recently Senator Smith, talking about inequality and poverty in this country, quoting figures, for example, from the Productivity Commission report on income inequality. While there was some very useful data in that report, what I'm deeply concerned about is quoting the Productivity Commission and the misinterpretation of some of the issues that came up in the Productivity Commission report on inequality, and also quoting the HILDA data and the Gini coefficient. When you actually look into the issues around inequality, you can mask the impact on particular cohorts of Australians who certainly are not doing better. If you look at the figures in terms of the concentration of wealth in this country, you see that in fact the situation isn't as rosy as the government likes to paint it. If you look at the fact that Australia is considered by many now to be the second wealthiest country in the world, poverty rates in this country remain very high. We've just gone through Anti-Poverty Week in October, the week before estimates. When we were looking at Anti-Poverty Week we heard how poverty is affecting so many Australians. Yet you get up here and listen to the government senators and you would think everything was sweet. 


They're ignoring the fact that poverty rates are remaining stubbornly high, with around three million Australians who are suffering deprivation and do not have a good quality of life. There are three million people in Australia living below the poverty line, of whom 739,000 are children. Inequality is baked into our system. When you look at the income share of the top one per cent in Australia, it has doubled. The top 20 per cent now own half of Australia's total wealth. That concentration is growing at a rate that is one of the highest in the world. 


If you look at the recent Productivity Commission report, the way some people are interpreting it suggests that inequality hasn't got any worse in recent years, based on analysis that basically compares the incomes of the highest decile and the lowest decile—in other words, the bottom 10 per cent versus the middle versus the top 10 per cent. The problem with this particular methodology is that it masks what's going on in the analysis for specific vulnerable groups—those vulnerable groups that I was talking about. It is also completely at odds with the reports that you get from the front-line services—Foodbank, for example. I'm going to come back to Foodbank, because we've just heard that it has had its funding cut again. 


If you look at some of the figures from that report and some of the other figures that are quoted, particularly when the Gini coefficient is quoted—it is often misquoted, and it is quite a difficult coefficient to understand—you look at what happened when the age pension increased. I am not for one minute saying that that was not a good outcome. It was a good outcome when the Rudd government increased the age pension. It was something that the Greens had been campaigning for; Senator Bob Brown in particular had been campaigning for it for a long time. Because there were so many age pensions that got that very needed boost, it masked some of the impacts on some of those other vulnerable groups moving more and more into poverty. That increase made the figures look a lot better for that particular group of people that had been living in poverty. Given that we also have a much better indexation rate for the age pension, that has helped that group of people deal with poverty better. That's not to say there are not aged pensioners living in poverty, because there are, particularly if you are a single woman. A lot of them are really struggling as they move into older age, particularly those who are unemployed and have used up their savings. They are moving onto the age pension in poverty.


Basically, it's masking those who are unemployed, single parents and those with a disability who should be on the disability support pension but are in fact on Newstart because of the change in the eligibility tables. Age pensioners have been better off over the term that we've been talking about—from the early noughties through to now—because of that increase, but the government is trying to wipe the slate and say, 'People aren't living in poverty anymore.' It's just not true. That is skewing the figures and masking the fact that, if you are living on Newstart, you are living in poverty. We have to raise the rate of Newstart by $75 a week.


There have been a number of very learned articles about the fact that it is easy to misquote the figures to make them look better without looking at those vulnerable cohorts who are really struggling, such as those on Newstart and single parents. We know from analysis that the poverty rate of children of single parents—and we know that the bulk of those are single mothers—has significantly increased since single mothers were dropped off parenting payment single onto Newstart. 


I promised I would make this contribution short, but let's quickly look at, for example, the stats coming through from Foodbank. Their hunger report was released just a couple of weeks ago. The number of people that they are servicing went up five per cent in the 12 months from 2017 to 2018. There has been an increased call for their services. They are providing a valuable service to feed those people who aren't able to put food on the table, because they are living in poverty. And what has this government done? It has cut their funding again. It is outrageous. You only have to visit their services, which I did recently, to see what an excellent job they do and see how they are supporting vulnerable families who are trying to get by on particularly Newstart, the disability support pension and the age pension. Families are struggling on casual part-time work. They are not earning enough to be able to put food on the table. Foodbank are providing that service. They are supporting people who are living in poverty. 


To imply that this country does not have an issue with inequality is simply ignoring or juggling the facts to make them fit their story. This country needs to wake up to the fact that we have an increasing problem with poverty and we have an increasing problem with inequality. Those who are trying to survive on extremely low incomes and on Newstart in particular are doing it very tough. If you just look at the proper figures and at those vulnerable groups, you will see that this country has a very significant issue with inequality.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:48):  I want to thank all my colleagues for their useful contributions to this debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. This is a debate we should have more often. It's a shame that, at a time of income stagnation and rising inequality, globally and here, this is one of the few real opportunities that the Senate has been given to debate these issues, and it's only doing so because there is a private senator's bill before us, not because of a government bill to address these issues. Where is the government's legislation addressing income stagnation? What is their plan to address living conditions for Australians? What is their plan to tackle the cost of living? I'm not sure and I don't actually think they know either.


Over the course of this debate, colleagues opposite have spent some time explaining why they don't think it is necessary to have the Productivity Commission regularly and routinely examine inequality as part of its work. I want to review some of these comments because this debate has been on foot for some time and a lot has changed in the intervening period. One senator said:


I am thankful for the opportunity this private senator's bill provides me to speak a little about the Turnbull coalition government's program to reduce income inequality in this country. One of the coalition's flagship policies is of course the enterprise tax plan.


That was in February this year. There are three things clearly wrong with this statement: it's no longer the Turnbull government, they don't have a program to reduce income inequality, and the enterprise tax plan is no longer one of the coalition's flagship policies.


A number of those opposite, during the course of the debate, spoke about their preference for reducing the cost of living for average Australians rather than addressing questions of distribution. One senator opposite said:


First and foremost, this government is tackling the cost-of-living pressures on Australian households. … On the energy front, the National Energy Guarantee, unveiled by the Minister for the Environment and Energy in October last year, will further ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian households, with expected savings of up to $400 per year on their energy bills.


There is another problem with that statement, because, of course, there is now no National Energy Guarantee. The government's figures of $400-a-year savings were always a bit rubbery. Now, however, they're entirely hypothetical. It appears the only climate or energy policy this government has is Direct Action, and that is a policy that should have expired along with the Abbott government. The only policy they have to reduce electricity prices was to have Minister Angus Taylor ask power retailers to do it—to ask nicely. As he found out last week, that is a strategy that doesn't work. Power retailers have refused to provide the lower rates by 1 January as demanded by the minister.


Despite the absence of any program to address inequality or the cost of living pressures or wage stagnation, a number of those opposite opposed the bill on the basis that it was better to take action rather than commission another report. One senator said:


Directing the Productivity Commission to undertake this analysis and provide a report to government is going to do nothing, other than allow us to line the shelves in our offices with yet another report that may well never see the light of day, that will just gather dust and that will not make a jot of difference to the lives of those people we're talking about now.


That sentiment fundamentally misunderstands the nature of policy development. Reports shouldn't line shelves and gather dust. That's not why we commission reports. They should be read. They should be understood. They should be used to inform decision-making. Yes, action is important, but so is understanding the problem. Perhaps this explains some of the struggles that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government have had in developing coherent policies: they don't value or understand evidence, and, as a consequence, they are unable to move in an organised way through cogent decision-making.


It is encouraging to see that the Productivity Commission has in fact already undertaken some of the work outlined in this bill. In August this year, the PC released a research paper on rising inequality. It's a useful first look at inequality that I don't think has been properly digested by Canberra. What does the report tell us about the state of inequality in Australia? It tells us that inequality has been rising over the last 30 years. It tells us that our progressive tax and transfer system has been a substantial factor in reducing inequality, typically lowering income inequality by around 30 per cent, and that government-funded services like health, education and public housing have an additional equalising effect. This is a positive story about how the role of government can deliver for Australians. Sound monetary, economic and social policies can and do reduce inequality. We know we have the levers we need to make change.


However, the PC report also tells us a story of persistent and entrenched inequality and disadvantage. Shockingly, despite 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the poverty rate hasn't decreased. That's nothing to pat ourselves on the back about. We've had 27 years of economic growth as a country, and what have we done for the poorest Australians? Not a great deal. According to the report, around three per cent of Australians are living in continuous poverty. Some Australians move in and out, but there is a core group of around 700,000 people that are in continuous poverty. I invite those opposite to consider what that might actually be like. The commission has, in fact, reported that poverty in Australia is increasing. This is essential information that governments need for assessing the state of inequality in Australia, and that is the point of this bill—to require the PC to regularly produce this information and to ensure that when they are doing their other work they have regard to the impact of other decisions on inequality in our society. 


What is it that the PC recommends we do about inequality? During his address to the National Press Club about the report, the commissioner didn't talk about corporate tax reform as a solution to inequality and entrenched disadvantage; instead, he noted the very low rates of income growth. He talked about productivity growth and pointed to three key areas from the Productivity Commission's Shifting the dial report last year. These areas were higher workforce participation and personal wellbeing, through preventing chronic disease; more adaptable workforce skills, through practical improvements to secondary and tertiary teaching; and reducing the number and complexity of overly restrictive planning and zoning restrictions, to make it cheaper and easier to live and work in our congested cities. Those are ideas for economic reform that we don't hear spoken about here. 


Despite the fact that our premier economic institution raises these, advances them, it is of no interest, apparently, to those opposite, who continue to hang onto the outdated policy prescriptions they worked up in the mid-1980s and are unable to let go of. None of those opposite mentioned any of these issues in their contributions. Senator McGrath suggested that we need to open up property investment for those in poverty and that tax concessions for property investment were really critical in addressing disadvantage. What nonsense. You'd be laughing if it weren't so offensive to the 700,000 people living in continuous poverty. 


There's not just a moral imperative to take serious action in addressing poverty and inequality. It is also likely to have an impact on our economic performance. That is something the Productivity Commission would be asked to consider through its work as a result of the passage of this bill. There is no fixed divide between social and economic policy. It is a porous relationship. When we all do well together our economy does well also. Back in 2012, the BCA, the ACTU and ACOSS released a joint statement and they committed to work collaboratively to support Australians disadvantaged in the labour market. This statement made the argument that there was a level of income support required for jobseekers to allow them to live decently and respond to job opportunities, and below a certain level of income it impedes jobseekers' ability to get into work. It didn't just make the social argument; it made the economic argument too. It said that in doing so we would provide employers with access to workers who had the skills they needed in the workforce. 


More recently, that's been built upon by a Deloitte and ACOSS report. It looked at the economic impact of raising the Newstart rate by about $75 a week. They estimate that the immediate stimulus provided by a decision of that kind would produce an additional 12,000 jobs in the first year. Reforms in social policy can have a direct impact on the economic outcomes of a community. Equally, economic reforms can affect social outcomes—for example, people's health and wellbeing and their ability to participate meaningfully in their community. 


What would a comprehensive response to poverty from a federal government look like? You'd start with action to address income. It's not reasonable that so many people who are working still don't have enough money to feed their families. I went out to Foodbank's warehouse recently in Glendenning. They make the point that of the people they help each month they're not just helping the unemployed and the homeless; their large-scale survey suggests that 20 per cent of people who are in part-time or casual work experienced issues accessing food in the last year. This is not because people are failing to manage their budgets or just need a little bit more advice about income management. There is a working poor, people going to work who cannot feed their families. 


And the payment system needs to be examined. In the case of Newstart, we will conduct a root-and-branch review of the payment system, should we form government, because we know that the rate is too low. We also need to undertake action to improve services. The Productivity Commission has made it very clear that services like health and education—those universal services—make a great deal of difference in ameliorating inequality in this country. That's why Labor, should we form government, are planning a very significant investment in public education, putting back all the money recommended by Mr Gonski and ripped out by the government over the past five years from our schools. That's why we're committing to make preschool available to all three-year-olds and four-year-olds. And it's why we continue to believe that Medicare needs to be funded properly and that the attacks on Medicare need to stop.


These universal services may not be enough for families who are in deep structural poverty. The literature suggests that exposure to poverty in childhood damages a child's development, their future productive capacity and their life prospects more generally. It has economic costs for our society, but surely the moral cost is much greater. Government already run a range of early-intervention programs delivered in the home to support those families. The question is: are we doing enough? As the Productivity Commission has made clear, there is a group of people for whom poverty is an unending reality, and we need to come to grips with it as a society. Unfortunately this is not a challenge that seems to be of interest to the government. The coalition came to power with a very limited set of fixations. They're fixated on unions and on working people's organisations, they're fixated on delivering tax cuts to very big businesses and they're fixated on stopping action on climate change. They struggle to find enthusiasm for any issue that doesn't involve their ideological obsessions, and unfortunately that is most issues. That's why this government find themselves without any plan whatsoever to address income stagnation. That's why they find themselves without any plan to attack poverty.


Having the Productivity Commission report regularly on inequality, as proposed in this bill, will drag these issues back onto the table, because that is where they belong. Australians are facing the very real consequences of policy inaction. Income inequality—sustained poverty—creates a multitude of barriers that affect people's living standards, affect their social participation and extract an enormous human cost. It's clear that the government have no real interest in addressing those concerns. When they do talk about welfare, their focus is on punitive measures. They are focused on monitoring payments and overpayments, chasing up debts from extremely financially disadvantaged groups, and income management. There's no thoughtful discussion about tackling disadvantage. There's no thoughtful discussion about the social and economic benefits that come from investing in our poorest people. This is a missed opportunity—a missed opportunity in social policy as well as a missed economic opportunity. It should be a priority of the government to address this issue. Instead, they choose to simply engage in a war of words.


There's no more hiding behind rhetoric about what past Labor governments may or may not have done. The government have been in power for five years, and their inaction is having serious consequences. Poverty isn't a force of nature; it's not something that exists in isolation. It is forced on people by social and economic structures that inflict harm, and it affects our most vulnerable. Overwhelmingly, it is children and the elderly who bear the brunt of food insecurity and income inequality. Just today we've had reports that the government is nearly halving the funding for Foodbank, our largest food organisation, which nationally provides emergency relief to on-the-ground charities, reaching thousands and thousands of vulnerable Australian families. We should be doing more, not less, to support these people. Addressing poverty in Australia should be core business—a key priority for this parliament and a key priority for the government. But that's not the case. We need to change our institutional arrangements so that now and forever these issues cannot be ignored. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:02):  I am speaking in continuation on this private senator's bill, the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017, which I suspect we might even vote on this morning. It seeks to draw attention to the issue of inequality in our country. Before I get to the substantive matter of whether or not there are or are not rising levels of inequality in Australia, I think it's important to revisit the issue of whether the technical elements of this bill are, in fact, correct or flawed. In my earlier contribution some weeks ago, I drew the attention of the Senate to my observation that the technical elements of this bill were flawed, for two primary reasons.


First, I think it is important—and the bill does draw this out—to recognise the great work that the Productivity Commission does in our country quite generally. Later today, perhaps even this morning, the Senate will debate the government's legislation that seeks to reform the goods and services tax distribution arrangements in our country. That is a debate that I know you, Deputy President, are very familiar with, coming from Western Australia—and I see Senator Sterle in the chamber as well. When we think about the elements over the last few years that led to such a significant revision in our GST distribution arrangements, it was because of the very, very good work that the Productivity Commission had done, both in its interim report and in its final report, which provided a pathway to what was once regarded as an intransigent issue with regard to federal-state financial relations in our country. Where Senator McAllister's private senator's bill is correct is in recognising the important work that the Productivity Commission does—indeed, the transformational work that the Productivity Commission does. I, for one, along with many other senators, I am sure, am someone who does believe that the Productivity Commission can be trusted with significant jobs of inquiry using at its core the importance of an evidence based approach to coming up with alternative policy propositions that governments and, indeed, oppositions might like to take up.


The second element, of course, is that the bill also proposes that the Productivity Commission be charged with the task of doing the inquiry with regard to inequality and that it be given the responsibility to do that review over a significant period of time. But I do want to highlight one particular point in this debate: that the recent independent review of the Parliamentary Budget Office which was done as part of an inquiry that was established by the JCPAA made a very powerful recommendation—one that I think the government should embrace over the next six or seven months, and one that I hope future governments might give time to consider. That is whether or not the intergenerational report that is done by governments every five years should, in actual fact, be entrusted to the Parliamentary Budget Office and not to executive government or the government of the time.


The reason why I say that inquiry is one that is worthy of very, very detailed consideration is that, when we think about the importance of the intergenerational report for our country and shaping future policy decisions around population issues and future taxation issues, I think it's a fair observation to say that often the good work—the very important work—that the intergenerational report does and the evidence it paints for our country often gets lost because it is a document that is owned by government rather than being independently owned by an office like the Parliamentary Budget Office. If it were to be owned by the Parliamentary Budget Office, I think that the information that's contained in that intergenerational report would be more readily used by stakeholders across the Australian community and would be more readily used and endorsed by governments and opposition parties in framing a more comprehensive policy approach to a whole variety of issues that confront our country not over the immediate term but over the medium and longer term. That is something that, while not specifically addressed in this private senator's bill, is a matter that I think does deserve careful consideration, perhaps again by the JCPAA, which is the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and most certainly by this government. I hope it's something the new Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will put his mind to over coming months. I think it's an important way to shift the focus from what parliaments, governments and politicians often get criticised for, which is having too short-term a focus on policy development and policy implementation, and shift it to a more medium- to longer-term policy approach.


But the substantive issue that we're discussing this morning is whether or not inequality in our country has been increasing or whether or not inequality in our country has actually remained stable. I will talk about the issue of inequality briefly in a moment, but, in discussing whether or not inequality has remained stable or perhaps even decreased in our country, that is not to excuse the very important work that does need to be done to make sure we are constantly addressing issues of workforce participation, making sure that young people get jobs in our country and making sure that women have an opportunity to participate in the country. So debating the point of inequality is not to excuse the very real issues and very real challenges that exist in our economy. We should make sure that Australians, irrespective of where they come from, irrespective of where they live, irrespective of their age and irrespective of their gender, have an opportunity to participate to the fullest extent in the Australian economy. We know that if people get to participate in the economy—that is, they have a job; they're able to save—then they're able to enjoy much of the prosperity, they're able to raise families and they're able to start businesses. And that, of course, is a critical element in what we're discussing.


If we turn to the substantive point—whether or not inequality in our country has been increasing or has remained stable, or whether or not it might just be part of the sloganeering that we hear from the Australian Labor Party as we move closer to a general election next year and whether or not the evidence actually supports the sloganeering—I will be arguing briefly, in the short time available to me, that the sloganeering is not substantiated and not supported by the evidence. I think the first evidence base, if you like, that I'd like to turn to is the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, commonly known as the HILDA survey. The HILDA survey, released in July 2018, just this year, found that relative poverty is at the lowest point in the history of the survey, whilst absolute poverty remains close to record lows. That's the evidence. Whether or not inequality is on the rise in this country or has remained stable—the answer to that question is in the evidence. It's in the HILDA survey released in July 2018. It said that relative poverty in our country is at the lowest point in the history of the survey, whilst absolute poverty remains close to record lows. Again, that's not to say that we shouldn't be mindful of issues of inequality in our country, but, in terms of what the current position is, what the current challenge is, the HILDA survey has been quite conclusive. 


The survey goes on to say that in the period from 2001 to 2016 the percentage of the population in absolute poverty decreased by approximately 70 per cent, from 12.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent, while the percentage in relative poverty—that is, with a poverty line set at 50 per cent of median income—fell from 12.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent. I'll be the first to recognise that it didn't say that poverty has gone, that poverty has been eradicated in our country, because, of course, we know that wouldn't be a true statement. But what it does say and what it makes very clear—the evidence makes it very, very clear—is that poverty has been on the decline in our country, and that's something that should be rewarded. It goes on to say that recent data supports the notion that some income inequality measures in Australia have stabilised since the global financial crisis. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Gini coefficient for income inequality fell from 0.33 in 2013-14 to 0.32 in 2015-16, after growing in the lead-up to the global financial crisis, peaking at 0.33 in 2007-08. So, the most important and reliable source of evidence, the HILDA survey, makes it very, very clear to us that poverty remains close to record levels in our country. 


We can think about why that is. What are the structural features in the Australian economy that allow that to happen? I think it's fair to say that there are a number of elements that have given rise to that very, very stable outcome. The first and most obvious is the sustained growth that has been delivered significantly to Australians over the last 30 years. Sustained episodes of strong economic growth have allowed Australians across the community to enjoy high levels of prosperity. Importantly—and I think it's something that most people in this chamber would agree with—Australia's progressive tax and highly targeted transfer system have substantially reduced inequality, meaning that those who are asked to pay tax in our country are those who are most able to earn and accommodate that tax. But, also, our social security system arrangements are very well targeted, meaning taxpayers' money goes to support those who are most in need in our community. Another structural feature of the Australian economy that I think has helped to stabilise and even decrease those levels of inequality has been the fact that economic mobility in our country is very high, meaning that Australians, during the course of their lifetimes, during the course of their working lives, have been able to move across income distribution scales. That's an important structural feature of the Australian economy that allows issues of inequality to be constantly managed and constantly addressed.


As I said earlier, that doesn't mean we should be blind or ignorant to the fact some Australians might find themselves in periods of economic disadvantage or dislocation as the economy changes, but we can have a mature, sensible, evidence based conversation about inequality while, at the same time, recognising that for some Australians, at particular points in their working life, things might get a little bit difficult. And we have a transfer system or social security system that allows those people to be properly looked after and hopefully return to work.


Of course, there's been a significant development in the time that we've been debating this private senator's bill, which has been probably over the last few months. The Productivity Commission itself, in the last few months, released its own report to say that inequality in our country was not the problem that some people were trying to make it out to be. Indeed, the Productivity Commission report was conclusive. It received a tremendous amount of publicity through The Australian newspaper, The Australian Financial Review and other media sources. It was very, very clear about inequality in our country. The evidence of the HILDA survey was released in July 2018, but the survey was conducted in the period before that. But then, of course, added to that were the comments by the Productivity Commission chairman, Peter Harris, who has since retired, when he said that inequality in our country was not the issue that some Labor members of parliament had tried to make it out to be. What that means is that the parliament's attention is focused on issues where there is no evidence. It means the parliament's attention is not focused on the areas where there does deserve to be greater conversation, greater discussion and greater ideas with regard to possible policy improvements.


I want to quote briefly, if I may, from The Australian Financial Review. It was an opinion piece published on 4 September 2018 in The Australian Financial Review by Mr Brendan Rynne, who is the chief economist at the KPMG, a renowned consulting firm in Australia. I want to read into the Hansard not only what he had to say with regard to the issue of inequality in our country and what he had to say with regard to the Productivity Commission report but also what he had to say with regard to the KPMG's Economics and Tax Centre report that it released in April 2017, which specifically looked at the issue of income inequality in our country. Mr Rynne said in his opinion piece of September 2018 that, like the Productivity Commission report, KPMG's own report, the Economics and Tax Centre report of April 2017 titled Financial stress in Australian households: 'the haves', 'the have-nots', 'the taxed-nots' and 'the have-nothings', 'found that inequality in Australia has been relatively stable, and our tax and transfer system does a good job in equalising incomes between rich and the poor across the nation.' He went on to say:


Both of these studies have shown the proportion of Australian households living in poverty has not materially worsened over the past three decades; the economic prosperity we as a nation have enjoyed since then has been shared between everyone, and not just captured by the wealthiest.


Depending on how you measure it, growth in income inequality in Australia has, at worst, been equal to the OECD average, or at best, been virtually zero.


That's worth repeating: the chief economist at the KPMG—not a Labor senator, not a coalition senator but an independent—said:


Depending on how you measure it, growth in income inequality in Australia has, at worst, been equal to the OECD average, or at best, been virtually zero.


He went on to say:


This means income inequality has stayed constant in Australia while in the—

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2018-11-12,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (10:19):  I rise to speak on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. Inequality has become the new rallying cry of the Left as they continue to peddle the politics of greed, envy and division. We've got a Labor Party here in Australia who have looked across to what Jeremy Corbyn is up to in the United Kingdom, with his politics of envy, with his views on British society and the British state, and they've gone, 'Yes, we'll have some of that; we'll bring that here to Australia.' 


It's ironic that the Labor Party preach to us about inequality while they oppose government measures that give Australians the hand up they require. With Bill Shorten's Labor Party it's always about the handout, not the hand up. It's always about having another review, another study. It's not about what we can do to grow the economy. This modern Labor Party, under Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, is not like the Labor Party of Bob Hawke or Paul Keating. It is a different beast. I may not have liked Paul Keating as Prime Minister when I had reached the dizzying heights of president of the Griffith University Liberal Club—our rallying cry back in 1993 and 1996 was about kicking out Paul Keating, and we finally did that in 1996—but under Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating Labor did focus on market based reforms to improve the Australian economy. It is sad that we will not be able to say the same about Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and the current Labor Party. 


With Labor it's always about taxing the rich, but now it's also about taxing the elderly. We've got a Labor Party who want to tax those who want an investment property. We've got a Labor Party who don't want to give out tax cuts. They want to make the poor poorer. They want to make sure the poor take a handout from government. They don't want the poor to get on that aspirational ladder, to start and grow a business, to start and grow a family, to help grow Australia. What they want to do is protect the trade unions in Australia. This is a segment of the community whose membership rate, increasingly, is going down. In the private sector, just over one in 10 workers are members of a trade union. Why is that? It is because workers recognise that the way to get ahead is not by having this third-party industrial organisation, these dinosaur-era trade unions, trying to negotiate on their behalf. They recognise that unions have forgotten what they're there for. Unions have become just a campaign arm of the Labor Party. They are not standing up for the workers. They use money from the workers to try and get Labor elected and try and keep Labor in power. That is very sad. 


The Productivity Commission, funnily enough, has just done a stocktake of the latest and most complete evidence on inequality. They have found that inequality has decreased since the global financial crisis. One of the main reasons for this is that this country has had 27 years of consecutive economic growth. That is a world record for a developed economy. For 27 years since 1991, since the recession we had to have—when Paul Keating drove the economy into the ground—we've had an economy that has been growing. It has largely been thanks to the economic stewardship of Mr Howard and Mr Costello, in terms of the work they did building on many of the reforms of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. But the work of the John Howard-Peter Costello government between 1996 and 2007, for 11 years, is something that all Australians, regardless of their political allegiance—whether they're a member of the Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, the Labor Party or a troglodyte party that I don't know the name of—should be proud, in terms of growing the Australian economy. 


We were able to have that economic growth notwithstanding the best efforts of those economic troglodytes in Labor. It was when we had Wayne Swan, that noted economist/thespian/union official, who was Treasurer of this country for a long period—notwithstanding his best efforts to ruin the economy. We should not forget that, when Mr Howard was asked by the Australian people in 2007 to update his CV, Australia had no debt whatsoever. In fact, we had money in the bank. It took Labor just under six years to spend all the money in the bank and also rack up over $500 billion of debt. Notwithstanding those efforts, because of the work of Mr Howard and Mr Costello we still had economic growth.


Since the 2013 election, which Mr Abbott and the coalition won, we have been able to continue that economic growth. We've done that through making sure we try to live within our means and making sure that government, where there is a need for government, is small but good; it shouldn't be large and wasteful. We also need to make sure that taxes are as low as possible. We on this side of the chamber believe that the individuals, families and business owners know best how to spend their money, and they will act in the interests of themselves, their families, their business and their communities in terms of how they spend that money. We think that they know best in terms of spending the money rather than allowing government to spend money and continually increase taxes.


The Productivity Commission found that there is a high degree of economic mobility in Australia, including a high degree of economic opportunity. This economic growth has delivered significantly improved living standards for the average Australian in every income segment of the economy. We've all been growing; as the Australian economy has grown, we've all grown. In fact, economic mobility in Australia is higher than in most other OECD countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. This is because our progressive tax system and our broad social safety net, our welfare system, are working together to drive inequality down.


The government's plan for a stronger economy is working, and it is helping to deliver a stronger economy for all Australians. How is it doing this? It is doing it through tax relief or, as I prefer to say, tax cuts—tax cuts to encourage and reward working Australians, tax cuts that keep backing businesses to invest in and create more jobs. We should not forget that, since 2013, a million jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We all want to decrease inequality and we all want to get rid of poverty, and the best way to do that is not by having the Productivity Commission do another study, which is effectively what this bill would propose, but by creating jobs. It is about people working for money. It is about people actually paying taxes that then go back into helping that social safety net. By doing that, it guarantees the essential services Australians rely on.


We're also growing this economy by keeping Australians safe. We are making sure that our borders are secure. We are making sure that we have an immigration system in which we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come. We decide who comes to this country, what skills they have and how they can help grow Australia.


We've also got to make sure that the government lives within its means. The government is delivering on its plan to get the budget back into the black sooner, with the reforms we've made, and also to start paying back debt. One of the biggest roadblocks to inequality in Australia will be government debt. Money we're spending on interest repayments is money that is not going into essential social services. Money that is going into paying interest on government debt is money that is not cutting taxes. We should never forget what Labor did to this economy in the period they were in power between 2007 and 2013. We went from zero debt in 2007 to almost half a trillion dollars of debt in 2013.


The core function of the Productivity Commission is to conduct public inquiries at the request of the Australian government on key policy or regulatory issues bearing on Australia's economic performance and community wellbeing. There is nothing preventing the commission from research and investigation into inequality or its impacts upon community, wellbeing or economic performance. In fact, that's what it's just done. Australia has a progressive tax system. It has a broad social safety net, and our welfare system is one of the most targeted in the world. There's also been wide reform of our age pension system to give more to those on the lowest incomes. We know that the best way to help Australians get ahead is to ensure that every Australian who can work is able to get a decent job. That is why our entire plan is targeted at growing the economy, getting more Australians into work and seeing incomes increase right across Australia.


In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and Labor believe that for some to do better others must do worse. We do not believe that. We think we can all do better. We think that by growing the economy all Australians can rise. Bill Shorten and Labor want to increase taxes and punish the job-creating parts of our economy, and that is a tragedy. The main thing we're doing to improve income inequality is jobs generation, because nothing helps people more than getting a job. The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, called 'HILDA' for short, released in July this year found that relative poverty is at its lowest point in the history of the survey, while absolute poverty remains close to record lows. From 2001 to 2016 the percentage of the population living in absolute poverty decreased by approximately 70 per cent, from 12.6 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the percentage living in relative poverty—and that's with the poverty line set at 50 per cent of the median income—fell from 12.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent.


Recent data supported the notion that some income inequality measures in Australia have stabilised since the global financial crisis. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Gini coefficient, which is used to gauge economic inequality, fell from 0.33 in 2013-14 to 0.323 in 2015-16, after growing in the lead-up to the global financial crisis and peaking at 0.336 in 2007-08. In case Labor has forgotten, in that instance lower is better. The HILDA survey estimated that there has been little change in income inequality between 2001 and 2016, with the Gini coefficient remaining at approximately 0.3 over the 15-year period. In 2016 the Gini coefficient was at its lowest level since 2005. In 2015-16 a total of 3.6 million Australian households received more in government payments than they paid in income taxes. Therefore, around 40 per cent of households do not pay any net tax after benefits. By contrast, in 2015-16 the top 10 per cent of taxpayers paid 45 per cent of total personal income tax.


It's disappointing coming to this debate, because Labor lack credibility on this topic. They have abandoned any pretence of fairness and of taking real action to reduce poverty in Australia. They want to play politics with it. They fail to understand that the best way to address inequality in our society is by economic means. It's not by doing another study, it's not by raising taxes, it's not by taxing one element of the population to subsidise another element of the population and it's not by adopting the Venezuela model of just taxing and taxing and taxing. The best way to decrease inequality is to make sure Australians have an economy that is growing, an economy where businesses will put on new workers, an economy where workers can decide that they want to start their own business.


In Australia we sometimes forget that every large business in Australia started off somewhere small. We forget that businesses like Qantas, in my home state of Queensland, started off in a shed in Longreach when it was the Queensland and Northern Territory Air Service. We forget that that is how that massive business started off. We forget that Coles started off with a single corner store and is now one of the giants of the Australian retail sector. We forget the same with Myer, which started off with a single store. So many Australian business names started off with someone who had been a worker deciding they wanted to start their own business, and they wanted to start their own business because they wanted to a get ahead. They wanted to get ahead for themselves, for their families and for the community. By doing that, they employed more people. By employing more people, we get them out of the poverty trap. We get them out of being reliant on welfare from the government. Even though we do need welfare, we do need to have that safety net for people, we want to make sure they can get ahead and have a job.


Labor's alternative plan for growing the economy is to put $70 billion of extra income tax on Australians. They don't want to have tax cuts for businesses. They will come to the table when they get shamed into it before the election. But let's see, if they ever win an election again in this country, what they will do. We got a pre-taste with what they did between 2007 and 2013. And, heavens forbid, if we fail to win the next election, and Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister, we will have all these economic giants who sit on the opposition frontbench, all these people with their extensive business experience! This might be a fun fact for people to know who might be listening at home: the number of people in the Labor frontbench—there might be an exception here—or indeed on the backbench with business experience is very limited. And that is sad because small businesses and those who work for big, small or medium-sized businesses—but particularly small businesses—do so much for Australia. My fear is that Labor do not understand that small business is the best way for people to get ahead, for that person who has that dream, who sees that empty shop in the main street. My office is in Nambour in Queensland. There are people always wanting to see an empty shop and start a small business and grow it, to make sure they can get their family ahead. And it is tough. But doing another study, doing another report, raising taxes or getting Canberra to tell people what is best for them are not the ways to do it. The best way to do it is to empower people to get ahead.


It was Labor who opposed our tough measures to crack down on multinational tax avoiders when they opposed the 2015 multinational anti-avoidance legislation. One of their many great shames—they have a lot of great shames—was to have voted for leaving $2 billion in the pockets of multinationals instead of supporting our efforts to deliver it to the budget bottom line, funding essential services for Australians. It is Labor who, by voting against the enterprise tax plan, is opposing the Liberal-National government's efforts to boost investment, increase earnings and grow the economy. It is a Labor who have a plan for higher taxes and higher deficits. At the 2016 election, the Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed that Labor's election commitments would have resulted in higher deficits to the tune of $16.5 billion. Higher taxes, higher debt and higher deficits are the worst prescription you can write for the Australian economy. Labor are a AAA threat to our AAA credit rating:


Labor do not have one policy that would help one business invest one dollar or create one job. On housing, Labor's only plan is for higher taxes. We all know that higher taxes don't build houses. Labor's plan is to tax more so they can dole more out for their welfare spending increases, and that is wrong. The best form of welfare, the best way to fight income inequality, is actually a job.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:39):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. I sat here and listened to senators, most recently Senator Smith, talking about inequality and poverty in this country, quoting figures, for example, from the Productivity Commission report on income inequality. While there was some very useful data in that report, what I'm deeply concerned about is quoting the Productivity Commission and the misinterpretation of some of the issues that came up in the Productivity Commission report on inequality, and also quoting the HILDA data and the Gini coefficient. When you actually look into the issues around inequality, you can mask the impact on particular cohorts of Australians who certainly are not doing better. If you look at the figures in terms of the concentration of wealth in this country, you see that in fact the situation isn't as rosy as the government likes to paint it. If you look at the fact that Australia is considered by many now to be the second wealthiest country in the world, poverty rates in this country remain very high. We've just gone through Anti-Poverty Week in October, the week before estimates. When we were looking at Anti-Poverty Week we heard how poverty is affecting so many Australians. Yet you get up here and listen to the government senators and you would think everything was sweet. 


They're ignoring the fact that poverty rates are remaining stubbornly high, with around three million Australians who are suffering deprivation and do not have a good quality of life. There are three million people in Australia living below the poverty line, of whom 739,000 are children. Inequality is baked into our system. When you look at the income share of the top one per cent in Australia, it has doubled. The top 20 per cent now own half of Australia's total wealth. That concentration is growing at a rate that is one of the highest in the world. 


If you look at the recent Productivity Commission report, the way some people are interpreting it suggests that inequality hasn't got any worse in recent years, based on analysis that basically compares the incomes of the highest decile and the lowest decile—in other words, the bottom 10 per cent versus the middle versus the top 10 per cent. The problem with this particular methodology is that it masks what's going on in the analysis for specific vulnerable groups—those vulnerable groups that I was talking about. It is also completely at odds with the reports that you get from the front-line services—Foodbank, for example. I'm going to come back to Foodbank, because we've just heard that it has had its funding cut again. 


If you look at some of the figures from that report and some of the other figures that are quoted, particularly when the Gini coefficient is quoted—it is often misquoted, and it is quite a difficult coefficient to understand—you look at what happened when the age pension increased. I am not for one minute saying that that was not a good outcome. It was a good outcome when the Rudd government increased the age pension. It was something that the Greens had been campaigning for; Senator Bob Brown in particular had been campaigning for it for a long time. Because there were so many age pensions that got that very needed boost, it masked some of the impacts on some of those other vulnerable groups moving more and more into poverty. That increase made the figures look a lot better for that particular group of people that had been living in poverty. Given that we also have a much better indexation rate for the age pension, that has helped that group of people deal with poverty better. That's not to say there are not aged pensioners living in poverty, because there are, particularly if you are a single woman. A lot of them are really struggling as they move into older age, particularly those who are unemployed and have used up their savings. They are moving onto the age pension in poverty.


Basically, it's masking those who are unemployed, single parents and those with a disability who should be on the disability support pension but are in fact on Newstart because of the change in the eligibility tables. Age pensioners have been better off over the term that we've been talking about—from the early noughties through to now—because of that increase, but the government is trying to wipe the slate and say, 'People aren't living in poverty anymore.' It's just not true. That is skewing the figures and masking the fact that, if you are living on Newstart, you are living in poverty. We have to raise the rate of Newstart by $75 a week.


There have been a number of very learned articles about the fact that it is easy to misquote the figures to make them look better without looking at those vulnerable cohorts who are really struggling, such as those on Newstart and single parents. We know from analysis that the poverty rate of children of single parents—and we know that the bulk of those are single mothers—has significantly increased since single mothers were dropped off parenting payment single onto Newstart. 


I promised I would make this contribution short, but let's quickly look at, for example, the stats coming through from Foodbank. Their hunger report was released just a couple of weeks ago. The number of people that they are servicing went up five per cent in the 12 months from 2017 to 2018. There has been an increased call for their services. They are providing a valuable service to feed those people who aren't able to put food on the table, because they are living in poverty. And what has this government done? It has cut their funding again. It is outrageous. You only have to visit their services, which I did recently, to see what an excellent job they do and see how they are supporting vulnerable families who are trying to get by on particularly Newstart, the disability support pension and the age pension. Families are struggling on casual part-time work. They are not earning enough to be able to put food on the table. Foodbank are providing that service. They are supporting people who are living in poverty. 


To imply that this country does not have an issue with inequality is simply ignoring or juggling the facts to make them fit their story. This country needs to wake up to the fact that we have an increasing problem with poverty and we have an increasing problem with inequality. Those who are trying to survive on extremely low incomes and on Newstart in particular are doing it very tough. If you just look at the proper figures and at those vulnerable groups, you will see that this country has a very significant issue with inequality.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:48):  I want to thank all my colleagues for their useful contributions to this debate on the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017. This is a debate we should have more often. It's a shame that, at a time of income stagnation and rising inequality, globally and here, this is one of the few real opportunities that the Senate has been given to debate these issues, and it's only doing so because there is a private senator's bill before us, not because of a government bill to address these issues. Where is the government's legislation addressing income stagnation? What is their plan to address living conditions for Australians? What is their plan to tackle the cost of living? I'm not sure and I don't actually think they know either.


Over the course of this debate, colleagues opposite have spent some time explaining why they don't think it is necessary to have the Productivity Commission regularly and routinely examine inequality as part of its work. I want to review some of these comments because this debate has been on foot for some time and a lot has changed in the intervening period. One senator said:


I am thankful for the opportunity this private senator's bill provides me to speak a little about the Turnbull coalition government's program to reduce income inequality in this country. One of the coalition's flagship policies is of course the enterprise tax plan.


That was in February this year. There are three things clearly wrong with this statement: it's no longer the Turnbull government, they don't have a program to reduce income inequality, and the enterprise tax plan is no longer one of the coalition's flagship policies.


A number of those opposite, during the course of the debate, spoke about their preference for reducing the cost of living for average Australians rather than addressing questions of distribution. One senator opposite said:


First and foremost, this government is tackling the cost-of-living pressures on Australian households. … On the energy front, the National Energy Guarantee, unveiled by the Minister for the Environment and Energy in October last year, will further ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian households, with expected savings of up to $400 per year on their energy bills.


There is another problem with that statement, because, of course, there is now no National Energy Guarantee. The government's figures of $400-a-year savings were always a bit rubbery. Now, however, they're entirely hypothetical. It appears the only climate or energy policy this government has is Direct Action, and that is a policy that should have expired along with the Abbott government. The only policy they have to reduce electricity prices was to have Minister Angus Taylor ask power retailers to do it—to ask nicely. As he found out last week, that is a strategy that doesn't work. Power retailers have refused to provide the lower rates by 1 January as demanded by the minister.


Despite the absence of any program to address inequality or the cost of living pressures or wage stagnation, a number of those opposite opposed the bill on the basis that it was better to take action rather than commission another report. One senator said:


Directing the Productivity Commission to undertake this analysis and provide a report to government is going to do nothing, other than allow us to line the shelves in our offices with yet another report that may well never see the light of day, that will just gather dust and that will not make a jot of difference to the lives of those people we're talking about now.


That sentiment fundamentally misunderstands the nature of policy development. Reports shouldn't line shelves and gather dust. That's not why we commission reports. They should be read. They should be understood. They should be used to inform decision-making. Yes, action is important, but so is understanding the problem. Perhaps this explains some of the struggles that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government have had in developing coherent policies: they don't value or understand evidence, and, as a consequence, they are unable to move in an organised way through cogent decision-making.


It is encouraging to see that the Productivity Commission has in fact already undertaken some of the work outlined in this bill. In August this year, the PC released a research paper on rising inequality. It's a useful first look at inequality that I don't think has been properly digested by Canberra. What does the report tell us about the state of inequality in Australia? It tells us that inequality has been rising over the last 30 years. It tells us that our progressive tax and transfer system has been a substantial factor in reducing inequality, typically lowering income inequality by around 30 per cent, and that government-funded services like health, education and public housing have an additional equalising effect. This is a positive story about how the role of government can deliver for Australians. Sound monetary, economic and social policies can and do reduce inequality. We know we have the levers we need to make change.


However, the PC report also tells us a story of persistent and entrenched inequality and disadvantage. Shockingly, despite 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the poverty rate hasn't decreased. That's nothing to pat ourselves on the back about. We've had 27 years of economic growth as a country, and what have we done for the poorest Australians? Not a great deal. According to the report, around three per cent of Australians are living in continuous poverty. Some Australians move in and out, but there is a core group of around 700,000 people that are in continuous poverty. I invite those opposite to consider what that might actually be like. The commission has, in fact, reported that poverty in Australia is increasing. This is essential information that governments need for assessing the state of inequality in Australia, and that is the point of this bill—to require the PC to regularly produce this information and to ensure that when they are doing their other work they have regard to the impact of other decisions on inequality in our society. 


What is it that the PC recommends we do about inequality? During his address to the National Press Club about the report, the commissioner didn't talk about corporate tax reform as a solution to inequality and entrenched disadvantage; instead, he noted the very low rates of income growth. He talked about productivity growth and pointed to three key areas from the Productivity Commission's Shifting the dial report last year. These areas were higher workforce participation and personal wellbeing, through preventing chronic disease; more adaptable workforce skills, through practical improvements to secondary and tertiary teaching; and reducing the number and complexity of overly restrictive planning and zoning restrictions, to make it cheaper and easier to live and work in our congested cities. Those are ideas for economic reform that we don't hear spoken about here. 


Despite the fact that our premier economic institution raises these, advances them, it is of no interest, apparently, to those opposite, who continue to hang onto the outdated policy prescriptions they worked up in the mid-1980s and are unable to let go of. None of those opposite mentioned any of these issues in their contributions. Senator McGrath suggested that we need to open up property investment for those in poverty and that tax concessions for property investment were really critical in addressing disadvantage. What nonsense. You'd be laughing if it weren't so offensive to the 700,000 people living in continuous poverty. 


There's not just a moral imperative to take serious action in addressing poverty and inequality. It is also likely to have an impact on our economic performance. That is something the Productivity Commission would be asked to consider through its work as a result of the passage of this bill. There is no fixed divide between social and economic policy. It is a porous relationship. When we all do well together our economy does well also. Back in 2012, the BCA, the ACTU and ACOSS released a joint statement and they committed to work collaboratively to support Australians disadvantaged in the labour market. This statement made the argument that there was a level of income support required for jobseekers to allow them to live decently and respond to job opportunities, and below a certain level of income it impedes jobseekers' ability to get into work. It didn't just make the social argument; it made the economic argument too. It said that in doing so we would provide employers with access to workers who had the skills they needed in the workforce. 


More recently, that's been built upon by a Deloitte and ACOSS report. It looked at the economic impact of raising the Newstart rate by about $75 a week. They estimate that the immediate stimulus provided by a decision of that kind would produce an additional 12,000 jobs in the first year. Reforms in social policy can have a direct impact on the economic outcomes of a community. Equally, economic reforms can affect social outcomes—for example, people's health and wellbeing and their ability to participate meaningfully in their community. 


What would a comprehensive response to poverty from a federal government look like? You'd start with action to address income. It's not reasonable that so many people who are working still don't have enough money to feed their families. I went out to Foodbank's warehouse recently in Glendenning. They make the point that of the people they help each month they're not just helping the unemployed and the homeless; their large-scale survey suggests that 20 per cent of people who are in part-time or casual work experienced issues accessing food in the last year. This is not because people are failing to manage their budgets or just need a little bit more advice about income management. There is a working poor, people going to work who cannot feed their families. 


And the payment system needs to be examined. In the case of Newstart, we will conduct a root-and-branch review of the payment system, should we form government, because we know that the rate is too low. We also need to undertake action to improve services. The Productivity Commission has made it very clear that services like health and education—those universal services—make a great deal of difference in ameliorating inequality in this country. That's why Labor, should we form government, are planning a very significant investment in public education, putting back all the money recommended by Mr Gonski and ripped out by the government over the past five years from our schools. That's why we're committing to make preschool available to all three-year-olds and four-year-olds. And it's why we continue to believe that Medicare needs to be funded properly and that the attacks on Medicare need to stop.


These universal services may not be enough for families who are in deep structural poverty. The literature suggests that exposure to poverty in childhood damages a child's development, their future productive capacity and their life prospects more generally. It has economic costs for our society, but surely the moral cost is much greater. Government already run a range of early-intervention programs delivered in the home to support those families. The question is: are we doing enough? As the Productivity Commission has made clear, there is a group of people for whom poverty is an unending reality, and we need to come to grips with it as a society. Unfortunately this is not a challenge that seems to be of interest to the government. The coalition came to power with a very limited set of fixations. They're fixated on unions and on working people's organisations, they're fixated on delivering tax cuts to very big businesses and they're fixated on stopping action on climate change. They struggle to find enthusiasm for any issue that doesn't involve their ideological obsessions, and unfortunately that is most issues. That's why this government find themselves without any plan whatsoever to address income stagnation. That's why they find themselves without any plan to attack poverty.


Having the Productivity Commission report regularly on inequality, as proposed in this bill, will drag these issues back onto the table, because that is where they belong. Australians are facing the very real consequences of policy inaction. Income inequality—sustained poverty—creates a multitude of barriers that affect people's living standards, affect their social participation and extract an enormous human cost. It's clear that the government have no real interest in addressing those concerns. When they do talk about welfare, their focus is on punitive measures. They are focused on monitoring payments and overpayments, chasing up debts from extremely financially disadvantaged groups, and income management. There's no thoughtful discussion about tackling disadvantage. There's no thoughtful discussion about the social and economic benefits that come from investing in our poorest people. This is a missed opportunity—a missed opportunity in social policy as well as a missed economic opportunity. It should be a priority of the government to address this issue. Instead, they choose to simply engage in a war of words.


There's no more hiding behind rhetoric about what past Labor governments may or may not have done. The government have been in power for five years, and their inaction is having serious consequences. Poverty isn't a force of nature; it's not something that exists in isolation. It is forced on people by social and economic structures that inflict harm, and it affects our most vulnerable. Overwhelmingly, it is children and the elderly who bear the brunt of food insecurity and income inequality. Just today we've had reports that the government is nearly halving the funding for Foodbank, our largest food organisation, which nationally provides emergency relief to on-the-ground charities, reaching thousands and thousands of vulnerable Australian families. We should be doing more, not less, to support these people. Addressing poverty in Australia should be core business—a key priority for this parliament and a key priority for the government. But that's not the case. We need to change our institutional arrangements so that now and forever these issues cannot be ignored. I commend this bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-11-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:20):  I move:


That the Senate apologise to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.


In doing so, I echo the words spoken by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 22 October 2018 and in his national apology to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. I also acknowledge the moving remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. 


There is no more significant duty or weightier moral obligation for a decent nation than the protection of its children. They are so much more than just our future. In their innocence, their unconditional trust and their hopefulness they are the best of us. That that innocence was so often shattered, their trust so often betrayed and those hopes so cruelly quashed will forever remain a stain on our national consciousness. That crimes so horrific were allowed to take place for so long, in so many places, with such impunity, defies comprehension. That so many of those who suffered are not with us today, having sometimes taken their lives or languished in poverty, prison or despair, worsens the blow. 


These horrific crimes of sexual abuse occurred in places where children should have felt safe—places where parents trusted that those involved would have the care of their children uppermost in their minds. Predators targeted places like schools and churches, sporting clubs and scout groups, orphanages and foster homes. In many cases the organisations that ran these facilities and services turned a blind eye to the abuses and pretended they didn't happen. These were crimes of unknowable scale. The royal commission estimates that tens of thousands of children were sexually abused in some of Australia's most trusted institutions. Tragically, we will never know the true number. That fact alone will surely haunt our society for a long time. 


The commission's report tells a harrowing story of almost complete failure: the failure to protect the innocent; the failure to believe the victims; the failure to challenge the perpetrators; a collective, systemic national failure. No words will ever be able to wind back the clock, heal the scars or erase the evils of the past. No speech will ever truly satisfy those countless thousands who asked for help but were denied. Why were those vile crimes committed against them allowed to occur? Why were the victims not believed? Why was justice and safety so unreachable? 


I extend the Senate's heartfelt sympathy to every victim and survivor, to acknowledge and honour them and to commit resolutely to responding fully to the recommendations produced by the royal commission. Ultimately, all of us in this place have a duty to do all that we can as best we can to right past wrongs and prevent future evils. I also convey, on behalf of the government, our deep gratitude to all those who contributed to the royal commission's work: to the commissioners and their staff for their tireless efforts; to Prime Minister Morrison and his predecessors, prime ministers Gillard, Rudd, Abbott and Turnbull, for their leadership in steering this important process to this point.


I especially pay tribute to the thousands of Australians who relived the worst chapters of their lives in making submissions and attending private sessions. Their strength and courage have inspired a nation. Without it, the commission's work, which has exposed the darkest of crimes in the brightest of lights, would not have been possible. The commission's work, which included the handling of over 42,000 calls, the receipt of nearly 26,000 letters and emails and the holding of over 8,000 private sessions, provides a path forward that is comprehensive, considered and essential on the long road to national healing. We must honour the courage and endurance of those who suffered. We must honour them by faithful implementation of the commission's findings. As we implement 104 of the commission's remaining 122 recommendations directed to the Commonwealth, with the remaining 18 being carefully examined, I'm confident that we will develop a timely and comprehensive bipartisan response.


As the Prime Minister stated, the Commonwealth government must lead the way. With the commencement of the national redress scheme, with the support of the states and territories, and the establishment of the National Office for Child Safety, which will now report directly to the Prime Minister, federal, state and territory governments across the country are working to establish a national database on working with children which can be shared nationally. We are also removing the ability of child sex offenders to travel overseas without permission. The task before us is a daunting one but, by harnessing the remarkable courage and conviction of the many victims and survivors, it will be achieved.


This is an episode in our nation's history of unfathomable horror, of innocence lost, of trust denied, of hopes and expectations dashed and of the triumph of evil. But thousands of courageous Australians would not be silenced; they would not let evil prevail. They raised their voices. To our collective shame, it took us too long to heed their calls. But they persisted. Despite the pain and the loss, they would not be denied. They roused the nation's dormant conscience into action. On this day and into the future, let us be worthy of them. To the children who suffered so much for so long and in such silence: we are sorry. To the parents, spouses, partners, husbands, wives and children who have struggled with the cruel after-effects of that suffering: we are sorry. To the generations of today and those that came before: we are sorry.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:28):  The opposition joins with the government and, indeed, all senators in expressing our most profound sorrow for the suffering and trauma experienced by all victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. To all of those who experienced abuse at the hands of those whose duty it was to care for you, to nurture you and to look after you: I say sorry. To the parents and family members who suffered the distress and trauma of learning that their precious children had been abused by those they trusted to take care of them: I say sorry. I say sorry for your pain. I say sorry for your suffering. I say sorry for the innocence that was stolen. I say sorry for your loss of dignity, a loss for which we, not you, bear shame. I say sorry for your loss of self-esteem and self-worth—a loss, again, for which we, not you, bear the blame. I say sorry for the burden of grief you have carried for so many years—indeed, for so many decades.


I say sorry to those among you who were forcibly removed from country, from your spiritual home, and then subjected to physical and psychological violence. I say sorry to those who joined youth groups, who joined the cadet corps and military apprenticeship schools and suffered abuse at the hands of those who should have been your carers and mentors. I say sorry to those of you who, fleeing the privations of postwar Europe, were transported to secular and religious institutions where criminal predators exploited your separation and vulnerability. I say sorry to those who were ignored, disbelieved or abandoned when they sought help. I say sorry for the lives irretrievably damaged, for those lives spent in misery or in jail, and for the so many lives which have ended in tragedy. And I say sorry that even though institutions knew about crimes committed against you they did nothing to care for you and that those same institutions and their leaders did nothing to bring perpetrators to justice but instead turned a blind eye or covered up their crimes; I say sorry.


The crimes that were committed against children in institutions, in schools, in churches, in recreational facilities and in community centres are an indelible stain on the reputation of those institutions and on the character of their leaders. But more than that, the crimes committed against children and their families are an indelible stain on our society as a whole—on all of us. If the measure of a society is its caring treatment of those most vulnerable, then we as a society failed you, and in doing so we failed ourselves. By failing to act when facts were known to institutional leaders, to people in authority, to senior members of church hierarchies and to our law enforcement agencies, we as a society condoned the evil of those who committed crimes against children, and we are profoundly sorry for our collective sins of commission and omission.


We should recognise the perseverance and endurance of those very brave Australians—victims and survivors, family members, journalists and police officers—who set in train the royal commission that has brought us to this point. Without them we would not have found ourselves in a position, even at this late stage, to apologise for the pain and suffering that was inflicted, to apologise for the crimes committed and to apologise for the callousness of so many institutional and religious leaders who were complicit in these crimes by looking the other way or by covering them up. But, most of all, the many survivors who came forward and told the truth to royal commissioners about what happened to them showed tremendous courage and selflessness. Their suffering is inevitably relived, pain rekindled and vulnerability experienced once again. Our admiration for their bravery and generosity mirrors the depth of our sorrow that these things happened in the first place. If you had not spoken, the apology and the actions that will follow would never have happened.


The perseverance of the families and relatives of victims and survivors has also been remarkable, and our Prime Minister Julia Gillard displayed her characteristic compassion and courage by establishing the royal commission. This commission, through its persistent determination to give voice to survivors, its findings and its recommendations, has performed a critically important service to the Australian community. It has exposed the appalling suffering of children and young people. It has chronicled the truth. It has identified the criminals who abused them. It has revealed the cover-ups, the complicity and the extent to which religious institutions exploited the law and legal processes to avoid legal accountability. The royal commission has shown us how power and money, entitlement and privilege, corrupt those who preach compassion but deny it to the victims and survivors of their acts. It has made clear for all to see how too many institutional and religious leaders abandoned their duty to protect the most vulnerable. So many placed a wrong construction of the interests of their religious and civil institution ahead of the interests of those who suffered.


This was a callous act. This was an abuse of power, and it harmed many. Justices McClellan and Coate, along with Commissioners Atkinson, Fitzgerald, Milroy and Murray, deserve our heartfelt thanks. There was perhaps no better tribute to the quality of the royal commissioners' work than the comment of one of the witnesses, who wrote, 'You cannot know what it meant to be listened to with such respect and made to feel that what happened to me really mattered.'


The royal commission's findings are horrific and the scale of abuse is overwhelming. Of those survivors who spoke to the commission, 10½ per cent alleged abuse at the hands non-government, non-religious institutions; 32½ per cent at the hands of government-run institutions; 22.4 per cent at the hands of other Protestant denominations; and 35.7 per cent at the hands of the Catholic Church. The commission's report found that, of the 1,880 perpetrators from within the Catholic Church, 572 were priests. Anglican clergy and lay youth leaders were also engaged in the sexual abuse of children, as were officers of the Salvation Army. It appears that each of these denominations harboured sexual predators and, worse, in many cases knew about it, but, instead of acting to protect children in their care, they acted to protect perpetrators and the reputations of their institutions with well-established procedures to cover up crimes, by moving criminals onto other parishes and other institutions where they could continue to prey on children, the vulnerable, the disabled and the powerless. This collusion was an abuse of power. This collusion compounded harm, and we condemn it. Those who we should most admire are the survivors who came forward to tell the truth, to share their hurt, their pain and their violation. So, to the members of the national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse reference group, which has guided and informed this parliament's apology, thank you.


Of course, sorrow for wrongs committed is worthless without genuine restitution. Simply saying sorry is meaningless unless there is repentance and a resolution to prevent the commission of further evils to make things right. Here we must ask ourselves and, more importantly, ask the institutions whether the royal commission's discovery of all these crimes against children has had the requisite impact on leaders, whether there is any repentance for crimes committed. Religious bodies must never again be able to use the separation of church and state as an excuse to cover up and perpetuate criminal behaviour, while simultaneously employing legal tactics to minimise financial responsibility. Hiding behind artificial legal structures and trusts that deny them legal personality is not the behaviour of those showing contrition. Rather, it looks like intention to continue to deny survivors redress and recompense, to compound injury with insult. The extent of the crimes against children at the hands of both secular and religious institutions was the result of failure that was both systemic and systematic. If we are to ensure that such exploitation is never to be repeated, those failures must be addressed as a matter of urgency.


Beyond contrition and repentance is of course atonement. What are these many institutions intending to do to atone for these failures? Atonement demands deep introspection, a thorough reappraisal of how power is acquired, used and protected. It requires significant structural reform on the part of all institutions, and that is the real challenge that faces institutional leaders: how are they going to reform their structures and systems so as to prevent the recurrence of such widespread criminality? Atonement also demands reconciliation, and this is by far the greatest challenge for all of us. To restore trust after betrayal is perhaps the most difficult thing for a person to do. How much more difficult is it for an entire cohort of survivors? Many of the survivors of child sexual abuse and their families retain deep anger towards those who committed crimes and the institutions that harboured them, and they cannot be expected to extend reconciliation and restore trust to those who continue to deny them rights. Reconciliation also demands action on the part of those who offended, and guilt is not expunged by words. All of us who share that guilt, whether through ignorance, inadvertence or indifference, must back up expressions of sorrow and apology with actions that repair damage where we can and restore trust where we might.


The opposition, like the government, supports all the recommendations of the royal commission and we also will work to ensure they are implemented in full. The National Redress Scheme supported by Commonwealth, state and territory governments is key to the journey to reconciliation. The scheme is far from perfect. It is too slow. Some survivors have been unfairly excluded, and some institutions are yet to sign up. It is imperative that institutions sign up and offer their unstinting support. Nothing less is acceptable. Survivors have been waiting decades for redress and, sadly, in many cases, they are running out of time. It is imperative that we in the parliament be guided by the original recommendations of the royal commission and that we listen to survivors throughout this process.


The National Office for Child Safety is another vital element in ensuring children are cared for, nurtured and protected. The safety of all our children is paramount, and it is critical that children are themselves empowered to act in their own interests. They must be taught to recognise danger and to tell their parents and those caring for them when they see or experience something that they think is wrong, and they must be believed. The opposition also supports the establishment of a national centre of excellence. This will help survivors of institutional child sexual abuse to address the issues of stigma, to ensure that support services represent best practice to keep the memory of these injustices alive and to promote awareness of impacts of child sexual abuse and the avenues for its prevention. I encourage the states and territories to support this initiative.


The royal commission has held up a mirror to the nation, and we have been shocked by what we have seen. The nation is ashamed and sorry. But we know that we are better than this and we can do better than this. All of you to whom we say sorry today can expect no less. So, as we beg the forgiveness of those who have suffered such unspeakable pain, we also know we must restore justice and rebuild trust. We must resolve as a nation that we will do everything in our power to prevent this abuse, betrayal and harm from ever happening again.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:40):  I rise to support the apology, to support the government's statement and the opposition's statement and to add some words on behalf of the Australian Greens. We too apologise for the years of abuse, suffering, trauma, the ongoing trauma, the nightmares and the intergenerational trauma that survivors endured, not just in the past but recent survivors as well. As part of the references committee we heard from survivors who suffered recent abuse through institutions. We need to remember that this is ongoing. We apologise for the fact that survivors were subjected to institutional abuse by people that abused the power that they had over innocent young people; institutions that these children thought they should be able to put their respect in and that they could trust. That trust was abused.


Just last week I was in Newcastle. We heard from survivors. We were talking about redress, which I will come back to. People spoke of the fear of answering the door, of the nightmares that they suffered and of the lifelong sentence that people were given through this abuse. We heard of the powerful disincentives to disclose. So we are sorry and we apologise. We also apologise to the prisoners that are currently in our justice system as a result of the abuse that they endured as children in institutions. We apologise to those who were originally going to be excluded from the redress system because of the failure to understand the impact of abuse and its close association with addiction, which leads to interactions with the justice system.


Not only was young children's trust abused, but the abuse occurred again when they were not believed. When they sought to tell people in authority, whether it was the people in authority in the institutions, sometimes it was their parents who actually believed the abusers rather than their own children. We apologise to those children as well.


I know there are lots of quotes that have been used while we have been discussing the apology. When I was in Newcastle just last week, I was given a book by a survivor. It's called Our Little Secret, by Lorraine Hall. I thought that I would quote from her experiences in her book. She said: 'The title of Our Little Secret relates to the shame I felt holding the secret of my abuse. The secrets we hold cause a double bind, meaning the perpetrator will often show attention and love to the victim and then harm the victim. We, as victims, deny a certain aspect of the reality of the abuse and are often confused about love and our attachment to the perpetrator. Survivors take it to be their fault, their shame. Perpetrators hold authoritarian power over us as children and often into our adulthood, rendering their victims powerless. Feelings such as being worthless and not good enough are always present, either in our behaviours or our beliefs about ourselves. Perpetrators either say or imply keeping a secret of the abuse. Secrets are like a curse in as much as the guilt and shame we hold in our self-beliefs. We cannot see shame, but it perpetrates into our mental, spiritual and emotional beliefs about ourselves, right down to our cellular memory. We also hold it in our bodies. What survivor doesn't have feelings or thoughts of being powerless, worthless, not good enough and all alone? Shame and the double bind has been a huge part of my journey, to realise none of it was mine. I needed to take responsibility for myself and let go of these negative beliefs and patterns that I took on. It was not and never was ours or my secret or my fault.'


That is what we also acknowledge and want to say to survivors: it was not your fault. It was not your fault that the abuse occurred. It was not your fault that you were not believed. But you are believed now. We, as a nation, believe you. We, as a nation, are apologising for the abuse. We also need to make sure that we do everything that we can to make sure that child abuse is stamped out in this country—that we have the processes in place to ensure that this is a thing of the past, that we protect and support our children.


One of the key issues that has not been picked up, although apologies have been given—I've heard them—regards those who were not covered by the royal commission; those who suffered physical abuse in institutions that is not classed as sexual abuse. Many, many children were abused in institutions, although it is not classed as sexual abuse. That has also led to years of trauma, and we apologise to you for the abuse that you suffered at the hands of those powerful people in institutions. There was a quote I heard just recently—in fact, in Newcastle—'Trauma sticks, shifts and changes,' which is why we need to acknowledge that the abuse that children suffered has lifelong impacts and the trauma suffered sticks, but it also can change, depending on the circumstances that people confront, and it can shift.


I want to talk about the things that perhaps haven't been talked about. We have spoken about the need for redress and to make sure this doesn't happen again, but there are some issues that are still yet to be resolved that survivors are asking us to address. First, I want to address the issues around redress. We need to make sure that the actions we take as a nation to offer redress, in terms of addressing and offering support to people, are not retraumatising people. For example, people have spoken about the retraumatising aspect of needing to fill in a form to apply for redress. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that part 3 of the form has caused some trauma, but the amendments that are being made, according to survivors, do not go far enough. A very simple point has been made: that there should be a note on the form saying, 'Do not fill this in alone,' because it is very likely that filling it in will have very significant impacts. Things like going to a session or a counselling session with someone to help you fill in the form—being much more flexible about the way we address the form and gathering the information that is required for redress.


The issue around counselling is one that many people want us to address. I've spoken about the trauma that shifts, that sticks, that changes; the intergenerational trauma; the life-long trauma; and the impacts of PTSD. We need to make sure that we have counselling support for survivors for as long as they live. That means not putting a money limit on the amount of counselling that is received. That means making sure that we offer top-quality trauma-informed counselling. These are the issues that survivors have asked us to raise, and we, as a nation, need to continue that conversation to ensure that we're offering those supports.


As has been touched on in other contributions here today and a fortnight ago, the fact that some institutions have for years and years essentially operated as protection rackets needs to be recognised and acknowledged. We need to make sure that institutions are opting in to the Redress Scheme, are acknowledging their role and are no longer continuing to protect people in high places.


We need to go to those hard places that are, in fact, the recommendations that the government is still continuing. These issues are hard—I'm not denying it—but we, as a nation, have to go there. We also need to address issues like the confessional. As a nation, we need to recognise that we need to put children's safety first. Another issue that has been raised with me by survivors is that it still causes deep pain and trauma to see the names of their abusers who have been given honours, and our failure to deal with that. I acknowledge that we need to address that issue, and the Greens commit to making sure that we are addressing that issue.


We, as a nation, are sorry. We are sorry for what happened. We are sorry for not believing. We are sorry for the ongoing trauma and the intergenerational trauma. We also know that this abuse has had not only lifelong impacts but impacts on families. It has torn families apart. It has impacted on children. It has impacted on grandchildren.


We need to follow through on the commitments that we have made to ensure that we get redress right, to ensure that we hold institutions and the people in those institutions to account, to ensure that this does not happen again and to ensure that we help people on their healing journey and acknowledge that they will need to continue to be supported and that there will be ongoing issues in their lives. For example, many people have articulated their deep fear of institutions. What impact will that have on their life in the future? For example, many survivors are ageing. How do we support people in the future as they age? These are all issues that as part of our apology we acknowledge we need to take on and address.


Let me finish with the deep sense of sorrow and grief that we as a nation have felt. We as a nation articulate our support for survivors and our deep apology for the years of abuse, suffering and trauma that they have endured.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (12:57):  Ten years ago young Catholic people from all parts of the globe descended on Sydney for World Youth Day. Held every two years, World Youth Day is the Catholic Church's global festival of faith, prayer and liturgy and a celebration of youth and young adults. In 2008 it was the largest single event on the planet after the Beijing Olympics. Pope Benedict came to Sydney for World Youth Day and Cardinal George Pell basked in the glow of the event. The city itself seemed to be filled with joy and peace. At the time, I was a minister in the New South Wales government and the government spokesperson for World Youth Day. In 2008 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse had not yet taken place, the Irish government had not yet published the Ryan report into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in that country, the movie Spotlight had not yet been made, and most people assumed that the isolated reports of clerical sexual abuse of children were just that—isolated.


I recall a meeting with Cardinal George Pell in the weeks leading up to World Youth Day. My job as a government minister was to oversee the logistics supporting the event—the transport, the health services and the public safety—and to provide media interviews and briefings and public information about the impact of the event on residents and businesses in Sydney. I recall suggesting to the cardinal that we consider that someone may come forward during the event to raise a historic or current complaint of sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy and it would be prudent to plan for a response. I will never forget the cardinal's answer. He gave me a hard look and said, 'No-one would dare disrupt such a joyous occasion with such an allegation.' Then he would have no further discussion with us on the matter. I've often reflected on that conversation. I tell that story today in the context of the national apology delivered by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the other house and here today by Senator Cormann, supported by Senator Wong.


The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was ordered by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012. I pay tribute to Prime Minister Gillard for her determination and courage to help our nation face this dark truth of our story. Ms Gillard attended the apology in the parliament, and sitting next to her, at times holding her hand, was Christine Foster. Chrissie and her husband, Anthony Foster, are the parents of Emma and Katie Foster. Both girls were raped and abused by Father Kevin O'Donnell in Victoria. Father O'Donnell had been raping children for decades.


During World Youth Day, Anthony Foster spoke up, and he spoke out. Anthony and Chrissie had been advocating within the church for a decade, trying to get justice for their daughters and for others who had been victims of sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy. They had been met with silence, with gross inadequacy, and with an unwillingness to acknowledge or appropriately respond to the horror their daughters and other children had experienced at the hands of Catholic clergy. The response of the Catholic leadership in Australia to Anthony Foster's public comments during World Youth Day was dismal. Archbishop Anthony Fisher said that the community should 'stop dwelling crankily on old wounds'. Cardinal Pell said that the church had paid for counselling for the Foster girls and that he really had nothing much to do with the Foster case. 


There are many people who bravely fought and advocated for a royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, but chief among these were Anthony and Chrissie Foster. Their advocacy led to the promise of a commission of inquiry in Victoria in 2012 and then the announcement of a national royal commission later that year by Prime Minister Gillard. The Fosters demonstrate bravery, unflinching determination, ongoing love for their children and all other victims, and an unwavering insistence on justice. Their daughter Emma took her own life in 2008 at age 26 after a traumatic life which included self-harming and drug addiction. Anthony died in 2017, and it was a loss to our nation. It was most fitting that Chrissie, with her daughter Katie, attended the national apology.


I applaud the Fosters' decision to use World Youth Day in 2008 as an opportunity to speak up. The world's media and the nation's attention was on young people and the Catholic Church, and the Fosters knew that there would likely never be a better time in Australia to bring to the fore the dark and diabolical truth the Catholic Church was trying to keep hidden. I can't imagine the pain that World Youth Day in 2008 must have caused the thousands of Australians who suffered horrific abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy. As a former state legislator and a minister responsible for the event, I am sorry.


For the past decade, as a legislator and as a Catholic, I have wrestled with the grotesque juxtaposition that the Catholic Church poses. At its best, the Catholic Church fires up its young believers by preaching the gospel messages and inspiring social action on poverty, inequality, injustice, homelessness, the environment and welcoming refugees. Sydney witnessed this firsthand when World Youth Day came to an often cynical town in 2008. From the moment the first pilgrims landed at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, they charmed the city with their faith, their generosity and their joy. At its worst, though, the Catholic Church has been diabolical to young people. Across the world, the church has presided over the grotesque phenomenon of clerical sexual abuse of children and compounded these sins with weak, pathetic decisions by priests and bishops to hide these crimes.


Through the work of the royal commission, Australia has witnessed the horror perpetrated by the Catholic Church. Five thousand submissions relating to the Catholic Church were made to the commission. The victims' stories are harrowing, and their testimony is raw. In New South Wales, allegations of the systematic cover-up of sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy in the Maitland-Newcastle diocese came to light in 2012 as a result of public comments by detective Peter Fox. The royal commission specifically examined Catholic Church authorities in the Maitland-Newcastle region in relation to allegations of child sexual abuse by clergy and religious. At this stage, the report into the Maitland-Newcastle diocese has not been made public, as the inquiry's terms of reference require that its work does not prejudice current or future criminal or civil proceedings. 


I stand here today, joining the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Cormann, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, endorsing the words of the national apology to victims and survivors of institutional sexual abuse. I do so not just as a senator for New South Wales but also as Premier of New South Wales from December 2009 to March 2011. I acknowledge that on 22 October this year the New South Wales Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, delivered an apology to survivors of institutional sexual abuse on behalf of the New South Wales government. In doing so, she said:


On behalf of the Government and people of NSW, to every survivor, I apologise deeply and unreservedly—for the pain they have suffered, and for the failure of governments and institutions to protect them when they needed it most.


I join with Premier Berejiklian in expressing that apology. 


The stark reality the royal commission lays bare is that our nation failed thousands of young people entrusted to institutions that were supposed to care for them but, instead, abused them. Residential institutions, out-of-home placements, schools, churches, sporting groups, cultural and other community organisations, and youth detention centres perpetrated violence and sexual abuse on those in their care. These organisations failed to acknowledge, punish or protect future victims. They failed to care for the survivor. 


This failure is doubly compounded by state and national public authorities, for they both failed in their duty to protect children and young people directly in their care and, in some instances, in their responsibilities to properly investigate and prosecute. For too long, victims and survivors of institutional sexual abuse have suffered in silence. They have now broken that silence with courage and with honesty and by speaking out through the royal commission. The commissioners listened. They understood. They helped us all understand. The commission has made serious and extensive recommendations, and these are being accepted by the government with the support of the opposition. It is incumbent upon all of us, legislators and the wider community, to ensure we act now and in the future to implement these recommendations. 


The silence of conspiracy and cover-up, of inaction and denial on the part of institutions, is now broken. Australia cannot be silent anymore. We will not deny the suffering of survivors and we cannot say we did not know how to keep children safe in institutional settings, in the future. Anthony and Chrissie Foster broke the silence, during World Youth Day, in 2008. They brought before us their daughters' truth. Now the parliament has spoken and expressed its sorrow for Emma, for Katie and for all the thousands of children our nation's institutions have failed. I also acknowledge that the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, apologised. On 4 October this year, in the presence of Pope Francis, at the Synod for Bishops in the Vatican, Fisher apologised:


For the shameful deeds of some priests, religious and lay people, perpetrated upon you or other young people just like you, and the terrible damage that has done; for the failure of too many bishops and others to respond appropriately when abuse was identified, and to do all in their power to keep you safe; and for the damage thus done to the Church’s credibility and to your trust …


I welcome these words. However, the reality is that the leadership of the Catholic Church in Australia and in the Vatican have yet to take sufficient steps to address the culture of clericalism and the flawed ecclesiology that encouraged the extensive and systematic abuse of children in the church's care. 


The words we say today in the Australian Senate cannot repair this damage or compensate for this failing of our nation's public and private institutions. But they can begin our determination to do what we as a nation can to give comfort, support, assistance and, importantly, justice to survivors. These words must compel us to act. We must ensure that children and young people in institutions, or anywhere else in our care, are safe from violence and abuse now and in the future.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:10):  After decades of enforced silence, business in our parliament was suspended last month to publicly acknowledge and apologise for the pain that was caused by institutional child sexual abuse. I cannot imagine how that must have felt for those who have spent years striving to be heard and striving to be believed. I can only add my voice to what has already been said. I, like the rest of the nation, am truly sorry. I am sorry for what was done to you, and I am sorry for what was not done for you. It is truly unforgiveable.


It was impossible not to be moved by the stories of deeply personal grief and betrayal that were revealed at the royal commission. All of Australia has heard witness after witness speaking with the perfect eloquence of truth. It shouldn't have taken a royal commission for these voices to be heard and to be believed, yet for many it was the first time that they were. Every Australian now knows how children suffered in places that they should have felt safe—in their schools, in their scout halls, in their churches and in their beds. This is uncomfortable knowledge. But that discomfort is not something that we should shy away from; it is something that should motivate us.


We do a great disservice to victims and survivors if we pass off what happened as the work of some other. The perpetrators held positions of authority and respect in our communities. It is wrong to say that evil happened; evil was done. Years ago, in a very different context, thinkers grappled with the concept of the banality of evil—and their conclusions hold some truth for us today. These abuses happened among us. These horrible acts were done by people who led otherwise respectful lives; they were ignored by others who found it easier to stay silent in institutions that were happy for children to pay the price for maintaining their public reputations. We cannot begin our reckoning with that past until we recognise our culpability as a community for what occurred, and we cannot complete that reckoning until we make sure that the past cannot be repeated.


I know that the act of appearing before the royal commission and reliving what happened took a toll on many people. So too did the years of advocacy and the battle for justice that came before it. Victims and survivors did this not just for themselves but to make sure that no other child would have to live through what they did. The royal commission has generated a comprehensive list of reforms, and there is no excuse or reason for resiling from them. As the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said in the other place, Labor will, wherever we sit in this parliament in coming years, unequivocally support the implementation of the royal commission, with no discounting or delay. This is something we owe to the children whose suffering brought about the royal commission. It is also something we owe to those yet to come. The apology has been described as a once-in-a-generation event. It must not become a 'once-a-generation event'. This must never happen again.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (13:13):  On behalf of Centre Alliance—including my Senate colleague Rex Patrick and the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie—I rise to speak on the national apology to Australian survivors and victims of child sexual abuse. In doing so, I endorse the sentiments expressed last month in support of this motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. I commend them and the contributions made today in this place, because the apology acknowledged the failure of Australian governments since Federation to afford children the protection they surely deserve.


Australia is on a mercy mission to ask childhood victims of institutional abuse to forgive us, to find it in their hearts to accept our collective, heartfelt apology for the heinous crimes they endured and that shame us as a nation. We're ashamed of the sexual abuse committed against terrified children in orphanages, churches, children's homes, recreational groups and foster care by those who were mistakenly trusted to care for them. In many cases, powerful people in taxpayer funded state-care positions abused the public faith put in them by turning a blind eye to what was happening. Others were more sinister in their offending, as one case in my home state illustrated.


In 2015, Families SA child protection carer Shannon McCoole was sentenced to 35 years in jail with a nonparole period of 28 years for sexually abusing babies and young children in state care. McCoole was also the head administrator of a highly sophisticated dark web child pornography site. He was arrested only after Danish police identified one of his photos and informed local authorities. McCoole's crimes prompted SA's own child-protection system royal commission. That inquiry heard that a colleague had reported McCoole for the suspected rape of a six-year-old girl a year before his arrest. But because McCoole had gained the trust of his managers, they dismissed the complaint without even reporting it to authorities. I'm still shocked that he could offend for so long under the nose of a government department and that reports of his evil could be ignored by that same department. All the while, his offending continued, and each time another little life was forever damaged by his putrid actions.


The National Redress Scheme, the National Office for Child Safety and the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations will indeed go a long way towards fixing the problems within institutions. But, sadly, the motion before us cannot be taken to mean that child sexual abuse is a thing of the past. The only way to tackle it is to be ruthless in identifying and reporting offenders and to do our utmost to ensure that children are not put in harm's way. First and foremost, that means listening and acting when suspicions are raised rather than ignoring, dismissing or minimising them. Like domestic violence and elder abuse, child sexual abuse, especially in the form of incest, has long been and in many cases still is taboo.


Despite the pain involved, Australia is becoming a more mature nation. We are confronting our past, acknowledging our failures and making more amends and efforts to eliminate multiple cycles of violence. Unfortunately, that can't be said for millions of other children throughout the world. In this respect, Australia is leading by example. However, in this global online age we must be ever alert to how the problem of child exploitation is continually changing. As the McCoole case proves, the internet looms large in those changes. With public institutions now becoming more tightly controlled, it's fair to say that predators are turning to the internet to create their own private groups. The eradication of child abuse in any form is and will always be a work in progress, and it is one that this and future parliaments must continue to be engaged with for the good of our nation.


This motion goes some way towards expressing the sorrow and guilt we all feel as a nation for the loss of innocence experienced by victims and survivors. It acknowledges this parliament's responsibility towards participating in their healing. It is undeniably our responsibility to say to the victims who prevailed over their torment—and, sadly, to those who didn't—that we are deeply sorry that they were treated like easy targets and not precious children, abused rather than nurtured, starved of love rather than nourished and encouraged, and left out in the cold when they should have been brought into the warm. We can't say 'sorry' enough for the cries for help that were ignored or never heard, the stories of extreme cruelty that were never believed, and the tales of physical, emotional and sexual torture that were pushed aside.


But, most of all, we are so sorry that it has taken this long for Australia to properly take notice and finally take action against a despicable wrong. The royal commission's final report reveals insights gleaned from over 8,000 private sessions with survivors, along with institutional responses to child sexual abuse. The gut-wrenching facts are that the average age of victims when first abused was 10 years old, over 58 per cent of survivors confirm the abuse took place in an institution managed by a religious organisation—primarily Catholic—32.5 per cent were in a government-run institution; and 10.5 per cent were in a non-government, non-religious institution. Alarmingly, of the survivors who provided information about the frequency of their abuse, most said that they had experienced multiple episodes and many by multiple people. And this is just skimming the surface of the sickening prevalence of such crimes over many decades. 


I thank the royal commission for acknowledging that people have been dying to change things and get the justice they deserve. We will all be doing everything in our power to deliver on its recommendations. We will use our power and authority to take action without compromise. But, above all, to those victims who stepped forward to bravely share their experiences, we owe a profound thanks. Without this, we would not be where we are today. So thank you, on behalf of generations to come. And, finally, I would like to add my voice to say, however belatedly, we believe you, we respect you, we applaud you, and we owe you an everlasting debt of gratitude.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (13:21):  I rise to contribute some remarks to the debate on the motion of Senator Cormann. I'd also like to acknowledge those of my colleagues who have spoken before me. Our children are our greatest gifts. Their innocence should always be protected. The crimes against these children who were robbed of their innocence have stained our nation. The cover-ups of these crimes have stained our nation. The fact that these children were not heard or believed has stained our nation. The stain on the nation has touched all of us. It's heartbreaking. I want to pay tribute to the so many who have helped us to get to this point. Whether they be survivors, advocates, in the legal profession or policymakers, I thank you. To those who made the painful and brave decision to come forward to the royal commission, thank you. You've made a difference and you are part of the reason why atrocities like these will hopefully never happen again.


I'd like to acknowledge the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, for setting up the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2012. I thank the former Prime Minister for her courage and for ensuring that the royal commission got to the bottom of all these harrowing stories, because her acknowledgement and her belief that the children should be heard have done more to protect the children of the future than anyone else has done. The applause she received and the way the room erupted when she was in Canberra last month for the national apology is a testament to the profound impact she had on the lives of so many. Today, we honour every survivor in this country. We hear you, we believe in you and we are so sorry. We also honour and remember those who are no longer with us. The words spoken in this place today are for you. Our words are also for your families. As many have said in the other place, as a nation, we failed you, and this will always be our shame. The perpetrating institutions of this abuse, who covered it up and refused to be held accountable, failed dismally. They failed these children and they failed all of us. As former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said back in 2012, 'These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject.' I'm sorry for this pain that can never be undone.


I don't think there is any state or church in Australia that wasn't touched by this evil. As a woman of faith, I'm deeply appalled at the institutions and the churches that failed so abysmally to stand for the values they were supposed to represent. I'm profoundly sorry for the experiences that people have had at the hands of people who should have known better, at the hands of those who breached their trust—trust given by our society, trust that was so disgracefully destroyed. Nothing can take away the deep, harrowing sadness, pain, emptiness, helplessness and betrayal that you have all lived with for too long. Nothing can take away the tears and the emotional exhaustion that still fatigues you to this day. You carry the pain with you every day, and I am so sorry for the things you have missed out on, the things you've been unable to enjoy, the things you've been held back from and the lives you will never get back. There are survivors who have spoken about not wanting to go on anymore. They feel crushed under the astonishing weight of the pain they carry with them every single day. Thank you for showing up, for fighting and for being part of the process. Thank you for being brave and giving strength to others who are yet to, or may never, share what happened to them.


I know a lot of words are used in this place, and I know that actions speak louder than words. There has been great momentum from the royal commission, but we need to keep moving forward. As the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, rightly put last month, it is now up to those in power, no longer just the survivors and the victims and their advocates. Sadly, even though I wish we could, we can't promise a country where abuse no longer exists. But we can promise a country where we commit to hearing and believing our children. We can commit to ensuring that we, as a government and a community, do our very best to ensure such abuse never happens again. We can ensure that we continue to do what the royal commission did so well, and that was to listen to the people whose lives have been damaged by treatment that they did not deserve and that they did not ask for. In acknowledging how real this pain is, we can commit to an effective redress system.


I won't for a second pretend that the National Redress Scheme can make up for the pain, the suffering and the trauma experienced by survivors, but redress is a vital step along the path to healing for survivors of child sexual abuse and is a vital step for all of us as a nation and a community. It's incumbent on all of us as parliamentarians to work together to get the rollout of the National Redress Scheme right. This is imperative. Survivors have been through so much and have waited so long. It is absolutely imperative that we get this right. I think it's so important that we continue to work together to right the wrongs of years gone by and to ensure that those events can never be repeated so that the institutions and the sporting groups and the Scouts and the churches that are entrusted with the care of children actually deliver that care. The stain left on our nation is something we will have to live with. These churches and institutions must work to restore the faith and trust of the community that they serve. There's been so much damage and hurt, and trust has been broken. It's time for healing; it's time for our nation to say sorry.


I will close by simply saying that we are sorry. I am so sorry. We believe you. I believe you.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:29):  I rise to add my voice to those who have already honoured the bravery of the survivors of sexual abuse and the profound impact their stories have had on our national history and shared future. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge my colleague Senator Siewert for being a powerful voice, through the royal commission, in listening and understanding and working with a journey of healing with the survivors of sexual abuse. 


The royal commission took over four years and more than 2½ thousand referrals to reach its conclusion. The stories exposed the shocking, systematic abuse of children at the hands of powerful institutions, institutions like the church, schools, foster homes and orphanages, sporting clubs and many others. They are institutions that committed acts of unspeakable cruelty, where perpetrators were given safe harbour for the rape of young children and were allowed to continue this shocking behaviour with impunity. 


I say to the survivors: I can't imagine your pain; the hurt; the tears of shame; or the kids alone at night, crying themselves to sleep, not believed, wondering what they did wrong to bring this on themselves. I say to you, the survivors: thank you for your bravery, for sharing your stories, because now many of these powerful institutions have had their day of reckoning. They were exposed throughout the royal commission of caring more about their own reputations and protecting their own colleagues than they cared for the children who were under their protection, with the resistance, the lack of remorse and the lack of empathy eventually giving way to a national call for action to stop this from ever happening again. They were only held to account because of your bravery, your courage—the courage of survivors—and your determination to see justice being done. 


On behalf of the Greens, on behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to thank those of you who have reached into your traumatic pasts to share your stories. You have contributed to some of the changes already made, and you will be instrumental in ensuring reforms that are yet to come. I cannot imagine your pain or the courage needed to share your stories, but, please, take pride in the fact that you have truly helped to shape the course of history in this country. You've created this moment, a moment of national determination that nothing like what you have endured at the hands of the powerful will ever happen again to future generations. We salute your bravery. I'm certain that many survivors have still kept that trauma to themselves, to be shared only with closest loved ones, some taking this secret to the grave. For many of you, putting down your past on paper, speaking your lives into the commission's transcripts of evidence, would have been too much to bear. You must carry that pain around with you every day. 


I had the great privilege of being in the Great Hall only a few weeks ago, and it was clear that that pain was still palpable. It was raw. It was on the surface. Many of you are being asked to trust another institution to deliver justice when you've been let down so badly, for so many years, by other powerful organisations. On behalf of my colleagues, I pledge to do everything we can in this chamber to stop this from ever happening again. There is no more solemn duty than to ensure that children can thrive in a caring, loving and supportive environment, free from even the slightest sign of physical and mental trauma. All children should be safe. We owe them nothing less. 


This royal commission was also due to the bravery of others—people who were prepared to speak truth to power, who were prepared to sacrifice their own advancement to speak on behalf of the voiceless. Detective Chief Inspector Peter Fox, who was the whistleblower who saw it as his responsibility not to stay quiet and not to let this suffering continue, should be honoured. He chose to publicly expose the church's covering up of evidence about paedophile priests and how police investigations were methodically silenced. We thank him. It was Prime Minister Julia Gillard who responded to Mr Fox's evidence, using the powers that only executive governments have to launch a royal commission. It was a call that the Greens had made on a number of occasions, and we wholeheartedly endorsed this move by the former Prime Minister. We saw only a few weeks ago how grateful the many survivors were for Ms Gillard to be there in the room and to have allowed the course of history to change forever.


That is our duty: to care for people; to ensure that justice is done; to make right the wrongs of the past; to acknowledge that we can never undo the suffering, the pain, the trauma or the hurt but we can change the future that young children are born into. That is the test of whether this apology will have force, whether this apology is one that moves beyond an acknowledgement of the past and, indeed, allows us to change our future. Our solemn pledge is to do everything that we can do to make sure that these sins are never repeated.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (13:37):  I too rise today to offer my most sincere apology to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. I thank former Prime Minister Julia Gillard for having the coverage to set up the royal commission and I thank Senator Cormann and Senator Wong for leading the apology to victims and survivors in this place today. I want to start quickly with my own story. My father was sent out here as a child migrant from England and he grew up at Fairbridge in Western Australia. Thankfully, my father was not a victim of child sexual abuse, but others at Fairbridge were: children that he knew and children that he loved. His brother was also sent out, and what they did suffer was hardship and abuse, but it was not sexual, and I think that's one of the great areas that we have to pursue into the future: that children in institutions were treated appallingly. They were beaten. They were put to work. They were just not treated as human beings, and my father was in that category.


I know firsthand what it feels like to have your family ripped apart. I've just recently met my cousin in the UK. I look like my grandmother. I didn't know that before. Of course, I never knew my paternal grandmother. I look like my cousins. I share the same name as them. All of this my father lost, and it was lost to me and my children. That is one of the legacies of children in institutions.


Of course, to then abuse children in the way that happened in our country is unbelievable. To have people in positions of trust that sexually abuse those children, that thought that those children were there for them to abuse and to sexually abuse—and we know that it ruined lives. We know it tore families apart, and what has happened in our institutions, in our schools and in our churches is absolutely unforgiveable. The best that I can do today is to stand here as one of the many senators and offer my apologies.


But I want to focus particularly on First Nations Australians, because it should not have taken that royal commission. In my own state of Western Australia, there's no doubt that First Nations people have been treated harshly and cruelly in the land that is their own. In Western Australia, the first royal commission was held in 1905. We knew then that children in institutions were being raped—we knew that. That inquiry was not about the sexual abuse of children; it was about the harsh treatment of natives, as they were called in those days. But, nevertheless, the abuse of children, the rape of children, the harsh treatment of children became a feature of that royal commission. Nothing changed. In fact, after 1905 we saw a harsher regime. AO Neville eventually became the protector of Aboriginal people in Australia, and we saw a regime that became much more harsh. 


Another royal commission, the Moseley commission, in 1935, looked again at what was happening to First Nations people. Again, one of the consequences was that that royal commission heard about the sexual exploitation, the sexual abuse of Aboriginal children in care. We know, as the colonisers of this country, that we have had a history of murder, of taking children away—and it goes on. There were more reports. In 1997, we had the Bringing them home report. There are horrific stories in there. 


Of course, there were many people, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, who were not able to tell their stories to the royal commission. I stand here today and apologise to those people, to those victims and to their families, to the many thousands who were not able to tell those stories.


There are many stories in the Bringing them home report. One of the institutions particularly close to me is Sister Kate's, which was an institution set up in the 1930s by a nun who took light-skinned children to, allegedly, give them a better life. I know that because my mother taught the children from Sister Kate's at Queens Park Primary School. Some of those children were sexually abused at Sister Kate's. This is unbelievable, but anyone could come and knock on the door and offer to take those children home for the weekend and home for the holidays, and many of those children were sexually abused. Sadly, I'm not sure if any of that got before the royal commission, but it is in the Bringing them home report. So it should not have taken a royal commission to get to where we are today. 


I applaud the men who, in that tearful way, told their stories on television and who, over and over again, were just not believed. I would hope that, if we've learnt nothing else, we have learnt that when children tell us an injustice has been done to them that the first thing we should do is believe them, because the damage that has been done is there, and it will continue into the next generation and the generation after that. 


From Western Australia's perspective, from 1905, when those first official reports were made, to where we stand today, we knew what was happening, at least to First Nations children. In the 1930s, we should have known what was happening in institutions. It took until Prime Minister Gillard had the courage to set up the royal commission for those people's stories to be told once again and for us to now stand in this place and say that we believe them. 


I would hope, as we've heard other senators in this place say today, that this would never happen again. But it's on all of us to make sure that children who are in institutions—and Western Australia, sadly, is leading the way. We have many, many children in out-of-home care. Most of them are First Nations children. In fact, the Healing Foundation said just recently that, of the children whose stories were told at the royal commission, 14 per cent were First Nations children. This is unforgivable. We have to do better. If that takes laws and it takes dollars, if that takes investing in early childhood and investing in communities, then that is what has to happen—because we can never allow what the royal commission has uncovered to happen again. My apologies are on the Senate record.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (13:45):  Today I will add a few words to this heartfelt apology being made by the Senate and by this parliament to victims of institutional child sex abuse in Australia. The sad truth is that people I care about deeply are among the victims of such heinous acts, acts that have life-long consequences. I want to acknowledge all of those who fought so bravely for the acknowledgement and recognition of this issue—for redress, for apology, for justice and, most importantly, to recognise that we need to listen to children and that we must have robust institutions and a society that never allows this to happen again.


The evidence before the royal commission exposed heinous crimes perpetuated against vulnerable children. And the evidence largely shows that it should have been seen for what it was at the time—that there were enough people who should have known at the time that something needed to be done. Many children did try and speak up about their abuse but were ignored. The reputations of adults and institutions were privileged over the vulnerable victims of crime. I've spent some time reading the narrative stories in the royal commission's report—and there are thousands of them. In many of those cases someone knew, or should have known, about the abuse that was happening. In other cases children had been intimidated and frightened into remaining quiet. That powerful people in institutions should privilege themselves over the charges in their care is in and of itself also a heinous crime. A failure to provide a protective environment, a failure to believe children, and a culture that diminished their rights and voices of children—environments like that must never be allowed to fester in our nation again.


There are very deeply shocking accounts for which our nation must hold itself properly accountable. The case studies and private sessions left absolutely no doubt that a great many people, thousands and thousands of Australians, were injured by being subjected to sexual and other forms of abuse while in institutions or in connection with institutions with responsibility. I read stories of child protection systems returning children to abusive families where convicted paedophiles resided. We heard stories of institutions where systemic abuse occurred. The pages of the royal commission's report and, most importantly, the narratives and personal stories reveal the history of people who had their childhoods utterly shattered. Their childhoods were taken from them and their trust in people was broken and damaged. I really encourage people to look at the private sessions that have been written up so that you can listen not to this parliament but to the voices of those who have been missing in this debate for too long. From the evidence presented to the royal commission, their injuries, both physical and psychological, have been severe and lifelong and play out in a great many ways in terms of people's personal relationships, their employment, their children and their involvement in the criminal justice system. The impact of these crimes is lifelong.


It was also clear, as I said before, that in a great many cases the abuse was known about and not stopped or prevented and perpetrators were not held to account. I'm going to share one of those stories with the chamber today. Kaden was made a ward of the state when he was three. He spent time in a number of children's homes and juvenile justice centres in New South Wales in the 1980s. He was physically and sexually abused in at least three of those institutions. They were, according to Kaden, 'a cesspit for paedophiles—one big paedophile ring'. As well as the abuse he experienced at the hands of at least 15 to 20 workers at the institutions, Kaden told the commissioner that the boys were beaten and restrained excessively. He said:


I've seen kids get their arms broken and their shoulders popped out ... it was horrible.


To escape the abuse at one such institution, Kaden began running away to Kings Cross. He said:


I've been a heroin addict since I was 10, and started shooting up at the age of 10 and you know, suppressed the things that happened to me. I never wanted to talk about it. When I was stoned, I could deal with it. When I weren't stoned, it was just, yeah, it played on my mind.


This young man grew up to become very violent. He said:


I had a lot of anger in me ... I was very violent drunk, so I stopped drinking ... I believe if things like that never happened to me, I ... probably wouldn't be in jail. Most of my crime is violent assault ... It stuffed me up, me childhood, basically. I've been in and out of institutions all me life. I'm starting to break the cycle now.


He's currently on methadone, and he said:


I want to try to get off that as well and live a normal life ... but one step at a time.


One reason Kaden chose to start speaking up about his abuse a couple of years ago was that, as he said:


I don't cry ... My people, my family, they think I'm heartless, and they don't understand, like the effects that it had on me as a child, because I don't speak about what happened to me, and they've only known me to be violent and they don't know why.


As well as his issues with anger, Kaden finds his relationships with other men difficult. He said:


I can't be comfortable with men ... My uncles and my real father, they can't show no affection towards me. Like if they go to touch me, I pull away from them ... I told [my father] things had happened to me as a child and he tried to comfort me and I pushed him ... 'You can't touch me, Dad.'


Kaden received copies of his records with the help of the Legal Aid service. He said:


There was a lot of stuff in there that just blew me away. There were things in there that I didn't even know ... that helped me, with a bit of closure and that. But there was a lot of stuff that was upsetting ... I was placed in a paedophile ring and they knew about it, but there was nothing done.


Kaden told the commissioner that there are reports in his file about him being sexually assaulted at two of the institutions. He said:


It's written. It's actually written there in my documents—


but nothing was done about it. He said:


I come out with it, I said. 'He's touching kids,' you know, and I was all hushed up ... and sent to another joint ... They made out I was being violent towards the other kids and got me sent to [another institution]. A lot of shit got covered up.


When a female worker at one of the institutions tried to help, 'she got bullied and sacked from there because she wanted to know what was going on and she tried to come out with it'.


Kaden chose to come forward to the royal commission. He said:


If I can stop one kid being touched, it's better than nothing. At the end of the day ... something's got to be done about the institutions ... I honestly believe that ... even myself, I was being bounced between [those institutions] ... basically, I was just being passed around, you know.


Kaden told the commissioner:


I'm still here to talk about it, so that's the main thing. There's a lot of people that I was in the institutions with that are not alive no more, you know, take their own lives or OD'd or whatever the case may be, but I'm still here to talk about it, so that's the main thing.


There are thousands of these stories on the royal commission's website, and I encourage members of this place and the community to take stock of what has truly happened in our nation and the blind eye that we turned to the abuse of our nation's young people. If this place, if this chamber, has any purpose at all it should be to make sure that we listen to people who have been forgotten in our nation—to listen and act to ensure effective redress and, most importantly, to protect children in our nation from now on and always. I know abuse still happens in our society. It happens in families. It happens in institutions. We can't pretend that grand statements in this chamber will prevent that overnight, but we can and must do more.


We have been too slow in picking up and adopting the recommendations of the royal commission. It has taken, frankly, too long to see many of those recommendations implemented. I have paid close attention to those recommendations, and they did not make their recommendations lightly. The evidence from victims of this abuse give a clear mandate to the recommendations of the royal commission. They should be implemented faithfully, and the task for all of us now in this parliament is to follow, faithfully, the recommendations that have been made by the commission to protect our nation's children. The commission got its job done very efficiently, in a timely manner, but it is of great concern to me that the time line for a great many of the recommendations has already gone a long way beyond what the royal commission recommended they should be. If there is one message I have for the chamber today it is that we have been too slow not only over the great vast history of this abuse but also in responding to the need of making sure this never happens again. 


Revealed in the pages of the royal commission's final report is a history of the betrayal and violations of the hearts, bodies and wellbeing of thousands of fellow Australians, Australians who were children at the time of this abuse. It should be unimaginable that our institutions or individuals could have participated in, perpetuated, tolerated, covered up and condoned every aspect of this abuse. We need to face up as a nation to exactly what has happened, to provide meaningful redress and to say sorry as we do in this place today and to mean it. It is critical that we take the human rights of children in Australia seriously and uphold them. We must listen to the voices of children who have been so much missing from this debate.

Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (13:58):  In rising to speak on the motion moved by Senator Cormann, the apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, I would like to acknowledge the contributions made by those who have already spoken: the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Cormann, Senator Wong, and members and senators from all parties and the crossbench. There are times when our parliament needs to rise above party divisions, and this is certainly one of them. I recognise the sincerity of the emotions experienced and expressed by all of the speakers. 


I want to acknowledge the leadership shown by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard when she announced the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in November 2012. It will be, perhaps, her finest legacy. As she said at that time, too many children have suffered child abuse but have also seen other adults let them down. They've not only had their trust betrayed by the abuser but other adults who could have acted to assist them have failed to do so. There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil. Julia Gillard was determined that Australia could no longer avert its eyes—

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:02):  What I can confirm is that the Prime Minister has a great commitment to the future success of our tourism sector. It's a very important sector in the Australian economy. Many small businesses across the Australian economy have benefited from the Prime Minister's strong commitment—for example, to ensure that small businesses in the tourism sector have access to an internationally more competitive business tax rate, which is something that Labor initially opposed and then decided to support.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, on a point of order.




Senator Wong:
  It's on direct relevance, Mr President. The question was about the Prime Minister keeping information from the board and failing to follow procurement guidelines. It had nothing to do with tax rates.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cormann, Senator Wong has reminded the Senate of the question. I note you have 30 seconds remaining to answer the question.




Senator CORMANN:
  In relation to matters to do with the report by the Auditor-General, I have already taken the substantive question on notice. I'm now just making the broader point that the Prime Minister has a longstanding outstanding track record in supporting a vibrant tourism industry for Australia as a very important part of a successful Australian economy.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senators Collins and Farrell today relating to the Prime Minister (Mr Morrison).


In the late noughties, Tourism Australia's 'Where the bloody hell are you?' campaign was in full flight. It may not have brought many new tourists to our country, but it did bring Lara Bingle, now Worthington, onto screens and social pages across Australia. But there was another career that rose from the spectacular marketing failure, and that was the career of the then managing director of Tourism Australia, Mr Scott Morrison. It would be a few years, of course, before Mr Morrison would rise to be the PM. He would have to win preselection first. For those who have forgotten, in 2007, it was actually Michael Towke who was preselected for the safe Liberal seat of Cook. That preselection contest attracted a large array of candidates, including Paul Fletcher and Mr Scott Morrison. Mr Towke easily won the preselection. He beat Mr Morrison 82 votes to eight. But, in the weeks that followed the preselection, a number of news articles questioned the legitimacy of this preselection, which ultimately saw him disendorsed. This led to Mr Morrison being preselected, and Mr Towke commenced defamation proceedings and obtained a substantial settlement. But, by that time, of course, from a political perspective, the damage was done. Mr Morrison went on to be a minister and a shadow minister before emerging from the chaos of this year as Prime Minister. An expose in this weekend's Saturday Paper has brought the conduct of Mr Morrison at Tourism Australia back into question. Why, after a decade, should Australians care? Because the events, as detailed in that expose and in the contemporaneous Auditor-General's report, raise serious questions about competence, about governance and about probity. They are raised in relation to a man that no single Australian knew could be the Prime Minister when they voted in the election in 2016. 


Prime Minister Morrison has steadfastly refused to answer the question of why he is the leader instead of former Prime Minister Turnbull. But, in the absence of any explanation, voters are entitled to turn to his past to try and understand who he really is and what he brings to the job. There are serious questions of competence raised by the events, because, all the indications in the material that is available to us are that Mr Morrison struggled to perform. In answering these questions, Senator Cormann tried to point to performance as a reason for Mr Morrison's ascendancy. But, if we look back, Michelle Grattan reported at the time: 'Sources close to Tourism Australia board told the Herald it was a unanimous decision to force Mr Morrison out. There was no dissent whatsoever. Nobody was happy. We wish there had been a better outcome, but the board was absolutely unanimous.' The Australian, likewise, reported the relevant minister as saying: 'We've moved on it. It was without question the right decision by the board.' That's what Ms Bailey said of Mr Morrison's departure. In The Australian, they went on to report, 'She said she was seeking a replacement for Mr Morrison who would be more of a team player, capable of working closely with state bodies, industry and the government.' Is this the man that the Liberals want as Prime Minister—someone who couldn't work with state bodies, industry and government?


There are also serious questions about governance and probity. The Auditor-General's report suggests there were serial irregularities in the way that contracts were awarded by Tourism Australia. For instance, the Auditor-General found that while Prime Minister Morrison was its managing director, Tourism Australia requested that tenderers commence work on contracts worth $184 million before contracts were even executed and that Tourism Australia's risk mitigation was ineffective. These questions around competence, probity and governance are serious questions and they require answers from the government.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-11-12,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:10):  Normally, it's a pleasure to join the take note debate after question time, but more and more I become disillusioned when we get to this part of the day and focus on things that I don't think the Australian people are too terribly interested in.


Question time came after two weeks out of this place—two weeks where all of us should have been out and talking to the people who we represent in this place; the people who elect us. They are people who have concerns and who are struggling to pay their power bills. They are people who want to make sure that their kids have jobs in the communities they live in. I'm sure they would have been communicating to Labor senators who asked questions in this question time about the issues which matter to them. I'm not sure how many Australians sat there and said: 'Do you know what, Senator X, Senator Y and Senator Z? Why don't you go down to Canberra and ask some questions about the Prime Minister from some report by the ANAO from 10 years ago? Go down there and see what you can find out about it. Why don't you go and play the man, not the ball?' Those opposite adopt the usual tactic that they seem to employ more and more as they run out of ideas and as they run out of steam in the lead-up to the next federal election: 'Why don't you go and besmirch someone's character by dredging things up?'


Clearly, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate said in answer to questions on this matter, the Labor dirt unit was working overtime for the last two weeks—not coming up with policy ideas and not thinking about the best ways to combat the next election but just digging deeper and deeper, searching for any skerrick of information that might yield a bit of what they believe is dirt. That is rather than focusing on the issues that actually matter to the Australian people—Australian mums and dads and Australian families.


As was stated, this ANAO report is a decade old. And, as was stated, it's one that was undertaken when we had a Labor government in this place—the Rudd government. But I think the answers given by Senator Cormann in response to those questions around this ridiculous character besmirching that has gone on by Labor today points to a very strong contrast between the Australian Labor Party and the plan they have—or don't, more to the point, given the nature of the questions today—and the record we can point to; the priorities for us. The questions that coalition senators asked of ministers today were around jobs, economic activity and how to look after regional Australians when it comes to matters like telecommunications and regional health. Those things are important. What the Labor senators asked about, and what we're doing the take note about today, is not an issue that Australians are concerned about. This is exactly why they get tired of us here in Canberra, because it is all insider, Canberra-bubble material. It isn't relevant to the kitchen table discussions, as I'm sure my good friend and colleague Senator Watt would agree.


But one thing which has been omitted from all of the discussion around the reports at the time was the comments that were made by the then chair of the board of Tourism Australia, Mr Fischer. He heaped praise on the Prime Minister when he was leaving that role. He said that he did a great job. It's a tough job and there was a time of transformation. The industry backed him in as well, saying that he did a fantastic job in terms of how the board should be structured. Those things have been omitted from the questions today. Rather than focus on the facts of the matter, they've hung things out there—suggestions and loaded language in these questions—to try to cast the worst light possible on the Prime Minister. They've been trying to sling mud, which is, again, something that Australians don't want to see here. People expect more of us; they want us to come in here and have a proper debate about issues that matter, like reducing hospital waiting lists—and we do have the MPI a little later on today, and I'm looking forward to contributing to that.


Of course, there was the matter of food relief, which Senator McAllister asked about. I was surprised that she moved the motion to take note of answers that didn't relate to that matter but on issues, as I said before, which are not important. As has been stated in the answers provided, this group of people, the Australian Labor Party, is looking backward. It is looking 10 years into the past to dig up as much dirt as possible. It is not looking to the future. It doesn't have the answers and it certainly doesn't have the plan. We need to expect more from those who aspire to be in government than what they're delivering.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:15):  I rise to take note of the answers given, or rather not given, by Senator Cormann to questions by senators on this side asked in relation to the fact the current Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, was unceremoniously sacked as managing director of Tourism Australia in 2006. Senator Cormann cannot claim he had no notice of these questions. He must have known, following the extensive reporting of this matter over the weekend, that there would be questions on this matter in the Senate today, yet he deliberately chose not to inform himself of the facts. This immediately raises the question: what is Senator Cormann afraid of? Why does he feel the need to dodge and wibble-wobble when he is asked about this matter?


We know Senator Cormann's home branch of the Liberal Party in Western Australia is a branch that I'm sure is close to your heart, Madam Deputy President, since you can observe its travails up close and personal on our great western coast. What's come to light over the weekend is that the Liberal Party has been asking children to sign extraordinary talent release forms that seek to ban people from criticising or satirising the party in public or in private for five years. These North Korean style forms also seek to ban signatories from associating with other political parties. The Western Australian Liberal Party would make Kim Jong Un proud. The question for today— and perhaps this will help Senator Cormann—seems to be: where the bloody hell are you? If you look at Sean Kelly's piece in The Monthly—he does a more metaphorical take on this—you will see the answer is, 'Looking for Scott Morrison.' And, I have to tell you, he is a pretty difficult man to find. Is he on the bus—the SloMo express? No, he is on a VIP. Is he making a video for Twitter? No, he is sculling a beer. All the while, he is stealing food from the poor, cutting funding for Foodbank. Not since 'Thatcher, Thatcher the milk snatcher' have we seen this level of villainy—from 'Scott no heart, Scott no clue and Scott no decency'. Margaret Thatcher, two decades later, still regrets snatching milk from schoolchildren. The Prime Minister is the moral equivalent of the person taking coins from the blanket of the homeless person in the city streets. How does he sleep at night?


Let's go back to his wonderful time as the CEO of Tourism Australia. There seem to have been some personality difficulties between Mr Morrison and the Minister for Tourism, rather surprising perhaps given they were both from the Liberal Party, but Mr Morrison's resistance to the plan that Ms Bailey planned to put in place is a key reason behind his messy exit. But there is more. Morrison was 'not a team player'. They're not my words; they're actually Ms Bailey's words. Ms Bailey said of Mr Morrison's departure, 'We've moved on. It was without question the right decision by the board.' She said she was seeking a replacement for Mr Morrison who would be 'more of a team player' capable of working closely with state bodies, industry and the government. Of course, we have seen in recent months that Mr Morrison, when he gave that fatal hug of death to the then Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, still isn't much of a team player.


In The Australian on 7 September 2006, there was an article around the unanimous board decision to dismiss Mr Morrison. Referring to Ms Bailey, it said:


She said she did not dismiss Mr Morrison—it had been the unanimous decision of the board, which felt he had to go because it had lost confidence in him and could not work with him.


Ms Bailey told the committee the issue with Mr Morrison was not one of personality but—


wait for it—


performance.



The Sydney Morning Herald on 16 August 2006 said:


Ms Bailey's office declined to comment last night but the strengthening of Tourism Australia is expected to be welcomed by the travel industry after the dramatic departure of its managing director, Scott Morrison, following a unanimous decision by the board to remove him … Sources close to the Tourism Australia board told the Herald it was a unanimous decision to force Mr Morrison out. ""There was no dissent whatsoever. Nobody was happy and we wished there had been a better outcome, but the board was absolutely unanimous.""


There is a line between someone who acts like that and the way we have seen the Prime Minister behave recently. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-11-12,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  I think this is grubby politics. I really do. Here we are, Senator Kitching quoting from The Australian newspaper in 2006—12 years ago. Imagine if I picked out a quote from the former Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke that he was on the grog one night as a young fella.



An opposition senator interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Have you finished? 



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  What did I do to Gillard? I didn't do anything, quoting you, Senator Wong. What did your side do to Prime Minister Gillard? That's the question you should be asking, Senator Wong. You're the ones that sacked her. As I said, we are going back to 2006 newspaper quotes. I'm not going to pick up a paper and look for a quote on Bob Hawke when he was on the grog some time as a university student. Good luck to him. I probably did the same myself except I didn't spend a long time at university. This is grubby politics. The now Prime Minister was a private citizen working before he joined politics. We have even seen attacks on his preselection. I could talk about a lot of preselections in here of those opposite, where the knives come out, the deals are done, and the factions get together and come to some sort of arrangement. We know all about them. We could go back to 2013 and the Senate positions on the paper, couldn't we, Senator Wong? Things like that.


This is just grubby politics. I'm not going to go back into the past. It's not for me to judge the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, or former leaders in this country. Question time is just a farce of throwing hand grenades. Probably the quote of question time today was Senator Cameron when he said, 'Those in the bush have never had it so good.' I find that an amazing interjection, highlighted by Senator O'Sullivan. Just yesterday I came in from Parkes in the Central West. I was talking to my friends Barry and Cheryl Green and Bull Green and his wife Therese. They're carting water, filling the dams up on their properties for sheep water because they don't have underground water in that region. And Senator Cameron says during question time, 'The bush has never had it so good.' That is an amazing statement—so out of touch. It just goes to prove that those opposite spend little time in the bush, seeing the drought, the effect on the people, the animals, the mental effect on humans. Sadly some have taken their own lives due to the stress of this drought. We find in question time comments that the bush has never seen it so good. It's simply amazing.


We were talking about the past of the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, and how those opposite are so squeaky clean with the past. There are things like the laws on superannuation. We can't get changes to them. We have Senator McAllister saying what happened in the preselection of Mr Morrison. Isn't that the business of the Liberal Party, just like the Labor Party does preselection? It's their business how they work their factions and agreements out and so on.


As far as Mr Morrison goes and his job at Tourism Australia, I was happy to speak with the former Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, a few weeks ago at Sydney Airport. He is a good man. He is having a few battles of his own personally. I wish him well with those struggles he's having now with some health issues. He has been a great leader of the National Party and a great Deputy Prime Minister. He is a very decent and honest man. He backed Scott Morrison in that position as managing director, and so did the industry. Here we are today playing politics again in question time and taking note, really to achieve nothing but to try and smear the Prime Minister, who is out there amongst the people working hard, communicating with them. Then we get the thing about the food grants and support; there has been no cut in that. There's an extra $4.5 million, but that wasn't discussed, of course—just one political point taken about that. Really, what is question time about? What is taking note about? It's about political points and simply wasting time.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I wanted to talk about why this issue is important. Unlike Senator Williams over there, I can't just dismiss this because it was a period of time ago. This is an important and substantial story. This is the last substantial job that the current Prime Minister did before he entered parliament, so it's absolutely legitimate that he is held accountable for the role that he played in that.


The other aspect of this is that his appointment to that job was highly political. The last job he did before he was appointed as the Managing Director of Tourism Australia was State Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. He had that role when they won re-election in 2004, and former Prime Minister Howard is on the record saying how grateful he was for the role that the current Prime Minister played during that 2004 campaign.


How was he appointed to be the Managing Director of Tourism Australia? The key recruitment agency that conducted the search was Korn Ferry. On this side of the chamber, we know that when the conservatives, when the LNP, want to get their preferred outcome in terms of recruitment, that's who they go to. We saw that evidence during Senate estimates when we were talking about the recent troubles at the ABC. And who have the government appointed to head the recruitment for the new board positions? None other than Korn Ferry. So we know that they have form. When they want their preferred outcome, this is who they go to.


These issues are substantial, they are important, and it is important that the current Prime Minister answer the questions that have been raised as part of the reporting. These aren't allegations by the Labor Party. This is as a result of a National Audit Office report. They are substantial allegations and they were reached independently of us as the opposition and, indeed, independently of the Public Service. They also go to the judgement of the Prime Minister, his record before he got into parliament and his capacity. It also goes to transparency, because taxpayer funds were involved in that organisation that he was responsible for. What payout did he receive that had confidentiality agreements around it? This is public money at the end of the day we're talking about.


So there are a number of aspects of this that go to his record now and also his record previously. How can we not use this to question his judgement as a result? In the short time he has been Prime Minister we have had the opportunity on numerous occasions to question his judgement. We saw that in the week before the Wentworth by-election when there was a series of rolling blunders by this Prime Minister, including what was nothing short of a diplomatic incident with regard to the relationship with Indonesia. In the last week of the by-election campaign, the Prime Minister floated the idea of moving the embassy in Israel, which put at risk the signing of a free trade agreement with our important neighbours in Indonesia.


It is, therefore, easy for us to conclude that we need to look at his decision-making, and to look at, when the current Prime Minister has been in positions of authority, how he has used that. When you look at his role at Tourism Australia, it was a very short-lived affair. It was a unanimous board decision—this is the same board that appointed him to that role 18 months earlier—to remove him, and this included a former National Party deputy leader as part of that, and there was a really obvious falling-out relationship with the minister at the time. The length of time he was in that role also leads us to conclude that there were judgement issues at play.


I think when you look at the LNP, they obviously—and we saw this in question time today—have problems detailing and explaining dismissals. We saw that with the former Prime Minister. They still can't tell us why Prime Minister Turnbull was dismissed, and it seems like we can't find out why the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, was dismissed from Tourism Australia. So there are some fundamental issues that need to be highlighted within the public domain.


In question time today, the Senate leader, Senator Cormann, didn't take that opportunity to explain these decisions. So we will absolutely continue to highlight why it is so important for us to question the government and question the Prime Minister on this role at Tourism Australia and get to the bottom of why these decisions were made. We know he went from being the New South Wales state Liberal director straight to the position of managing director of Tourism Australia and then 18 months later he was out of that role. The Australian people deserve answers and the ANAO report is a good place for us to start. (Time expired)

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (15:33):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation (Senator McKenzie) to a question without notice asked by Senator Faruqi today relating to the Choice and Affordability Fund for school funding.


We have seen from Minister McKenzie's performance in question time today and from the stonewalling at budget estimates that the so-called 'choice and affordability fund' is exactly what we thought it would be when it was first announced. This is a bipartisan political fix for private schools that comes at the direct expense of public schools, public school students and teachers, which are grossly underfunded and most in need. This whole program is a farce. There are no rules and no criteria, and the department seems to have no idea how the enormous amount of $1.2 billion for the private school slush fund was arrived at. There are no complex mathematical formulas behind this number. There's only one formula the Liberal-National government is interested in, and that's how much money to throw at the private school sector to keep it quiet.


Billions going to Catholic and independent schools is billions not going to public schools, and it is public school teachers and students who will continue to be neglected. Ninety-three per cent of teachers dip into their own pocket to buy stationery and classroom equipment, and nearly half buy library resources and textbooks. It means public school students continue to sweat it out in demountable classrooms with no air conditioning, while private schools build orchestra pits and their third and fourth swimming pools. This government and the private schools have some things in common, and one of those things is that they both fear transparency. Dr Adrian Piccoli, former New South Wales education minister and the director of the Gonski Institute for Education at the University of New South Wales, has made very clear what happens when you allow systems like the Catholic education system to determine where to put public money, instead of the government. He pointed out that the Catholic sector often allocate more money to their wealthy schools than their schools in disadvantaged areas. He gives the example of schools in regional Queanbeyan receiving $2,000 less per student than Catholic students on the wealthy North Shore. St Joseph's in Condobolin, whose student population is 30 per cent Indigenous, gets $4,000 less per student than St Michael's in Sydney's wealthy inner west.


This madness has to stop. These special deals have to stop. The Greens are the only party that will stand up for public schools and against special deals for private schools. Both the Labor and Liberal parties continue to support billions going to already overfunded private schools. Parents of public school children have the right to be angry that the government managed to find $4.6 billion behind the couch and there is not a dollar—not even a single cent extra—for public schools. This is a national disgrace. It's time for the government to admit that this is just hush money for private schools and to put this money into the public system, where it's clearly most needed.

  The opposition will be supporting this motion. It has been Labor's long-held policy that the federal disclosure threshold be lowered. It was a Labor government that originally lowered the disclosure threshold to allow Australians to see who was funding election campaigns. It was the coalition who reversed it, reducing transparency and seeing the threshold blow out to its current figure of $13,800.

  The Australian government has robust processes for assessing the environmental impacts of seismic surveys on fisheries and the marine environment. In applying the petroleum titleholders environmental plan, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority must be satisfied that the environmental impacts of the activities have been considered, control is proposed to reduce the risk of an unacceptable level, and the community and affected industry have been adequately consulted. The government continues to encourage better collaboration between the fishing and petroleum sectors to further improve certainty about the management of environmental impacts, including a joint workshop occurring this Friday in Melbourne between Seafood Industry Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association.

  Labor opposes this motion because, while its intent is understandable, it is unnecessary.

These rules were amended in October 2016 to ensure stewards have access to studs and farms to monitor the health and welfare of horses. According to the chair's report in the annual report referenced in the motion, the new rules ensure the traceability and welfare of all thoroughbred horses from birth until rehoming.

  A national horse register makes sense for animal welfare, for safety and for biosecurity.

We definitely need national leadership, and I will continue to push for federal leadership in establishing a national register. Horses do not have lifetime tracking beyond the first movement.


I want to pay tribute to Juliana Waugh AM and Mark Waugh for their tireless advocacy on this issue since tragically losing their daughter, Sarah, in 2011 in a horse-riding accident. The national register is a sensible public policy. Together we can save lives, we can protect biosecurity and we can stop racing horses being discarded at knackeries when they're no longer profitable.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:00):  I rise this afternoon to speak about a plan to fix Australia's hospitals, including more investment in beds, doctors and nurses, ending the Medicare freeze and providing new MRI machines across Australia. It's going to take a lot of work to fix the damage of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years, but Labor is willing and ready. That's why, on 7 October 2018, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, launched Labor's Fair Go Action Plan—our five-step plan for a better and fairer Australia. It's a plan to fix our schools and hospitals, ease pressure on family budgets, stand up for workers, invest in cheaper, cleaner energy and build a stronger economy that works for all. The key point I make here is that Labor has drawn a line in the sand. We have outlined the kind of government that we want to be and the kind of country we want to build for future generations. We have the courage to make the big decisions that need to be made and then be up-front about how and why we made these decisions. 


The contrast between Labor and the Liberals couldn't be starker. Unlike the illegitimate Scott Morrison government, whom no-one elected, Bill Shorten is leading a stable and united Labor team that is 100 per cent focused on delivering a fair go for all Australians. This is what drives the Australian Labor Party forward. We're not just talking about ourselves: we're out there fighting for our workmates, our partners and children, our parents and grandparents every single day. 


Australia deserves better than the neglect and the political bandaid approach to health care that we've seen under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. There are too many people battling cancer and other serious health issues that are driving for hours or paying thousands of dollars for vital scans and tests. There are too many older Australians with crook hips, bad knees, cataracts, hernias, waiting too long for an operation they desperately need now. There are too many young people and adults unable to reach out and access the mental health services they need. There are too many families and individuals skipping out on seeing their GP because they just can't afford it. 


Too many of our fantastic healthcare workers are overworked and underpaid. In my home state of Tasmania, as you would have to agree, Mr Acting Deputy President Duniam, these amazing frontline workers are at breaking point. The catastrophic health crisis in our home state should serve as a wake-up call for both the state and federal Liberals to do better. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have cut millions from Tasmania's hospitals and our health care system has hit a boiling point. Every week new horror stories are emerging. We have paramedics trying to treat sick people in corridors and nurses performing invasive procedures on patients who are sitting shoulder to shoulder with complete strangers in the emergency department. Our nurses, doctors and health professionals are at a breaking point. They tell me they're desperately wanting to provide the high quality of care that patients expect and deserve, but they can't because the system is broken and the local and federal Liberal governments aren't listening. We are better than this and we need to do better than this. 


And we will. A Shorten Labor government will invest an extra $30 million in halving Tasmania's elective surgery backlog, put more into the state's hospitals and reverse the Liberals' cuts to TAZREACH. If we are fortunate enough to win government, we'll fix our hospitals by reversing the Liberals' cuts; by unfreezing Medicare; by making record investments in mental health; by investing in more beds, more staff and more technology, including new MRI machines in the regions and suburbs; and by investing in new urgent care clinics to relieve pressure on our overworked and strained emergency departments. We're determined to fix our hospitals, and if we're elected to government we will always make sure that it's your Medicare card and not your credit card that guarantees your access to quality health in this country.


Through our better hospitals fund, a Shorten Labor government will invest more in every single public hospital in the country. The better hospitals fund will see $2.8 billion extra investment from 2019 to 2025. This will fully reverse the Liberals' cuts, fund more beds in emergency departments and wards, and fund more doctors, more nurses and more health staff. This funding will be targeted to reduce emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, which, as I've outlined, have blown out under the Liberals' cuts to Medicare and hospitals. Under a Shorten Labor government, the health of Australians will never take a back seat to a handout for big business. Labor will invest an extra $764 million over the forward estimates and $2.814 billion over six years to fix Australia's public hospitals. Our plan has been fully costed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office.


As I said, the difference between Labor and those opposite couldn't be starker. The Liberals have cut from Medicare and hospitals in every year since Tony Abbott's horror 2014 budget. This is a government that gave us the GP tax, the Medicare freeze and the $715 million in cuts from public hospitals from 2017 to 2020 alone, giving their rich mates a handout instead of funding health. This is a classic move in the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison playbook. Under the Liberals, the national average wait time for elective surgery is the longest on record, the number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record and the number of people presenting at emergency departments is the highest on record, and one in every three patients considered urgent isn't seen on time.


The Liberals have always hated Medicare and simply cannot be trusted with it. This has been proven time and time again, whether it was by the Abbott government, the Turnbull government or, now, the Morrison government. We know that it's in the Liberals and Nationals' DNA—they just don't like Medicare. They don't like to have universal health care in this country. But Labor will always stand firm and we will always say that your Medicare card is what should give you access to good health in this country, not your credit card. We know that the community believe us; they proved that at the last election. They were concerned about Medicare and voted against this government because of it. It's only Labor that's committed to making Medicare stronger.


People are sick of being short-changed by a government that favours the top end of town. They want to see a contest of ideas and policy. But what do we get from those on the opposite side? The infighting, dysfunction and chaos just continues. If they're not fighting about themselves, they're obsessing about what Bill Shorten is doing and what Labor is doing. We're doing what we said we would do, and that is that we want to contest the next election on good policies and good ideas for the future. That's why we're putting our policies out early. There won't be any reason for the Australian people not to know what Labor stands for going into the next election, because we're going to be up-front about that. They'll know, and they'll have it reinforced time and time again by us, that we'll put people first. We'll put the health of the nation before the big end of town. We'll ensure that families can afford to go and see their GP. We'll ensure that there are not mothers in this country not going to the doctors themselves, because they have to buy new school items for their children and can't afford to go to the GP. We know how important good health is. We know how important good education is. We will prioritise, and we have made the commitment to protect Medicare. We will fund good health services in this country because that's what the Australian people deserve and that's what they will get if there is a Bill Shorten government elected at the next election.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-11-12,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:10):  I rise today to speak on a matter of public importance, introduced to this chamber by our colleague Senator Wong, to discuss a plan to fix Australia's hospitals, including more investments in beds, doctors and nurses, ending the Medicare freeze and providing new MRI machines. I thank Senator Wong, very much, for introducing this matter of public importance. I also thank Senator Polley for her contribution to the debate today, which was as dull as it was inaccurate. 


I get a chance now to speak genuinely of the coalition's health policy, which is terrific. The coalition is all about raising standards of living. It takes its health policy very seriously indeed, because health policy makes genuine changes to lives. Let me dispel a few myths for the chamber. First of all, let's talk about hospital investment. Federal funding for public hospitals under the coalition has increased from $13.8 billion in 2014, the last year of a Labor government in this country, to $22.7 billion in 2020-21. That is a 64 per cent increase just in the coalition's time in office. There are more hospital services, more doctors and more nurses. That is exactly what this matter of public importance is all about. Under the coalition, more Australians are seeing a doctor without having to pay record bulk billing levels for GPs. At December 2017, bulk billing rates were up to 85.8 per cent, up from 81.9 per cent in Labor's last year of office. That is 21.6 million more bulk billed GP visits. It's 1.9 million more bulk billed specialist visits. It's 6.2 million more bulk billed GP visits in regional and rural areas. 


Can we talk for a moment about immunisation rates in this country, which are also at record highs? The number of five-year-olds now being vaccinated has increased from 91.5 per cent, when we came to office, to 94.6 per cent. More children are covered and more children in the community are protected from diseases like mumps, measles and rubella. So successful have we been that the World Health Organization has now verified that Australia has eliminated rubella, a contagious viral illness that can result in tragic miscarriage or stillbirth. And the World Health Organization has confirmed that Australia has also maintained its measles elimination status, after being verified in 2014. 


On top of this, the Morrison government has invested $446.5 million in the national immunisation program, just this year alone. From 2018 all 12- and 13-year-old girls and boys will have free access to Gardasil 9. This is the vaccine that will protect them from the HPV virus, and we hope that one day it will make cervical cancer go the way of measles and rubella. That's raising the standard of living. There are life-saving drugs programs. There is an extra $51.8 million for headspace—mental health for young Australians. That takes it to a total of about $148 million for this vital program, across 107 centres around the country. Most important of all, I think, is that we have guaranteed Medicare. Medicare and the PBS are now enshrined in legislation. The Medicare Guarantee Fund will ensure that they are sustainably funded well into the future, because guaranteeing essential services can happen only when the budget is strong.


However, what I am most excited about and most proud of is being part of a government that has listed more than 1,900 additional medicines worth over $10 billion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. They include drugs like Kisqali, which, without a PBS subsidy, would cost the 3,150 women who have breast cancer around $72,000 per year. Four thousand Australians with chronic pain from spinal arthritis will now be receiving Simponi; without the subsidy, it would cost over $15,000 a year. One thousand Australians with a type of head and neck cancer will receive Opdivo; without the subsidy, it would cost around $50,000. Some 850 Australians with lung cancer will be receiving Keytruda; without the subsidy, it would cost those patients around $188,000. Some 220 Australians with a type of lymphoma will now be receiving Imbruvica; without the subsidy, it would cost around $134,000 per year. Some 1,125 patients with rare types of leukaemia will be receiving a drug called Pegasys; without the subsidy, that drug would cost more than $18,000 per year. And over 6,000 Australians with an inherited high cholesterol condition will be receiving Repatha; without the subsidy, it would cost those Australians around $8,000 a year.


Only a strong economy, strong fiscal management and sustainable fiscal management can deliver those new additional drugs on the PBS. Please hold this in stark contrast to 2011, when Labor announced the unprecedented deferral of the listing of seven medicines, saying:


… the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.


They are the words used in the 2011-12 portfolio budget statement. That was when the now opposition leader, Bill Shorten, was, in fact, Assistant Treasurer. The Medicare freeze imposed by Labor—not by the coalition, Senator Polley—because Labor couldn't get its economic house in order has been lifted by the coalition government. Make no mistake: on health, education, the NDIS and all the essential services that Australians deserve and expect from a prosperous and successful nation like ours, Labor cannot be trusted. They will promise you the world and then they will hand you the atlas but not before they've slapped a tax on it along the way.


If you want an example of a Labor government's health policy in action, look no further than my home state of Victoria. Three and a half years ago, only four months after being elected, Victorian Labor did its first health backflip. It announced that it would scrap 42 hospital beds from the new Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre which would have provided treatment to thousands of cancer patients. Since that decision was made, over 13,000 people with cancer are estimated to have missed out on treatment in what would have been Peter Mac Private. The decision was entirely based on Labor's ideological opposition to private health care and has cost Victorian taxpayers around $100 million. The 13th floor of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre remains vacant to this day—a state-of-the-art facility lying fallow because a Labor government would rather make a point than save a life. When you see opposition leader Bill Shorten campaigning with Labor Premier Daniel Andrews, when you see Mr Shorten fail to condemn the 'red shirts' rort that misappropriated taxpayer funds to pay for a Labor campaign, when you see Mr Shorten go to ground rather than pass judgement on his Victorian colleagues—21 members of Victorian Labor, including six ministers—who are currently being investigated by the Fraud and Extortion Squad of the Victorian police, when you see opposition leader Mr Shorten and Victorian Labor Premier Daniel Andrews together, please recall the hollow promises that Victorian Labor made before that last election.


The key to a sustainable, generous and effective healthcare policy is a strong economy. What does that look like? I'll tell you what it looks like. It looks like 3.4 per cent economic growth; 1.1 million new jobs over five years, with around 400,000 in the last 12 months alone; the female participation rate at record highs; youth unemployment at the lowest levels in a quarter of a century; unemployment at around five per cent; AAA credit ratings from three credit rating agencies; a budget surplus forecast a year early; the smallest deficit in a decade and the smallest since the coalition left office; and an expected return to surplus in 2019-20. Stronger economic growth and much stronger employment growth than anticipated at the time of the 2017-18 budget have driven increases in personal income tax and company tax receipts. Total receipts are now $13.4 billion—much higher than expected than at the time of the last budget—and total payments are $6.9 billion lower than forecast.


Senator Polley wants more beds; I hear more taxes. If you want more doctors, all we hear is more taxes. If you want more nurses, that's more taxes. The politics of envy, the economics of snake oil, promises as hollow as bone—that is all you will get from Labor. That's all you ever get from Labor. The government's health policy is about changing lives. Labor's is about changing their political fortunes. I am certain that those opposite know it was Vladimir Lenin that said, 'A lie told often enough becomes the truth.' Don't Labor have form on lies? On health policy, Labor cannot be trusted.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:20):  I rise to speak to this critically important issue, and that is what a 21st century, modern healthcare system looks like in Australia. It's good to be having a discussion on something that matters. I'm not going to spend too long dwelling on the coalition's record on health care. It's an abysmal one. They came to office. They cut the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. They've decimated prevention. Under the Abbott budget in 2014, we saw hospital funding slashed. They've frozen Medicare indexation. They have underinvested in health care and they have put us on a path towards a US two-tier health system that will cost us more and leave Australians with much worse health outcomes. No, what I want to talk about is what a positive vision for the country looks like.


Election after election, people rate health as the most important priority when they cast their vote. It's about time they got a comprehensive plan for what we need to address the failings of our health system at the moment. The first thing to do is to acknowledge that health outcomes are not simply a function of having a good health system; they are also a function of those social determinants that contribute to good health. Having a roof over your head and access to affordable housing—that's a health issue. Being able to feed yourself because you're on an income support payment, like Newstart, at a level that doesn't commit you to living in poverty—that's a health issue. Being able to get a decent education for your children at a public school—that's a health issue. Dealing with climate change and addressing the challenge of climate damage—that is a health issue.


A decent health system is founded on some key principles. Firstly, it's universal. It doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what your background is, it doesn't matter what your postcode is and it doesn't matter what your bank balance is; you get access to world-class health care in a decent health system. A good health system puts prevention at its heart. It focuses on prevention. A decent health system has a primary care system which people can navigate, where GPs, as the gatekeepers, are supported by allied health professionals and practice nurses. It's where people are able to get access to decent health care in a coordinated fashion. It's not churning them through; it's not six-minute medicine. That is what decent primary health care looks like.


Of course, if we're going to deal with those issues and if we're going to have 21st century health care, what we need to do is make sure that our health policy is determined by evidence, not by who's got the biggest chequebook, not by the private health insurers who lobby to advance their industry, not by the junk food industry and not by the alcohol industry—that it is, indeed, informed by evidence, not by lobbyists.


When it comes to prevention, the Greens support having a national preventive health agency, because we understand that that is the most cost-effective way of delivering better health for Australians. We need to focus much more on prevention, but the government's ideology is of small government, individualism, not focusing long term and wanting to get a quick hit today in the polls rather than focusing on long-term initiatives—which is what prevention is; these initiatives have long lead times. We need to invest in prevention if we're going to keep people well.


We need to make sure that we address the issue of obesity, and, certainly, in the next few weeks, we'll be announcing the Greens-led recommendations from the Senate inquiry into obesity. But, again, you have to take on those vested interests. You have to take on the food lobby, you have to take on the alcohol industry and you have to take on the advertisers if you're going to address some of those structural problems that contribute to unhealthy weight.


When it comes to primary care, we need to have a system that moves away from throughput, where it's simply a case of GPs being driven towards shorter consultation times—basically, throughput rather than outcomes. That's why we want to see chronic disease management through a system of blended payments, as was promised in the Health Care Homes trials, which failed to deliver. We want that to be also addressed. We need greater investment in our hospital system, but we've got to take the cost shifting out of it, which is why we support an independent body to address those funding shortfalls.


Denticare, Aboriginal health and addressing the health impacts of climate change are all part of the Greens vision for health care in Australia.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-11-12,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  I just want to concentrate for a few minutes on the divide in this country between those in rural and regional Australia and those in the cities. There is a completely unacceptable divide in health outcomes for those in rural and regional Australia. We've often heard Labor say your health outcomes shouldn't be determined by your credit card. Well, neither should they be determined by your postcode. People in country Australia have a lower life expectancy—3.4 years lower for men and two years lower for women. It's even worse for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. People in the country experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease. They experience higher rates of diabetes. They experience higher rates of lung cancer and higher rates of suicide. Rural Australians are less likely to be covered by private health insurance, are less likely to see a dentist every year and are more likely to visit an emergency department.


In rural Australia, there are fewer pharmacists, psychologists, podiatrists, physiotherapists, optometrists and occupational therapists per capita than in the cities. Rural Australians see GPs half as often as people in the city and see specialists at one-third the rate. That's because they face long travel times and extra costs just to get to a GP, and too often many of them face the prospect of travelling to a capital city to see a specialist. Of course, there are far fewer doctors in country Australia—263 doctors for every 100,000 people, compared to 442 doctors for every 100,000 people in the city.


What's striking about these numbers is that, under this government, they haven't changed. They have not changed. It's okay for Senator Hume to come here and argue that the contribution from Senator Polley was dull. I don't agree with that. I thought Senator Polley's position was clear. Senator Polley outlined the deficiencies in the coalition government in the context of health and also the deficiencies that I've outlined in relation to the divide between metropolitan Australians and rural and regional Australians.


We hear the National Party come in here and argue what great things they're doing for rural and regional Australia. Well, they've failed in health, they've failed in education, they've failed in penalty rates and they've failed in the context of putting a roof over people's heads. They are just not up to it. Not just is the junior partner not up to it; the Liberal Party are clearly not up to governing Australia. Day after day, we see more division in this government. We now see a Prime Minister trying to pretend that he's one of the ordinary people in Australia, with a different baseball hat on every day. Well, putting on a different baseball hat doesn't mean you're dealing with the real issues. The real issues are health, education and making sure that there's not such a great divide between rural and regional Australia and the rest of the country.


We do have a terrific health system, but that health system will be divided by this government through their argument for small government and through the fear campaigns you heard Senator Hume set off on. Someone has to pay for a health system. If big business are not paying their fair share, it falls on those that can't afford it—and we need more investment in health.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (17:30):  It is a pleasure to make a contribution to the MPI today, following on from the contributions of Senator Cameron, Senator Polley and you, Madam Acting Deputy President Hume, and to debate the 'plan to fix Australia's hospitals, including more investment in beds, doctors and nurses; ending the Medicare freeze; and providing new MRI machines across Australia'—a statement packed with assumptions and assertions about the state of play. I will pick up on something that Senator Cameron said in the last part of his contribution, which is that we do have a fantastic health system in this country. I don't agree with where he went after that, which I'm sure he is not surprised by, but it is the case that certainly in my home state of Tasmania, while there is always going to be room for improvement when demand increases, we do have a system that is catering more for Tasmanians.


Senator Cameron is right: when you move out of metropolitan areas, when you go out of the highly built-up and more populated areas, access to health services is harder to come by, especially for specialist services. That's why in Tasmania, under the guidance of the fantastic health minister, Michael Ferguson, we are seeing a terrific reform of the broken health service down there, the one that was left in tatters. I will come to the record on that and compare the pair, looking at how things were in 2013, only four short years ago, and how they are today under the Hodgman Liberal government, which has invested a huge amount in health services in that state.


Going to those assertions in the MPI around investments in health and how things are structured and situated in Australia, we need only recall the 'Mediscare' campaign that we saw at the last federal election, in 2016. I recall standing at the pre-poll booth at Rosny Park in southern Tasmania, and a fellow came up to those of us who were standing at the pre-poll booth and he was holding one of those fake Medicare cards and he was outraged. But here we are almost three years on and, of course, Medicare was never privatised. It was a Labor lie. It was one of those scare campaigns that Labor wanted to whip up—and did so successfully, unfortunately. They fooled a great many Tasmanians, and indeed Australians, into thinking that somehow the government was going to privatise the entity that provides for public health, Medicare. It was never going to happen.


That's why this so-called plan that has been put forward by the Labor Party is something that you can't bank on. It is something that we have to interrogate closely. I think the best way to do that is to check the facts and see how things stack up here in Australia—federally and right across the country—and, as I said before, when we examine the situation in my home state of Tasmania. As I understand was pointed out by Senator Hume a little earlier on in this discussion, the amount of federal funding that has been provided to public hospital services under this government has increased by a huge amount—from $13.3 billion in the financial year 2013-14 to $23.4 billion in the year 2020-21. That is a 76 per cent increase in funding to public hospital services. We should remember that the administration and delivery of public health services are the domain of the states and territories. Of course, the Commonwealth, through the various partnership agreements, through the GST and through other funding streams, does support the state and territory governments to administer and fund those services.


We have the five-year hospital funding agreements where we are seeing an increase of funding by $30.1 billion from the year 2020-21 to the year 2024-25. That is a massive increase, taking it from $100 billion to $130.1 billion. This agreement has been signed up to by six state and territory governments—Western Australia, the ACT, the Northern Territory, South Australia, the great state of Tasmania and also New South Wales. That's three Labor and three Liberal governments, meaning that there is bipartisan support for the amount of funding that is being provided to states to administer their much-needed health services. In the case of Victoria, one would assume that the Andrews government is playing politics, holding things up and not signing up in the lead-up to a state election. I can't think what other reason there would be. It is very disappointing for the people of Victoria to be missing out on that much-needed funding to secure the future of their health services.


You only have to consider those facts—the support for Medicare, the numbers related to bulk-billing and, of course, all of the statistics and the case studies around the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—to understand how much is being invested in public health and in providing services and medications that are so very much needed by many, many Australians.


Senator Hume was talking before about drugs like Orkambi to help sufferers of cystic fibrosis. A 12-month period would cost a patient $250,000 without the subsidy that the PBS provides. That's a fantastic initiative that our fellow Australians contribute to through paying their taxes that enable these people to access their medicines at an affordable rate—a far more affordable rate than $250,000 a year. That drug, like so many others, sat on that list for so long before it was approved to be provided under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.


On bulk-billing, as has already been stated, record numbers of people are being provided bulk-billing for health services—86.1 per cent for the 2017-18 financial year, the highest bulk-billing rate at any time since Medicare came into existence. The numbers are that 154.7 million GP services were provided across the country and 133.2 million were bulk-billed. So, on these stories about people being denied access to bulk-billing and doctors jacking up fees, this bears out that record numbers of people are being able to access this service. Again, it points to another Labor scare campaign.


On support for Medicare, as Senator Hume also pointed out, the Medicare freeze which was put in place by the Labor government in the year 2013 is being removed by the coalition, by this government, the one we've heard such nasty things about this afternoon. Huge amounts of funding are being provided to Medicare. In 2017-18, it was $24 billion. In the next financial year, 2018-19, it will be $25 million. It will be $26 billion in 2019-20, $27 billion in 2020-21 and $29 billion in 2021-22.


These are some facts that have been seen around the country about how funding is being administered. It puts paid to the claims that are being made by those opposite that funding support isn't there, that we aren't investing in health and that it's at breaking point. Indeed, Senator Cameron made the point that we do have a fantastic health system, a claim that I believe he is right on.


I will turn to Tasmania briefly, though. Talking about small government, as Senator Cameron did, it was the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania that wanted to privatise the Mersey Community Hospital. They wanted to outsource it. They didn't want it to be supported by government. It was the Tasmanian Liberal government, the Hodgman government, and the coalition government here in Canberra that engineered a deal to make sure that that health facility remained part of the statewide health network, where we are seeing great reforms and where people in regional communities are getting access to the health services and specialist services they need, with the support of the coalition government here in Canberra.


Some of the statistics I put on the record before around access to health were provided during the 2018 Tasmanian state election campaign. They show a contrast to where things were back in 2014, when the Hodgman government came to power after the Bartlett-Lennon-Bacon-Giddings-McKim government had fallen. In the year 2014 there were 15,315 elective surgeries performed in our public health system. At the end of 2017 there were over 19,000 services—that is a massive increase. We had 3,375 full-time-equivalent nurses; we now have 3,630. The number of ambulance ramping hours at the Royal Hobart Hospital—our capital city hospital—has dropped by 25 per cent. This is under the management and guidance of the Hodgman government and the fantastic health minister, Michael Ferguson.


So to claim that things are not being supported and are not being appropriately funded is patently wrong. In the case of Senator Polley's comments that these are Liberal cuts to health: she is wrong. The cuts they talk about are a result of Labor's funny money. The promises they made in the past were ones they could never have delivered on, because they were never elected. They didn't receive the mandate to fund the promises they made. It's all lies with Labor when it comes to funding of health. (Time expired)

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-11-12,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (17:40):  Right now, there are more than 30,000 people in Kalgoorlie-Boulder who have to travel to Perth by car, bus, train or plane in order to get an MRI scan. If you don't already know, that's a 600-kilometre journey, one way, just to get a scan. I wonder how many of you in here have had to travel that far to get an MRI. Travelling that far often costs hundreds of dollars, especially when you take overnight accommodation into account.


Thankfully, after months and months of significant lobbying by One Nation, Kalgoorlie hospital was granted a Medicare licence for an MRI machine in June. It was the first licence to have been issued in years. The WA state Labor government has already set aside $3 million to buy the machine and install it at Kalgoorlie regional health campus. But guess what? The state Labor government is now saying it will take up to two years before the machine is installed. How is that saving lives? What's more frightening is that from next month older Australians will be denied Medicare rebates for a GP-ordered MRI. By 'older Australians' I mean those who are 50 and over and need a scan for their knees. That's at least 80 per cent of you in this chamber. We wouldn't have this issue if the government provided more MRI licences to independent imaging clinics which aren't part of the duopoly. There are about two chains which run the shop when it comes to scans, and quite often they are using old or outdated equipment. Some of the independent imaging clinics have far superior, newer equipment which can home in on cancers and tumours that the scanners the multinationals use have failed to detect. I know this because I have seen it with my own eyes.


In my home state of Western Australia there's been significant investment in two hospitals—the Fiona Stanley Hospital and the new Perth Children's Hospital. A lot of money has been spent on both, but the Children's Hospital has had its fair share of troubles. It was over budget before it opened, and who can forget the scandal which saw lead leaching into the water supply?


Despite this new investment in tertiary and children's hospitals, doctors have warned of increasing waiting times at Perth hospitals and a growing waiting list for elective surgeries, which are putting the public health system under strain. Then you have more and more people cancelling their private health insurance, which is putting the public health system under further strain. Even emergency departments are struggling to admit or discharge patients within the four-hour target.


There is no doubt in my mind that the health system in Australia was once the envy of many other nations. However, it is quickly losing its much-respected ranking. The government of the day must apply a fair and meaningful approach to ensure all Australians are looked after to the extent that all of us in this chamber expect.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:44):  I rise today to contribute on a topic about which I've talked on my occasions in this place: the importance of appropriately funding our health and hospital system. This is a fundamental responsibility of government, yet it is one that the current Liberal-National government has failed to grasp. This is a divided and dysfunctional government that you wouldn't put in charge of a chook raffle at the present time. They are not capable of coming up with a plan to fix our hospitals. Just look at the latest backflip at the moment in relation to the funding for Foodbank—a terrible outcome, a $300,000 cut to an essential service. I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is open to reviewing this terrible decision, but it highlights the point: this is a government that cannot be trusted with important decisions that affect Australians. This is a government with a terrible track record when it comes to health. I've spoken about these matters before, but we know that the previous Prime Minister tried to implement a GP tax, and Australians are now paying $4 more out of their own pocket every time they go to the doctor and $12 more out of pocket when they need to see a specialist, and there have been other cruel cuts to the health budget.


Other speakers have spoken about the $715 million ripped out of hospitals around the country. From my own state that's $160 million taken out of Queensland hospitals, the equivalent of slashing the jobs of 1,435 nurses in our state. Brisbane's dedicated children's hospital, the Queensland Children's Hospital, has suffered a $6.5 million cut. The Metro North Health Services District has lost $32 million under the Liberal-Nationals, and let's see where that's coming from: $14.3 million from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital; $7.7 million from The Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside; $2.9 million from Caboolture Hospital—and we learnt during the Longman by-election just how strongly locals felt about that; and $4.2 million, a funding cut equivalent to 37 fewer nurses, from Redcliffe Hospital in the seat of Petrie.


What's worse is that the Queensland government is still waiting for this divided and dysfunctional government to pay the $780 million owed for procedures delivered as far back as 2014. It is an absolute disgrace that under the previous Prime Minister the federal government spent 51 weeks arguing over undisputed funding and withholding payment from Queensland hospitals for procedures already delivered going back to 2014. As I've indicated, there is still funding missing. Queensland hospitals are still owed $780 million for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. This funding, as I said, is for operations and procedures performed as far back as 2016, in this case. It is a travesty that the government doesn't even want to meet its commitments for procedures already delivered.


I'm going to be concentrating on the issue of MRI licences a bit later on, but at this point it's worthwhile noting that, in contrast to the government, Labor has a proud record when it comes to MRI licences. We granted 238 of them when we were last in government. This government has delivered only five in the last five years. That's an indictment of their record. I will also highlight some of the other features of the plan, coming from Mr Morrison, to rip even more money from public hospitals. They've cut billions of dollars from public hospital budgets between now and 2025 and they also want to retrospectively claw back funding for services already provided. This just doesn't affect Queensland; as I've indicated, it affects other states, and I think every other state has indicated its opposition to this plan.


By contrast, Labor has a positive plan to restore $2.8 billion to hospitals through our already announced Better Hospitals Fund, which I think will be very much welcomed out there in the community. It will see an investment in every single public hospital in the country with, as I said, $2.8 billion for more beds and shorter surgery wait times. This fund will restore $2.8 billion from 2019 to 2025—fully reversing the Turnbull government's and other cuts in funding—for more beds, emergency departments, wards, doctors, nurses and health staff. This funding will be particularly targeted at reducing emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, which have blown out under the Liberals' cuts to Medicare and hospitals. 


We know that, right now, the national average waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record. The number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record. The number of people presenting at emergency departments is the highest on record, and yet one in every three patients whose cases are considered urgent aren't seen on time. There were 7.8 million emergency department presentations in 2016-17, which is one million more than five years ago. This, as you can appreciate, puts our hospital system under immense pressure, which means that it needs more funding to keep up with increasing demand from the growing ageing population. 


Labor has a commitment to benefit every hospital and patient in the country, and it's only Labor that can be trusted with the universality of our healthcare system. We know that those opposite are not truly committed to supporting our Medicare system, based on the number of occasions in the past that they've taken the opportunity to attack it.


As I said, I want to focus on MRIs, because they are so important in helping to care for people, and I want to point out the fact that the coalition government's failure on this issue has led to the fight being taken up by Labor candidates around the country, including in a couple of my duty electorates. I do want to pay tribute to Zac Beers, in the seat of Flynn, who has taken up this issue, and highlight the fact that the current federal member, Mr O'Dowd, has been unable to secure a Medicare MRI licence for Gladstone. It is of course the latest in a long list of failures by Mr O'Dowd. Despite clear evidence that Gladstone needs an MRI licence—including a bipartisan Senate committee report that recognised this region as an area of shortage—Gladstone was snubbed in the Liberals' announcement of new licences a couple of months ago. Other areas did receive MRI licences. Mr Morrison as Treasurer cut $1 million from the Gladstone Hospital and over $6 million from Central Queensland hospitals between 2017 and 2020. In contrast, Mr Beers has been able to get a commitment that a future Shorten Labor government would deliver an MRI licence for Gladstone and more than reverse the Liberals' cuts to the Gladstone Hospital as part of our $2.8 billion Better Hospitals Fund that I've talked about.


I also want to pay tribute to Corinne Mulholland, our candidate in the seat of Petrie—and I have spoken about this matter previously. Ms Mulholland has also been successful in getting a commitment from Mr Shorten that a future Labor government would deliver a new MRI licence for the hospital. This highlights the spectacular failure by current member Mr Howarth to secure such a licence. Despite the fact that he says he supports it, all he has offered is the fact that the Queensland government can go through a process for it. So he is offering Queenslanders paperwork rather than delivering for them, despite being in office for five years. 


Whilst Liberal-National members continue to dillydally, hiding behind pending government reports and buck-passing, Labor is getting on with the job. Only Labor can be trusted to deliver— (Time expired)

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (17:54):  I was flicking through my email this morning and I saw the MPI for the day come up. These days we don't look at things in detail, we don't read the headers and footers first; we just flick to the body of the texts and we read them. I read:


A plan to fix Australia's hospitals, including more investment in beds, doctors and nurses; ending the Medicare freeze; and providing new MRI machines across Australia.


I thought: 'Wow! I wonder who wrote that excellent MPI. It probably came from Minister Cormann, Minister Birmingham or perhaps Minister Reynolds.' But then I glanced down and saw it came from Senator Wong. I thought, 'Goodness gracious me.' Seemingly I'm not the only one who read it incorrectly, because those opposite don't seem to have been particularly enthusiastic about their own MPI anyway.


This MPI does actually reflect what the government has been delivering: a plan to fix Australian hospitals. That's what the government's delivering. We've got record hospital investment. In fact, this government has increased the investment in the public hospital system over the period 2013-14 to 2020-21 from $13.3 billion to $23.4 billion, a 76 per cent increase. As Senator Hume very eloquently put it in her contribution, repeating something often enough does not make it true. There are no cuts here. In fact, there are very, very strong increases into the future. Under our new five-year hospital agreement, funding will increase by $30 billion from 2021 to 2024-25, an increase of 30 per cent, from $100 billion to $130 billion. This has been signed on by three Labor and three Liberal governments at the state level: Western Australia, the ACT, Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. I repeat: the state Labor governments recognise a good thing when they see it—except, of course, Victoria, and Senator Duniam very eloquently went through some of the reasons why that wasn't the case. This funding agreement equates to millions of new hospital services each year for Australian patients in our public hospitals, and thousands of new frontline doctors and nurses. So 'a plan to fix Australia's hospitals, including more investment in beds, doctors and nurses' gets a tick from this government.


In the brief time I have left, let's go to Labor's record on the Medicare freeze. Minister Reynolds, do you remember who introduced the Medicare freeze? I think it might have been Labor. It might have been Labor in government. The indexation freeze was introduced in 2013. In fact, this coalition government has provided $1.5 billion for re-indexation. So this government gets a tick on the MPI.


Finally, on 'providing new MRI machines across Australia', access to MRI scans is important, and more than 400,000 Australians will now be able to access life-saving scans for cancer, stroke, heart disease and other medical conditions, with a $175 million investment from this government in new MRI machines. The first 10 locations have been announced: Mount Druitt Hospital in New South Wales, Northern Beaches Hospital in New South Wales, Sale Hospital in Victoria, Monash Children's Hospital in Victoria, Pindara Private Hospital in Queensland, Toowoomba Hospital in Queensland, St John of God Midland Hospital in WA, Kalgoorlie Health Campus in WA, Mount Barker hospital in South Australia and the Royal Darwin Hospital in the Northern Territory. There will be a competitive public application process for a further 20 Medicare-eligible MRIs, and we invite prospective facilities to apply for consideration. I know a number of excellent facilities in Western Australia have applied to be part of this new rollout.


So this government does have a plan. It has a plan for the hospitals. It has a plan for the MRIs. We have made a contribution to the ending of the Medicare indexation freeze. We will continue to manage the economy in such a way as to be able to fund all the essential services that Australians require.

That the Senate take note of the document.


I wish to make a few comments on the report of the Review of the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This document was tabled as a result of an order for the production of documents that the Senate passed on a motion from me. It relates to the implementation of the 339 recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It was a report that the minister commissioned that, in fact, cost a significant amount of money. In Senate estimates we established that the report cost $691,793, of which $198,447 came from departmental funding and $493,346 came from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy; in fact, under a safety and wellbeing program. It was a review that people have been calling for for a long time. People have been calling for a long time for an understanding of which 339 recommendations have been implemented.


It was a desktop study that, in fact, relied on the states and territories to self-assess. I've got to say I have some significant issues with that self-assessment in terms of what they say is now implemented. If they've funded one particular program where the funding has now run out, that's counted as that recommendation being at least partially implemented, which I think is of very deep concern. I very much call into question the analysis of what has been implemented and what's been partially implemented, given that we are seeing an ever-worsening rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people going into the justice system; in particular, Deputy President, in our home state of Western Australia but also in other states around the country.


That's not to mention, obviously, the most important fact: we are still seeing deaths in custody. We've seen 407 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal commission, with 147 over the past decade. Not only are we seeing these deaths in custody in our home state of Western Australia, Deputy President; we are seeing the awful reasons people are going into custody. In the case of Ms Dhu it was for fine defaults. She then, unfortunately, died in custody. We aren't seeing the issues being adequately addressed. I'd argue very strongly that the implementation of these recommendations has not gone as far as the reading of the report suggests. We're also seeing Aboriginal people dying in custody from ailments and conditions that they should not be dying of. In other words, they are not receiving the medical attention that they should be receiving in the justice system.


It is now almost 30 years since the royal commission report was tabled, and we're still seeing incarceration rates increasing. They have not decreased as a result of implementation. These are very strong recommendations, so I'd argue very strongly that they have not been adequately implemented. In fact, we've seen a doubling of the incarceration rate since the completion of the royal commission report. We are not getting it right in this country. Imprisonment is not a solution to poverty and social issues, and one of the royal commission recommendations was around imprisonment as a last resort. We are not seeing that implemented around the country. We are not seeing imprisonment being imposed as the last resort—clearly not, when we're seeing people end up in prison as a result of fine default and not paying their fines. In some instances, people don't even know that they've been fined in the first place. The first they know of it is when the police come knocking on their doors.


According to the government's own report, some of the key areas that have not been implemented relate to the cycle of offending, self-determination and non-custodial approaches. I particularly want to focus on this issue of self-determination. It is absolutely critical. It comes out so strongly in the royal commission report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (20:04):  As I was saying, we've got a situation in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru that is having absolutely the most horrendous consequences for innocent human beings and, in fact, has created a humanitarian calamity. Part of my job as the Australian Greens' immigration spokesperson is to bear witness to what Australia is doing on Manus Island and Nauru. It's well and truly on the record that I've travelled to Manus Island many times and have seen what is happening over there. In fact, I was there at the time the Australian government ordered the withdrawal of drinking water, electricity, food and medication to over 600 men in the Lombrum detention centre.


Recently, I applied for a visa to visit Nauru. That, as the record shows, was rejected by the Nauruan government.

Therefore, Nauru government is unable to support the senator's visa request at this time.' We need an explanation from the Australian government as to exactly what role the Australian government played in having my visa denied by the Nauruan government. It is there in black and white: the Nauruan government said that they are unable to support my request for a visa because it does not have the support of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That's in black and white. Remember, these are Australia's detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru. They are funded by Australian government money—Australian taxpayers' money. The contracts are signed by the Department of Home Affairs. It's the Australian government that is responsible for everything that happens on Manus Island and Nauru—the rapes, the sexual assaults of children, the armed assaults from the Papua New Guinea navy, the humanitarian calamity that is offshore detention, and children in a catatonic state withdrawing from life.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (20:04):  As I was saying, we've got a situation in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru that is having absolutely the most horrendous consequences for innocent human beings and, in fact, has created a humanitarian calamity. Part of my job as the Australian Greens' immigration spokesperson is to bear witness to what Australia is doing on Manus Island and Nauru. It's well and truly on the record that I've travelled to Manus Island many times and have seen what is happening over there. In fact, I was there at the time the Australian government ordered the withdrawal of drinking water, electricity, food and medication to over 600 men in the Lombrum detention centre.


Recently, I applied for a visa to visit Nauru. That, as the record shows, was rejected by the Nauruan government. When it was rejected, I had an email from the Nauruan consulate in Brisbane forwarded to me that said: 'The senator's request to visit Nauru does not have the support of the Australian DFAT office. Therefore, Nauru government is unable to support the senator's visa request at this time.' We need an explanation from the Australian government as to exactly what role the Australian government played in having my visa denied by the Nauruan government.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (20:11):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Bill reforms GST payments to the States and Territories (States) by providing a fairer and more sustainable way of distributing GST.


It is a plan that leaves all States and Territories better off.


The Commonwealth makes significant payments to the States and Territories. The GST comprises half or well over half of these payments for most States and Territories. 


The good news for States and Territories, is that since 2000 when then Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello introduced the GST the revenue pool has more than doubled. It is expected to grow anther 65 per cent over the next decade.


However, the system has not been working for everyone. The integrity of the GST was being threatened with Western Australia's share falling to 30 cents in the dollar. This compares to Victoria and New South Wales getting more than 90 cents in the dollar and the smaller States higher rates again.


The situation was so ridiculous that Tasmania and the Northern Territory both received more GST revenue than Western Australia, despite having populations that were one fifth and one tenth, respectively, of the size of Western Australia's population.


The current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation was effective when the Australian economy and States' and Territories' economies were relatively stable. It meant that the GST was distributed so that all States and Territories had their fiscal capacities equalised to be the same as the broad-based, stable economies of either NSW or Victoria.


However, the current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation was not designed to deal with significant economic shocks. The mining boom was an unprecedented shock to the Australian economy. It exposed weaknesses in the system that could not have been foreseen when the GST was introduced. So, after the economic shocks of the past decade, it is time to make improvements to the system.


The way that GST is distributed in Australia has not been updated since it was introduced in 2000. 


The Coalition Government asked the Productivity Commission to reassess how the GST is distributed. The Productivity Commission found that although the current GST distribution system functions well and achieves high levels of fiscal equity, it can deliver perverse outcomes when there is a significant shock to the economy, such as a mining boom. 


The Government's Interim Response released on 5 July 2018 proposed reforms to the way the GST is distributed that will leave all States better off and protect the integrity of the system.


GST will continue to be distributed using the 'fair-go' principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE).


In essence, States should have sufficient resources (fiscal capacity) so that all Australians can have access to vital government services no matter where they live across the country. 


The Government's plan will:


First, create a new equalisation benchmark the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria (whichever is higher). All States will transition to this new equalisation standard over six years from 2021‑22 to 2026-27. 


Second, introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25.


Third, permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the States and Territories, by providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections.


The Bill will enable an initial boost of $600 million in 2021-22 and a further $250 million boost in 2024-25, indexed each year to grow in line with the GST. 


Fourth, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, States and Territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. This means at the end of the transition period, each State and Territory will have received the better of the cumulative total over the entire period of either the old system or the updated system. Payments will be verified annually by the Commonwealth Grants Commission over the transition period and any adjustments made accordingly. 


Fifth, to be completed by December 2026, the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry to assess whether the updated system is working efficiently, effectively and operating as intended.


Sixth, separately provide short-term top-ups to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to keep their relativities above 0.7 and 4.66 respectively from 2019-20 to 2021-22. 


At the end of this period in 2026-27, Australia will have a horizontal fiscal equalisation system that protects against economic shocks and provides a more stable source of revenue for all States and Territories.


The horizontal fiscal equalisation 'fair-go' principle has been an important part of our federal financial relations system since federation. The Government's horizontal fiscal equalisation reforms – implemented in this Bill – continue to uphold this principle, so that all Australians can have access to vital government services no matter where they live across this diverse country.

Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (20:18):  I acknowledge the leadership shown by the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, when she announced the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in November 2012. It is perhaps her finest legacy. As she said at that time:


… too many children have suffered child abuse, but have also seen other adults let them down—they've not only had their trust betrayed by the abuser but other adults who could have acted to assist them have failed to do so.


There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil.


Julia Gillard was determined that Australia could no longer avert its eyes from evil—and it is evil, with the full import of that word—and the report of the royal commission has fully vindicated the decision she took in 2012.


I don't want to name him, but I want to talk about a friend of mine. He went to one of the finest schools in Melbourne. He was a boarder there in the 1970s. He was sexually assaulted. The headmaster and the school supported the teacher, even calling the teacher a hero and someone who always acted in the best interests of the boys. These statements were made just prior to eventually paying my friend $500,000 in compensation, decades later. My friend was sexually assaulted by a teacher when he was 15 years old. When he told the headmaster what had happened, he was told that his claim was outrageous, that he had a vivid imagination, that he needed discipline and that his parents needed to consider whether he should stay at the school. The headmaster said that the teacher was an 'honourable man'. My friend's father was not a particularly physically demonstrative person, but he held my friend tight and he said, 'Son, we love you, we believe you and we'll make this right.'


My friend eventually received an apology from the school in June of this year—more than 40 years later. The only reason I know about this is that we were chatting a few weeks ago and he said, 'I'm coming up to Canberra on Monday.' This was the day the apology was given in the other place. I said: 'Oh, great! Are you coming up for work?' He said, 'No, I'm coming up for the apology.' He interpreted my silence quite correctly as my needing further elucidation. He said: 'I want to hear the apology. I think I will find it healing.' We were on the phone, but I just wanted to hug him, to hold him tight, as his father had done so many years before, because I could hear not only the voice of the adult but also the voice of the child. I didn't see him until the day after the apology. He is a lovely man, a very competent man, a very funny, intelligent and engaging man and a well-known man in Melbourne. But for the first time, when I saw him that following day, I saw the child he had been and the unnecessary journey he had had to undertake because of the betrayal, the grief, the anger, the pain and the awful, awful maelstrom of emotion. I am sorry. But my friend, not surprisingly, is a better person than the criminal who abused him. My friend said, in the only interview he has given:


My message is stand up, be heard, you're not alone.


I will stand with you.


Don't be a victim, be a survivor.


He said to me the following day that the apology will help him move on, that it is healing.


I want to acknowledge some people without whom we would not have had a royal commission. There is the former New South Wales police officer Peter Fox, whose investigation into the cover-up of child sexual abuse triggered the government's decision to appoint the royal commission. He had a great deal of difficulty in bringing his investigation into the light and he should be commended.


As a Catholic, I have found the report of the royal commission to be painful reading. It is difficult to reconcile the deep love and compassion that one knows exists within a faith with the evil that has been done to innocence. I sincerely hope—and I'm sure that this hope is shared by all Australian Catholics and all people of faith—that the church will change its attitude and its behaviour. We are starting to see some changes, including in the solemn vow: 'Never again will the safety of the child be placed behind the reputation of the church. No more cover-ups or transferring of people accused of abuse to other places.' The church was the first non-government institution to opt into the National Redress Scheme.


The Catholic Church is, however, not alone. I want to acknowledge, for example, Manny Waks, who courageously exposed the sexual abuse that he and others suffered in institutions of the orthodox Jewish community in Melbourne. There have been many others who have helped, from many religious and non-religious institutions and from government and nongovernment. They have exposed a failure to protect children and the fact that perpetrators were instead protected. It is now clear that there has been a systemic failure to protect children in institutional settings of all kinds—state and private, religious and secular—for many decades. That must now stop, for, if it doesn't, we must ask: what kind of society do we want? 'Sorry' is a word and only has power because one understands why one is sorry and the actions that therefore flow from that state of being. There is little point in saying sorry if there is no change.


The royal commission has given us a powerful set of recommendations. I thank the commissioners for their diligent carrying out of what must have been, at times, a harrowing duty. We as parliamentarians now also have a duty, and that is to put the recommendations of the royal commission into effect. I note the commitments given by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to that effect. This parliament—all of us, from all parties and the crossbench—needs to ensure that those commitments are acted upon, whoever is in government—for, if we shirk that duty, we will not be forgiven.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-11-12,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (20:24):  I rise to contribute to this motion on the apology following the royal commission into institutionalised child abuse. The royal commission was many years coming, and it has done incredibly important yet harrowing work to really put the spotlight on the suffering and the pain of so many Australian children in the institutions that were—many of them—meant to care for, look after and love the children who they abused. 


I want to start by saying that I am sorry. I want to associate my comments and heartfelt apology with those of every other member of this place and the other place—those who have stood and verbalised an apology, those who have acknowledged the moment's silence in the House of Representatives, and those who will do the same here shortly this evening. I'd also like to acknowledge the leadership of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in bringing forward this royal commission. There are many things that I wish Julia Gillard had done while she was Prime Minister, but I think it is fair to say that her strongest legacy will be this royal commission. The spotlight has exposed evil crimes done to children in institutions that are unthinkable, but it is so important to have had it happen. It should have happened many, many years ago. The evil should have been stopped many, many years ago. But, for what we have before us today, I think we need to pay strong and honest tribute to Ms Gillard for showing leadership at the time. 


I also want to associate myself with the comments of, and pay my respect to the leadership shown by, my own colleague Senator Rachel Siewert in relation to this issue. Senator Siewert has been fighting hard for many, many years in this place for justice and truth for the survivors of institutionalised child abuse, and for those who, for too long, remained voiceless and whose suffering and pain remained a dark secret. I also thought that the contribution in this place earlier today from Senator Kristina Keneally was one that deserves to be acknowledged. She spoke very eloquently and, as a practising Catholic, I think her words carry incredible power. 


Many of us, as we have acknowledged and reflected upon the much-needed apology to the survivors—and to those who didn't survive—think it is absolutely essential that we acknowledge that the children whose childhoods were stolen had it happen almost in plain sight. Yes, there were dark secrets that the institutions were keeping and that children—abused at the hands of those who were meant to care for them, look after them and love them—were forced to keep. But many, many people knew. And many, many people—adults; people in authority—stayed silent when they should have spoken up. That is what we are truly sorry for. As adults, too many people stayed silent and allowed these children to suffer, to be abused, to be traumatised, to be re-abused and re-traumatised, some night after night, week after week, month after month—and for years. The absolute horror of these acts is only compounded by the cover-up that was associated with them.


There have been many accounts that have been used as part of the reporting through this royal commission, and many of us in this place have referred to individual stories that reflect so devastatingly the pain and the suffering that innocent children have had to carry. Tonight I want to focus my short time speaking on this motion on what we have to do to ensure that this never, ever happens again. If we are honest about reforming the way we deal with the issue of institutional child abuse, we must accept that listening to children and believing them has to be first and foremost. We have to accept that those responsible for this evil must be well and truly held to account. There is no excuse—ever—for abusing or hurting a child. There is no confession that can make this abuse less evil. If we are to deal with this issue properly, we must accept that religious institutions themselves must change.


Out of the 180-odd recommendations from this report, a number of them stand out in a very stark way. Recommendation 7.4 goes directly to the issue of the confessional. I will read it so that we have it clearly on Hansard:


Laws concerning mandatory reporting to child protection authorities should not exempt persons in religious ministry from being required to report knowledge or suspicions formed, in whole or in part, on the basis of information disclosed in or in connection with a religious confession.


No religious institution should ever excuse the abuse and trauma inflicted on children. After years and decades of suffering, generational and intergenerational trauma, it is time that we acknowledge that the confessional is not an excuse for keeping child abuse secret or for protecting the abusers.


It is the responsibility of any religious organisation, any person in authority and any adult that when they see evil they do something to stop it. And when they see children suffering, they must do something to stop it. If they suspect that a child is being abused and is suffering emotional or physical abuse or sexual abuse, they must do something about it. Any institution that refuses to comply with laws of mandatory reporting of child abuse, using the excuse of the seal of confession, I believe, should be prosecuted. I believe that using the seal of confession to refuse to report child abuse does not warrant the protection of Australian law or funding from the Australian taxpayer. If the Catholic dioceses around this nation are not prepared to concede to the recommendation of mandatory reporting of child abuse, I don't believe they should be receiving any public money. If you're not prepared to stick to the law that is designed to protect children, you're not playing your part as a decent institution in the community.


From 1 October this year, my home state of South Australia became the first state where priests are now legally obliged to report any confessions of child sexual abuse. In response to these laws being put in place, we have the leadership within the Catholic diocese in Adelaide openly saying they will defy those laws. Despite everything that we have been through, despite all of the reporting that has gone on and the exposure of this horror and this evil, we have leadership within the Catholic Church saying that they are refusing, and will refuse, to comply with the basic necessity of mandatory reporting and that somehow their seal of confession is more sacred than the life of an innocent child. I fundamentally and strongly disagree. I hope that the public response on this issue creates pause for thought for a number of those within the leadership of the Catholic Church and the various dioceses about complying and not using the confessional as an excuse to keep secret these horrible, painful and evil acts.


The report into institutionalised child sexual abuse also dealt, in a very sensitive manner, with the other contentious issue facing religious organisations. That, of course, is mandatory celibacy. Recommendations 16.18, 16.19 and 16.20 in the royal commission's final report all go to this. I strongly support that. If we are to be honest and brave, and if we are to pay genuine tribute and apology to all those who have suffered, to those children who never made it, to the survivors who are still in pain and suffering today, and to their children, who have suffered the intergenerational trauma of this abuse, we must also deal with forced celibacy within religious institutions. Canon law should be changed so that celibacy is not mandatory, and it should be illegal to force an individual to be celibate simply for religious tradition. I understand that this is a very sensitive element. I understand that this is a very controversial and sacred part of religious practice. But, if we are to be honest with ourselves, with the community and with the children who have suffered, we must face this and not hide behind it.


There are many other good recommendations throughout this report. I am very pleased that the government, the opposition, the Greens and other members around this chamber and the other have agreed to take these on. We must also insist that religious institutions and the church leadership take them on as well. Let's not allow the pain and re-traumatisation to have happened in vain. These two issues, the seal of confession and the enforcement of celibacy, must change if we are to ensure that we are doing everything we possibly can to protect children and young people from the type of evil and horror that we know has existed for far too long in those dark corners of institutions, and adults must do their jobs to protect children and to protect the innocence of children. That is what is important here—not ancient law and practice, but the protection of the innocence of a child and their right to a childhood, to love and care, and to be believed and supported, without the cover-up and without the shame.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-11-12,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (20:45):  Little is more important in life than bringing children into this world. Nothing is more important than the responsibilities parents face, having made that fundamental decision—that is, to ensure that children can grow up in an environment where they have the best chance to prosper, to know that they are loved and, most importantly, that they are safe. Parents can and do a lot on their own, but the community has a role too. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse showed us how grievously as a community we have failed. Like those who have spoken before, today and tonight, I say sorry to the tens of thousands of children who suffered for so long at the hands of people they believed they could trust and who suffered as adults as their pleas were ignored.


Sixteen thousand individuals contacted the commission with their deeply distressing accounts of abuse. More than 8,000 accounts were heard in person. For the commissioners and those working with them, I know this was a deeply distressing experience but one they weathered for the greater good. The commissioners and all associated with them are owed a great debt of gratitude, not just from the many who suffered for so long—voices in the wilderness often ignored by the institutions responsible for their abuse or, worse, belittled as they struggled for justice. Churches moved around priests who they knew were abusers. They resisted appeals from victims and their parents. They took legal advice designed to minimise their liability.


The nation owes Julia Gillard a pat on the back and a collective hug for having the courage to establish the royal commission. As the former Prime Minister has noted, she worried at the time about the effects of an inquiry probing people's hurt. She was anxious that the inquiry would take a long time and cause frustration. Odd fears, she now notes, given the results and the recommendations of the royal commission.


The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, deserves to be congratulated too, for promoting and leading the national apology. As the Prime Minister said three weeks ago:


Why were the cries of children and parents ignored? Why was our system of justice blind to injustice? Why has it taken so long to act? Why were other things more important than this, the care of innocent children?


These are unanswerable questions, but now the time for grief ought to be over. Now is the time for redress. How we as a parliament, and as a nation, respond to the royal commission will be the proof of what we have learnt as a community. Words are one thing, but actions are quite another. The government has not rejected a single recommendation of the royal commission. The Prime Minister says that the government is acting on 104 of the inquiry's 122 recommendations, and is consulting with the states and territories on the remaining 18. I note the four key areas of the findings and recommendations to be: child safety as a national responsibility, the need to implement child safe standards, the importance of believing children and the potential for a genuine apology to have a therapeutic benefit.


As Professor Daryl Higgins, the Director of the Institute of Child Protection Studies at the Australian Catholic University puts it:


For the apology to be meaningful, Australians will want concrete actions to provide redress for those already harmed.


…   …   …


… organisations can adopt prevention strategies that focus on modifying risky environments (including physical structures, policies and supervision practices), so that it is harder for would-be perpetrators to behave as they did in the past. Governance, funding arrangements and accreditation should be contingent on serious progress towards a culture of safety.


A National Redress Scheme for victims of child sexual abuse in organisations, to allow psychological counselling and compensation of up to $150,000, has already been announced. But, as Professor Higgins points out, what people really need to hear is that things will change. They want to know what is happening in youth-serving organisations. How will the mistakes from the past not be repeated? They need to hear how child safe strategies will become standard practice. How will they, for example, be embedded in funding arrangements and accountability requirements? If organisations won't prioritise the safety and wellbeing of children, says Professor Higgins, then the public purse should not be open to them.


The statistics revealed by the royal commission are as grim as they are stark. Close to 60 per cent of victims who approached the inquiry reported sexual abuse in religious institutions. A central recommendation of the inquiry was the National Redress Scheme. Despite various statements, the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches are yet to fully formally opt into the scheme. Apologies may have been made, but, once again, it is action which counts. As the Prime Minister puts it, justice, decency and the beliefs and values we as Australians share insist that they sign on. So far, though, some key institutions have not. Time is running out. Many of the victims are old, frail and ill. They deserve recognition, justice, treatment and recompense for their suffering.


I applaud Senator Hinch, who has made chasing down child sexual abuse one of the missions of his career, both in the media and in this place. He has a motion on the Notice Paper for tomorrow calling on the government to withhold public funding and deny charity tax concessions to religious institutions that fail to opt into the National Redress Scheme by the end of 2018. It is a motion that I support, and I hope that government senators will support it, too, when it comes to a vote tomorrow. The royal commission reported in December last year. Twelve months is quite long enough for the institutions in question to sign up voluntarily.


Then there is the CREATE Foundation, the peak body for foster care children, calling for:


… a tightening of standards related to the ongoing monitoring of placements to ensure that children and young people in the out-of-home care system are provided the opportunity to have a voice in this monitoring process.


The royal commission revealed that the out-of-home care sector, commonly known as 'foster care', was the worst source of child abuse in Australia in the years before 1990. Nearly 50,000 children are currently in out-of-home care across Australia. As the CREATE Foundation puts it:


We must never again be in the position of ignoring so many children and young people who tried to tell their stories of abuse and were silenced by a flawed and non-accountable system.


The last word should belong to Julia Gillard, who appealed to governments around Australia to develop schemes for the victims that will operate with 'a culture of openness and generosity'. As a community which did not sow such qualities in the past, it is the least we can do to heal the hurt and try to ensure it never happens again.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (20:52):  Every child has the right to feel safe, to be heard and to be protected by those in whom their safety is entrusted. But, for survivors of institutionalised child abuse, those rights were denied. You sought safety and were subjected to unspeakable harm. You spoke up, and those with power turned away. You named demons and were demonised. For these unforgivable acts of avoidance, for the culture of wilful ignorance, for the pain and trauma that was met with silence, for the silence that was created and in which prowled the predators that did your life such terrible damage—for all these things and so much more—your parliament tonight offer up our apologies.


There may well be those watching at home who neither trust the words we offer nor believe in the genuineness of the spirit in which they are put forward. To those I say: you have every right to be suspicious, because you placed your trust in us, you placed your trust in those who were charged with your protection, and we failed you. Our failure will cast a long shadow over this place and all places that took part in it—a shadow which we will never, nor should we ever, attempt to escape. We made you feel as though you were shameful, as though you were broken, when it was we who were broken, when it was our shame to be held.


It is for us now to offer this recognition, to offer this apology and to humbly seek your forgiveness. It is for us now to dedicate ourselves solemnly to the work of making this apology material—to dedicate ourselves to doing those things which will ensure that no child is ever again subjected to the harms, that no child is ever again turned away from when they speak up and that no demon is ever again facilitated to prowl among the young of this nation.


As we reflect upon the findings of the royal commission, as we absorb the stories that were so bravely told after being held for so long, we must reflect upon those things which caused these horrors to take place. We must recognise that our society has for too long disregarded the voices of children, treating them as mere chattels of adults and writing them off as imaginative and as liars when they come forward with their stories. We must reflect upon how we as a society can radically and urgently change this—the ways in which we can elevate and enshrine the rights of Australian children so that no child ever again is left to suffer in silence or subjected to abuse.


I thank the chamber for its time.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion of apology moved by Senator Cormann be agreed to. I will ask senators for a moment's silence to signify our assent to the motion.


Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (20:59):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Labor supports every state and territory and our Commonwealth getting their fair share of GST revenues. Federal Labor has consistently led the way in arguing for GST reform that addresses the needs of Western Australia while also preserving much-needed funding across the other jurisdictions.


It was of course Labor that first put forward policy to ensure that Western Australia got its fair share, without punishing the other states and territories. We announced this policy, our Fair Share for WA Fund, well over a year ago, at the end of August 2017. This policy recognised the issues that Western Australia had been experiencing and committed $1.6 billion at the time, funded by our sensible measures to improve the budget, which would have put Western Australia up to a 70c level. At the time, the coalition government criticised us for employing this top-up method. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said, 'Top-ups forever is a mug's game.' This was merely the first in a number of inconsistencies in the government's approach to this issue, particularly over the course of last year. Indeed, after the government released its interim response to the PC inquiry, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, again led the policy debate in July of this year when he said:


Make the floor the law.


This was also ridiculed by the government, but just what has the government now done with this bill? They've accepted a 70c floor and a 75c floor, along with top-ups going on forever.


The government's obstinacy was again on display when shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen, followed by the state and territory treasurers, unanimously called for a guarantee within the legislation so that no state or territory would be worse off as a result of the government's proposed new model. The government, at first, refused to heed these calls, saying there didn't need to be one because there was all this money available to the states. And yet, as evidenced in this legislation, Labor's position has been adopted and there is a guarantee within the legislation. While Labor has been consistent and principled in its approach, the government's approach has instead been to, at first, criticise what is a sensible proposal, then vacillate on their own position before, finally, backflipping.


Ultimately, however, we're pleased the government has seen the sense of Labor's proposals and broadly adopted them, albeit utilising them with a slightly different mechanism. The need for a reconsideration of how the GST is distributed is well known, particularly as it relates to Western Australia. Never in the history of the GST has any other state or territory fallen below 86c in terms of their relativity, except, of course, Western Australia, which got as low as 30c in 2015-16 and 2016-17.


It's important not to forget the role that a certain member of the Morrison government played in relation to the unenviable situation that Western Australia found itself in, particularly in relation to the GST. It was the then Treasurer of Western Australia, who, in early 2011, along with the then Premier, Colin Barnett, decided to raise royalties. This was a cynical and transparent attempt to force a change to the GST distribution so they could keep most of the money. And just who was that Treasurer? It was none other than the Attorney-General, Christian Porter, the member for Pearce. What was the result of this cynically engineered ploy?


Well, as the shadow Treasurer put it to the House, it was to make 'a complete and utter mess' of the Western Australian state budget.


Turning to the bill itself, the bill contains several elements that make up the government's proposal for the new GST distribution model. The bill makes changes to the GST distribution model, changing the equalisation method for horizontal fiscal equalisation from the fiscally strong state which was Western Australia to the strongest of either New South Wales or Victoria. The six-year transition period from the existing system to the new system starts in 2021-22 and finishes in 2026-27. This bill also legislates for a floor, which is precisely what Labor had been calling for. The bill contains a 70c floor for all states and territories in 2022-23 and 2023-24, rising to a 75c floor in 2024-25.


The bill also contains a mechanism whereby the Commonwealth will provide an additional top-up into the GST pool in perpetuity. From 2021-22 onwards, the Commonwealth will provide hundreds of millions of dollars to the states and territories: $600 million per year, indexed to GST revenue growth, from 2021-22 to 2023-24, rising to $850 million per year—again, indexed to GST revenue growth—from 2024-25 onwards. This will lead to top-ups of over $1 billion a year. 


The bill also contains a legislated guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off. This is a cumulative guarantee. If a state's or territory's entitlement over the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27 is less than they would have received, the guarantee will activate. On balance, we think this is a reasonable approach; however, it's not as if there are no concerns about it. The government has only provided a guarantee for the transition period. What happens beyond that time? What is to stop GST revenue being taken away from jurisdictions such as Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory? Notwithstanding that, we on this side of the chamber would like to see a long-term Labor government still in office at the end of this transition period. What could a future Liberal government do: cut schools and hospitals, as is their record and their preference?


The bill also contains a requirement for a review by the Productivity Commission on whether the changes are operating efficiently, effectively and as intended. The review will also look at the fiscal implications for each state and territory as a result of this legislation. The Productivity Commission must submit its report to the government by 31 December 2026. We have no issues with this review. I would note, of course, that the last time the government initiated a PC review into the GST it actually rejected the recommendations—and with good reason, given that the commission's preferred model would have been completely unacceptable. 


I also note that this bill went through a short Senate inquiry. This provided the chance for states and territories to make submissions and to ensure that this legislation is doing what it is supposed to do. Again, let me make it clear that, while Labor will support this bill, it's not as though the states and territories did not raise concerns with the bill. Evidence to the Senate inquiry from the Victorian government went to the fact that the forecast of future relativities is subject to a high degree of variability, which could leave states and territories worse off. State and territory governments were notably concerned that the Commonwealth top-up funding might come at the expense of cuts to other funding arrangements. While a letter from the federal Treasurer to state and territory governments stated that 'any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states', there were still concerns raised. 


Federal Labor will hold this government to account on its commitment not to cut other funding to states and territories. We will scrutinise the imminent MYEFO budget update to determine just how the Morrison government will be paying for these top-up payments. Labor senators are of the view that the letter from the federal Treasurer to the state and territory treasurers ought to be tabled during the parliamentary debate so that the government's commitment to this issue can be strengthened. 


This is a government that can't be trusted. This is a government that is so consumed by its internal conflicts that it just can't get economic policy right, and this is another example. They have backflipped on each of the issues that Labor raised, and raised for due and proper reasons. This government is inconsistent. It's incoherent on economic policy. It makes promises and breaks them. Remember this government's commitment 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to the ABC or SBS'? Remember that?


Have a look at what they've done in the last few days. They have made cuts to Foodbank, reducing its funding from $750,000 to $427,000. This is an operation, a non-government organisation, that sets about trying to help the most disadvantaged in our country. Foodbank leveraged their funding to $8 million through support from business. Across the country, 2,600 charities rely on Foodbank's support. So the government has cut funding to Foodbank.


Trying to do some sleight of hand, the government have provided $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation—a small, private foundation—without a tender. That's great economic policy! They have provided $200 million to a project in Bob Katter's seat in return for his vote. What's that about? No wonder they're handing $200 million to a lower house member when they are in such a parlous state, when they are depending on the vote of Mr Katter.


They are providing $60 million to deliver One Nation's policy on apprentices. Why would anyone take up any policy position of One Nation, especially a policy position that the coalition are now describing as the 'bush wage' to support apprentices? It is basically paying for apprentices' employment in their first, second and third years to various levels. The government actually subsidises apprentices generally, across the country, to the tune of $9,000. This attempt to get the support of One Nation will cost $92,000 per apprenticeship. Where's the economic rationality in that? Where is the logic in these decisions that this government is making, when it's desperately trying to cling to government?


They're describing this so-called 'bush wage policy' as a 'pilot'. Well, if the pilot were run out across the rest of the country, it would cost $11 billion to subsidise apprenticeships across the nation. It's absolute economic nonsense. There are better, cheaper and more effective ways to deal with ensuring that apprentices are taken on, such as Labor's proposal that one in every 10 employees on government-funded projects is an apprentice. The government should stop this nonsense of trying to ensure that unions in the construction sector can't negotiate and reach agreement with their employer on employing apprentices. The government have made that illegal. By making that illegal, they now have to hand over $92,000 for every apprentice as part of their appeasement of the racist party, One Nation. They also provided $2 million to former Senator Bob Day to try and make sure that former Senator Bob Day voted with them. Then Senator Day had asked for $1.4 million to subsidise 20 apprentices, and the government handed him $2 million. Where's the economic rationale in that?


This government must be watched. This government is about making promises based on securing its own survival. Its priorities are crazy. It's no wonder that Prime Minister Morrison described his own government as 'muppets', and it's no surprise that former Prime Minister Turnbull described those that knifed him in the back as 'mad'. So we've got the M&Ms, the 'mad muppets', across the chamber. That's all they are—a pathetic, declining government; a government in chaos; a government that claim economic superiority but don't have an economic brain in their head. Despite this, Labor will support this bill. We'll support the bill, but we will continue to monitor the crazy decisions that this government makes. We will continue to oppose bad decisions. We will continue to oppose bad economic decisions.


Let's look at this government's record on economic decisions. What was their first position? It was an austerity budget in 2014-15 that would have made pensioners $80 a week worse off over 10 years and would have resulted in young kids getting no social security payments for six months—on the streets with nothing to spend and nothing to look after their basic needs. Then the government moved from that to handing the GST over to the states. Remember that economic policy? Prime Minister Turnbull announced it at Penrith Stadium, and it lasted a day and a half. Then they moved from that to other crazy propositions, like trickle-down economics—that workers would be better off if the big end of town was given $80 billion and the banks were given about $17 million. The government have no economic credibility. They are a mess. We need to get to an election and we need to get rid of these mad muppets as soon as possible. (Time expired)

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (21:19):  I rise this evening to make a very short contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, because this is a government that is getting on with the job and we don't need to spend the next 20 minutes talking about that. But I do wish to pay tribute to six people who have made a really significant contribution. The first is, of course, the former Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who is the person who has managed to shepherd through what was said to be—and I won't name the people who said this; we all know who they were—impossible to achieve. But he has achieved it.


The other people I wish to pay tribute to are my Senate colleagues from Western Australia. Two of them are in the chamber this evening—Senator Dean Smith and Senator Linda Reynolds. The others are Senators Michaelia Cash and Mathias Cormann. The genesis of this significant national reform and the hard work that was done in achieving it were largely done before my time in the Senate, and I wish to acknowledge the significant contribution of my four colleagues in standing up for the rights of Western Australia, standing up for the proper place of the Senate as a states' house in this Federation and achieving what many said was impossible: significant reform of GST-sharing arrangements to the significant benefit of our home state of Western Australia. I thank you all.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (21:21):  I too rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. But I really do want what actually happened to be put on the record. Senator Cameron, in his contribution to this debate, outlined in a series of events how we got to where we are today. I have to say that we got here with the government dragging its heels and criticising Labor every step of the way. We got here because Premier Mark McGowan made this his No. 1 priority on winning the election last year.


When we look at where WA has come from in getting a fair go for GST, we had, for many years, a Liberal state government and, coinciding with that, a Liberal federal government. Within the Western Australian component, from the Liberal Party we had cabinet ministers and other ministers with very important portfolios, and none of them lifted a finger. I will pay tribute to Senator Dean Smith, who, with a Liberal state government and a Liberal federal government, wasn't able to deliver GST reform but wasn't afraid to speak out about it. He was the only one.


When we look at Senator Cormann, part of his experience as a senior minister from Western Australia has been as the acting Prime Minister. What did he do for GST reform? Nothing—diddly squat! What did Ms Bishop, the member for Curtin and our former foreign minister, do about GST reform when we had a Liberal government in the state and here? Nothing! What did the Attorney-General, Mr Christian Porter, the member for Pearce, do? I might just leave him, because I'd really like to put his record on the Hansard tonight. What did Minister Keenan, the longstanding member for Stirling and a minister in successive Liberal federal governments, do about GST reform in WA? Nothing—absolutely nothing! Mr Wyatt became a minister more recently, but he's been the long-term member for Hasluck. What has he done on GST reform? Nothing! What has Mr Steve Irons, the member for Swan—sadly, my local member, although, hopefully, in the election we'll change that—done about GST reform? I follow Mr Irons carefully and closely; he's my local member. Nothing! I've never ever seen a leaflet from Mr Irons that talked about the need for GST reform. Minister Cash was a fairly high-profile minister who had a fall from grace. What did she do on GST reform? Nothing!


So on and on it goes. All these very important people, very important ministers, in this federal Liberal government—one of them was the acting Prime Minister for some time—have done nothing.


I want to come back to Mr Porter, the member for Pearce—and, hopefully, that will change too because there are a number of marginal seats in Western Australia and they play into this agenda as well. He was the Treasurer in the state Liberal government under Mr Barnett. Mr Barnett was absolutely booted out of the parliament last year in the state's election, suffering the biggest loss the Liberal Party had ever seen in Western Australia because he put the state into record debt. We hear those opposite—in particular, Minister Cormann—talking about debt and deficit. What did they ever say to Mr Barnett when he racked up a massive debt so bad that the WA treasury just before the state election last year raised real concern about the level of interest payments Western Australians were being saddled with? Who was the Treasurer who incurred most of that debt? Who was the Treasurer?




Senator Cameron:
  Can I guess?




Senator LINES:
  Go right ahead, Senator Cameron.




Senator Cameron:
  The member for Pearce.




Senator LINES:
  It was the member for Pearce, Mr Porter. Mr Nahan had a bit of a hand in it as well, but when you look at the reports of the Western Australian economy most of that debt belonged to Mr Porter. No wonder he took the seat of Pearce and skedaddled out of the state parliament as quickly as he could. No wonder. So Mr Porter bears a big responsibility for the debt that Mr Barnett's government left the Western Australian people with. Is it any wonder that they were unceremoniously kicked out of office last year? Mr Porter then came here. I'm the duty senator for Pearce, so I like to watch what he's up to as well. Never did I see Mr Porter trying to do anything about the GST.


When Mr McGowan came into power, he said that he would do something about the GST—and, to his absolute credit, he has. He also pledged to the Western Australian public that he would reduce the debt, and he's done that. Under Mr Porter, Mr Nahan and Mr Barnett, WA lost its AAA credit rating. There were all sorts of downgrades. It was just a disgrace. But what have we seen the Liberals doing in Western Australia? Suddenly they realised the only person who ever mentioned the GST was Senator Smith, so they started running full-page ads having a go at Labor, somehow trying to run this story that Labor weren't interested in fixing the GST. As Senator Cameron has outlined, we were the first people interested. We put the Fair Share for WA Fund up, which effectively would have taken the GST floor to 70c. Mr Morrison just mocked that. We insisted that, when Mr Morrison finally got around to putting a fix in, the floor be legislated. He scoffed at that. In fact, I was at a media conference with Senator Wong when she was asked, 'But surely when the bill comes before the parliament, Senator Wong, you'll back off on that; you won't push with this ridiculous idea to legislate the floor?' Senator Wong said, in no uncertain terms, that we would. And what happened? Suddenly Mr Morrison was onboard. So we've now got the floor legislated. We also said, 'No other state or territory is to be worse off.' Again, we were given the promise: 'Trust us. We made those commitments about the ABC, SBS and school funding. You can trust us. We never go back on our word.' Of course, the states and territories were never, ever going to sign up to that. So we now have the guarantee in place.


But I think the thing that really got me—it didn't get under my skin; I just thought, 'Boy, some people are really cheeky!'—was when I got a letter from Mr Nahan, one of the treasurers who put WA into massive debt. He didn't just send it to me; he sent it to Senator Dodson, Senator Pratt and Senator Sterle. But as he was pressing the email 'send' button he also sent it to the media. So it wasn't really a letter to Labor senators; it was a bit of political grandstanding. Dr Nahan tried to make a claim in this letter that somehow Labor, who were on the public record, weren't going to support the GST fix.


I took the opportunity to ask Dr Nahan a few questions of my own. When he was treasurer, what was he doing about this massive debt that Mr Porter started and he continued? What was he doing about that? What was he doing about the massive unemployment rate that, along with Mr Barnett and Mr Porter, he created? What was he doing about the loss of our AAA credit rating? All this happened under Dr Nahan, Mr Porter and Mr Barnett. Well surprise, surprise! I haven't had a response from Dr Nahan. I thought it was fair, because he'd published his letter, that I publish mine, so I published that letter.


It didn't stop there. I then got a letter—and I presume other senators did as well—from Senator Cormann. His is somewhat longer than Dr Nahan's, setting out all the evil things that Labor is alleged to have done. Perhaps I will let Minister Cormann answer for himself, but I don't think he published this to the news media. He certainly showed them. So, because there was the benefit of the doubt, I didn't publish mine to the media. I thought: 'Fair go! He didn't publish it; he only showed it.' But he, too, picks up some of Dr Nahan's nonsense about trying to pretend that Labor wasn't supporting the GST.


I went back to Minister Cormann and asked him the same questions—the same ones that Dr Nahan wouldn't answer. We've heard in here that he likes to talk about debt and deficit. He likes to say that the federal government, despite its massive debt at the moment, somehow has reduced debt. I thought, 'I'll ask him the questions.' So I asked him, as the federal counterpart—he's part of the Liberal Party, and presumably they talk to one another—if he had ever raised concerns with Mr Porter about the massive debt he'd occurred. I asked him if he'd ever raised concerns with Dr Nahan about the loss of the AAA credit rating. I asked Minister Cormann if he had raised concerns with Mr Barnett about the rising and massive record unemployment under the Liberals in Western Australia. I asked Minister Cormann why there were these reports from Treasury warning about the dangers of the Western Australian debt. Surprise, surprise! I heard nothing back from Minister Cormann either. I say in my letter: 'I note your letter to WA Labor senators and MPs regarding the GST. It's hard to see this letter as anything other than a cheap political stunt, as it was given to the WA media at the same time it was sent to us.' I can only conclude that Senator Cormann isn't interested in responding to my questions about what was going on in Western Australia under the Barnett Liberal government and, indeed, when Mr Porter was the treasurer, what was happening with our debt. As I said at the outset, there was just silence, when Colin Barnett was in power, about fixing up the GST.


I attended the Senate inquiry into this bill. It was really interesting to hear from the states and territories. It was really a very productive day to hear from everyone. So important is this GST fix to Western Australia that Premier McGowan came and gave evidence. That is unprecedented, I think. I know that he will be watching this debate tonight. What Mr Barnes, the Under Treasurer, said at the inquiry was interesting. He said the disadvantage 'is not the size of WA's total revenue base or the growth in that total revenue base; it is the composition of that revenue base'. The really important point is, he said:


… about 18 per cent of our total revenue comes from mining royalties and about 86 per cent of that comes from iron ore. That's where WA is the outlier compared to the other states, and it is that outlier composition of our revenue base that drives the distortions and the disincentives under the current system.


He thought that 'was quite an important distinction', and I agree with him. He also said:


Just to highlight those distortions and disincentives, in the last financial year WA collected about $4.5 billion in iron ore royalties and this year our GST relativity is 47.3 per cent. If, instead of collecting that $4.5 billion in iron ore royalties, we instead collected the same quantum of revenue from payroll tax or stamp duty, our GST relativity would be over 100 per cent and we wouldn't be sitting here today.


Mr McGowan made similar comments in talking about gold and iron ore. He made the point:


I could give you just one example of that. Because Western Australia is a big iron ore mining state—other states have small iron ore industries, but we have … the big one—90 per cent of what we raise from iron ore is redistributed.


There was a similar amount from gold. About 60 per cent of gold revenue is redistributed.


I do commend the bill. I'm keen to get it voted on and I'm keen for Western Australia to get its fair share. I am very pleased that the Morrison government has followed Labor's lead and is going to legislate the floor and that it has made the guarantee that no other state or territory will be worse off. I would not have copped a situation where WA got something and other states and territories got nothing, because it should be fair and we should have a situation where everyone gets a fair go. Now that Mr Morrison has followed Labor's lead, that is in fact what will happen.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:38):  The bill before us today is a lie. It is called the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. If it was just rearranging the distribution of GST revenues to make it fair—whatever 'fair' might mean—at least it would have no overall financial impact. What we have instead is a bill that will cost taxpayers $9 billion over 10 years. What is going on here and who is stretching the truth?


This bill is fundamentally about authorising the Commonwealth government to throw $9 billion at state and territory governments, over and above the GST revenues they already receive. This bill is not about a fair share of GST. It is about grabbing $9 billion from taxpayers in addition to their payment of GST and throwing that money to state and territory governments on an unconditional basis in what amounts to a massive bribe to get out of a political problem caused by the crazy fiscal relationships between the states and the Commonwealth. This is also not some trivial transitional grant; it is permanent change, entrenched in law. No longer can there be any pretence that state and territory governments receive GST revenues and the Commonwealth government receives income tax. The Commonwealth collects both GST and income tax revenues in massive proportions, massive quantities, and then decides—now on a political whim—what it might pass to state and territory governments. This time, that whim is to save some seats in Western Australia, but who knows what it might be in the future, because there is no reasoning or predictability?


The truth is federal financial relations in this country are a shambles. We have a federal government that raises the money, and state and territory governments that spend it, with next to no accountability anywhere. The Liberal Democrats have a fully funded, costed and published plan to get rid of the interstate welfare system called horizontal fiscal equalisation. Under our plan, taxpayers would see their tax bill slashed in half so they would keep much more of their hard-earned money. Crucially, each state government would be required to raise all the money they spend, so they would have no-one to blame but themselves if they ran out. There would be no more blaming the Commonwealth because they didn't get enough. But let's get back to this bill. 


Of course, the great bulk of the $9 billion in handouts authorised by the bill is being thrown at the beggar state and territory governments—in particular those in Tasmania and South Australia. Regardless of which major party is in power, these beggar governments continue to hold back the prosperity of the people they are supposed to represent. These beggar governments only see the upside of preventing development, of smothering their small businesses in red tape and of making fanciful commitments to renewable energy. They should feel the downside of more expensive energy, fewer bustling small businesses and fewer jobs. But, for these beggar governments, such a downside is merely a recipe for more and more compensation from taxpayers in the rest of the Federation. 


I don't expect this Senate to object to throwing billions of dollars of taxpayers funds at beggar governments in places like Tasmania and South Australia; after all, all the major parties are infested with a disproportionate number of beggar politicians from those states and territories. But it should. In fact, what we need is a 'begxit', where the beggar states exit the Federation. But the beggar governments of these states never do anything for themselves, so they won't exit of their own accord. The rest of us, with the Liberal Democrats at the vanguard, will need to arrange it for them.

 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (21:43):  I rise to add my contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. My contribution won't be as colourful as Senator Leyonhjelm's. 


I do want to make it very clear at the outset that Labor does support this bill, but we do so with quite some degree of reservation. My reservation centres on three key points: firstly, the arbitrary nature of the Commonwealth's decision to introduce this legislation while questions from the states and territories remain unanswered; secondly, the complete lack of transparency from this government about how it intends to fund the top-up policy that this legislation introduces; and, thirdly, the likelihood that this untrustworthy government won't make good on its commitment not to cut other crucial funding to states and territories. Health or education funding, national partnership funding agreements on housing and early childhood education and care could all be at risk under a government that changes its mind and its Prime Minister at the whim of the polls. I will come back to these points shortly. 


I also want to point out that it is Labor that has led the way when it comes to GST reform. It was Labor that listened to the concerns of the states and territories and took them seriously. It was Labor who took on board the plight of Western Australia, where not only the financial mismanagement of the Liberal Barnett government—although that was a key factor—but also the effects of the time lag in the current method of GST distribution meant that a drop in Western Australia's share coincided with a sudden economic downturn, significantly affecting the state's ability to balance the books. That's why Labor announced the Fair Share for WA Fund, a fund designed to bring Western Australia up to the equivalent of 70c in the GST dollar.


During the course of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, the Premier of Western Australia, Mr McGowan, attended—as Senator Leyonhjelm indicated—and he made it very clear that he thought that the Labor announcement of the Fair Share for WA Fund was a game changer in ensuring that there was a positive outcome for West Australia. There was a policy vacuum in this area. The government wasn't coming to the party and so it fell to Labor to come forward with a tangible policy response. Mr Shorten and federal Labor came forward with that policy response to a long acknowledged problem.


Contrary to what the coalition subsequently proposed, the Fair Share for WA Fund was structured to ensure that other states and territories would not see any reduction in their GST funding. I'm a senator for Queensland, so, whilst we would like to see Western Australia dealt with fairly, we certainly don't want to see any reduction in funding for Queenslanders, particularly given the fact that Queensland is a decentralised state. Once the coalition came to the party on GST reform, Labor fought for and won a seven-year guarantee that no state or territory would be worse off under the new funding arrangements. This important Labor achievement is one of the key reasons that I will be voting for this bill.


I will now outline, for the benefit of those listening or watching, what this bill is proposing to do. It largely responds to a report from the Productivity Commission inquiry into horizontal fiscal equalisation. The report recommended changes to the method of distribution of the GST, in recognition that the current method of distribution is sometimes disadvantageous, particularly in the case of economic shocks in our economy and particularly in the case of Western Australia in recent times. To change the method of GST distribution, this bill amends the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to transition our current system of full horizontal fiscal equalisation, or HFE, to a system of reasonable equalisation, which means equalising to the stronger performing state of New South Wales and Victoria. The bill goes on to introduce a minimum GST-revenue-sharing relativity, or GST relativity floor, that may be determined by the Treasurer for any individual state or territory, and it also permanently boosts the GST revenue pool with additional Commonwealth financial assistance.


The bill also provides for measures during the transition period, including payments to be made to any state or territory with a GST revenue-sharing relativity below a relativity factor of 0.7, or 70c in the dollar, later moving to 0.75; payments to be made to the Northern Territory if its GST-revenue-sharing relativity falls below its determined relativity factor for 2017-18; and a guarantee that each state and territory will get the better of the current distribution system or the updated distribution system during the transition period. In addition, the explanatory memorandum to the bill provides that the Productivity Commission will be required to conduct an inquiry at the end of the transition period, and additional Commonwealth funding under the new method of distribution and top-up arrangements will be nearly $9 billion over 10 years.


I would now like to go back and look at the history of GST reform, for the benefit of those listening. The GST was introduced in the year 2000 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard—although, as people listening might recall, the following comments were made by Mr Howard in 1995, before he was elected:


There's no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy … Never ever. It's dead.


After being elected, the Liberals changed their tune, with Mr Howard—


Debate interrupted.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (20:59):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Labor supports every state and territory and our Commonwealth getting their fair share of GST revenues. Federal Labor has consistently led the way in arguing for GST reform that addresses the needs of Western Australia while also preserving much-needed funding across the other jurisdictions.


It was of course Labor that first put forward policy to ensure that Western Australia got its fair share, without punishing the other states and territories. We announced this policy, our Fair Share for WA Fund, well over a year ago, at the end of August 2017. This policy recognised the issues that Western Australia had been experiencing and committed $1.6 billion at the time, funded by our sensible measures to improve the budget, which would have put Western Australia up to a 70c level. At the time, the coalition government criticised us for employing this top-up method. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said, 'Top-ups forever is a mug's game.' This was merely the first in a number of inconsistencies in the government's approach to this issue, particularly over the course of last year. Indeed, after the government released its interim response to the PC inquiry, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, again led the policy debate in July of this year when he said:


Make the floor the law.


This was also ridiculed by the government, but just what has the government now done with this bill? They've accepted a 70c floor and a 75c floor, along with top-ups going on forever.


The government's obstinacy was again on display when shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen, followed by the state and territory treasurers, unanimously called for a guarantee within the legislation so that no state or territory would be worse off as a result of the government's proposed new model. The government, at first, refused to heed these calls, saying there didn't need to be one because there was all this money available to the states. And yet, as evidenced in this legislation, Labor's position has been adopted and there is a guarantee within the legislation. While Labor has been consistent and principled in its approach, the government's approach has instead been to, at first, criticise what is a sensible proposal, then vacillate on their own position before, finally, backflipping.


Ultimately, however, we're pleased the government has seen the sense of Labor's proposals and broadly adopted them, albeit utilising them with a slightly different mechanism. The need for a reconsideration of how the GST is distributed is well known, particularly as it relates to Western Australia. Never in the history of the GST has any other state or territory fallen below 86c in terms of their relativity, except, of course, Western Australia, which got as low as 30c in 2015-16 and 2016-17.


It's important not to forget the role that a certain member of the Morrison government played in relation to the unenviable situation that Western Australia found itself in, particularly in relation to the GST. It was the then Treasurer of Western Australia, who, in early 2011, along with the then Premier, Colin Barnett, decided to raise royalties. This was a cynical and transparent attempt to force a change to the GST distribution so they could keep most of the money. And just who was that Treasurer? It was none other than the Attorney-General, Christian Porter, the member for Pearce. What was the result of this cynically engineered ploy?


Well, as the shadow Treasurer put it to the House, it was to make 'a complete and utter mess' of the Western Australian state budget.


Turning to the bill itself, the bill contains several elements that make up the government's proposal for the new GST distribution model. The bill makes changes to the GST distribution model, changing the equalisation method for horizontal fiscal equalisation from the fiscally strong state which was Western Australia to the strongest of either New South Wales or Victoria. The six-year transition period from the existing system to the new system starts in 2021-22 and finishes in 2026-27. This bill also legislates for a floor, which is precisely what Labor had been calling for. The bill contains a 70c floor for all states and territories in 2022-23 and 2023-24, rising to a 75c floor in 2024-25.


The bill also contains a mechanism whereby the Commonwealth will provide an additional top-up into the GST pool in perpetuity. From 2021-22 onwards, the Commonwealth will provide hundreds of millions of dollars to the states and territories: $600 million per year, indexed to GST revenue growth, from 2021-22 to 2023-24, rising to $850 million per year—again, indexed to GST revenue growth—from 2024-25 onwards. This will lead to top-ups of over $1 billion a year. 


The bill also contains a legislated guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off. This is a cumulative guarantee. If a state's or territory's entitlement over the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27 is less than they would have received, the guarantee will activate. On balance, we think this is a reasonable approach; however, it's not as if there are no concerns about it. The government has only provided a guarantee for the transition period. What happens beyond that time? What is to stop GST revenue being taken away from jurisdictions such as Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory? Notwithstanding that, we on this side of the chamber would like to see a long-term Labor government still in office at the end of this transition period. What could a future Liberal government do: cut schools and hospitals, as is their record and their preference?


The bill also contains a requirement for a review by the Productivity Commission on whether the changes are operating efficiently, effectively and as intended. The review will also look at the fiscal implications for each state and territory as a result of this legislation. The Productivity Commission must submit its report to the government by 31 December 2026. We have no issues with this review. I would note, of course, that the last time the government initiated a PC review into the GST it actually rejected the recommendations—and with good reason, given that the commission's preferred model would have been completely unacceptable. 


I also note that this bill went through a short Senate inquiry. This provided the chance for states and territories to make submissions and to ensure that this legislation is doing what it is supposed to do. Again, let me make it clear that, while Labor will support this bill, it's not as though the states and territories did not raise concerns with the bill. Evidence to the Senate inquiry from the Victorian government went to the fact that the forecast of future relativities is subject to a high degree of variability, which could leave states and territories worse off. State and territory governments were notably concerned that the Commonwealth top-up funding might come at the expense of cuts to other funding arrangements. While a letter from the federal Treasurer to state and territory governments stated that 'any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states', there were still concerns raised. 


Federal Labor will hold this government to account on its commitment not to cut other funding to states and territories. We will scrutinise the imminent MYEFO budget update to determine just how the Morrison government will be paying for these top-up payments. Labor senators are of the view that the letter from the federal Treasurer to the state and territory treasurers ought to be tabled during the parliamentary debate so that the government's commitment to this issue can be strengthened. 


This is a government that can't be trusted. This is a government that is so consumed by its internal conflicts that it just can't get economic policy right, and this is another example. They have backflipped on each of the issues that Labor raised, and raised for due and proper reasons. This government is inconsistent. It's incoherent on economic policy. It makes promises and breaks them. Remember this government's commitment 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to the ABC or SBS'? Remember that?


Have a look at what they've done in the last few days. They have made cuts to Foodbank, reducing its funding from $750,000 to $427,000. This is an operation, a non-government organisation, that sets about trying to help the most disadvantaged in our country. Foodbank leveraged their funding to $8 million through support from business. Across the country, 2,600 charities rely on Foodbank's support. So the government has cut funding to Foodbank.


Trying to do some sleight of hand, the government have provided $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation—a small, private foundation—without a tender. That's great economic policy! They have provided $200 million to a project in Bob Katter's seat in return for his vote. What's that about? No wonder they're handing $200 million to a lower house member when they are in such a parlous state, when they are depending on the vote of Mr Katter.


They are providing $60 million to deliver One Nation's policy on apprentices. Why would anyone take up any policy position of One Nation, especially a policy position that the coalition are now describing as the 'bush wage' to support apprentices? It is basically paying for apprentices' employment in their first, second and third years to various levels. The government actually subsidises apprentices generally, across the country, to the tune of $9,000. This attempt to get the support of One Nation will cost $92,000 per apprenticeship. Where's the economic rationality in that? Where is the logic in these decisions that this government is making, when it's desperately trying to cling to government?


They're describing this so-called 'bush wage policy' as a 'pilot'. Well, if the pilot were run out across the rest of the country, it would cost $11 billion to subsidise apprenticeships across the nation. It's absolute economic nonsense. There are better, cheaper and more effective ways to deal with ensuring that apprentices are taken on, such as Labor's proposal that one in every 10 employees on government-funded projects is an apprentice. The government should stop this nonsense of trying to ensure that unions in the construction sector can't negotiate and reach agreement with their employer on employing apprentices. The government have made that illegal. By making that illegal, they now have to hand over $92,000 for every apprentice as part of their appeasement of the racist party, One Nation. They also provided $2 million to former Senator Bob Day to try and make sure that former Senator Bob Day voted with them. Then Senator Day had asked for $1.4 million to subsidise 20 apprentices, and the government handed him $2 million. Where's the economic rationale in that?


This government must be watched. This government is about making promises based on securing its own survival. Its priorities are crazy. It's no wonder that Prime Minister Morrison described his own government as 'muppets', and it's no surprise that former Prime Minister Turnbull described those that knifed him in the back as 'mad'. So we've got the M&Ms, the 'mad muppets', across the chamber. That's all they are—a pathetic, declining government; a government in chaos; a government that claim economic superiority but don't have an economic brain in their head. Despite this, Labor will support this bill. We'll support the bill, but we will continue to monitor the crazy decisions that this government makes. We will continue to oppose bad decisions. We will continue to oppose bad economic decisions.


Let's look at this government's record on economic decisions. What was their first position? It was an austerity budget in 2014-15 that would have made pensioners $80 a week worse off over 10 years and would have resulted in young kids getting no social security payments for six months—on the streets with nothing to spend and nothing to look after their basic needs. Then the government moved from that to handing the GST over to the states. Remember that economic policy? Prime Minister Turnbull announced it at Penrith Stadium, and it lasted a day and a half. Then they moved from that to other crazy propositions, like trickle-down economics—that workers would be better off if the big end of town was given $80 billion and the banks were given about $17 million. The government have no economic credibility. They are a mess. We need to get to an election and we need to get rid of these mad muppets as soon as possible. (Time expired)

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (21:19):  I rise this evening to make a very short contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, because this is a government that is getting on with the job and we don't need to spend the next 20 minutes talking about that. But I do wish to pay tribute to six people who have made a really significant contribution. The first is, of course, the former Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who is the person who has managed to shepherd through what was said to be—and I won't name the people who said this; we all know who they were—impossible to achieve. But he has achieved it.


The other people I wish to pay tribute to are my Senate colleagues from Western Australia. Two of them are in the chamber this evening—Senator Dean Smith and Senator Linda Reynolds. The others are Senators Michaelia Cash and Mathias Cormann. The genesis of this significant national reform and the hard work that was done in achieving it were largely done before my time in the Senate, and I wish to acknowledge the significant contribution of my four colleagues in standing up for the rights of Western Australia, standing up for the proper place of the Senate as a states' house in this Federation and achieving what many said was impossible: significant reform of GST-sharing arrangements to the significant benefit of our home state of Western Australia. I thank you all.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (21:21):  I too rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. But I really do want what actually happened to be put on the record. Senator Cameron, in his contribution to this debate, outlined in a series of events how we got to where we are today. I have to say that we got here with the government dragging its heels and criticising Labor every step of the way. We got here because Premier Mark McGowan made this his No. 1 priority on winning the election last year.


When we look at where WA has come from in getting a fair go for GST, we had, for many years, a Liberal state government and, coinciding with that, a Liberal federal government. Within the Western Australian component, from the Liberal Party we had cabinet ministers and other ministers with very important portfolios, and none of them lifted a finger. I will pay tribute to Senator Dean Smith, who, with a Liberal state government and a Liberal federal government, wasn't able to deliver GST reform but wasn't afraid to speak out about it. He was the only one.


When we look at Senator Cormann, part of his experience as a senior minister from Western Australia has been as the acting Prime Minister. What did he do for GST reform? Nothing—diddly squat! What did Ms Bishop, the member for Curtin and our former foreign minister, do about GST reform when we had a Liberal government in the state and here? Nothing! What did the Attorney-General, Mr Christian Porter, the member for Pearce, do? I might just leave him, because I'd really like to put his record on the Hansard tonight. What did Minister Keenan, the longstanding member for Stirling and a minister in successive Liberal federal governments, do about GST reform in WA? Nothing—absolutely nothing! Mr Wyatt became a minister more recently, but he's been the long-term member for Hasluck. What has he done on GST reform? Nothing! What has Mr Steve Irons, the member for Swan—sadly, my local member, although, hopefully, in the election we'll change that—done about GST reform? I follow Mr Irons carefully and closely; he's my local member. Nothing! I've never ever seen a leaflet from Mr Irons that talked about the need for GST reform. Minister Cash was a fairly high-profile minister who had a fall from grace. What did she do on GST reform? Nothing!


So on and on it goes. All these very important people, very important ministers, in this federal Liberal government—one of them was the acting Prime Minister for some time—have done nothing.


I want to come back to Mr Porter, the member for Pearce—and, hopefully, that will change too because there are a number of marginal seats in Western Australia and they play into this agenda as well. He was the Treasurer in the state Liberal government under Mr Barnett. Mr Barnett was absolutely booted out of the parliament last year in the state's election, suffering the biggest loss the Liberal Party had ever seen in Western Australia because he put the state into record debt. We hear those opposite—in particular, Minister Cormann—talking about debt and deficit. What did they ever say to Mr Barnett when he racked up a massive debt so bad that the WA treasury just before the state election last year raised real concern about the level of interest payments Western Australians were being saddled with? Who was the Treasurer who incurred most of that debt? Who was the Treasurer?




Senator Cameron:
  Can I guess?




Senator LINES:
  Go right ahead, Senator Cameron.




Senator Cameron:
  The member for Pearce.




Senator LINES:
  It was the member for Pearce, Mr Porter. Mr Nahan had a bit of a hand in it as well, but when you look at the reports of the Western Australian economy most of that debt belonged to Mr Porter. No wonder he took the seat of Pearce and skedaddled out of the state parliament as quickly as he could. No wonder. So Mr Porter bears a big responsibility for the debt that Mr Barnett's government left the Western Australian people with. Is it any wonder that they were unceremoniously kicked out of office last year? Mr Porter then came here. I'm the duty senator for Pearce, so I like to watch what he's up to as well. Never did I see Mr Porter trying to do anything about the GST.


When Mr McGowan came into power, he said that he would do something about the GST—and, to his absolute credit, he has. He also pledged to the Western Australian public that he would reduce the debt, and he's done that. Under Mr Porter, Mr Nahan and Mr Barnett, WA lost its AAA credit rating. There were all sorts of downgrades. It was just a disgrace. But what have we seen the Liberals doing in Western Australia? Suddenly they realised the only person who ever mentioned the GST was Senator Smith, so they started running full-page ads having a go at Labor, somehow trying to run this story that Labor weren't interested in fixing the GST. As Senator Cameron has outlined, we were the first people interested. We put the Fair Share for WA Fund up, which effectively would have taken the GST floor to 70c. Mr Morrison just mocked that. We insisted that, when Mr Morrison finally got around to putting a fix in, the floor be legislated. He scoffed at that. In fact, I was at a media conference with Senator Wong when she was asked, 'But surely when the bill comes before the parliament, Senator Wong, you'll back off on that; you won't push with this ridiculous idea to legislate the floor?' Senator Wong said, in no uncertain terms, that we would. And what happened? Suddenly Mr Morrison was onboard. So we've now got the floor legislated. We also said, 'No other state or territory is to be worse off.' Again, we were given the promise: 'Trust us. We made those commitments about the ABC, SBS and school funding. You can trust us. We never go back on our word.' Of course, the states and territories were never, ever going to sign up to that. So we now have the guarantee in place.


But I think the thing that really got me—it didn't get under my skin; I just thought, 'Boy, some people are really cheeky!'—was when I got a letter from Mr Nahan, one of the treasurers who put WA into massive debt. He didn't just send it to me; he sent it to Senator Dodson, Senator Pratt and Senator Sterle. But as he was pressing the email 'send' button he also sent it to the media. So it wasn't really a letter to Labor senators; it was a bit of political grandstanding. Dr Nahan tried to make a claim in this letter that somehow Labor, who were on the public record, weren't going to support the GST fix.


I took the opportunity to ask Dr Nahan a few questions of my own. When he was treasurer, what was he doing about this massive debt that Mr Porter started and he continued? What was he doing about that? What was he doing about the massive unemployment rate that, along with Mr Barnett and Mr Porter, he created? What was he doing about the loss of our AAA credit rating? All this happened under Dr Nahan, Mr Porter and Mr Barnett. Well surprise, surprise! I haven't had a response from Dr Nahan. I thought it was fair, because he'd published his letter, that I publish mine, so I published that letter.


It didn't stop there. I then got a letter—and I presume other senators did as well—from Senator Cormann. His is somewhat longer than Dr Nahan's, setting out all the evil things that Labor is alleged to have done. Perhaps I will let Minister Cormann answer for himself, but I don't think he published this to the news media. He certainly showed them. So, because there was the benefit of the doubt, I didn't publish mine to the media. I thought: 'Fair go! He didn't publish it; he only showed it.' But he, too, picks up some of Dr Nahan's nonsense about trying to pretend that Labor wasn't supporting the GST.


I went back to Minister Cormann and asked him the same questions—the same ones that Dr Nahan wouldn't answer. We've heard in here that he likes to talk about debt and deficit. He likes to say that the federal government, despite its massive debt at the moment, somehow has reduced debt. I thought, 'I'll ask him the questions.' So I asked him, as the federal counterpart—he's part of the Liberal Party, and presumably they talk to one another—if he had ever raised concerns with Mr Porter about the massive debt he'd occurred. I asked him if he'd ever raised concerns with Dr Nahan about the loss of the AAA credit rating. I asked Minister Cormann if he had raised concerns with Mr Barnett about the rising and massive record unemployment under the Liberals in Western Australia. I asked Minister Cormann why there were these reports from Treasury warning about the dangers of the Western Australian debt. Surprise, surprise! I heard nothing back from Minister Cormann either. I say in my letter: 'I note your letter to WA Labor senators and MPs regarding the GST. It's hard to see this letter as anything other than a cheap political stunt, as it was given to the WA media at the same time it was sent to us.' I can only conclude that Senator Cormann isn't interested in responding to my questions about what was going on in Western Australia under the Barnett Liberal government and, indeed, when Mr Porter was the treasurer, what was happening with our debt. As I said at the outset, there was just silence, when Colin Barnett was in power, about fixing up the GST.


I attended the Senate inquiry into this bill. It was really interesting to hear from the states and territories. It was really a very productive day to hear from everyone. So important is this GST fix to Western Australia that Premier McGowan came and gave evidence. That is unprecedented, I think. I know that he will be watching this debate tonight. What Mr Barnes, the Under Treasurer, said at the inquiry was interesting. He said the disadvantage 'is not the size of WA's total revenue base or the growth in that total revenue base; it is the composition of that revenue base'. The really important point is, he said:


… about 18 per cent of our total revenue comes from mining royalties and about 86 per cent of that comes from iron ore. That's where WA is the outlier compared to the other states, and it is that outlier composition of our revenue base that drives the distortions and the disincentives under the current system.


He thought that 'was quite an important distinction', and I agree with him. He also said:


Just to highlight those distortions and disincentives, in the last financial year WA collected about $4.5 billion in iron ore royalties and this year our GST relativity is 47.3 per cent. If, instead of collecting that $4.5 billion in iron ore royalties, we instead collected the same quantum of revenue from payroll tax or stamp duty, our GST relativity would be over 100 per cent and we wouldn't be sitting here today.


Mr McGowan made similar comments in talking about gold and iron ore. He made the point:


I could give you just one example of that. Because Western Australia is a big iron ore mining state—other states have small iron ore industries, but we have … the big one—90 per cent of what we raise from iron ore is redistributed.


There was a similar amount from gold. About 60 per cent of gold revenue is redistributed.


I do commend the bill. I'm keen to get it voted on and I'm keen for Western Australia to get its fair share. I am very pleased that the Morrison government has followed Labor's lead and is going to legislate the floor and that it has made the guarantee that no other state or territory will be worse off. I would not have copped a situation where WA got something and other states and territories got nothing, because it should be fair and we should have a situation where everyone gets a fair go. Now that Mr Morrison has followed Labor's lead, that is in fact what will happen.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-11-12,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:38):  The bill before us today is a lie. It is called the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. If it was just rearranging the distribution of GST revenues to make it fair—whatever 'fair' might mean—at least it would have no overall financial impact. What we have instead is a bill that will cost taxpayers $9 billion over 10 years. What is going on here and who is stretching the truth?


This bill is fundamentally about authorising the Commonwealth government to throw $9 billion at state and territory governments, over and above the GST revenues they already receive. This bill is not about a fair share of GST. It is about grabbing $9 billion from taxpayers in addition to their payment of GST and throwing that money to state and territory governments on an unconditional basis in what amounts to a massive bribe to get out of a political problem caused by the crazy fiscal relationships between the states and the Commonwealth. This is also not some trivial transitional grant; it is permanent change, entrenched in law. No longer can there be any pretence that state and territory governments receive GST revenues and the Commonwealth government receives income tax. The Commonwealth collects both GST and income tax revenues in massive proportions, massive quantities, and then decides—now on a political whim—what it might pass to state and territory governments. This time, that whim is to save some seats in Western Australia, but who knows what it might be in the future, because there is no reasoning or predictability?


The truth is federal financial relations in this country are a shambles. We have a federal government that raises the money, and state and territory governments that spend it, with next to no accountability anywhere. The Liberal Democrats have a fully funded, costed and published plan to get rid of the interstate welfare system called horizontal fiscal equalisation. Under our plan, taxpayers would see their tax bill slashed in half so they would keep much more of their hard-earned money. Crucially, each state government would be required to raise all the money they spend, so they would have no-one to blame but themselves if they ran out. There would be no more blaming the Commonwealth because they didn't get enough. But let's get back to this bill. 


Of course, the great bulk of the $9 billion in handouts authorised by the bill is being thrown at the beggar state and territory governments—in particular those in Tasmania and South Australia. Regardless of which major party is in power, these beggar governments continue to hold back the prosperity of the people they are supposed to represent. These beggar governments only see the upside of preventing development, of smothering their small businesses in red tape and of making fanciful commitments to renewable energy. They should feel the downside of more expensive energy, fewer bustling small businesses and fewer jobs. But, for these beggar governments, such a downside is merely a recipe for more and more compensation from taxpayers in the rest of the Federation. 


I don't expect this Senate to object to throwing billions of dollars of taxpayers funds at beggar governments in places like Tasmania and South Australia; after all, all the major parties are infested with a disproportionate number of beggar politicians from those states and territories. But it should. In fact, what we need is a 'begxit', where the beggar states exit the Federation. But the beggar governments of these states never do anything for themselves, so they won't exit of their own accord. The rest of us, with the Liberal Democrats at the vanguard, will need to arrange it for them.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (21:43):  I rise to add my contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. My contribution won't be as colourful as Senator Leyonhjelm's. 


I do want to make it very clear at the outset that Labor does support this bill, but we do so with quite some degree of reservation. My reservation centres on three key points: firstly, the arbitrary nature of the Commonwealth's decision to introduce this legislation while questions from the states and territories remain unanswered; secondly, the complete lack of transparency from this government about how it intends to fund the top-up policy that this legislation introduces; and, thirdly, the likelihood that this untrustworthy government won't make good on its commitment not to cut other crucial funding to states and territories. Health or education funding, national partnership funding agreements on housing and early childhood education and care could all be at risk under a government that changes its mind and its Prime Minister at the whim of the polls. I will come back to these points shortly. 


I also want to point out that it is Labor that has led the way when it comes to GST reform. It was Labor that listened to the concerns of the states and territories and took them seriously. It was Labor who took on board the plight of Western Australia, where not only the financial mismanagement of the Liberal Barnett government—although that was a key factor—but also the effects of the time lag in the current method of GST distribution meant that a drop in Western Australia's share coincided with a sudden economic downturn, significantly affecting the state's ability to balance the books. That's why Labor announced the Fair Share for WA Fund, a fund designed to bring Western Australia up to the equivalent of 70c in the GST dollar.


During the course of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, the Premier of Western Australia, Mr McGowan, attended—as Senator Leyonhjelm indicated—and he made it very clear that he thought that the Labor announcement of the Fair Share for WA Fund was a game changer in ensuring that there was a positive outcome for West Australia. There was a policy vacuum in this area. The government wasn't coming to the party and so it fell to Labor to come forward with a tangible policy response. Mr Shorten and federal Labor came forward with that policy response to a long acknowledged problem.


Contrary to what the coalition subsequently proposed, the Fair Share for WA Fund was structured to ensure that other states and territories would not see any reduction in their GST funding. I'm a senator for Queensland, so, whilst we would like to see Western Australia dealt with fairly, we certainly don't want to see any reduction in funding for Queenslanders, particularly given the fact that Queensland is a decentralised state. Once the coalition came to the party on GST reform, Labor fought for and won a seven-year guarantee that no state or territory would be worse off under the new funding arrangements. This important Labor achievement is one of the key reasons that I will be voting for this bill.


I will now outline, for the benefit of those listening or watching, what this bill is proposing to do. It largely responds to a report from the Productivity Commission inquiry into horizontal fiscal equalisation. The report recommended changes to the method of distribution of the GST, in recognition that the current method of distribution is sometimes disadvantageous, particularly in the case of economic shocks in our economy and particularly in the case of Western Australia in recent times. To change the method of GST distribution, this bill amends the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to transition our current system of full horizontal fiscal equalisation, or HFE, to a system of reasonable equalisation, which means equalising to the stronger performing state of New South Wales and Victoria. The bill goes on to introduce a minimum GST-revenue-sharing relativity, or GST relativity floor, that may be determined by the Treasurer for any individual state or territory, and it also permanently boosts the GST revenue pool with additional Commonwealth financial assistance.


The bill also provides for measures during the transition period, including payments to be made to any state or territory with a GST revenue-sharing relativity below a relativity factor of 0.7, or 70c in the dollar, later moving to 0.75; payments to be made to the Northern Territory if its GST-revenue-sharing relativity falls below its determined relativity factor for 2017-18; and a guarantee that each state and territory will get the better of the current distribution system or the updated distribution system during the transition period. In addition, the explanatory memorandum to the bill provides that the Productivity Commission will be required to conduct an inquiry at the end of the transition period, and additional Commonwealth funding under the new method of distribution and top-up arrangements will be nearly $9 billion over 10 years.


I would now like to go back and look at the history of GST reform, for the benefit of those listening. The GST was introduced in the year 2000 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard—although, as people listening might recall, the following comments were made by Mr Howard in 1995, before he was elected:


There's no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy … Never ever. It's dead.


After being elected, the Liberals changed their tune, with Mr Howard—


Debate interrupted.

Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (21:50):  I rise this evening to speak on the subject of nuclear energy. Our government is working to overcome a crisis of confidence in energy, and it is making good progress. Our nation is blessed with abundant resources—the basis of affordable, reliable energy that Australia once enjoyed. Yet only one in four Australians believe that the energy market is working in their interests, according to a recent survey. 


We in parliament have a responsibility to the Australian people to turn this around, to return energy policy to a sensible footing and restore public confidence. To do this, we are getting back to basics, examining the problem and potential solutions with open minds. In the short term, the government's top priority is reducing energy prices, as it should be. Minister Taylor recently announced that we are working towards fairer pricing arrangements that stop energy companies taking advantage of customers. These changes are overdue and should be supported. They promise to make a difference to power bills as soon as possible, which is exactly what Australians desperately need. 


However, there are other answers to the big underlying problems in the energy sector. The big challenge in energy is what experts call the trilemma. Over the past decade, the Australian government has concentrated on three things: affordability, reliability, and emissions reduction. The problem is that the technologies in our present energy mix cannot satisfy all three criteria. We have such problems in energy because we are working towards priorities that are difficult to meet with the technologies we are using. Solving the trilemma is the key to restoring confidence in the energy sector. If we are to do this, we must sensibly and deliberately explore potential solutions. The full range of potential solutions over the short, medium and long term must be explored. For too long, Australia's energy debate has focused on coal versus renewables, but by focusing on coal versus renewables we may lose sight of the true breadth of alternatives over the longer period. 


One of these alternatives is nuclear energy. In recent weeks, a real conversation has started about nuclear energy; it needs to be continued, because Australia has neglected it as an option for decades. It's time to seriously examine its potential for Australia's energy needs in the 21st century. If we are to be truly fair minded and technologically neutral in relation to our energy future, nuclear deserves serious and sober consideration. Like coal, nuclear energy promises affordable and reliable base-load power. More importantly, it produces a very low level of CO2 emissions. Over time, it has the unique potential to solve the energy trilemma by combining the best of all other technologies. 


Expert assessments demonstrate that nuclear is the cheapest energy option that isn't coal. A modern nuclear plant would be able to provide, at minimal operating costs, power for more than half a century. That means that, averaged out over the total life cycle of a power plant, the cost of nuclear energy would be very low. And the up-front cost of plants keep falling as technology advances. A report from the US Energy Innovation Reform Project reveals that the next generation of advanced reactors will cost substantially less than current models. The findings of this report suggest nuclear prices per megawatt-hour are likely to be comparable to those of coal and gas, as presented in the Finkel report. That needs to be repeated: nuclear prices per megawatt-hour are likely to be comparable to those of coal and gas, as presented in the Finkel report. 


Unlike coal and gas, nuclear power promises an affordable, reliable energy source without any CO2 emissions. The report of South Australia's Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission found that nuclear was comparable with wind in producing negligible CO2 emissions. In fact, the total life cycle emissions from nuclear are even less than that of solar. Let me also repeat that: the total life cycle emissions from nuclear are even less than that of solar. Nuclear could, therefore, over time, slash Australia's CO2 emissions.


A study from Electric Power Consulting demonstrated that replacing all coal with nuclear in Australia's energy mix some time in the future would reduce emissions by 93 per cent, and replacing our old coal power plants with advanced nuclear reactors would make a tremendous reduction in emissions and allow Australia to far surpass our international commitments.


Unlike renewables, nuclear promises great reliability. It is not dependent on the sun shining or the wind blowing. It can operate continuously without interruption. This makes nuclear well suited to providing base load power at a scale appropriate for Australia's energy needs. It could supplement or even replace coal as the foundation of Australia's base load power supply. In short, nuclear offers to blend the advantages of coal and renewables. It is reliable, low-cost, low emissions technology.


There are other merits, of course, to nuclear power, beyond solving the trilemma. We live in a time of tremendous technological innovation and nuclear power is no exception. The reactors of today are a long way from the reactors of half a century ago, and the reactors we will see coming online within the next decade will be even more advanced. They will be smaller, safer, cleaner and more efficient than any reactors we have ever seen before.


While we strive to get out of our energy crisis, the rest of the world is embracing nuclear energy for the 21st century. Australia is the only OECD country yet to do so. There is nuclear expertise in this country, but there is also a deep reservoir of international expertise in nuclear energy into which Australia can tap. We would stand to benefit from integration into the existing international networks of scientific, technical and commercial collaborations. Australia could also benefit from adopting the most advanced technology from overseas. This means that we could take the best the world has to offer, learn from mistakes that have been made elsewhere and develop our own expertise through our world-class education and research institutions. This is not to say that there are no questions to be investigated. I'm not recommending nuclear unquestioningly, nor suggesting that we rush headlong into it. Many questions would need to be considered—for instance, what sort of reactor technology would best suit Australia's needs? Some of the designs shortlisted by the Generation IV International Forum was thorium fuel molten salt reactors and graphite-moderated, very-high temperature reactors. These are the kinds of questions that would need to be answered.


Many Australians would also have concerns that would need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact. There can be no ducking these matters. They require honest and careful investigation. Questions need to be asked and objections listened to. What is no longer debateable is that nuclear should be considered as an option for Australia's long-term energy needs. We in this chamber have a common responsibility to ensure that Australia's best interests are served by the policies we enact. Energy policy has been deficient in this regard.


The Australian people expect and deserve their standards of living to improve and not get worse. We've seen prices increase and reliability decrease. This impacts families and also businesses. Until recently, most Australians paid little attention to energy—they had no need. They could carry on with confidence that in energy, as in other policy areas, their elected representatives would work in their best interests. We are here in this parliament to do what we can to help realise the Australian dream: the promise of a better future for Australians, their children and their grandchildren and to advance Australia's interests through policies that can help to bring better lives to the citizens of this nation. If nuclear proves to be the best option for Australia's energy future, as I believe it will, we owe it to the Australian people to give it our full consideration.
