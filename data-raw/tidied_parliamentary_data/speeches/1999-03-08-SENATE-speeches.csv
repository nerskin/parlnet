"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-03-08,"—This is Minister Reith's so-called youth employment bill, and I say so-called because it would be more aptly named the `youth wages bill'. This is a bill that not only because of what it contains but because of the process that is involved should not even be before this parliament. Let me deal firstly with the real agenda of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 . It is not, as the title seems to indicate, a bill that will improve working conditions or increase job opportunities for young Australians, nor will it even reasonably address youth unemployment in areas such as the bush. The real agenda is consistent with the typical approach of Minister Reith, an approach which has been mean-spirited and designed to ruthlessly cut costs and attack victims.
Let me go to the bill itself. If we look at the explanatory memorandum of the bill we would see what we might anticipate in relation to this legislation, which is legislation to 
 deal with the exemption of junior rates—an issue that was canvassed during the workplace relations bill inquiry and which was the subject of an arrangement between the government and the Democrats. But, no, this legislation goes much further than this. If we look at what this bill represents, it covers permanently exempting junior rates, as one might expect. It also seeks to include in the principal object of the act and in the objects of part 6 of the act the protection of the competitive position of young people in the labour market, and the promotion of youth employment and the reduction of youth unemployment—laudable aims, but I will deal further with how it seeks to do that.
The third dot point also highlights that this bill seeks to promote the inclusion of junior rates of pay in awards and agreements. It actually promotes the inclusion of junior rates. When this matter was debated in the House of Representatives the question was asked, `What is a junior rate?' It appears that the answer could be `a rate for those up to 21 years of age'. This legislation is actually seeking to promote the inclusion of junior rates for Australian workers, who are up to possibly 21 years of age, in the roughly 50 per cent of awards that do not actually contain them.
This brought back memories to me. I did a search and found a Sydney Morning Herald article which proposed a $3 an hour youth pay proposal. This was part of the government's Fightback campaign. There is nothing new in this proposal. There is no new measure to assist youth unemployment. It is simply a matter of cutting costs, cutting wages, with the arguable claim that it will increase employment. This was rejected around the time that this community, this country, debated Fightback. This was rejected then and, as this morning's Australian points out, it is not something that the government has a clear mandate on. In a front-page article in today's Australian, Richard McGregor reports—
—Read Glenn Milne—it is much better reading.
—It is actually much better reading, but that was two 
 weeks ago, Senator Campbell. But, back to the point, in relation to Reith's call-up of business, it says:
. . . after he—
Minister Reith—
agreed to soft-pedal on the issue during the election campaign.
So where is this mandate that Minister Reith had agreed to soft-pedal on in order that Australians would not really understand that what he is actually after is the insertion of rates as low as $3 per hour for Australia's junior workers? If there is any concern about whether this is really the case, whether this bill really does mean this, let me take you to some of the provisions of the bill. Point 3 of the bill says:
3 After paragraph 88B(3)(b)
Insert:
	 (ba)	 the need to protect the competitive position of young people in the labour market, to promote youth employment, and to assist in reducing youth unemployment, through appropriate junior wage provisions;
Anyone dealing with industrial law would then ask the question: `What do we mean by ""appropriate""?' What would the commission regard as appropriate in such matters? And if you look further you would find what the commission might have to refer to on this issue. In the explanatory memorandum again, at point 2.3, there is an explanation of what is meant here. It states:
2.3	 The provision recognises, however, that there may be circumstances in which it is not appropriate for awards to contain junior rates. For example, under some awards the employment of people under a certain age is effectively precluded for reasons such as legally imposed barriers (for example, in relation to legal driving ages) . . . 
This one is actually a non-example because the provision with respect to where the commission was to apply these powers is meant to relate to areas where young people actually work. So the first example the commission has to refer to is a non-example because it is not even relevant to where it is meant to be exercising its powers. The second example is of course a good one. It is:
. . . or the qualifications required for the work (for example, nurses or engineers). 

There would be very few examples today of people under the age of 21 who have concluded their nursing training or their engineering training. I will tell you what, if they have been good enough to get through the education and qualification systems by the age of 21, they deserve the adult rate of pay. They are the only examples referred to. The government is seeking to extend this provision to the other 50 per cent of awards where, in the past, the commission has determined junior rates not to be relevant and where juniors up to 21 years of age do work, or potentially work, in those fields.
The final reference point for the commission that I want to highlight is in the minister's second reading speech, because this dispels any doubt about what this legislation is really about. About half way through the fifth last paragraph of the speech, the minister says:
By protecting existing junior rates, and making junior rates more widely available, these provisions will contribute towards enhanced job opportunities for young people and complement the changes to the principal object of the Workplace Relations Act.
That is the object I highlighted. But the important point is the next one, which is:
They recognise the links between junior wages and youth employment and unemployment.
These links are very arguable links. But the minister has written that into his second reading speech. The commission, with its new powers, would need to refer back to that speech to see how it is to apply those powers. It would say, `The guidance we have on this issue is that there is a link between junior wages and youth employment. This is even though America does not have them. But, in Australia, in this context, there is that link; therefore, we should introduce them, under the new provisions in our objects, right across all of our awards. That is, of course, unless there is a non-example such as young people who cannot work under that award anyway, or there is an example where someone has gained qualifications in nursing or engineering.' Therefore, I go back to my original example. We are looking at rates of pay cuts right across the board. That is what this 
 legislation represents. That is why the opposition will reject this bill.
We will have the minister claiming that it is, once again, Senate obstructionism; that we are not allowing his legislation through; that we are denying the Australian community thousands and thousands of jobs. We had the unfair dismissal bill that was meant to provide 50,000 jobs. We had the proposals that were meant to provide half a million jobs. In this case, the minister is not quite as consistent. In the More Jobs, Better Pay proposal they took to the election, the quote was 300,000 jobs but, in the ministerial discussion paper on protecting job opportunities, we are looking at 220,000. Once again, the minister is plucking figures out of the air as to how many jobs there would be.
The financial impact that is cited in the explanatory memorandum is another example of how shoddily all this has been put together. If we are talking about inserting junior rates right across Australian awards and affecting the 50 per cent of awards that currently do not include them, then we are looking at a significant drain, I would have thought, on our social security budget. There are many people under the age of 21 who have families—who have children—who currently would not be eligible for social security benefits but who, if they had their wages cut under this sort of proposal, would thenceforth become so.
This is another example of how minister Reith is throwing up legislation which seeks to cast the Senate in a particular light of being obstructionistic when what he is really doing is backing away from his previous commitments and not taking no for an answer. The minister simply cannot accept no as an answer from the Senate. He keeps presenting to us legislation which he knows will be rejected. The question, then, is why is he doing it? How does he see it as furthering his objectives? If it is going to cast him in a strong light to assist him to drag himself out of the charade he dug for himself over the waterfront dispute, that is one thing. But the minister is not addressing his own objectives. The minister is casting himself as a class warrior. He is doing that in the way he 
 described to a Perth business luncheon late last year, when he said:
Never forget the history of politics and never forget which side we're on. We're on the side of making profits. We're on the side of owning private capital.
This comment from the minister is not consistent with the objectives that he is meant to represent in his role as minister for workplace relations. He is meant to be promoting cooperative workplace relations whereas his style is one which simply seeks to generate further conflict and further difficulties. The only policy options he seems able to come up with are cut wages, cut benefits; cut wages, cut benefits. This is yet another example of this. This is consistent with his attack on the award system that we saw with the workplace relations bill. It is consistent with the letter that was leaked and then released three weeks ago, and it is consistent with his agenda as a whole.
But the amusing thing is that the minister seeks to claim a mandate in relation to this bill. He says it was mentioned in More Jobs, Better Pay. But the reality is when this approach was last canvassed it was quite clearly rejected. Nobody could claim that the past election debate was over introducing cuts to wages and junior rates. The only memory that sticks in people's minds about that debate was that it occurred during Fightback. It is stretching the point a long way to say that you have a mandate on the very same day as a major national newspaper announces that you had actually agreed to soft-pedal on the issue. I am sorry but the two are just not consistent.
Going back to the issue of mandate in general that has been relied upon by various parties in relation to other issues before the parliament, to claim a mandate when less than 40 per cent of people voted for the government and 48 per cent of people in the House of Representatives is quite ludicrous, but it is even more ludicrous when it is an issue that you soft-pedalled on. You hid. You might have written two lines in a policy statement, but that was it. That was the extent of the debate. There was no debate over a proposal to cut the wages of 50 per cent of people 
 under the age of 21 currently in the work force. That is what this bill is seeking to do.
Not only did the minister misrepresent his mandate, but he also ran some very interesting arguments in support of his proposals. Let me give one example of misrepresentation. He misrepresented the SDA when on 2 December last year he claimed that the SDA supported junior rates. Instead, let me use SDA's actual submission to the Industrial Relations Commission inquiry, which I will come to later, to highlight their concerns with this bill. The SDA speaks with some authority as it covers more than half of Australia's junior work force who are employed in the retail and fast food service industries. The submission states that those junior rates are discriminatory in that they pay employees in accordance with their age, rather than in accordance with the value of the work performed. So it is discriminatory.
The submission states that junior rates are illogical in a society where the emphasis is not on discrimination but on equity. But the minister wants to keep discrimination. The submission also states that parallels can be drawn with women workers achieving equal pay for work of equal value and young workers who should also be paid in accordance with the value of their work. I can certainly recall the arguments in the seventies about how many jobs would be lost if equal pay or work for equal value was extended fully to women. But now the minister is applying the same arguments, the same form, to young people.
A final reference to the SDA's submission is the comment that junior rates are a form of exploitation of young workers: they perpetuate the financial difficulty facing young workers as their income is set at a fraction of the adult rate, whilst their living expenses are not discounted in a similar way. That is hardly the sort of statement one would expect from a submission that is meant to be supporting junior rates.
The SDA did seek to be balanced in its submission to the commission. It did seek to say, `We can understand that there are some circumstances where it is difficult to find competency based measures or other means 
 of assessing skill in relation to young people.' It made the suggestion that for young people under the age of 18 years, if—and I stress `if'—training is a component of their job, reduced rates might be appropriate. That was the closest thing that could have been taken to support junior rates: an attempt to provide some balance into this debate by saying that if there was recognised training linked to a job—training obviously recognising the fact that many young people do not have the full skills of an adult worker—then that might be the best way to assess it. But there was certainly not a statement that age should be the only factor which sets a person's rate of pay and certainly not above the age of 18 years.
Again, we are left with a situation where half of the junior work force who are not currently on junior rates could end up on them. There is no discussion of how transitory problems might be dealt with in any of this legislation. There is no guarantee that `no worker would be worse off', to quote the Prime Minister. There is no protection of people's current rates of pay. There has been no statement from the minister to that effect. So I do not think I am stretching a long bow to say that that could quite easily be the consequence. If you go back to the explanatory memorandum, the statement is quite clear: we are going to promote the inclusion of junior rates into awards. There is no mention of protections for current workers—nothing at all.
Let me conclude my remarks on the issue of how we got to this stage. We got to this stage because when we were debating the workplace relations bill in 1996 the government reached an agreement with the Democrats that the commission would conduct an inquiry. I think it is important to say what they will assess in that inquiry: whether it is desirable to replace junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives—so we are looking at alternatives; we are not just talking about abolishing junior rates—and the utility of junior rates for different types of employment, for different industries and in the school to work transition.
Again, that inquiry will deal with a myriad of issues that are completely ignored in this bill to the extent that from the opposition's point of view, and pre-empting an amendment that Senator Murray will move, this bill is so flawed that it should not be allowed through the parliamentary process without being re-presented. It needs to be re-presented to the House of Representatives. We need to start the process afresh after the commission inquiry is concluded.
I am still waiting for an answer to a question I put on notice during estimates: how much has the government paid for this inquiry to date? How much public expenditure has been put into this inquiry that the minister is pre-empting? The minister is pre-empting the inquiry in the same way that he pre-empted the unfair dismissals legislation; and we are yet to see whether that is going to present itself here again. So the minister is completely pre-empting all of the terms that he put to the Industrial Relations Commission inquiry. In fact, it is arguable that he is perhaps doing more than that. Perhaps he is seeking to bully and intimidate the commission into the sort of finding that he wants from them. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-08,"—I am extremely disappointed that the government has chosen to bring the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  forward. I am extremely disappointed because this bill brings into question the worth of the word of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith. I have a lot of time for Peter Reith. I spent 60 hours in negotiations with him prior to the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and found him very engaging and open. I find him a likeable person. But a deal is a deal and I expect him to abide by it.
What was the deal? It is worth repeating because the words were hammered out over many hours and were released under the signature of both Peter Reith and the Leader of the Australian Democrats. Let me repeat them, from page 20 of the agreement signed by Peter Reith on behalf of the government:
Junior rates will be exempted from anti-age discrimination requirements for the Industrial Relations Act for a further three years from 22 June 1997. The legislation will require a full bench of the Commission to report to the parliament on the feasibility of the replacement of junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. The full bench is to be convened by the President and is to report not later than one year before the expiry of the exemption. The report is to include assessments of whether it is desirable to replace junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives, the consequences for youth employment of an abolition of junior rates and the utility of junior rates for different types of employment for different industries and in the school-to-work transition. The act will empower the AIRC to extend the exemption on an award by award basis in accordance with guidelines which were established by a full bench of the Commission convened by the President.
That is what Minister Peter Reith agreed to do and this bill is the evidence that he refuses to abide by his own agreement. His word, it seems, is not worth the press release paper it is written on. What he agreed to do was to place all of the evidence before the Industrial Relations Commission and test it. That commission is scheduled to report on 22 June 1999, in 3½ months time. But Minister Reith will not wait for that report. And why? It is not because they are under any risk; the act will only come into question a year after that. I suspect it is because he knows that all of his assertions about youth jobs being at risk by replacing junior rates with competency based rates do not hold up to scrutiny. He does not want his assertions and his grandstanding on cutting wages scrutinised. He would prefer instead to break an agreement, his solemn word, than risk his radical labour market agenda being exposed as flawed.
This is not the first time the minister has failed to abide by agreements he has made. In our agreement on workplace relations he agreed to a new principle in the Workplace Relations Act ensuring that employee organisations were able to operate effectively and recognising the right of employees to join or not join unions. Then during the waterfront dispute he sought to undermine his own act, breaking that agreement by trying to destroy the maritime union and its members. Of course, he was humbled in that instance by the law, with four Federal Court judges and 
 five High Court judges finding an arguable case that his own act had been breached.
Then there was unfair dismissals. He promised that there would be a fair go all round for employees and employers in unfair dismissals. He agreed to insert a new principle in the act that the law would `assist in giving effect to Australia's international obligations in relation to labour standards'.
Then he brought forward regulations and laws to deny workers in small businesses the right to challenge an unfair dismissal in breach of his electoral commitments, in breach of international obligations and in breach of the general framework of the act itself. He has promised time and again that no worker would be made worse off as a result of the Workplace Relations Act, yet the law in front of us not only just allows but actively encourages the Industrial Relations Commission to cut the wages of young people in industries that currently do not have junior rates.
This is the evidence of a repeat offender, of a minister whose word is not his bond, whose assurances are not to be trusted and whose laws are to be tilted against the interests of ordinary workers. The Workplace Relations Act and the agreement underpinning it were very important. It was the Democrats' first major dealing with this government. We tried to work with them, to understand their position and to deliver the bulk of their agenda while protecting the low paid and the vulnerable. That involved a great deal of trust. We have kept our side of the deal and we do expect Minister Reith and his government to keep theirs, and they haven't.
I should draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the government now wants us to negotiate tax reform and to trust them on their word that again no-one will be left worse off. Once bitten, twice shy. If an agreement is to be reached on tax reform, based on our bitter experience on workplace relations we will have to leave nothing to chance, nothing to interpretation and nothing to goodwill or trust. This government cannot expect to make deals and then break deals on one set of issues and then expect the Democrats to accept their assurances and trust them on other issues. We 
 are prepared to talk about tax reform but we will be dotting every `i' and crossing every `t'.
I would draw my colleague Senator Harradine's attention to the government's failure to keep its side of the agreement he made on the sale of Telstra, as well. Service levels have fallen, Telstra's employment levels have fallen, a commitment never to sell the rest of Telstra has been breached. Even a commitment to spend $1.1 billion on the environment has been breached, with over half the funding funnelled back into primary industries and farmers.
In regard to Senator Harradine's agreement with the government that families who suffered under youth allowance should be assisted in the health package, again that was an agreement broken, with dependants for the purposes of the youth allowance means test denied access to the increased family assistance payments—another assurance broken.
This builds up a regime which the rest of us cannot trust, and that is a fatal thing to happen to the Senate. The word of this government is now no longer worth the press release paper it is written on. The Democrats are prepared to debate the merits of abolishing youth rates, but only when all of the claims, assertions, counterclaims and headline grabbing ministerial statements from Minister Reith have been tested by the Industrial Relations Commission test case—and everybody else's assertions tested as well. That is why I am moving a second reading amendment to force the government to abide by its agreement. What has it got to hide? Why won't it wait for its claims to be tested by the umpire? Why won't the government abide by the agreements it has made?
The second reading amendment I am moving is a clear test for this government. If it is serious about encouraging youth employment then it will support my amendment and await the independent umpire's assessment before proceeding with legislation. If, as I suspect, all the government is interested in is a political stunt and some immoral, deceptive grandstanding, then obviously it will proceed with the bill.
What is that inquiry looking at? First it has been asked to look at the desirability of replacing junior rates, particularly in light of the act's stated intention to remove age based discrimination. This is a moral issue, in my view. Why should two workers working side by side doing exactly the same work and exercising exactly the same skill be paid different wages simply because one is five or six years younger than the other?
The government will tell you that many countries have these kinds of laws, but they don't. International experience indicates that of 20 OECD countries which have a minimum wage, seven have no junior rates at all, four only have junior rates applying to minors and only two—the Netherlands and Australia—have junior rates up to the age of 22 years.
Yes, it is true: according to our government, 22-year-olds are still kids. Youth and junior rates have been abolished in Canada, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Poland and Spain. They apply for minors aged 17 and below in the Czech Republic, France—just for the first six months of employment—Luxembourg and Turkey. They apply below the age of 18 in Ireland, Korea—just for six months—and Portugal. New Zealand has youth wages only below the age of 19 and Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States—only for three months in the case of the United States—below the age of 20. Australia is out of step with all these, and yet the government wants to entrench a situation where we discriminate against young people far in excess of that which applies in the OECD.
The Industrial Relations Commission was asked expressly to look at the consequences for youth employment of abolishing junior rates. This is clearly the `but' that Minister Reith is keen to avoid. Why? Because there is no evidence that junior rates are necessary to maintain youth employment—none whatsoever. A 1992 study by the Reserve Bank stated:
The recent deterioration of the youth labour market does not seem to be due to any change in relative wage levels, which have been declining steadily since the mid 1970s. 

Indeed, despite declining relative wages of young workers, youth full-time employment has fallen and youth unemployment rates have risen. So wages have been going down and youth full-time employment has fallen and youth unemployment rates have risen.
Research by NATSEM shows that from 1982 to 1995, the number of young workers in full-time work halved while youth wages fell 30 per cent. Even that arch-defender of labour market deregulation, the OECD, in its 1998 OECD Employment Outlook, had to reluctantly concede that junior rates have had little employment effect, conceding:
. . . it is not clear that a rise in minimum wages has unambiguously led to job losses for youth in all circumstances.
If anything, the studies have tended to find very small employment effects one way or the other. Indeed, the OECD said that teenage employment trends could only be marginally attributed to the evolution of minimum wages and must be explained by other factors—a point also borne out by Australia's experience of rising youth unemployment despite falling relative wages.
What is clear is that it is not wage rates driving youth employment, but perceptions of employers about young people. Indeed, a 1990 Confederation of Australian Industry survey showed that it was not wage rates but experience, skills and maturity that were regarded as more important in employment decisions. That is what young people should be employed on—the skills and experience that they bring to a job, not their age, the colour of their hair or whatever else employers like to discriminate on.
What is this debate about? I think it is no coincidence that the junior rates bill cops a mention in Peter Reith's recent `101 ideas on employment' paper, as part of a broader discussion on labour market deregulation. This bill is the first serious step in cutting the wages of the lowest paid. This bill is not about just entrenching junior rates; it is about spreading them to other industries where they do not exist—industries like building and metals, with proud employment records of young people, particularly in apprenticeships, without junior rates. Let us remember that the 
 vast bulk of young workers in Australia are not employed on junior rates. In Australia, 31 per cent of young people are on adult rates, 14 per cent are on traineeships and apprenticeships and 56 per cent are on junior rates.
On 10 November 1998, I asked a question with notice—No. 14—of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The question was as follows:
How many workers are there on youth rates: (a) by industry; (b) by State and Territory; and (c) by each of the 6 industrial relations systems operative in Australia.
The minister—in figures that I will check—answered that there were 405,000 workers on youth rates in Australia, of which 251,000 were in the retail trade. The 405,000 was the total of all industries excluding agriculture. According to him, there are 724,000 non-farm employees aged under 21—but I remind you that present youth rates go to the age of 22 anyway. He was unable to break these figures down by state and territory and was unable to estimate how many workers were on youth rates for each of the six industrial relations systems operative in Australia.
Who will this bill affect? We do not know. The minister cannot tell us. If we crudely guessed—and it would have to be a crude guess—that this bill covered one-sixth of the 405,000 youth rates workers, because there are six industrial relations regimes, the number of young people affected would be 68,000. This is a far cry from the 200,000 figure I recall the minister using. To me, this signals that, like unfair dismissals, we are again going to get into a battle over what is a lie, what is propaganda and what is fact. If the government succeeds in winning its dubious argument that cutting minimum wages for young people will create jobs, then why not for older people; why not for all vulnerable workers? Let us cut wages for everybody over 55, or maybe for all women over 40, shall we? Where does it stop?
That is what this debate is about—the first instalment of this government's determined agenda to push us towards the New Zealand system of lower wages for the lowest paid, of pushing more workers into the ranks of the working poor. And are there jobs at the end 
 of this rainbow? No, there are not. Australia's jobs growth has exceeded New Zealand's by a factor of almost two to one over the last decade. Unemployment has risen sharply in New Zealand since 1996 and fallen in Australia. At the other end, countries like Ireland and the Netherlands—countries with more regulated wage systems than ours—are leading the OECD jobs growth tables. No, cutting minimum wages does not create jobs—a point clearly shown by the research of labour economist Professor Bob Gregory in comparing Australian and US employment trends.
In conclusion let me restate the Democrats' position. We support the Industrial Relations Commission investigating the issue of whether discriminatory wages based on age should be abolished or retained in the interests of promoting employment. We believe we should wait until 22 June 1999, 3½ months away, to hear their response. We are prepared to wait for a decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to deliver case-by-case wage resolutions for industry on appropriate payment systems for young workers based on proper consideration of the evidence. We are not prepared to back a bill to entrench and extend discriminatory wages, to cut the wages of tens of thousands of young workers and to further a hard Right agenda of undermining the minimum wages system. We will warn business and we will warn the government that the pursuit of these kinds of agendas make us awfully suspicious of whatever else you ask us to look at and trust you on.
I would like to conclude by quoting from two elements of international law. The first quote to ponder is an extract from the United States Code, title 15, Commerce and Trade, section 17, which states: `The labour of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce.' The second quote is from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia signed in 1948, article 23, paragraph 2. Listen carefully. It states: `Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.' We are a signatory to that Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Are you going to tell me that you wish to walk away from that commitment? I move:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the day after the day on which the report from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on junior rates, prepared in accordance with section 120B of the Workplace Relations Act 1996  and pursuant to the commitments made by the Government to secure the passage of that Act, is tabled"".",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-08,"—It is clear that the government's credibility is in tatters. We have just heard Senator Murray express his view and the view of the Australian Democrats that the word of this minister is not his bond and that the word of the government may not be able to be trusted on a whole range of matters and cannot be trusted on such an essential issue as this. It involved an agreement between the Australian Democrats and the government. That agreement involved the provision in the legislation. The Democrats have honoured their part of the bargain; the minister has not. That is for them and him to consider, but it is for us to recognise and to listen to what has been said by Senator Murray and the Democrats.
It means that at least half of this Senate cannot accept from this government at face value what it says. That must cause concern amongst those ministers whose word you are inclined to believe. There are a number of issues which I have mentioned from time to time, and some of them that I have not, where the word of certain ministers cannot be taken at face value. I will give you one example, because it was given by Senator Murray and it is in response to what Senator Murray said.
Senator Murray indicated that I had accepted the word of the government in relation to the common youth allowance. It is true that I decided not to block the passage of the common youth allowance bill after receiving personal assurance from the highest level of government that that issue would be taken into consideration and that the parents upon whom there would be a greater burden would have their benefits or tax arrangements altered to cover for the extra burden. Indeed, the minister for social security as well as the Leader of the Government in this place had indicated that something would be done about that. 
A shift in the age of dependency was introduced with the common youth allowance and that did place a greater financial burden on families, which the government had said it would take account of. It has not done so. It will be interesting to see whether it does so in the forthcoming budget. Otherwise the government is assuming that an adult sibling is sharing in their parents' income and then turning around and ignoring the income sharing when it comes to taxing the parents. That is a matter that has concerned me for some considerable time. I have just got it off my chest.
Senator Murray interjecting—
—I had it in the bottom draw, actually. I thank Senator Murray for indicating what he did to give me the chance to do that.
Turning to this particular piece of legislation, the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 , clearly the legislation is not necessary and clearly it ought to be defeated. Under the present section 120B of the Workplace Relations Act there is a provision for the AIRC to examine youth wages. As has been indicated by Senator Murray, it is doing that, it is proceeding to do that, and it is doing so in a manner that will mean that there will be a report to the government on this particular matter by 22 June of this year.
It seems that the exemptions are in the legislation until the year 2000. What is the rush? Why can we not see what the Industrial Relations Commission will say about it? For example, are they going to tie junior wages to at least some sort of training? Presumably they are not going to adopt the attitude of the government that youth is a source of cheap labour—in other words, the exploitation of the most vulnerable. I say: let the commission proceed as they have been asked to do by the government. Let not this sort of interference take place with the AIRC in the performance of their functions. I will have a bit more to say about that shortly.
Having disposed of that, I think we can talk generally about the whole system of industrial relations, and I ask the chamber to at least acknowledge that I am entitled to say some 
 thing about industrial relations. For many years I have worked for the development of a system of industrial relations in this country which will see orderly industrial progress. I believe also you need to have a philosophy, a set of values, a set of principles, upon which this can be achieved. You should not do it by personalities.
So, when I became the Secretary-General of the Trades and Labour Council in Tasmania in 1964, one of the first things I thought of doing was changing the objective of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. That objective was the old Wobblies objective of the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. We turned that around and had inserted into the rule book the objective of assisting in the development of an economic and social order in which persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and their material wellbeing in conditions of economic security and equal opportunity. That was framed into our objectives.
Against that objective, we had to time and time again defend the trade union movement, defend industry and defend Tasmania against the push by the extreme Left, particularly in Victoria and particularly amongst some of the thugs in the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, to some personal sorrow, I might say. But eventually we were successful. We were able to defend the workers of Tasmania against the constant attacks and disruptions, for example, to our lifeline—the shipping services. I have to acknowledge the wonderful work that people within the trade union movement in Tasmania did and the support they gave me and my executive, including the support that we received from the Waterside Workers Federation in Tasmania. We kept the Ship Painters and Dockers out of Hobart.
We believe that the industrial relations system should be built on a fair go for all and on trust and mutual obligation, to promote a productive Australia, to protect the vulnerable from exploitation and to achieve orderly, peaceful industrial progress and the settlement of disputes by an independent umpire. In other words, we want a fair go.
I am very sad to have to relate that, in my view, the action of the current minister, Mr Reith, is reversing that progress. It is based upon a nihilist philosophy of the survival of the fittest. His grand plan for workplace deregulation, instead of building trust, will mean distrust. Instead of mutual obligation, the power will be where the balance is, and that will be upon the exploitative employer, who is in fact the minority. Instead of a productive Australia, there will be seething discontent within industry; and the vulnerable, the weakest, will become the most exploited. Instead of orderly and peaceful industrial progress, there will be at least disaffection within industry and, indeed, disputation.
This gives me the opportunity to refer to the 101 suggestions of Mr Reith. These were, of course, leaked—I do not know how. I will turn to some of these to indicate how I see they would apply to workers in Australia. These measures, the Reith plan, are contained in the document which is attached to Mr Reith's letter to the Prime Minister. The Reith plan will allow exemption of small businesses—that is, 15 employees or fewer at the moment—from having to pay award wages and conditions, leaving their employees unprotected. It would provide scope for large firms to opt out of rules governing wages and working conditions if they meet some sort of vague standard of best practice. Employers would be able to hire unemployed on cut-rate wages and working conditions, leading to lower wages throughout the whole of industry.
The Reith plan waters down the no disadvantage test, weakens the right of unions to fully represent their members and provides a big push for ordinary pay only for work at night and on weekends and public holidays. It attacks the independence of the industrial umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It proposes that Reserve Bank and Treasury government officials will be able to hear living wage hearings. It provides for lower minimum wages in regional areas and a further cut in the number of protective clauses in industrial awards.
Might I say something to the Australian Democrats. I feel certain they will not be 
 conned again but, when the workplace relations legislation came before us, they obviously did not see some of the problems. One of those problems, for example, related to the reduction in the number of allowable questions to be determined in an award. A provision in the Victorian awards—and I am sure Senator Collins will recall this—protected Victorian shop assistants from being required to go topless or wear skimpy clothing, as was being sought by certain auto spare parts retailers and some other employers. The award that was obtained by the SDA at that time protected those employees, but because Mr Kennett abolished the system in Victoria, these employees now come under federal awards. But this is not an allowable matter under the new legislation, so these people are not protected. I do not say that the Democrats knew what would happen—of course, Mrs Kernot did not know that but she ought to learn and I hope she has learnt her lesson.
Finally, I believe that Australia deserves better than to go down that path of Mr Reith's into conflict, disruption and distrust. That path will mean that the most vulnerable employees will ultimately be unprotected, unrepresented and exploited. That path will only lead to the expansion of the vast army of underemployed workers now. What it is all about is the acquisition of profits over the rights not only of the employees but also of those decent employers who believe in a fair go.
You know as well as I do that the trend now in the United States of America is for the big companies to make their profits hand over fist. Each of them has a certain cost cutting percentage. It is not being done in the normal way, but they are cost cutting. Unilever, for example, is one of those companies which has just made an enormous distribution to its shareholders. That appears to be the only rule for companies like that: never mind the customer and never mind the employees, just do the begging of the shareholders.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-03-08,"—The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  is part of the government's continuing agenda of marginali 
 sing and disregarding young people in Australia. Since the Howard government first came to office, they have sought to denigrate young people by any and every means possible. Sugar-coated rhetoric to the contrary is transparent and disenfranchisement amongst young people is growing as the coalition's shallowness becomes clearer.
If you are a young person—and for this government that means 21 years or under—then you are fodder to be used up and disregarded rather than treated according to competence and ability. Young people, especially those under the age of 21, are now facing yet another attack on their worth as the government seeks to reduce their earning capacity by entrenching junior pay rates in federal awards. This legislation is all about reducing the wages of young people. Instead of waiting for the Industrial Relations Commission to finalise its report, the government is proceeding without any care or respect for due process, and the losers, once again, will be young Australians.
It is an anachronism that people aged 18 to 20 years in Australia are adults for all intents and purposes. They are permitted to purchase and consume alcohol, they are permitted to enter into contractual arrangements, and they are both entitled and obligated to vote in elections. They are adults in respect of all societal regulations except, according to this government, in respect of their entitlement to full and fair minimum award wages.
Paying junior wages to these workers is part of an outdated and irrelevant industrial approach based on the 1907 view of an adult male wage being the amount needed for a male to support himself, his wife and his two children. It is both false and discriminatory to assume that all workers under 21 are automatically of less value than older workers are and therefore should receive less pay. There are many examples of youth who are in very responsible positions—for example, those in retail and food industries being supervisors, opening and closing shops, and working late at night; not to mention those youth who are entrepreneurs themselves, always pushing the outer boundaries of what is possible within 
 the work force—but these employees are still being paid junior wages.
In a full bench hearing of the Industrial Relations Commission, the government argued for the removal of these awards for public servants such as police, teachers and nurses. They argued that all future salary increases should be based on recognition of skills and increases in productivity. However, according to the government, if you are under 21 the only thing determining your salary should be your date of birth. This is yet another example of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business at his hypocritical best. The subliminal impact of these attacks day after day on education, social support and wages reinforces to the young people of this country that they are worth nothing in the eyes of this government. Once you get beyond some of the brutal and overt insults that this policy and this bill represent, it is this subliminal message to our young people that represents one of the most damaging approaches that I have ever experienced by an administration.
One of the problems with this bill is that, by its nature, it fails to recognise the positive contribution of so many young people who are at the cutting edge of innovation in this country with respect to their work. The new ideas that young people bring into workplaces, whatever the nature of their work, are valued considerably by employers. One example is in the new technology areas, be it environmental technology or information technology. If you look at the driving force and the intellectual minds behind these new industries, you find that young people are the programmers, the application designers, the web developers—the ones who care enough about the environment to drive technological innovation to find a way forward and a sustainable future. It is young people that bring inspiration to a workplace. The best this government can do in recognition of that is to penalise them through a discriminatory wage structure.
If this bill is passed it will effectively mean that these young men and women leading the field in new technology areas could be subject to lower wages than their less qualified, less 
 able and less inspired older colleagues. It will mean that their intellectual property will not be judged on merit, on their contribution or on their experience but purely on their date of birth, on the age of the employee in question. I wonder how much of this policy is a reflection on generational elitism. I ask: how much of its motivation lies in the perceived threat that these clever young people represent to the entrenched group of ministers and decision makers that have driven this policy forward and whose hearts and minds lie back in the 1950s? In the same way that the dignity of older Australians is being undermined by these ministers and decision makers, the dignity, hope and potential of young Australians is also being undermined.
We know only too well the priority that everyone in the political sphere place on jobs or at least says they do. The extension of youth wages will not impact significantly on the youth unemployment levels in Australia. The reasons for this are simple: there is no correlation between wage rises and increasing youth unemployment, nor are wages holding back the rising opportunities for people in part-time work. As this is the case, an increase in wages will not necessarily reduce young people's labour market opportunities and neither will a cut in their wages necessarily improve their labour market prospects. All this legislation will achieve is the ultimate reduction in the earnings of 217,000 workers under the age of 21 who are currently receiving adult wages.
 By the government focusing solely on maintaining junior wages, rather than making substantial changes to the employment opportunities for youth or making improvements to the provision of education and training services, the youth of Australia are likely to end up in a worse situation—a situation where young people are paid less and rely more on social security, with no real improvements for those actively seeking work. Peter Reith repeatedly uses the Productivity Commission report Youth Wages and Employment to justify his claims that an increase in junior rates of pay will reduce youth employment. However, findings contained within this report actually contradict the claims made by the 
 minister for industrial relations. The report acknowledges that part-time employment for teenagers has increased at the same time as their real hourly earnings have risen. This has led the commission to conclude that:
. . . rising wages costs do not appear to have affected teenage part-time employment adversely.
In addition, the report noted that teenage full-time employment has fallen relative to adult employment by 60 per cent between 1984 and 1997, at the same time as their relative hourly earnings have fallen by seven per cent.
But this is not the only report to acknowledge that youth unemployment is a result of a much broader collection of employers' concerns. A survey conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in October 1998 gauged the importance of junior rates of pay on youth employment. What these results showed was that junior rates of pay are not seen as the major reason for employing juniors. In fact, the highest responses to the question were identified as the willingness of young people to do certain kinds of work and the increased flexibility of youth with regard to working hours. However, the most common response by far was employer preference for training their employees.
The ACCI went on to survey firms already employing people aged under 21 as to the reasons why no additional juniors were being placed in jobs. And again their results confirmed the irrelevance of junior rates of pay in the decision making process related to employing more young people. Twenty-six point nine per cent of employers surveyed responded that award wages being set too high was of no importance in hiring more young people. This figure represents more than double the percentage of respondents who believed that wage levels was a factor of major importance.
Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the survey identified that the major barrier relating to the employment of youth is that young people are not always as work ready as adults. Surely, this is more a reflection on the downgrading and the cuts to education that have been experienced in recent times under a coalition government. For this reason, rather than any real or perceived problems associat 
 ed with the level of wages, employers repeatedly voice their concerns regarding the employment of school leavers.
It is time for this government to become more inclusive of the needs of Australia's youth and it is time for the government to realise that it has a significant role to play in eliminating Australia's youth unemployment crisis. The evidence is clear. The Howard government must shift its focus from one which perpetuates the discrimination of youth to one which is directed at providing adequate training and support networks in order to facilitate the school-to-work transition for young people. It must work on improving the economic stability of our economy to strengthen the labour market—a labour market which promotes youth employment.
My own experience in this area gave me a lesson of life that I will never forget. As a 16-year-old I was able to enter the work force on adult wages. This provided me with an opportunity to participate in society with economic independence. Other young people have had that opportunity, but I find it so ironic that it was back in 1984 that this occurred, and that in 1999 I find myself in this place defending this simple notion of dignity for young people in the work force; defending this simple and fundamental right of young people to be able to get a job and be paid wages that are not discriminatory.
Australia's youth deserve a better deal from the Australian government and they deserve the right to prove their financial worth based on merit, not on their date of birth. They also deserve access to training and education programs, rather than a regressive attack on their living standards; rather than this government's willingness to relegate them to a period of underemployment and of working poverty that some of the lower junior rates force young people into at a critical stage of their development.
For these reasons, the opposition will not be supporting the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-08,"—I would like to begin my contribution to the second reading debate with a quote taken from an article by Mike Steketee 
 in the Australian  on Thursday, 4 March. The quote was:
There is plenty of evidence that permanent marginalisation of particular groups will generate high social costs down the track and can have inter-generational consequences as well.
Who was this quote from? It was in fact from employment minister Peter Reith—if it is reported correctly—writing to John Howard on 3 December 1998. The article mentions that in an interview the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, had argued against the relevance of the Henderson poverty line as an indicator of what is happening in our society.
The Henderson poverty line is the most commonly used measure. Updated to 1996, it shows that 16.7 per cent of households in Australia are below the poverty line and this is compared with 12.5 per cent when the line was first calculated in 1973. What does this say? We know that those figures do not coincide strictly with unemployment figures. We know that they are a fair indication that what we are seeing in Australia is a growing number of working poor. If you put that in line with the quote from Minister Reith you begin to see that he seems to understand part of the problem, but has not quite linked up his own actions with the creation of this marginalised underclass of working poor.
As other senators have indicated, the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 —although I am not sure where the employment is in this bill—amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 to promote the inclusion of junior rates in awards and workplace agreements, and to exempt junior wage rates from the antidiscrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It is an issue that we have debated at least twice during my time in the Senate and it may not surprise the Senate to know that the Greens have not changed their position.
There are two aspects to this issue in the context of the current bill: the first is a process issue, and the other is the substantive issue. The process issue relates to the fact that, when we last debated junior wage rates 
 in 1996, section 120B was inserted requiring the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to undertake an inquiry into the whole question of youth employment and junior wages. The report, as we have heard from other senators today, is required, under the act, to be presented to the minister before 22 June 1999.
The simple question therefore is: why are we debating this bill prior to the presentation of that comprehensive report? The Greens certainly do not see any rational explanation for this fast tracking. Also, as we have heard today from Senator Murray, there is a signed statement, a signed commitment from the minister, indicating that that would not happen. So I think the public, and perhaps the House of Representatives, will need an explanation.
The substantive issue—that is, whether we should be paying lower wages to workers between the ages of 16 and 21 and whether the discrimination provision in the Workplace Relations Act should be waived in relation to junior wages—as I have indicated earlier, has been debated previously in the Senate. In 1994, for example, during debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, I quoted from a submission by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition.
The government has, or has certainly tried, to close this group down because it dared to criticise the government, or it dared to represent its constituents. This group has had done to it what so many groups and so many voices in our society in recent times have had done to them: it has been gagged for daring to speak up for the people whom it represents. But in this particular case, at that time AYPAC stated:
Young people are entitled to a living income. While acquiring work experience is crucial, it should not be a mechanism for exploitation. AYPAC regards competency, not age, as the crucial determinant for wage income. AYPAC has consistently advocated the removal of youth provisions for industrial awards.
The arguments that I outlined in 1994 are as pertinent now as they were then, and I would like to quote from a speech I made at that time, because the points made by AYPAC 
 succinctly counter many of the arguments put forward by the government. AYPAC stated:
The practice of paying young people lower wages than adult workers is based on a number of unsustainable arguments:
.	 Young people do not have the same social needs as older workers (such as families to support) and should be paid less.
This concept of `social need' has been applied to wage determinations for most of this century and has been the philosophical underpinning of reduced wages for women and Aboriginals. This argument also implies that young people receive some form of parental support, when, in fact, many young people who are working and living at home contribute to the household from their earnings and receive no financial support from their parents.
I am not sure that there are many landlords or landladies who actually look at a person's age and say, `Fine, you're young, I'll charge you less.'
Another assumption was:
.	 Young people are less productive and less competent than older workers.
AYPAC responded:
Some employers consider that young people are, by virtue of their age, immature and inexperienced. Physical labour performed by a junior worker may have a higher work value than an older worker but would automatically be paid the lower youth wage. Similarly, a young clerical worker with knowledge and skills on computers and new technologies is assumed to be less skilled than an older clerical worker and paid less regardless of either person's actual skill level. AYPAC believes that young people in employment must be paid on the basis of competency, not age, and age discrimination must be removed from industrial awards.
Another assumption was:
.	 Lower wages provide an incentive for young people to remain in training and/or education instead of entering the work force.
AYPAC responded:
It is assumed young people are easily tempted by the immediate gratification of a waged income. It is assumed that high wage incomes may induce young people to desert education or training (perceived as having a long term benefit) and that this would not be good for the overall quality of the Australian work force. There is no evidence to substantiate this argument. In fact, data indicates that an increasing number of young people are staying in education when (if employment opportunities were available) they could be receiving an adult wage. 

The next assumption was:
.	 Increasing youth wages would cause an increase in youth unemployment and a decrease in youth wages would cause a decrease in unemployment.
AYPAC responded:
International and Australian research—
as has been mentioned today—
indicates that there is inconclusive evidence to support this assertion. Youth unemployment cannot be attributed to ""high"" youth wages. In fact, youth wages are 5 per cent lower in real terms than they were a decade ago. Spiralling youth unemployment is primarily attributable to major structural changes in the nature of the work force.
These arguments are not new. Groups such as AYPAC have been pursuing this issue for many years and government departments and parliamentary committees have similarly examined the question of youth wages. Why, then, do we need to delay any further the implementation of competency based awards for young people in the work force? Are we to continue to allow some employers to exploit the youth of this nation with wage levels below the poverty line.
It is important to note that this push by the Government to push down costs for business so that we can be `internationally competitive' is only leading to a race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions for workers. If we are to be truly competitive should we be paying the same wages as workers in developing countries who are forced to subsist on a few dollars a day . . . 
or less?
In more recent times AYPAC staff, working part time and without any funding, have managed to make a submission to the AIRC inquiry on junior rates which is being ignored by this government. In that submission, they expand on some of the points that I have just outlined and they summarise their position as follows:
AYPAC is opposed to the retention of junior rates of pay and considers that they constitute a barrier to finding lasting solutions to youth unemployment. An alternative system based on the recognition of skills must be put in place. Young people should be paid based on their output not on their age. Junior rates do not provide young workers with an incentive to acquire skills and training, because they are paid regardless of their contribution to the workplace.
The AYPAC submission to the AIRC inquiry also refers to research in the United States by David Card and Alan Kreuger, which throws 
 serious doubts on the government's claim that the elimination of junior wage rates will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Professor Richard Freeman from Harvard University has acknowledged in an article reviewing Card and Kreuger's book that many economists have overestimated the danger of job losses from increases in the minimum wage.
I believe this government should have undertaken similar research and a thorough examination of the forthcoming AIRC report before embarking on any legislative change. Their claims to date about the impact of not making the changes they have proposed are based on hearsay and very questionable assumptions. One of those assumptions is that, by eliminating junior wage rates, all young people will be paid full adult wages. On the basis of the relevant skills of young people and adult workers, that claim has no foundation.
We have a really good idea of what is behind this issue. We know that it is likely to add to the working poor in Australia. But I would also like to add another dimension from the Mike Steketee article on 4 March, which states:
Reith acknowledged another wrinkle.
This is from the discussion paper from Minister Reith to John Howard on 3 December 1998. It continues:
""Discounting wages would also likely require complementary action on the social security entitlements for this group if adequate work incentives were to be provided,"" he wrote.
In plain English, this means that unless welfare benefits were cut along with wages, the unemployed would not find it worth their while to get a job.
I think that is the nub of the issue. The government are just planning to throw $3.5-plus billion a year into subsidising diesel users and destroying the environment in the process. But they want a further excuse to reduce the wages, reduce social security benefits, pathetic and pitiful as they are, to young people. By making this push in relation to youth wages, they will use the argument to reduce even further the common youth allowance and any other social welfare benefits to that group of people.
In summary, the Greens will be opposing this bill because of the failure of the government to live up to its commitment to examine the AIRC report on junior wages and also because of the substantive issues related to discrimination against young workers. I have read the second reading amendment put forward by Senator Murray for the Australian Democrats, and I indicate that the Greens (WA) will be supporting this amendment. It certainly makes no sense at all to not look at this bill. I think the bill itself is flawed, but it makes no sense whatsoever to be having this debate and putting this question until the Australian Industrial Relations Commission have presented their report. What was it all about if the government have no interest whatsoever in the outcomes of that report and appear to have no interest whatsoever in what the wider community has to say on the realities of youth wages in Australian society? I hope the message will be quite clear to the government that what they are doing is silly, short-sighted and quite clearly goes against their own statements and commitments.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-08,"—I rise to oppose the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  as proposed by the government. The government's line in introducing this bill is to promote youth employment and reduce youth unemployment. Underlying this is an objective to permanently exempt junior rates of pay from the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act intended to prevent and eliminate age discrimination in awards and agreements and to promote the inclusion of junior rates of pay in awards and agreements.
Amendment to section 88A of the act direct the AIRC to encourage employers and employees to make agreements and when determining such an agreement for the commission to ignore discrimination on the basis of age. In fact, the AIRC is directed to ensure that they support junior rates of pay where young people are involved in a determination. With further amendments to the legislation, the way is open for junior rates of pay to become enshrined in the Australian workplace.
The motion to repeal subsection 170LU, paragraph (7), which currently excludes junior rates of pay from the operation of antidiscrimination provisions of the act until 22 June 2000, seeks to make this exemption permanent. This has been introduced before a conclusion has been reached by the AIRC in its inquiry into junior rates of pay, and the AIRC is required to report to the minister by June 1999.
I want to pose the question: why the sudden urgency in the government introducing this legislation? They introduced legislation back in 1996 which required the AIRC to inquire into junior rates of pay. Junior rates of pay have been the subject of inquiry and discussion in the commission for the past decade or so in terms of trying to find ways and means of dealing with the issues that are inherent in that debate. Why all of a sudden have we seen this rush of blood to the minister's head in terms of the introduction of this legislation into the parliament in order to get a result before 30 June?
—He wants to be leader.
—Senator Sherry says that he wants to be leader. I think the competition between the two Peters is hotting up in terms of who is going to get to the wire first, should the boss fall over or get hit by a bus or retire to Lord Howe Island, seeing how he enjoyed it so much over the Christmas and New Year period. He got a bit of golf in, read a few books. Maybe that is a better proposition than sitting in the hot seat of the Prime Minister's office.
The reality is that you have to question what the real objectives are behind the introduction of this legislation. It goes to two speeches which the minister has made this year. One was to the legal firm Freehill Hollingdale and Page, where he put the question of junior rates of pay fairly and squarely on the agenda.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-03-08,"—During question time, 
 Senator Evans asked me a question about the involvement of the AMA. Madam President, I would draw your attention to the Senate legislation committee hearings on 17 February when Senator Chris Evans said:
I understand you have a prepared answer, Ms Briggs, but that was not the question. The question was: you have listed the people you have consulted. Why did you not consult the AMA?
Ms Woodgate replied:
We did consult the AMA, and the AMA policy officer has, in discussions with us, apologised for the fact that he said they were not consulted.
Senator Chris Evans then asked:
Why didn't you put that in the explanatory memorandum? I am not getting this information from the AMA; I am reading your explanatory memorandum and they are not listed.
Madam President, I should tell you that Ms Woodgate is the assistant secretary, private health industry branch, portfolio strategies division of the Department of Health and Aged Care. Ms Woodgate said:
They were part of general meetings that we held with health insurers and private hospitals.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I understood that this procedure was available for ministers to provide extra information. If he wants to debate the issue about the AMA's consultation and their submission that they were not consulted, I am happy to have that debate. But the minister is just having a political debate, which I am happy to have with him, but he is not answering the question asked.
—On the point of order, Madam President, I said that I would come back with any additional material. This material has been provided to me. I am directly reading from the Hansard  of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Surely, Senator Evans cannot object to my reading from the Hansard .
—There is no point of order. The minister can provide what additional information to a question he sees fit. You can take note of it during the next period if you wish.
—Ms Woodgate continued:  
We had local representatives and we had an informal meeting with the policy officer from the AMA.
It goes on and on. Senator Evans continued that in the next couple of pages and I do not intend reading it.
—Did you read the AMA submission?
—It is available to everybody and they can read it, if they wish, in the Hansard  of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee of Wednesday, 17 February.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Private Health Insurance: Australian Medical Association Consultation</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 27 January 1999, of George Howard Branson, a senator for the State of Western Australia from 1958 to 1971, places on record its appreciation of his parliamentary service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
George Howard Branson was born on 23 February 1918 at Perth, Western Australia. George's father was a gold miner who pushed a barrow from Geraldton to Lawlers Creek. In 1924 the family moved to Babakin.
In 1940 George enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was appointed a lieutenant in August 1941. He served with the 2/4 Machine Gun Battalion in Malaya from 1942 until 1945. During this time George was captured and spent almost four years as a prisoner of war, when he worked on the now infamous Burma railway.
After the war, George returned to Babakin and farmed there for several years. In 1955 he moved his family to Perth. Then in 1958 George entered federal politics when he was elected to fill a casual vacancy. He was re-elected in 1964.
During his parliamentary career, George had wide service within committees, including the Privileges Committee, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. He was also Chairman of the Select Committee on Air Pollution from 1968. In addition to this, George was the Australian Political Adviser to the United Nations from September to December 1968. 	In his maiden speech in February 1959, George spoke optimistically about the future for Australia, which he described as being one of `unlimited potential', and particularly sang the praises of his home state. Through his parliamentary career he remained faithful to Western Australia and played a part in achievements such as the extension of television into the state's 
 rural areas; Australia's northern beef roads program; and the Ord irrigation scheme. On his retirement from the Senate, colleagues commented that George had `brought into this place the patience and wisdom of the country man'.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-08,"—Madam Deputy President, I wish to associate the opposition with the condolence motion that has been moved on the death of former Senator George Howard Branson. We in the Labor Party also express our sincere regret at his recent passing.
As the Manager of Government Business has indicated, former Senator Branson was a Western Australian by birth. He also clearly had a most distinguished career in the 2nd AIF. He was a prisoner of war for quite a considerable period—from 1942 to 1945—on the notorious Burma-Siam railway. He obviously suffered very great hardships during that period of time.
He served in the parliament from 1958, when he came in to fill a casual vacancy, through to his retirement in 1971—which, of course, represents two terms in the parliament. Like many others, he had very distinguished service on numerous parliamentary committees. He was the Chairman of the Select Committee on Air Pollution and, from all reports, was a dedicated member of parliament who very genuinely felt an obligation to the people of Western Australia and to his state. He demonstrated that commitment through great loyalty and hard work over a long period in this parliament.
Madam Deputy President, on behalf of the opposition I extend to former Senator Branson's family and friends our sincere condolences on his passing.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-08,"—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.
Leave granted.
—I sought leave, and I am grateful that it has been granted, to indicate to the Senate that with respect to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill that has just been referred to, the opposition will be seeking leave later this week to present the opposition minority report. The minority report was not contained within the report that was presented out of session last week. I want the Senate to be informed of that. The reason why I jumped up earlier was because I was concerned—obviously incorrectly—as to whether I needed to advise the Senate of the minority report before any motion to print the report was adopted. Having clarified all of that, I indicate to the Senate that we will be presenting our minority report later this week.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The tabling of this report on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  is a very important part in the progression towards one of the worst social and environmental outcomes through legislation that has come before this place certainly in the time I have been here, and in a long time. This committee was set up at the request of the Senate last year to look 
 into the legislation by which the government intends to remove pretty well all environmental laws which would give it the ability to discharge its responsibility to look after the great wild forests of this country for the next 20 years. It also moves to give corporations which are logging those forests, in particular the big woodchip corporations, the ability to be compensated for any future federal move to protect the forests in the interests of the Australian public. So the corporations which have not paid a red cent for anything get compensated by the owners for acknowledging the owners' interests.
This is reprehensible legislation. I would have thought that with its ramifications on the Australian public's commercial interest, let alone its environmental interest, with the enormous amount of interest the Australian public has in its natural heritage and in particular its forest heritage, and with the phenomenal public alarm being demonstrated around the country, not least at the moment in Western Australia over the fate of the forests, there would have been a Senate inquiry open and available to the competing interests right around the country.
As I said at the time, and have said in my report, this inquiry was effectively a sham if it was meant to produce a popularly available forum from which a diligent evaluation of popular feeling in this country could be made and the information made available. The Labor Party has not yet presented its report, but the government members on the committee, of course, have submitted a majority report which effectively rubber stamps what the government's legislation stands for.
I ask everybody interested in this matter to look at that report. What you will see is a ringing support of the interests of the woodchip corporations. But what more could be expected when this committee met only once at the outset in Melbourne—Melbourne being in the one state on the mainland which does not have an export woodchip mill, although valuable forests from Victoria are now being exported through the wholly owned Japanese woodchip mill, Harris Daishowa, in Eden—and had a supplementary hearing here in Canberra one night?
 Although the advertising of this committee's deliberations occurred in the week before Christmas and members of the Australian public were given only a month in which to make submissions, nearly 400 submissions came to this committee. That is surely something out of the box! But the way in which the hearings were held effectively excommunicated most of those people who had gone to the trouble in the Christmas holidays to make those submissions, and one only has to look at the submissions to see how much people cared.
If you were from Tasmania, you had to cross Bass Strait to get to the hearings. If you lived anywhere but in Victoria, you had to travel an enormous distance. If you were in Western Australia, you had to cross the Nullarbor. But even then, the odds were totally stacked against the public making live representations to this committee. A handful of people were able to present their case. Of course, they presented a compelling case on economic, environmental and employment grounds for the government not to be able to get away with this legislation, which cuts away the Commonwealth's responsibility for forests and effectively hands it to the woodchip corporations. The logging interests, of course, certainly had to have their balanced say to the committee.
I must say that I feel a great deal of thanks should go from this chamber to the staff who were working on this committee, because they had to do a Houdini act to try to appear to balance the presentation, at the behest of the committee, in a situation which was totally imbalanced. If you look at those submissions, you will see that the representations from the public saying `Do not pass this legislation' far outweigh the sectional interests of the big logging corporations. You would not know it from the time and space allocated in this report—the majority report—to this chamber.
The majority report to this chamber does not deliver a fair reflection of how the public out there feels and what the committee was given in evidence. If this is an example of how the committee system works, I think there is something seriously wrong with it. Obviously, the `something' is the govern 
 ment's ability to use a committee like this to get the outcome it wants through the dint of numbers—not through the dint of reasoning, not through the dint of evidence coming from the public, but through the sheer dint of numbers to deliver an outcome wanted by the woodchip corporations.
Why would they do that? As the evidence to the committee made it clear, the woodchip corporations are very big contributors to both the major political parties in this place—over half a million dollars in the last year for which we have the figures—and I can only come to the conclusion that that money counts extraordinarily well as far as influence is concerned in outcomes. Otherwise, how can you have it that opinion polls around this country show 70 per cent—or, in Western Australia, over 80 per cent—of people are opposed to the continuing destruction of the great wild forests of this nation and the wildlife in them—
—How much does Dick Smith give you?
—That is an unparliamentary comment, but it is the sort of loutish comment I would expect from the Labor Party on this matter. The fact is that the corporations are having their way against a huge preponderance of public feeling.
The government believes that, after this legislation gets through—if it passes this chamber, and one has to accept that it probably will, with Labor supporting the government—there will thenceforth be so-called peace in the forests. One thing that became abundantly clear in these hearings—and you will not see this reflected in the majority report—is that there will be nothing of the sort. Every community group, every indigenous group and every environmental group which appeared before the committee, opposed to the woodchippers digging deeper and chainsawing deeper into our forests, made it abundantly clear that they will not give up on their fight to have the right thing done—the forests protected—and, moreover, the industry translocated across to the plantation option which is there and available now.
Instead of that win-win situation, we have the cloud of big corporations working through 
 the political establishment of the old parties, and the end result of that is this majority report which does not reflect community thinking. In that sense, this committee has been a total failure in representing the interests of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-08,"—I will not speak long on this Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report and not in great depth on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  because we will have the opportunity to address that when the legislation comes before the Senate. Suffice it to say the Democrats, my colleague Senator Woodley and I have a dissenting report. The Democrats do not believe that this legislation should be passed as it stands.
Whilst it was a very unsatisfactorily brief and truncated inquiry, it was quite sufficient to at least highlight the number of problems that are present with the RFA process around the country and the real con we will be putting over ourselves if we actually think this is going to solve the so-called forest problem. Clearly, if this legislation did go through, it would entrench many of the concerns that have been expressed over many years and indeed are growing in terms of both the extent of them and the number of people in the community who also share those concerns.
It does not resolve one of the longest running and contentious issues to face this nation. It fails to deliver on jobs. It unfairly discriminates against the plantation industry. It will destroy more areas of native forest, including old-growth areas. It does not protect biodiversity. It discriminates unfairly against other important cultural values. It will mostly be controlled by state governments which have vested or financial short-term interests in the outcomes. It removes the Commonwealth's legitimate oversight of Australia's biodiversity in our world heritage obligations, among other things.
I would like to speak briefly of the concerns about the processes of this inquiry, which have been alluded to by Senator Brown and Senator Forshaw in his brief comment before, in terms of the unnecessary speed of 
 the inquiry and the somewhat unusual process of the committee reporting out of session last week. I would like to also repeat the commendation of the committee secretariat because I think the pressure that was put on them to try to deal with the huge number of submissions, the great deal of public interest and the extremely short time frame was very unreasonable. I am concerned that it potentially places committee staff in a situation where they can unfairly be portrayed as not being competent or capable when clearly they were put in a situation that was virtually untenable.
I am also concerned about the reputation of the Senate and Senate committees as a whole when we have processes such as this which clearly generate an enormous amount of public interest and make people from whatever side of the argument feel that they are not being taken seriously, that it is a sham inquiry just for the sake of appearances and that legitimate concerns of the public are not taken on board. I think, unfortunately, that is the situation that did occur with this inquiry. It ends up reflecting very badly on the Senate itself, on the parliament and on the Senate committee process when clearly inadequate time frames are allowed to consider issues of great importance, great significance and great public interest. I would like to register the Democrats' concern and dissatisfaction about that.
The need for Senator Forshaw to make his statement before indicates the problems that have occurred in terms of the correct printing of this report. I assume our dissenting report is appropriately incorporated in the report that has been tabled, although I know there were some problems last week with that. Again I think that highlights the inadequate time frame that was allowed for this. I have no idea why the report needed to be tabled out of session last week and supposedly in some urgency when, when we get here this week, the bill is not listed for debate. Apparently we were meant to do all this irregular process and put enormous pressure on Senate committees that are already under-resourced and overstretched so that we could meet the apparently absolutely urgent imperative of the government to bring on this legislation today. 
 It is not only not on today but, at least as far as we know, it is not listed at all for this week. Regardless of one's views about the content of this legislation—whether you feel it is good or bad—that process makes it very difficult for us as parliamentarians, makes it impossible for the Senate committee staff, Senate staff, and generally brings the parliament into disrepute.
It is probably also worth noting the action, prior to this debate coming on, of the withdrawal of a notice of motion of Senator Murphy's which was aimed at referring these broader matters relating to regional forest agreements to a Senate references committee in recognition of the range and importance of the issues that relate to forestry, particularly the regional forest agreements and, again, the depth and strength of public concern. If that motion had been continued and voted on and the issues were put to a Senate committee, it would have at least enabled these issues to be examined in the depth that they deserve, but, unfortunately, that motion was withdrawn by the Labor Party just a few minutes ago as well. So clearly we are not going to have that opportunity.
We have not had an adequate opportunity with this legislation to address those issues. Unfortunately, that looks like all the examination we are going to get of what is clearly a crucial issue. In the Democrats' view it clearly puts the future of our forests, indeed the future of our forestry industries and people dependent on the timber industries, very much at risk. To lock up some public resources for the long-term benefit of foreign owned woodchip companies is an outcome, from the Democrats' perspective, we find hard to believe and something that should be adequately examined.
Unfortunately, because of the time frame imposed on the committee—and, again, this is no reflection on the committee staff or the members of the committee from all parties who had to work within the time frame that the Senate imposed on them—I think this is a perfect example of an inadequate process which reflects badly on the Senate and on the parliament. I hope senators keep that in mind next time there is consideration given to 
 appropriate reporting dates for contentious legislation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-08,"—I had not intended to speak in this debate on the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report because my colleague Senator Brown has been following this committee and working very hard to put the community's view and give the community a chance to give their view in this regard. I just wanted to make a comment on one of these issues of process. Here we have a situation where the committee, with the votes of the Labor Party opposition and the government, agreed to table this report out of session. For all the arguments we have heard, we have realised that the government basically have not lived up to any commitments that they made or may have made on this issue.
What concerns me, however, is that, given the agreement by the Labor opposition, the Labor opposition's response is not here. It was an out of session tabling, and we have the actual report being tabled in the Senate today. I would be concerned that what we are seeing here is the desire of the Labor opposition not to be seen to be part of this process, part of the debate, to try to take the heat away from their own position on this issue because we do not know what their position is.
This whole process is of great concern to me. Firstly, they agreed to the out of session tabling but, secondly, when we get here several days later, the smaller political parties with fewer resources are able to present their response on time and the Labor opposition is saying `some time later this week'. That is not good enough. Perhaps I could seek leave to continue my remarks, and maybe this document will still be on the table. Then we can look at both these reports together at some stage in the future when they are available.
—You can only seek leave to continue your remarks provided nobody else wants to speak, Senator Margetts. I understand Senator Forshaw is seeking the call. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-08,"—Firstly, I was going to make some comments at greater length when the time came later this week, provided leave will be granted, with respect to the opposition's position on this legislation, the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . I will no doubt still have that opportunity. Secondly, we will deal with the legislation when it comes on, and that will provide a further opportunity to consider all of the reports of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—the majority report, the dissenting reports from the Greens and the Democrats and the opposition minority report. But I do need to correct a couple of things that have just been stated by Senator Margetts and Senator Bartlett.
Absolutely no inference can be drawn from the fact that the opposition has not presented its report today along with the majority report that somehow we are trying to dodge this debate. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I can assure the honourable senators from the Democrats and the Greens that we have almost finished our report. In fact, a large part of the draft has been prepared and is with the secretariat, and I am in the process of finalising that.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—I will ignore that, the start of what I think was going to be a rather snide insinuation.
—Please do, Senator.
—The reason we have taken a little bit longer than the majority report and, indeed, the dissenting reports is that we are looking at the specific options and propositions that would be available to the Senate to deal with this legislation properly. The majority report has come down after quite a detailed analysis of evidence. It is quite a lengthy document—and we received the full copy, I think, just a day or two before it was presented to the President—but all the majority report from the government says is `pass the legislation unamended'.
Basically, the position of the Democrats and the Greens is that they do not agree with this 
 legislation at all, they do not agree with the RFA process, throw it all out. That is their position. Rather, the Labor Party's position, as has already been flagged in the debate in the lower house by the shadow minister, is that we are looking at some specific proposed amendments which we believe will go to the heart of the issues raised by many of the witnesses during the proceedings concerning the RFA process.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—You can sit there and make your snide interjections, but why don't you just wait a couple of days?
—We know it's coming. It'll be more of the same cop-out.
—Order! Senator Brown! Senator Forshaw has the call.
—Senator Brown, you know nothing.
—Wait and see.
—Yes, you wait and see. Mr Acting Deputy President, we are giving very detailed consideration to the sorts of amendments that we believe this Senate should look at when the debate comes on, and we flagged that as well in the debate in the other place.
It has been put to us that the opposition should not have agreed to the tabling out of session. It is important to understand the process that occurred here. This bill was referred to this committee late last year. At the time the issue came on in the Senate, we argued that there should be a later reporting date than was first proposed, namely 15 February. The reason was that we wanted more time to allow for more public hearings and to allow the committee to have the opportunity of possibly going to other states and, given that the intervening period would encompass Christmas, New Year, the school holidays and so forth, we thought this legislation deserved more time. We argued that position here in the chamber, but we lost.
The government said at the time that this was urgent legislation and had to be dealt with at the start of the session this year. 
 When the committee's hearings got under way and key constitutional issues were raised regarding the legislation, there was a need to get a response from the department and from the Attorney-General's office. The government then acknowledged that maybe the committee did need a bit more time, so there was a further extension.
At that time, the government put forward that it wanted the report to be tabled out of session—from memory, the date was 25 February. It wanted it to be tabled on that day so that the parliament would be in a position to deal with the legislation on the first day of the sitting week—today. It was put to us that it needed that extra time between the 23rd and today to consider the report.
Opposition senators of the committee—and I do not wish to go into confidential or private discussions—maintained our position that we thought more time was still required. But understanding the numbers on the committee and understanding the numbers in the Senate, we were not going to win that argument. That is the position. We wanted the opportunity for that extra time to consider in even greater depth than we had been allowed all the submissions and information that had been raised. I imagine we will be presenting our minority report within the next couple of days, certainly this week. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The Government has already released a large number of documents relating to the environmental impact assessment process for the Jabiluka development, including the assessment reports produced by my Department, the independent scientific review undertaken by scientists from the University of NSW and the Australian Government's submission to the Mission which visited Kakadu National Park in 1998. The release of the attached documents again highlights the Government's commitment to transparency.
The documents also demonstrate the commitment of the Government to:
.	 respond to the flawed Mission report based on strong and well-constructed scientific, legal and logical arguments;
.	 ensure the strictest environmental and cultural heritage protection standards are applied to the Jabiluka development;
.	 protect the World Heritage values of Kakadu; and
.	 defend Australia's national interest in the face of misleading and inaccurate representations about the state of conservation of Kakadu National Park.
I am not tabling draft documents, legal advice, diplomatic communications or electronic mail messages not placed on file. I am also not tabling certain documents dealing with Australia's relations with other members of the World Heritage Committee and certain internal advice provided to me by my portfolio. The release of such documents could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations of the Commonwealth, or they are internal working documents the release of which would be contrary to the public interest, or they are subject to legal professional privilege.
There is also a mass of supporting documentation (for example, papers, notes and correspondence) held throughout the bureaucracy on the issue of Jabiluka. To exhaustively search for and process this mass of material at very considerable public expense would not be justifiable.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-08,"—When the debate on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  was adjourned before question time I was raising a question as to why the urgency for the introduction of this legislation, given that the matter had been referred under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to an inquiry by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Such inquiry is due to report to the minister by June of this year. Obviously one has to come to the conclusion that the introduction of this legislation is a blatant attempt by the minister to circumvent the outcomes of the AIRC inquiry.
If the minister wanted to ignore the inquiry, if he felt that the inquiry was not going to bring down a set of findings that would allow him to run the sort of agenda he wants to run, which he spelt out in the letter he sent to the Prime Minister and in the speech he made to Freehill, Hollingdale and Page in February of this year, then clearly he could have introduced legislation here which would have amended the Workplace Relations Act and abolished the inquiry altogether. Instead of that he has seen fit to introduce legislation in here dealing with the question of youth wages while, parallel, the Industrial Relations Commission is looking at the whole issue and is due to report to the minister in June of this year.
Once again, this demonstrates that this government and this minister in particular are not driven by a desire to implement good policy. They are not driven by a desire to put policies in place that will benefit the section of the community those policies are supposed to be targeted at. They are driven by an ideological agenda, a political agenda, which has as much to do with the minister's ambitions to be Prime Minister of this country as 
 it has to do with trying to get young people into employment.
The message is clear in the letter to the Prime Minister. The minister clearly spells out the government's agenda for cutting youth wages, for keeping the wages of young people down. He again spells it out in the paper to Freehill, Hollingdale and Page in February this year. That agenda is a key focus of both those documents. The government's whole agenda on wages from when they came to power—despite the rhetoric they put before the Australian people in 1995, and in 1996 prior to the election about no worker in this country being worse off—has been exactly to achieve that. Their whole political strategy, their legislative strategy, is about setting in place the circumstances to cut real wages in this country, to create the same sorts of circumstances that apply in many countries overseas—to create a class of working poor. Young people are a part of that target in the wages agenda of this government.
It is as if a panacea has suddenly arrived—that if we keep the wages of young people down, if their wages are less than we pay to adults, then they will suddenly get employment because we will create jobs. I think the minister referred somewhere to 300,000 new jobs being created for young people in the current situation—a view that has been utterly rejected by both the ACTU and AYPAC.
But the reality is that junior rates of pay are not the problem in terms of unemployment of young people. If they were, then the problem would be easily resolvable. I will just give you an example in my own state. In the 12 months to December 1998, the average full-time youth unemployment rate in the Illawarra statistical district was 27.9 per cent. In the Richmond/Tweed/Mid North Coast statistical district, the rate was even higher—35.8 per cent. In comparison, adult unemployment for the month of December 1998 was 10.9 per cent in the Illawarra and 12.9 per cent in Richmond/Tweed/Mid North Coast. The reality is that, if young people worked for nothing in both those districts, you would not create enough jobs to significantly reduce the 
 unemployment level. It is a nonsense to suggest it.
Over the past decade or so, as a result of structural changes in the economy, many entry level jobs have disappeared out of our economy. The number of apprenticeships and traineeships have fallen. The number of job opportunities in the banking industry and the finance sector—which was a major employer of young people—have gone. They have been displaced by technological change, privatisation and corporatisation and a contraction of the public sector. Through structural change, we have abolished thousands and thousands of what were essentially job opportunities for young people, and they have not been replaced within our economy. 
It is also true to say that those structural changes in our economy that occurred right throughout the 1980s and the 1990s occurred in conjunction with the application of junior rates of pay. The fact that junior rates of pay applied under our award system through the 1980s and the 1990s did not help to alleviate the impact of structural change on job opportunities for young people. Growing unemployment  amongst  young  people  continued throughout the 1980s and the 1990s because of that structural change and not because of any significant shift in the rates of pay that young people were paid over that period. It is a fallacy to suggest that somehow or other keeping pay rates at a lower level is going to all of a sudden contribute to a huge demand or a groundswell for employment of young people in the community.
Senator McGauran interjecting—
—Senator McGauran, you will have your opportunity to get on your feet and demonstrate exactly how the young people are going to be employed. Show us where the 300,000 new jobs for young people are going to be created in this economy as a result of your policy on youth wages. You get up and demonstrate it, and I will listen intently to your contribution, because it will be just as hollow as every other contribution you have made in this chamber since you have been a senator.
We continually get bombarded in this place with political rhetoric saying, `If you only do 
 this 50,000 new jobs will be created there, 100,000 new jobs will be created here, 300,000 new jobs will be created there.' None of it has been demonstrated. None of it has, in fact, been targeted in terms of where those actual jobs are or where they can be created as a result of these policy changes. I do not think we ought to spend too much time dealing with or being concerned about that type of rhetoric.
In the last 20 years, we have seen a fall of 18 per cent in real wages for young males and a fall of 12 per cent for young females. On the other hand, real wages for adult males and females have risen by seven and 12 per cent respectively. In fact, over the past decade, the gap in wages between young people and older adults has grown—the disparity has widened. Despite that fact, there are a greater number of young people unemployed today than 10 or 12 years ago—and, as I said previously, it has nothing to do with the issue of wages.
The 1997 inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training heard from Ms Felicity Thomson of the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association. In relation to subsidies to encourage employment, she said:
I definitely find that most employers are not interested in the fact that they have to pay a salary . . . they are more interested in getting the right person for the job in the long run and whether that person is going to perform to the standards they require.
That argument, I would suggest, is just as valid with respect to the question of junior rates of pay. It is, in fact, strengthened by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its own publication, Review , of December 1998 in an article entitled `Youth Employment and Junior Rates' in which it said that, in a survey by ACCI of 400 businesses, the reasons given for employing juniors were: preference to train their own employees—of major importance, 27.4 per cent; willingness of juniors to do certain types of work—18 per cent; and lower wages for juniors—third on the list at 17.5 per cent. So wages is not the determining factor in decisions by employers to employee juniors—to put juniors on.
In a press released dated 5 September 1998, the minister says he believes that by encouraging junior rates of pay, more young people will be employed, giving more of them a `toehold in the labour market. Without them, young people would be competing against more experienced adults for jobs—they would be squeezed out and left with little opportunity for getting a start in life.' That is very clearly not the case.
AYPAC, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, agrees with the position of the Labor Party: there is no evidence to suggest that young people's jobs will be jeopardised if the Senate votes against this bill—no evidence at all. It is interesting to note, however, that funding for AYPAC, the peak national youth affairs body, was cancelled in December 1998. Further, AYPAC has been denied observer status at Dr David Kemp's national youth round table as the organisation has criticised government policy in the past. It appears that, as soon as a lot of community organisations express a point of view that is not consistent with the policy agenda of this government, all of a sudden they seem to have real difficulties in getting funding to continue their operation. It appears that funding decisions by this government to community organisations are not predicated upon the contribution those organisations are making in the community but upon whether or not they are prepared to toe the policy line of the government.
The reality is that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is conducting an inquiry into the question of youth rates. That inquiry has been going on just on two years. It has had a wide range of submissions to it in terms of what ought to be done in the area of youth wages. There are a variety of proposals, as I understand it, that have been put before that inquiry of ways and means to deal with this question. It may well be that that inquiry will find that there is more than one way to skin the cat in terms of this issue; there are a variety of mechanisms that can be applied to deal with the questions of wages, wage rates, wage relativities of young people in employment, which go to the question of skills and training and the type of policy 
 settings that were adopted by the Labor Party when it was in government in terms of the youth trainee wages, which is one element of the process.
It appears that the inquiry's outcomes or findings have already been prejudged by this government. They are not concerned to have the views of an unbiased umpire. They are not concerned to listen to the findings of a group of people who have had a long period of experience in dealing with the issue of wage fixing, in dealing with the issue of industrial relations matters and in dealing with the issue of youth in employment. They are not concerned to try to understand the myriad of arguments that have been put before that inquiry or to look at the suggested outcomes that that independent tribunal may come up with in terms of dealing with these issues.
The minister has already circumvented the inquiry. He circumvented it some six months ago. He has not shown the slightest bit of interest in what the independent umpire might find in terms of how to address this issue. Why? Because this government has got an ideological bent against workers. It has got an ideological bent against their organisation. It has an agenda that is driven by serving the needs of capital, which the minister himself has said his agenda is, that is his only purpose for being here. It is driven by a desire to cut real wages. No-one in this community across the spectrum believes any longer in the rhetoric of 1996 that no worker would be worse off in this country, because there are thousands and thousands of examples out there in the community that repudiate that statement of the Prime Minister.
—Real wages have gone up.
—It is true real wages have gone up. What feeds into that? The huge boost in executive salaries. Don't you know how average wages are calculated in this community? Don't you know that, when salary increases at the top go in, they boost average weekly earnings? Don't you know that, when there is employment at the lower end of the spectrum, average weekly earnings go up? Don't you know that, 
 when people on low incomes are unemployed, they go down?
—That is false.
—Is it? Come around some day, Julian, and I will give you a lesson in how wages and wage fixing, not wage fixation, operate in this country, because you obviously do not understand.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-03-08,"—We are now debating the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 . It talks about the competitive position of young people. Schedule 1, item 1, in the bill talks about the competitive position of young people. Item 2 again refers to the competitive position of young people, and so does item 3. There is no mention in this bill of fairness to young people or fairness to employees, or of what is a fair and reasonable amount to pay to people who might be working, whether they are children, young people or otherwise.
The sort of language in this legislation is quite distinct from the sort of language that was used in the classic case decided in 1907 by Mr Justice Higgins in the H.V. McKay case. The sort of language he used there is in contrast with the sort of language this bill uses. His Honour's speech says:
I may add that the view which I have stated of my duty under the Act seems to be supported by a critical verbal examination of the words ""fair and reasonable"" used in collocation. Under an English Act, an agreement between a solicitor and client as to costs can be set aside, unless the solicitor show that it is ""fair and reasonable""; and it has been held by the Court of Appeal that ""fair"" refers to the mode in which the agreement has been obtained, and ""reasonable"" means that the amount payable must not be out of proportion of the work done—
and he quotes a case—
Applying the reasoning to the present case, I cannot think that an employer and a workman contract on an equal footing, or make a ""fair"" agreement as to wages, when the workman submits to work for a low wage to avoid starvation or pauperism (or something like it) for himself and his family; or that the agreement is ""reasonable"" if it does not carry a wage sufficient to insure the workman food, shelter, clothing, frugal comfort, provision for evil days, &c., as well as reward for the special skill of an artisan if he is one. 

We have gone back a long way from there over the intervening years, the intervening decades.
There is another passage that His Honour stated which I think is worth considering. In this context he is talking about the people bringing the case—the objectors, as they were called in those days—wanting to look at the books of the company that manufactured the machinery. He said, `No, it is not a matter of how much money the company earns. Your wages are set not on the basis of what can be afforded by the company, but on the basis of what is fair and reasonable to you as an employee.' So, if the company earned great profits, that made no difference to the sort of wage that should be paid because the wage had to be appropriate to the work done. If on the other hand the company did not make great profits—indeed, made a loss—that should not make any difference either to the wage because the wage had to be measured in terms of what was fair to the person who was working.
It is in that context that I think of a statement by Charles Dickens in, I think, Hard Times, where he said that the big business people in those days—19th century capitalism at its worst—did not think that the Good Samaritan was a good economist. To use that expression here now, I do not think this particular legislation thinks that fairness to young people, or indeed to any particular worker, is necessarily good economic policy either.
I say that because of certain matters set out in the second reading speech which talks in terms of the competitive advantage of young people. They say this bill is all about competition, and the only way youth can do any good in the labour market is to take less than others. That is quite a horrible sort of attitude to have to people.
—Horrible?
—Yes, Senator McGauran, because it shows an attitude to people which is merely based on an economic principle. Senator McGauran is, unfortunately, perhaps not the sort of person who can see beyond economics. He is the sort of person who would condemn the Good Samaritan 
 because he was not a good economist. We on this side of the chamber see people differently. We see them as people who not only want to work but also want to work in a place where they are properly rewarded, where they have dignity and where they learn.
The one thing this bill is not interested in is having youth educated. Why do I say that? I say that because item 3 in schedule 1 of the bill says:
After paragraph 88B(3)(b)
Insert:
	 (ba)	 the need to protect the competitive position of young people in the labour market, to promote youth employment, and to assist in reducing youth unemployment, through appropriate junior wage provisions.
How does section 88B(3)(b) read? It says:
In performing its functions under this Part, the Commission must have regard to the following:
. . .              . . .             . . .
(b)	 the need to support training arrangements through appropriate trainee wage provisions;
That is the provision that deals with the education of young people. That is the provision that deals with the empowerment of youth by giving them skills. That is the section that deals with that.
This is a separate section. This is not a section that is directed towards giving young people skills. This is not a section devoted to the vocational education of children at all. This is simply a section that says that youth should be able to be exploited, that employers should be able to pick them up at whatever price they can and that the only thing that should motivate them is the issue of what is competitive.
It will no doubt be said that, if you look at section 88B in its entirety, you will see that it refers to other issues, such as minimum wages and conditions of employment. But this piece of legislation before us talks only in terms of the competitive position of young people and does not purport to go any further than that. It has been brought in at a time when there is an examination of the whole issue by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and that point has been made again and again.
The point has been made—and I think it ought to be made again and again—that this chamber ought to have great concern about a government that brings in legislation before a proper conclusion has been reached about it. What is a proper conclusion? It is that conclusion which the Industrial Relations Commission is going to bring forth, and the second reading speech bears that out quite clearly. The government has put in a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission, and the second reading speech says:
In that submission we demonstrate the critical role played by junior rates in maintaining the competitiveness of youth in the labour market and encouraging youth employment. We show that junior wages help young people by giving them a foot in the door into employment.
We also demonstrate that any move to abolish junior rates would lead to an increase in youth wages, and in turn have a detrimental effect on youth employment.
Why make a submission and then treat it as a conclusion? Why let the Industrial Relations Commission have this inquiry? Why not just simply bring in the legislation? As I understand it, the reason the Industrial Relations Commission is looking at it is to keep faith—if that is the right phrase to use—with undertakings which were made with other parties in the chamber. But it is hardly keeping faith to run an inquiry about matters which you have already come to a conclusion on and which you have stated in the second reading speech to be undeniable fact.
One point made prior to my speech—and, as I said, it is to be emphasised again—is that this is a very topsy-turvy way of going around an inquiry. The tragedy of it is that a conclusion has been reached and has been set out in legislation. That conclusion says that children—I keep using the word `children' and they are not much beyond children, but I mean the young people—are going to be thrown into the labour market without any adequate protection.
There are passages in this second reading speech which come close to being cynical. Again, I will demonstrate that by reading one such passage. It says:
Madam President, the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act are concerned with 
 equality of opportunity just as much as with equality of treatment. In this context, junior wages are a special measure that operates beneficially to meet the particular needs of young people in the labour market, who are generally recognised as needing special assistance. Lower wage costs relative to adults assist young people to gain employment by compensating for the disadvantage that young people experience due to their relatively lower skills, experience and maturity compared with adults.
The only conclusion you can draw from that is that these children, these people just above being children, these youth, these young people, will replace adults. What else does that paragraph mean? It says that, if you were going to pay young people the same as adults, you would employ the adults, which means that, since you are going to pay them less than adults, they are going to replace adults. There is discrimination, and you cannot get out of the discrimination. You are either discriminating against youth or you are discriminating against mature aged workers. So the whole basis upon which this argument goes forward is quite flawed. The second reading speech goes on to say:
Madam President, the uncertainty surrounding the current interim arrangements does not create a stable environment for the employment of young people. Young people and employers are entitled to know that their jobs and employing rights are secure. This bill will create that certainty.
What this second reading speech is saying to young people reading it is this: if they take lower wages their jobs will be secure. It specifically says that not only will the jobs be secure but also they will know that their jobs will be secure. If that promise is made, will it be carried out or will it receive the same fate as promises made to other people? We have heard people complain about their experiences with promises made to them.
This is a bill the philosophy of which is flawed, the reason of which is flawed and the results of which will be flawed. A proper way out of this is for the inquiry that is presently taking place by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to proceed to its end. I finish by saying that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is a body which has served this country well. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, have had great 
 experience before that body and know it well. I think you would, if I may say so with respect, agree with what I say.
It seems to me to be quite insulting to give that body a task to undertake and then to take steps which interdict the very decision that it is going to make. In other words, the government is saying to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, `What we're doing is sending you on an exercise which we don't think is a very serious exercise. We are sending you on the exercise of looking at this matter of youth wages but we really don't care what you say.' That body, which has that aura and that respect that we have come to know over the years, should not be treated in that cavalier way.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-08,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats as their youth affairs and employment spokesperson to speak on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 . Our industrial relations spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray, has outlined a number of concerns that the Democrats have with the legislation before us, including our primary concern in relation to the process.
I begin where I guess Senator Cooney left off. One of the most offensive aspects of this particular bill is that it does involve the breaking of a commitment, the breaking of a word and the breaking of a written understanding. But, more importantly, it is a minister pre-empting the outcome, the findings, of an Industrial Relations Commission inquiry and report—a report and a process that was agreed to by Minister Reith and his colleagues. For that minister to pre-empt that process in such a blatant manner is disturbing to many people and not just some of the parties represented in this chamber.
I wish to address some of the principles behind the Democrats' opposition to this bill. We have concerns on a number of fronts: the effect of the retention and extension of youth wages on young people; the current state of the labour market; and the possibility of viable alternatives to age-based discriminatory wage levels. At the outset, there are two 
 points that I think must be emphasised and understood in this debate. Firstly, the proposed alternatives to youth wages do not involve the abolition of differential rates of pay, but rather their replacement with a different system of competency based rates. Consequently, as a result of these alternatives that have been put forward that do not abolish the notion of differential rates of pay, many of the arguments being advanced for the retention of these wage rates are completely irrelevant.
The minister knows this. I think he has been quite disruptive and inappropriate in the way that he has spread this propaganda that differential rates somehow would be off the agenda. In doing so—and I acknowledge this—he has caused some concern among different businesses and some industries. But we are not talking about the abolition of differential rates, we are talking about replacing a system that is based on age alone with a system of differential rates based on competency, training, a recognition of skills and experience. That is exactly how we should operate in our work force today, not with age-old, antiquated, discriminatory wage levels based on someone's age.
Secondly, the government is not merely proposing the retention of youth wages in existing awards under this legislation but is proposing the extension of these wages to awards where they do not currently exist. Despite the minister's rhetoric, this is not about retaining the status quo; it is in actual fact about reducing the income levels of thousands of young Australians. It is in line with this government's perpetual agenda of scapegoating, targeting and vilifying young people. We are talking not about the status quo and its maintenance but about the extension of these youth wages into areas where they do not currently exist.
I do not think it can be denied—certainly contributors to this debate so far have not denied this—that youth wage levels based on age are discriminatory and grossly unfair to young workers. They fundamentally contravene the `equal pay for equal work' principle enshrined in international labour and human rights conventions to which Australia is a 
 signatory. On this basis alone, the Democrats have significant concerns with the government's attempts to flout its promise to examine non-discriminatory alternatives.
Young workers do not have access to `junior' rates, if you like, for rent, food or clothing and only full-time students qualify for travel concessions. This is a point that my leader, Senator Meg Lees, makes continually. Indeed, last Friday at a business function she was explaining to people that young people do not have junior rates or concessions when it comes to some of those necessities of life. Young people incur the same costs of living as adult workers, yet many of them receive heavily discounted incomes.
Those over the age of 18 in our society are deemed adults. They are old enough to vote, to drive and to drink. They are tried as adults and they undertake financial obligations. Yet in many areas of policy and legislation this government believes they are not mature enough to be treated as adults—certainly in relation to being paid an equal rate for equal work carried out by their older counterparts.
Over the past 20 years in this country real wages have declined markedly for young people despite a significant increase in adult wages over the same time. Real wages for young males have fallen by 18 per cent, from $395 in 1976 to $322 in 1996. Real wages for young women have fallen by 12 per cent, from $361 in 1976 to $316 in 1996. We are all conscious of the wage disparity between male workers and female workers, a point that has been made a number of times today, which is fitting given that it is International Women's Day. Over the same period real wages for adult males have increased by seven per cent and by 12 per cent for adult females.
—I'm all for the day.
—Senator McGauran says he is all for the day. I think that means that he has just thrown his support behind International Women's Day. Perhaps you could have a chat with Senator Newman and advise her of your support for policies that actually boost women's participation in areas like education, training and employment. Senator McGauran might also raise the 
 fact that a lot more young women these days, as opposed to young males, are looking for full-time work and not getting it.
Youth wages further undermine the value of youth labour by determining the worth of a young worker according to his or her age rather than their skill, competence and experience. This perpetuates the view that youth labour is of less worth than adult labour, a view often based on such intangibles as immaturity or maturity when, in many cases, particularly in the sectors which tend to employ young people, the work of different aged workers may not differ in any material way. This raises the possibility for young labour to be exploited. Most young workers do not belong to a union and many work in insecure casual or part-time jobs at a cut pay rate.
Youth wages are profoundly inequitable and should be resisted for that reason alone. The Democrats certainly believe that. We are also aware of the need to examine and re-examine means of creating job opportunities for young Australians. We do not believe that wage reductions are the way to achieving increased employment opportunities. Those who seek the retention and the extension of, as this bill proposes, youth wages claim that the alternatives would be worse. However, this argument ignores the real nature of the type of work many young people are engaged in. The majority of young people are employed in the retail and services sectors. The type of work they undertake shares a number of common requirements—that is, flexibility, projection of a particular image or marketing strategy, adaptability to new sales techniques or technologies and physical stamina.
The growth in the consumer market, particularly the youth consumer market, has increased the demand for highly productive, flexible and easily trained employees who reflect the image and marketing of particular retailers and service providers. There are many clear incentives, other than cost, to hire young people. They should not be discounted in the debate over the effect on employment opportunities for young people by replacing youth wages with competency based rates. In my home state of South Australia Mitsubishi 
 and another car plant, Holden, have recently abolished youth wages, recognising the particular value of the younger employees and understanding that workers should be paid according to their skill and their productivity rather than according to some inflexible model which offers them no incentive to necessarily improve their competency or their productivity.
The nature of youth work has also changed profoundly. Youth wages grew out of the apprenticeship tradition which involved a clear training wage level trade-off between employers and employees, long-term job security and a basis in pay increments according to skill acquisition. The past decade has seen a massive reduction in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships in favour of institutionalised training, usually and increasingly at the students' own expense. Most work that is undertaken by young people is low skilled involving minimal training which generally tends to take place in the first few months of employment, with all employees retained on the basis of their acquisition of a particular level of competency regardless of their age.
The justification posed for the retention of youth wages we have heard from various quarters and from the minister is that they have a positive effect on youth employment levels. That argument is being put with a lack of supporting evidence. That is one of the reasons why people were keen to see an investigation into this issue so people could assess what the likely impact would be on employment or unemployment levels and young people's work. Youth unemployment levels have continued to rise since the introduction of youth wages, which is also worth noting.
In fact, the youth unemployment rate has undergone a more rapid rate of increase since 1968, more so than any other group in this community. The unemployment rate of 15- to 19-year-old males was 2.9 per cent in 1968 compared with the current rate of 25.3 per cent. For females it was 3.9 per cent in 1968 compared with today's rate of 27.9 per cent. Young people have been severely impacted and have really borne the brunt of structural 
 change in the work force today, something Senator Cooney was referring to. The impact of recessions on the pool of available employment, of course, has been felt by young people severely.
The entry level positions which used to be available for young people do not exist. State and federal governments have greatly contributed to this, though the substantial reduction in Commonwealth and state public service positions in particular are reasons for a lot of that loss. Today there are next to no under-20-year-olds working in the public sector, yet the government continues to place the blame for high levels of youth unemployment on young people. Under the current government's policies on a federal level, we have seen a halving in the funding available for employment assistance. Under most of these policies, young people are no longer eligible for intensive work search or job search assistance.
One of the dangerous effects of this legislation is that it will serve as a proxy for the real action which needs to be taken in relation to creating jobs for young Australians. A lot of this is designed to deflect from the real issue—that is, a lack of sustainable policies designed to create meaningful and long-term jobs, not just part-time or casual positions, but sustainable long-term meaningful jobs for young Australians. What we are doing here today is deflecting away from that debate.
It is for that reason Minister Reith has put forward this particular piece of legislation. Minister Reith's agenda is all about wage and condition reductions in an attempt to spread available work more thinly—basically, extending the growing numbers of the working poor in our society. I certainly look forward to Senator McGauran outlining and telling us about—as he promised Senator Campbell he would—the government's options for creating jobs for young Australians.
In relation to the eroding of conditions and wages of Australian workers, be they older or younger, the Democrats do not accept that agenda. We resist that agenda, and we will resist this government's attempt to shirk its responsibility for job creation. This is a government which, in only November last year, reneged on a commitment to invest in 
 job creation through industry support. Instead, it prefers to pursue a regressive approach which will reduce the income of hundreds of thousands of Australians.
This legislation breaks faith. It breaks faith with the Democrats to whom Minister Reith gave his word—primarily, to our former leader—one that some of us had grave concerns about; but no, we were assured that Minister Reith would keep his word. I find it hard to believe that even he would have the audacity to not only pre-empt the findings of an inquiry but also break his word to young people, to the Democrats—
—What about Cheryl Kernot? She broke hers to you.
—I am not responsible for her, thank you, Senator McGauran. Not only did he break his word to young people and to the Democrats; he also had the audacity to pre-empt the findings of an inquiry to which he had given a commitment and his support. Surely, if there were no non-discriminatory alternatives to youth wages available, he would not feel the need to pre-empt the inquiry's findings.
His rationale for doing so, that it will lead to job creation, is based on little evidence. Even the evidence that was presented in the submissions is deeply flawed. The minister is quite fond of quoting employer surveys—only those in his favour, of course—while conveniently failing to mention that they are based on selective sampling and often misleading questions. And, even so, the results often show employers citing reasons other than mere cost for hiring young people. I think that already had been alluded to in a previous speaker's comments here today.
International evidence is similarly inconclusive and cannot support such an inequitable policy. Past Australian experience shows that the reduction of wage levels has little effect on unemployment levels. For example, between 1981 and 1983, youth wages declined relative to adult wages but youth unemployment rose by 64 per cent. In 1992 the Reserve Bank of Australia stated:
. . . the recent deterioration of the youth labour market does not seem to be due to any change in 
 relative wage levels, which have been declining steadily since the mid-1970s.
The same arguments now being advanced for the reduction of youth wages previously were put in favour of retaining gender based differential rates of pay. Yet the disastrous effects that it was predicted would result from paying women the same rates as men for work of equal value never eventuated.
In the submission I presented on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the IRC, we argued for the replacement of discriminatory age based junior rates of pay with a competency based structure. Young people must also be offered the opportunity to develop skills through training and, of course, to receive appropriate remuneration for doing so. This would recognise the value of young people's labour and end the discrimination and exploitation that currently exists in over half of industrial awards.
This government wants to entrench youth wages where they exist but also to extend them to awards where they do not necessarily currently exist. In doing so, the government is breaking its promise to wait for the AIRC's findings on examining non-discriminatory alternatives; it is proposing the drastic reduction in pay rates for hundreds of thousands of young people. The government, by suggesting this course of action, is turning its back on meaningful job creation.
If this government is serious about creating opportunities for young people in employment, it would do better to direct its employment efforts towards extending the eligibility for job search assistance to young people, improving access to education and training and other opportunities for young people to develop their skills, and making and maintaining commitments to investing in sustainable industries to create meaningful and secure jobs.
The Democrats will be opposing this bill before us today on principle grounds, on employment grounds and on procedural grounds in the sense that the minister has pre-empted the findings of a meaningful, important and worthy inquiry, and also because he has broken his word with legislators and young people, and the Australian people 
 generally. I see this as just another part of this government's ongoing targeting and scapegoating of young Australians, with the suggestion that their lives, their worth, are somehow less valid than those of older Australians.
Many people, young workers and old workers, have felt the brunt of structural change in the work force. I think this government would do well to start investigating opportunities to create jobs for those many displaced or out of work Australians as opposed to continually bashing them over the head, whether through so-called mutual obligation policies, extension of policies like work for the dole, cutting employment assistance, or even the extension and retention of youth wages in law. Perhaps this government could look at sustainable opportunities for meaningful and full-time work for all Australians. I would hope perhaps that Minister Reith could investigate those areas more thoroughly.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-03-08,"—We have heard many times before about the purpose of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998, and we now know that it is just another of this government's attempts to permanently exempt junior rates of pay from the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. At present, this act exempts junior rates of pay from the operations of its antidiscrimination provisions until 22 June in the year 2000; that is, unless the Industrial Relations Commission otherwise decides, on a case-by-case basis, that the exemption should continue to apply.
This bill is intended to amend the Workplace Relations Act and to permanently exempt junior rates of pay from the operations of its antidiscrimination provisions. It requires the Industrial Relations Commission to promote the inclusion of junior rates of pay into awards and agreements which currently do not include such rates. So what we have before us is not only a permanent exemption of junior rates of pay from the operations of the antidiscrimination provisions but also a requirement for the Industrial Relations Commission to promote—which seems in one respect an analogy when you look at enter 
 prise bargaining—the inclusion of junior rates of pay; to ensure that junior rates of pay operate where they probably do not currently exist.
Why do we have this bill before us at all in the Senate? In order to get the Workplace Relations Act through the Senate in October 1996, Minister Reith agreed with the Democrats, as we have heard time and time again today. We have been reminded time and time again that the agreement with the Democrats was an undertaking that an inquiry be conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission into youth wages and it would report by June 1999. Here we are in early March talking about the effects of this bill and the impact of this bill. There was also an agreement to exempt junior rates of pay from the age antidiscrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act until June 2000.
So this bill is before the Senate, which shows that this government has completely reneged on this agreement. It is an act to intimidate the Industrial Relations Commission. It is an act that questions, I believe, its effectiveness. It disregards the evidence of the people before it, and it clearly says a lot about what this government views as the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in the future. It pre-empts the outcomes of this inquiry, and there is still a year at least before the current provisions in the Workplace Relations Act run out.
Historically, junior rates provisions have been included in a wide range of awards. They appear to have originated from consensus, by and large. The age of majority in Australia in the early decades of this century was 21 years. Well into the second half of the century persons under the age of 21 were not entitled to vote in state or federal elections and were not entitled to purchase alcohol. They were not able to enter into certain legally binding agreements. The living costs of juniors, by and large, were subsidised by their parents through their teenage years. This is no longer the case in contemporary society in Australia. The make-up of contemporary society in Australia when it comes to young people seems to be completely ignored and forgotten by this government.
The age of majority for Australians these days—the age at which they are treated as adults—is 18 years of age. At 18 they are now entitled to vote. They can make wills, they can buy alcohol, they can enter into mortgages and hold passports. They are adults before the law. Yet the provisions of this bill treat them as if they are still minors rather than adults. School retention rates have risen dramatically over the last couple of years, and many children now complete year 12. They turn 18 the following year. They enter into part-time work while studying, certainly while going through university. Generally, the skill level of school leavers is higher than it was many years ago. It is common for young people these days to live independently.
They support themselves through their own earnings, and they usually live with a couple of kids in a flat or a house together. Persons aged 18 to 20 in Australia are adults for all intents and purposes, except in respect of their entitlement to full and fair minimum wages—and that is the case in some industry sectors but not in others.
In September 1997 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training presented the report Youth employment: a working solution. The inquiry was chaired by a member of parliament, Bob Charles, and the report has commonly become known as the Charles report. The inquiry's aim was to examine factors which influenced the employment of young people. It had to identify recommendations to improve their employment prospects. In the summary the report notes that the employment environment for young people has changed enormously since their parents and most of their teachers first entered the labour market. It says that full-time and part-time employment for 15- to 24-year-olds has fallen by three per cent since 1982, and by comparison total full-time employment has grown 16.2 per cent and total full-time and part-time employment has grown 31.2 per cent. The decline in the number of full-time jobs has been particularly severe for teenagers, falling 59.2 per cent over 15 years. On page 114, though, the dissenting report makes this statement:
The coalition members displayed a worrying disregard for the quality of life of young workers. This is evidenced by their refusal to incorporate in the report data relating to young people's standard of living, such as a comparison between the Henderson poverty line and junior wage rates.
There was evidence there to show that young people's standard of living is well below what we would expect it to be. It goes on to say that their disregard is also evidenced by their commitment to remove junior rates from the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission.
Together with the employment issues, the Industrial Relations Commission also considers questions of equity and fairness. But one of the recommendations is not to remove junior rates of pay. It is simply that the members of the coalition parties recommend the government make a submission before the Industrial Relations Commission opposing the abolition of junior wages. Back in September 1997 this government was prepared to make a submission before the commission. It still recognised that the commission had a role in conducting this inquiry. There is no recommendation at all in here that this government should break their promise, break their agreement and move to abolish junior rates of pay by the enactment of this sort of legislation.
The most significant factor influencing the employment of young people is the availability of jobs. Increasing the competitive advantage of young people within the labour market does not expand the size of the market itself. Principal determinants of youth employment include technological change, structural change and changing social mores. Again, the Charles report noted these factors.
In response to the Charles report, the ACTU had the following to say. They have calculated an optimistic view by applying the current age based relativities in the retail industry to the current minimum adult wage, and they calculated a realistic view by applying current apprenticeship rates for a commencing 18-year-old hairdresser. Substantial wage cuts for young people result either way. Optimistically, the cuts amount to 12 per cent for retail workers at each year of age from 15 to 20, while the realistic view sees cuts of up to 41 per cent in the basic minimum rate payable to 
 these young workers for ordinary hours of work. Minimum award rates for teenagers in Australia are much higher in the retail industry than in the manufacturing industry.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Prior to the dinner break I was making some comments on the Youth employment: A working solution  report, commonly known as the Charles report. I want to put on record that this report does not claim that cutting wages will create measurably more jobs for young people. It rests on the conventional belief that lower wage costs will cause employers to offer more jobs and vice versa. In fact, there is a huge body of international research that contradicts this conventional belief. Facts in Australia also challenge it. This report went on, under a section `Lack of information on wages and employment', to say:
In examining the relationship between youth wages and employment the Committee was amazed by the dearth of current Australian information on the issue. It is the Committee's view—
it went on to say—
that a detailed study of the empirical evidence in Australia to provide a clearer picture of the extent of the relationship must be undertaken.
In fact, one of the recommendations of this report was:
. . . that the Department of Industrial Relations undertake or commission empirical research on the relationship between the changes in the level of wages and employment levels.
Minimum award wage rates for teenagers in Australia—as I was saying before the dinner break—are much higher in the retail industry than in manufacturing, with a differential of 35 per cent at age 16 falling to 15 per cent at age 20. But the retail sector employs five times as many 18- to 20-year-old sub-trade workers than does manufacturing and it employs more than 12 times as many 15- to 17-year-olds. On the same measure, between 1986 and 1997, youth employment in the retail sector grew by about 70,000, or 30 per cent, but fell by around 25,000, or 40 per cent, in manufacturing, despite youth wages for retail workers rising relative to manufac 
 turing by about eight per cent over the same period.
Also, the Charles report noted that over the last 15 years there have been major structural changes in the labour market for young people aged 15 to 24. Overall there has been a decline of nearly 32 per cent in the number of full-time jobs available for young people in this age group, which has been offset by the growth in the number of part-time jobs. The decline in the number of full-time jobs has been particularly severe for teenagers, falling 59.2 per cent over 15 years. Growth in the number of part-time jobs has failed to offset the decline in the number of full-time jobs, and the total employment of teenagers has declined by 10.6 per cent over 15 years.
The changes in youth employment recorded in this country over the past 15 years have occurred in conjunction with a decline or no change in the relativity of junior to adult award wages and with falls in the relativity of junior to adult earnings. Wage rates simply have not been a decisive influence driving these changes—to the contrary, award rates of pay for juniors appear to be wholly or substantially unrelated to teenage employment outcomes over the past 20 years. In fact, junior rates of pay have been amongst the few factors held constant throughout this period of change. The incomes earned by teenage workers are, however, significantly affected by any changes in the junior rates submission.
I would like to draw the Senate's attention to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 November last year, headed `Youth need wage justice'. The author of this article, Adele Horin, makes a number of very true points. She said:
When women workers were treated as second-class citizens, dire predictions were made about the economic consequences of granting them equal pay. History proved the doomsayers wrong. Women's employment grew in leaps and bounds, all of it after the historic 1969 and 1972 equal pay victories.
. . .              . . .             . . .
For the young, it is never a right time to improve their wages.
She continues:
A government intent on overhauling the industrial relations and taxation systems is fiercely committed to maintaining the outmoded and unfair concept of junior wages.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. research points to increase numbers of impoverished young workers in Australia who cannot support themselves despite having a full-time job.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. Judy Schneider of the Social Policy Research School at the University of New South Wales maintains that it is virtually impossible for full-time workers under 18 to support themselves, even at an austere standard of living.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Even when you compare industries, youth wages are lower in manufacturing and retail, but youth employment has fallen faster in manufacturing.
~. . .              . . .             . . .
Wage rates have not been the decisive factor in youth unemployment. But they have been the decisive factor in the poverty of young workers.
In conclusion, let me just refer back to the fact that the most significant factor influencing the employment of young people in this country is the availability of jobs. As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja mentioned, it is not in fact the rate that you pay these people but the availability of jobs. She was correct when she talked about the spreading of available jobs even further and thinner.
The benefits of economic growth have not transferred into jobs for young people. Many entry-level positions have disappeared. There is no evidence to suggest that young people are less job-ready now than in the past. The cause of youth unemployment cannot be found in asserted deficiencies of young people themselves but in the economy which increasingly fails to provide them with employment opportunities. It is imperative to find innovative ways to approach the problem of youth and employment, including adopting a more interventionist approach to industry policy so as to promote job-intensive industries.
The intended cuts to youth incomes through this bill, the cuts to the provisions maintaining junior rates and the conditions contemplated by this government are unjustified and are suggested without considering the consequences for young people themselves. There 
 is a wish to maintain junior rates of pay rather than to accept competency based pay. There is no evidence at all that the abolition of junior rates of pay will increase youth unemployment. Competency based wages in this country should be allowed to proceed.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-03-08,"—The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act 1996. It promotes the inclusion of junior rates and awards and workplace agreements and exempts junior wage rates from the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. In essence, the legislation before the Senate maintains the junior rates of pay in awards beyond June 2000, when they are due to expire because of legislation introduced by the previous government.
While I do not wish to waste my valuable time on comments made by some of the speakers on the other side of the chamber, I particularly wish to single out Senator Campbell's comments and respond to some of the falsehoods he put about this government. I know that he often wraps up his speeches with the old cliche that this government is against the worker. Although this description is general, I would like to point out to Senator Campbell and those on the other side of the house—
—George Campbell.
—Senator George Campbell, to be correct. Your interjection is utterly correct—how could we possibly get the two of you wrong when you are chalk and cheese? In response to Senator Campbell, this government produced a real wage increase of five per cent in its first term. Because that real wage increase has been linked to productivity, we have a falling unemployment rate—now 7.5 per cent—which is the best rate for over a decade. Added to this, the average worker with a mortgage has saved over $400 through this government's tight and responsible fiscal and monetary policies—that is, a lower interest rate regime. That is what we have put directly into the pockets of the workers. So the last thing we should hear in 
 this debate on youth wages is an ideological attack on the workers; rather, what we are seeing is a commonsense approach to protect young Australians in the work force. Senator Cooney used biblical terms which were utterly incorrect. We are giving young people a far more competitive advantage, by not pricing them out of the market. This pretty basic and commonsense attitude towards the workplace and the marketplace is to the advantage of over 420,000 youth workers on the junior rates of pay.
Instead, we hear tonight from the other side—particularly from Senator Campbell—the old line that the level of wages is not linked to the level of employment or the ability to employ; that the employers take no notice of the level of employment; and that the cost of labour has no effect. That is the old line we have had run here tonight. Besides being very dangerous, it is nothing more than a defence of the old union ways of the seventies and eighties—during those years when the unions really did have some economic and political power which they used to devastating effect. It was a time when we had crippling interest rates, crippling inflation rates and crippling unemployment rates. It was a time when unions thought they could pull on a strike at any time to devastate big business, to bankrupt small business and to hold the nation to ransom. It was really the glory days of the union movement; and we have heard every argument they used then being run again here tonight by that arch monument to old unionism, Senator George Campbell.
Employment was never a factor during those times, nor does it seem to be a factor now. It is just simply a matter of putting the ambit claim—the highest wage claim possible. Whether it is sustainable or whether it is linked to productivity has no relevance at all. You were running a protection racket for the employed. It does not matter who drops off or who cannot get into the marketplace, it is a protection racket for the employed. That is the philosophy we have had here.
Senator Campbell has got a nerve to make the same old mistakes. He blames technology and structural change as the reason for youth 
 unemployment in this country. As evidence of that he quoted the manufacturing sector, for example. Yes, there has been a shedding of employment—young and old—within the manufacturing sector. But he has got a nerve to mention the manufacturing sector when over 200,000 jobs were lost when he was head of that union. One single ambit claim, one single wage rise, brought about over 200,000 being unemployed in his time. And he says there is no link between wage rises—excessive wage rises—and unemployment in his period. Well, there is.
He also failed to mention—and I attempted to make this point by interjection—that the retail sector employs the most young people on junior rates. He uses the manufacturing sector as his prime example—the sector which he personally devastated—but he never mentions the retail sector, which is the biggest employer of young people. Presently, there is an incentive to employ young people; there is an incentive to give them the training and experience they need for their first time in the workplace. For most of them, it is the first time. This is a sector that has not been subject to a great amount of structural change or technical change at all; it is simply price sensitive. We are told by the Retail Traders Association that if this legislation does not pass and junior rates are abolished, virtually overnight we will have some 60,000 unemployed.
Whether you believe that figure or not, one thing you can be sure of is that, if this legislation does not go through in that sector, there will be the non-employment of young people; that is what you will have. You will have a percentage shed, and you will certainly have no new ones coming in, certainly not at the current take-up rate.
This debate is all about employment. It is about the government's responsibility to undertake policies that will reduce unemployment. That includes no less, of course, than youth unemployment. We all know that no single approach will solve the problem. Governments must act on a wide front, and we have acted on a wide front. We have promoted policies of low inflation and low interest rates so as to stimulate business 
 investment, which, of course, follows on to employment. We have also tackled social welfare, where there is quite often a disincentive to take job opportunities should they come up.
We have tackled the industrial relations area. This government has introduced a more flexible wage system. We have introduced a fairer dismissal system et cetera. We have undertaken these measures in our first term with success. We know we have achieved the lowest unemployment rate for over a decade. Much more can be done and should be done, and we are attempting to do it. We have a pretty good record in this area.
On each of those occasions I have mentioned, let alone tonight, we have been blocked, hindered and frustrated by the Senate, regardless of our good record. The irony is that the scourge of unemployment requires immediate action. The public would expect this government, after winning its second term, to immediately get on with the job of tackling unemployment. It does not want us to sit around waiting for reports to be produced or tabled, especially given that we went to the election with this policy.
The Democrats have been complaining about some commitment that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business broke with Senator Murray. But a greater commitment than anything we might make with Senator Murray in the corridors of this place is the commitment we make to the Australian people at an election.
—More of whom voted for us than for you. More Australian people voted for us than for you. If your commitment is to the Australian people, the majority of them do not agree with you.
—I confess that I am distracted by that point because it is central to the debate. Senator Forshaw interrupts and says, `We got more votes than you.' That is a pretty humble, if not pathetic, interjection from someone who happens to be sitting in opposition. It is not quite like that, and Senator Forshaw knows it.
Let us dispel this. Your primary vote did not jump at all. Your primary vote jumped by 
 one per cent, so you did not get more. The Labor Party in fact had the second lowest primary vote. It jumped by one per cent from 1996. It was the second lowest primary vote in the history of the Labor Party. You jumped up a bit on preference votes, but you got most of them from One Nation. You won three seats in Perth from One Nation preferences.
—Four.
—You won four seats in Perth. If One Nation, which is now imploding, had done the right thing, you would not have won four seats. It would really then have looked like a devastation. But you are dressing it up as something else. That is the distraction I have taken up. I will now get back to the debate. That point is important to this debate, because we have a mandate to act. Like most of the policies we have attempted to pass since the election, we put them to the Australian people before the election. I know that Senator Forshaw is tired of the word `mandate'. Those opposite are pig-headed about frustrating the Senate, so that is what they are going to continue to do.
I assure the Senate that we will continue with our strategy to reduce unemployment and all the policies we took to the people of Australia in the last election. We have not just the political confidence to do that now; we have the empirical evidence, particularly on this issue. It is from no less than the Productivity Commission, which produced a paper that supports our view. It states the obvious. The conclusions are unambiguously clear.
—Oh, wow!
—You are scoffing at the Productivity Commission. After you amended it so much, there could not be an organisation further at arm's length from this government than the Productivity Commission. It looks into matters such as this and other economic matters. Do not forget that you amended it so that it was much more to your liking. That is how you got it. This is what it says:
The empirical results indicate a strong and robust negative relationship between youth unemployment and youth wages. This relationship suggests that a 1 per cent increase in youth wages would lead to a decrease in youth employment of between 2 and 
 5 per cent in industries employing a relatively high proportion of youth.
It should be noted that the opposition has been running the false argument that the introduction of this legislation will reduce all young people's wages. It does not. It simply maintains the existing junior rates and encourages junior rates for other awards.
Remember that the industrial relations reform package has written into it the no disadvantage test. So what is the problem? A measure of just how out of touch and out of date the opposition is is that many unions are now embracing the junior wage rates that we have in place now in their enterprise bargaining agreements. They are there now. They are writing them in. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry report claims that age-based junior pay rates were common in the last batch of enterprise agreements struck with the bosses.
Imagine that out of the blue in June 2000, not linked to any productivity outcome or wage negotiation, employers were faced with pay increases of greater than 40 per cent just for 18-year-olds. For example, a junior shop assistant employed under a retail award would, with the abolition of junior rates, cost an employer $43.20 more to employ; that would be for a 20-year-old. It would cost $86.35 extra to employ a 19-year-old and $130.55 extra to employ an 18-year-old. You are trying to tell us that it will have no effect. In one hit, it will have more than a $1 billion effect throughout the economy on the wage rates of this country.
The coalition's strategy is to reduce unemployment based on empirical evidence and common sense. The surest way to handicap a young person in obtaining employment where junior wage rates are part of the award—and they have been there since federation—is to increase the employers' costs to the extent that there is no difference between the wages of an experienced adult employee and those of an inexperienced junior employee. So the onus is upon those supporting the removal of junior rates to show that such a change would not damage the jobs of young people. It is not discrimination to pay less to young people who are less skilled and who have less experi 
 ence. Rather, the prime interest of young people is to gain experience and develop labour market skills.
It has been said that the alternative to what we are offering is competency based wages. That is what the opposition now wants to put in place. The great theorists in this debate are promoting the competency rate against age based rates. The point is that junior rates specifically target the youth unemployment problem. They go straight to the heart of the matter. This is a prime aim of the government in introducing its legislation.
Competency based rates are not a solution to youth unemployment. It is a complicated and very subjective system, and it will cut out young people from early employment opportunities. One of the main complaints of young people—I am sure you have heard it—is that they are unable to get a job because they are inexperienced. Yet how do you get experience without a job? Competency based rates will only accentuate this problem.
I refer to a committee report which quotes major views on competency based wages. Senator Crossin had much to say about this report, Youth employment: A working solution. It is a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, September 1997. It quotes extensively the likes of Coles Myer, Woolworths and McDonald's, the three biggest employers of the junior sector and shows just how complicated, subjective and ill-advised the competency based system is. I refer to pages 79 and 80 in regard to this matter. Together all of these employers employ hundreds of thousands of young people.
Further, we need to consider the impact of a competency based rate on adult earners. Not only does it make employees vulnerable to a very subjective assessment of their competency but it may well have the effect of dragging many adult wage earners down to what was once a junior rate, the lowest of the competency rate—in particular, working women.
Consider a working woman with a family to support who has lost her job in which she had become skilled over, say, 10 years in the manufacturing sector—a most common 
 occurrence. The area of growth is the retail sector. So she takes up a job in that area and is plummeted to the wage at the lowest level, the former junior wage rate, because of her competency, because she is judged not to have the skills required for this industry. So the system that once supported the adult worker with a family now does not recognise her contribution and her working life as an adult. It will simply pull away the safety net for many adult workers.	So in conclusion, in the words of the Canberra Times on 26 October, `You have to wonder about how serious some people are about lowering youth employment' when they stand against this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-03-08,"—The Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  Bill typifies this government's total lack of understanding and ineptitude with regard to industrial relations in Australia in 1999. It also represents just another aspect of their sustained attack on young Australians. The bill seeks to exempt junior rates in awards and certified agreements from the age discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The present statutory exemption is due to expire on 22 June 2000. The most worrying aspect of this bill is contained in item 5, which will require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that in making any award it must give consideration to inserting junior wage rates. This provision will mean that many young people who have gained jobs on the basis of their skills, ability and performance will subsequently have their wages cut because of their age. The AIRC will be compelled to insert into every industrial award and agreement a junior rates of pay clause, even where such clauses have never before been required or sought.
It is important to understand that a junior differs from apprentices and trainees in that he or she is expected to be working full-time receiving no training. A junior's pay is usually based on their age, starting at 45 per cent of an adult's pay for a 16-year-old and increasing in steps on each birthday until age 21 is reached and he or she is considered to be an adult. At the moment many industrial 
 awards and agreements do not incorporate junior rate clauses. Young people employed under these arrangements have competed for their jobs on an equal footing with everyone else in the labour market and have been employed entirely on the basis of merit.
These young people are now to be penalised for their achievements. In many industries these penalties will be highly significant, creating a huge disincentive for young people to continue their employment. At present, under the metal engineering and associated industries award, there are no junior rates of pay. As my colleague Arch Bevis stated in the other chamber, an 18-year-old would now be earning $434.60 per week. With the enforcement of junior rates of pay, the same person would be paid $296.83 per week. This is a pay cut of $137 each week. Arising out of this statement, the question has to be asked: if this legislation is passed, will those people who are working at the current rate of pay suddenly find their pay packet lighter on the next pay day? Obviously it will be so. This, of course, would mean that there would be a very large number of very peeved people out there in voter land—rather stupid politics, to my way of thinking.
This government has to realise that it will not just be a few young people who will find themselves taking crippling pay cuts. While 56 per cent of all people in the work force aged under 21 are currently employed on a junior rate of pay, some 44 per cent are not. Therefore, 44 per cent of under-21-year-old workers are now faced with the prospect of being forced to accept less pay for the same work. This approach seems particularly contradictory, given the government's supposed commitment to performance based industrial relations arrangements.
The competency based or skills acquired system is supposed to determine wages according to performance. The only people the minister thinks should not be paid according to their skill are people under 21. Under his system, you could be 18 and get paid 20 or 30 per cent less than someone who is 21 performing exactly the same job with the same responsibilities. Where is the incentive for young people to work hard and get ahead 
 when they will be denied a fair day's pay for a fair day's work? It will be interesting to see whether the coalition intends to inflict a junior rate of pay on Tasmanian Liberal member for Franklin, Matthew Smith. After all, Mr Smith is only 20 years old and would hence be subject to these new arrangements. I wonder if he thinks this proposal is fair.
The unnecessarily contradictory nature of this bill is further illustrated by the Queensland government's submission to the AIRC inquiry into junior pay rates. The Queensland submission proposes a competency based system by progression. This would bring legislation in line with the arrangements that prevail for the rest of the work force. The submission endorses the gradual introduction of competency based wages for those under 21 on an industry by industry basis. These would initially be based on current junior rates of pay. Until such arrangements are established, the existing system in each industry would remain.
There is no need to implement a hurried and inequitable policy like the one proposed in this bill. It would be far more appropriate to progressively work through each industry and agreement in order to establish a non-discriminatory basis for paying young people what they are due according to their work contribution. However, given the minister's disregard for the AIRC inquiry and its findings, I doubt whether he would have contemplated any sensible transitional arrangements put forward by the Queensland government. Instead, Minister Reith has set about undermining the AIRC and its inquiry into junior rates of pay. Section 120B of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 established that the full bench of the AIRC would conduct an inquiry into the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. The fact that the AIRC was directed to examine non-discriminatory alternatives clearly indicates that it would not be preferable to discriminate against young people.
When he instigated the inquiry, Mr Reith said it would ensure `a fair deal in the end'. Non-discriminatory alternatives, like those put forward by the Queensland government, have been uncovered during the process of the 
 inquiry, but now Mr Reith wants to institutionalise junior rates of pay before the inquiry has made its report. How can the inquiry ensure the fair deal for young people that Mr Reith promised when its findings will not even be taken into consideration? Junior rates of pay will be a fait accompli before 22 June, when the inquiry is due to present its findings to the minister.
This incredible turn of events begs a couple of questions. Why is Mr Reith trying to rush this bill through parliament when the inquiry pertaining to it has not been completed? The date of 22 June was chosen for the presentation of the inquiry's findings because this will still be a full year before the current provisions are due to expire. There is no need to hurry the process along at this stage unless Mr Reith is feeling frightened that the inquiry will scuttle his plans to enforce junior rates of pay. At this stage, it looks like there might be a number of preferable options that do not involve unnecessary discrimination against young Australians. Why is Mr Reith so set on enforcing discriminatory industrial relations arrangements on young people? He seems to be hell-bent on persecuting the young, even if it is proven to be entirely unnecessary and avoidable.
Many Australians will also be wondering why their tax dollars are being spend on an inquiry when the minister has already disregarded its findings. It seems that no-one is receiving the fair deal the minister promised from this inquiry. Minister Reith's actions indicate a complete disregard and disrespect for proper parliamentary processes and accountability. He has initiated an AIRC inquiry to which he is completely unaccountable. It does not matter what the inquiry concludes, he has already gone ahead and done exactly as he pleased. All the expert witnesses and submissions made to the inquiry obviously cannot surpass the overarching wisdom of the minister for industrial relations! This inquiry has been a farce and those who have taken part in it have the right to be thoroughly insulted by the arrogance of this minister who brings the entire parliamentary process into disrepute by his actions.
Mr Reith's recently leaked cabinet-in-confidence plans to restore full employment revealed an underlying desire to do away with the AIRC altogether. This seems totally logical in the context of the junior rates issue. Why would the purveyor of all wisdom need such a body? He is already making all the decisions himself.
The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association is one of the largest unions in Australia and represents an extraordinarily large proportion of young people in the work force in this country. They have presented an excellent submission to the federal commission outlining an effective case to show that Mr Reith's proposal to maintain junior rates of pay is a discriminatory practice. They acknowledge that in some cases there may be a need for junior rates of pay, but stress this is not across industry in general. Their argument is that, if people in the workplace are doing exactly the same job on an equal level, why should the person who is 18 receive less pay than his or her work mates who are 10 or 20 years older? The principle here—and it is a very important principle—is that work of equal value demands equal pay. This is the crux of the matter. That is the real issue of this debate.
In justifying the Work for the Dole program, the coalition's rhetoric leaned heavily on the concept of mutual obligation. I would therefore like to revisit this notion of mutual obligation in the context of the current debate. Work for the Dole was touted as a way for young unemployed people to contribute something to the community in return for government support. This government now seeks to shirk its obligations to support young people who are already willingly contributing to Australia's community and economy. It seeks to institute a set of disincentives so severe that many young people will be reconsidering whether it is worthwhile looking for work at all. How does this government dare to speak of mutual obligation when it is trying to remove the very provisions set in place to ensure that young people are not discriminated against in the workplace? It is trying to prevent young people from getting an honest day's pay for an honest day's work 
 when no other group in the community has been singled out for such treatment. Why don't the concepts of fairness and equity extend to young people as well?
This government has been hypocritical in promoting mutual obligation while shirking its own responsibility to support younger Australians in the work force. This bill is intrinsically discriminatory towards young people, and it is not just a matter of denying them an honest day's pay either. This bill has significant social implications for the way young people are perceived within our community. It also has implications with regard to how young people perceive themselves and their own social responsibilities within Australian society.
Since 1973, 18-year-olds have had the right to vote. This means that young Australians play an equal role with all other adults in deciding who governs their country. At 18, people are held criminally liable for their actions and are sentenced in court as adults. At 18, young people can join the military and go overseas to fight and even die for their country. An 18-year-old also consumes alcohol and for all intents and purposes is considered to take on the responsibilities of an adult before the community and the law. Becoming an adult involves all of these responsibilities, but it should also involve some rights as well.
If this bill becomes law, 18-year-olds will still have all of these responsibilities, but the right to be paid an honest day's pay for a hard day's work will be removed. This government cannot have it both ways. As a community we expect young people to assume responsibility for themselves and their actions. How can we in good conscience ask them to fulfil the responsibilities of adult life without giving them the rights we take for granted as adults in a democratic society?
This bill portrays people under 21 as second-class citizens who do not deserve the rights bestowed on other adults. How are young people ever to feel a sense of belonging in an atmosphere that denigrates them and singles them out for contempt? The duplicity of this government's concept of mutual obligation can be more fully appreciated if we 
 consider the social upheavals being faced by this generation. A recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Mr Richard Eckersley highlighted some of the major social problems facing young Australians. Surely, if this government takes its commitments to mutual obligation seriously, it must have a responsibility to address some of these long-term problems that continue to plague our youth in the 1990s.
Mr Eckersley cited increases in family breakdown, youth unemployment, child poverty, education pressures and media influence as some of the main pressures on young Australians. The youth unemployment rate was 20.3 per cent in 1997-98, up from 3.3 per cent in 1967 and 14.9 per cent in 1989-90. Opiate overdose deaths, excluding suicide, among Australians aged 15 to 44 increased almost sevenfold between 1979 and 1997. The suicide rate for males aged to 20 to 24 rose from 29 per 100,000 in 1986 to 42 per 100,000 in 1997.
Recent surveys of youth attitudes have shown they are regarding social institutions, especially government, with growing cynicism and mistrust. Many are no longer willing to serve or believe in the system, and who could blame them? A lot of young people are feeling alienated and detached from mainstream society. Governments have failed to adequately address the very real problems facing our youth every day. Now this government is jamming the concept of mutual obligation down their throats as though they have something to be thankful for.
While this government has failed to solve the problem of youth unemployment, it continues to begrudge young people unemployment benefits. This has already been demonstrated by its dogged commitment to the Work for the Dole program under the banner of mutual obligation. Now apparently young people are mutually obliged to forgo an honest day's pay in return for the wonderful opportunities this government has provided for them. What an insult! No wonder young people are increasingly feeling alienated from the mainstream. No wonder they are expressing a growing contempt for government institutions and authority.
Young Australians are continually being used as scapegoats for the problems in society this government has failed to address. `What is wrong with the youth of today' seems a very popular catchcry in the 1990s. Maybe what is wrong with the youth of today is they are becoming increasingly angry and frustrated by government rhetoric and inaction on the issues that are most important to them.
If this bill goes ahead, they will not even be able to be properly paid for the daily contributions they make to our economy and society. No wonder our youth often seem disrespectful and irreverent. This bill is a nonsense. It is designed to exploit the young people of this country so they can be used as nothing more than cheap labour, and it deserves to be defeated and thrown in the rubbish bin.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1999-03-08,"—There is a very long speaking list on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  and I do not want to be repetitive, so I will not take an encyclopaedic approach to it. I just want to enter a plea for some fairness in the Australian parliament for those less fortunate than the members of parliament, namely, the youth of Australia who are trying to get a career established. I would also like to bring a little bit of reality to the debate, particularly after the hoary old mythology we have had from the trade union representative who has just spoken.
In essence, this is a very simple bill. It is just about retaining a specific wages policy for the youth of this country. Those who oppose it really are saying that we have to pay full adult wages to people who are just learning a job. That is just not the real world. I have employed people for 40 years. I have employed people not because they are black, white, female or male; I have employed them for the job they can do, for their professional skills and for their productivity. That is what you are paid for in this world. To not recognise that means that you get off with the wrong set of assumptions, and we have had those assumptions paraded extensively by the Labor Party today.
I support wholeheartedly the concept of equivalent pay for women and men doing the same tasks, but we have had an attempt to muddy the waters through this debate and somehow move equivalent pay for women into the business of adult wages for the youth. If you are an employer, why on earth would you pay the same rate to a young person who has to learn on the job to do the job when you can employ a fully trained person with experience to do the same task for the same price? It is just not logical. You also have to remember that in the real world what you pay someone is not the end of the business. Because of the proliferation of awards, long service leave and a thousand other things, your oncost as an employer is at least 50 per cent on the notional up-front weekly wage or salary. So you are asking a great deal from an employer.
If you go down the path the Labor Party wants us to go down, you are denying the opportunity to countless hundreds of thousands of young Australians to get a career. They do want to work. The great majority of young Australians are not gifted enough to go to universities and become professionals, and a very large proportion of them are not gifted enough to become tradesmen. They want to climb the ladder the way millions of Australians have done before them.
If you look around this community, there are many successful retired Australians. When I say successful, I am not necessarily talking about someone with a multimillion dollar house and a big car in the garage; I am talking about Australians who have had satisfying and rewarding careers and have often made a great contribution to the society they live in. A lot of these people started with nothing. They left school at whatever the minimal age was 40 or 50 years ago, got themselves a job and worked their way up from there. That is very much part of the Australian ethos, and I will defend the right for someone to do that to the end.
I will go further to say that it is our duty to give people the right to lead a fulfilling life. That is at the heart of this bill. That is what it is about. It is giving people an opportunity to get started. It is not a messianic plot in any 
 way at all to enshrine child slave labour in the Australian work force; it is all about giving an opportunity to the young and to the unskilled to get a job because the absolutely most crucial thing in their lives is that first start. Once they get on the ladder, if they have the will, they will go somewhere.
Before I wind up, I would just like to look at contemporary United States experience. In the last five or 10 years, the United States has transferred millions from the unemployed to the productive work force. A lot of it has been done by having low starting wages for youth. It is not much fun to go onto a wage of a few dollars as a starting position but, once you get your foot on the ladder, six months later there is the opportunity for getting a promotion or another job—you have something to sell, you have experience. The experience in the United States, as I say, is that millions have been transferred from welfare to productive employment.
Once they get through that door and start in the work force, they go on to better things. They have the psychological satisfaction and the self-esteem that come from being employed and achieving. It is not only the economic benefits for them; it is a benefit for the whole community. Once you transfer people from the unemployment field into the employment field, the whole of the economic pie in that country grows and everyone benefits. That has been a significant part of the economic growth and the unprecedented boom they have enjoyed in the United States.
Conversely, against that argument, we have very clear research in Australia which shows that, if we abolish youth wages, we will get an increase in unemployment for the reasons I have outlined. In the most recent research conducted by the Australian Retailers Association—and the Retailers Association employ most of the young people in this country—the respondents claimed that 16.8 per cent of them would lay off some juniors if junior wages were abolished, 18.4 per cent would lay off most of their juniors and a staggering 50.6 per cent—over half of them—would employ only adults. This is a very chilling statistic for the youth of this country. What it means is that, if we reject this bill, we will 
 add to the social misery, the discontent and all the dislocations in society that it brings. There really is a huge cost to society in the longer term. What has happened to the social conscience the Labor Party once used to aspire to? Why are they condemning these children to lives of unemployment, disillusionment and misery?
Only last sitting week, the Senate rejected the unfair dismissal amendments that we brought before it. That was a very bad decision, it is quite indefensible, but I will not redebate it here. I want to put another dimension into this debate and it is one that Senator Cook will appreciate very well. He, like me, spends quite a bit of time in Asia, and he knows very well we cannot dissociate ourselves from what is going on in our region. I am not talking about places like Burma, or Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos or some of those countries with a low standard of living. I am talking about places which have a competitive standard of living or a higher standard of living than Australia—like Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
When you go to those countries and talk to employers and business people, they just cannot believe that we have the restrictions on employers that we have. They cannot believe that we have things like unfair dismissal. They say, `How can you bind an employer so that he cannot get rid of an unsatisfactory employee who is not performing?' They cannot believe that we want to get rid of youth wages.
I want to return to the starting point. We do owe it to the youth of Australia to give them the best of opportunities parliament can. The best of opportunities do not involve, necessarily, a university education, because that is enjoyed by only a minority of youth. The very essence of this argument is getting a start in life, and this bill does that.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-08,"—I have no doubt about the sincerity of Senator MacGibbon but, unfortunately, what he put forward can best be described as quaint naivety.
—Hogwash.
—Thank you for the interjection, Senator Collins. I can declare that I come from the retail industry. I worked in the retail industry. I worked on both sides. I worked as an employee and I worked on the industrial side, as both an industrial advocate and the secretary of an organisation which had a great deal to do with retailers and their employees over a long period of time. Let me just say that Senator MacGibbon's concept of a career being established—whilst it is very nice and very quaint—is not the reality. As for your concern about an increase in unemployment—whilst, again, that is very nice—most of these people you are talking about are high school students who are working in the industry, as opposed to those people who are genuinely long-term unemployed. One must necessarily make the distinction between the classes of people whom you are talking about in this debate.
The fact remains that the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998  is about providing cheap labour for the marketplace in the retail industry. The issue of junior rates just defies logic. Junior rates had meaning when they were first introduced in the earlier part of this century, as others have already pointed out. Then the majority age was 21, most people finished school at year 8 or lower, most of them were 13 years of age or younger and, of course, in joining the work force, they had knowledge and skill formation and education as part of their employment process.
Today, however, that has dramatically changed. The majority age is 18, most finish school at year 12 at about 18 years of age and, when they go into the service industry and the retail industry, in particular—which seems to be the main area of focus in this debate—there is minimal knowledge and skill formation or education as part of the employment process. So we are talking chalk and cheese, from the scenario under which junior rates were first established to what we have today. The scenes are completely different.
Senator McGauran mentioned that there had been no technological change in industries such as the retail industry. That is complete nonsense. The Australian retail industry has 
 been the fastest industry of any nation in the world to take up new technology. That is through scanning and EFTPOS. Everyone, whether walking into a supermarket, a department store or the local corner store, is confronted with EFTPOS, scanning and the like today. So to say there has not been major technological change within the retail industry—I can peg when it first started to come in; it was back in 1980—is a complete lack of understanding of what that industry is about.
In the retail industry, the majority of employees—who are juniors—invariably get no more than two to four hours training in their induction. Part of their induction process may even involve something as complex as being shown where the lunch room and the toilets are. However, after that induction program, which on average may last two to four hours but could even last up to a day, one finds that these people are expected to perform at the same standard as a person who has been there for five weeks, five months or five years. That is regardless of that person's age, sex, race, religion or anything else. So the fact that they have been through an induction program and are then out on the floor does not in any way lessen the requirements of their employer—these people have to perform to the same standard.
You will find that the junior is required to do the same as the senior. You will find that that junior is subject to the same threat of dismissal. The fact that they have been through a two- to four-hour induction program and are out working on the floor is of no relevance whatsoever. The juniors are subject to the same abuse from management for alleged non-performance; they are subject to the same threats of dismissal for any measure of non-conformity in their personal outlook; they are subject to the same abuse from a cranky customer as any senior may well be; they are subject to the same dress standards as any senior that might be employed there; and they are subject to the same output standards. Even though employers may refuse to acknowledge publicly that they have such output standards, they do exist. Whether it be scanning rates or carton counts, these people 
 are required to do exactly the same work for less money. The juniors get the same treatment as seniors in all but one respect, and that is in respect of their wage—they are paid less.
If one looks at a typical example of a retail award, one finds that the 21-year-old receives the adult rate, 100 per cent; the 20-year-old receives 90 per cent of the rate; the 19-year-old receives 80 per cent; and the 18-year-old receives 67½ per cent. In today's dollar terms for juniors working full time—and I am quoting now from an actual award that applies throughout Australia with a major retailer—that 21-year-old person receives $463.10; the 20-year-old, $416.80; the 19-year-old, $370.50; and the 18-year-old, $312.60. So the 20-year-old who is doing exactly the same work and facing exactly the same work requirements as the senior gets paid $46.30 less, the 19-year-old gets paid $92.60 less and the 18-year-old gets $150.50 less.
 In terms of full-time employment, this is really about paying people lower rates of pay. The same applies if those people are casual. Junior employment, particularly in the retail industry, has plummeted over the last 25 years. Casual employment dominates the industry. So the argument that junior rates are going to provide some stimulus for full-time employment in industries such as the retail industry is just not true. It has not done so for the last 25 years and to believe that it will do so now is just nonsense. We have here a proposal that effectively will seek to entrench rates of pay which will keep people being paid far and away below what they should legitimately be entitled to be paid. But there is more. These juniors get no discount for their rent, food, electricity, clothes, public transport and a whole wide range of other issues. So the discrimination is compounded, the discrimination is blatant and the inequities are clear.
 In the past some people had difficulties coming to grips with the concept of equal pay for women. At the time we had forecasts of dire consequences as a result of women achieving equal pay. It was a barrier; it was a hurdle that many people had to overcome. However, all the dire consequences that were 
 forecast have not come to be. Women have continued to be employed and, of course, in greater numbers.
 Dire consequences are now being forecast for youth employment with a great amount of hype, a great amount of emotional argument, as if something is being done for young people. But my experience in the retail industry has been that, regardless of the fact that youth wages have been there, the fact remains that retailers set about sacking people when they reach the ripe old age of 17 and 18. It did not just happen for a short period of time during my association with the industry; it happened for the whole time of my association with the industry—and my ongoing association with the industry—that people were sacked simply and solely because they had reached the age of 18. It had nothing to do with their being full-time employees. It was purely and simply because they were casuals, they were disposable and they could be replaced by a new semi-skilled or unskilled work force in next to no time.
What needs to happen is that junior rates need to be put to one side such as to force employers to employ people for the right reasons—that is, to give people a genuine career and not just to be used as dollar cannon fodder. Young people deserve and are entitled to better. This legislation will perpetuate injustice and will see the young people in our society continuing to face a disadvantage which they should not have to face. In the last 25 years, as I have said, full-time employment, particularly in the retail industry in which I have some experience, has fallen quite dramatically. Junior wages did not provide then, nor will they provide now, the basis for full-time, real, meaningful jobs. If that is what this is about—that is, junior wages—then the history of junior wages in the last 25 years certainly does not sustain the contention that it will provide real, meaningful jobs.
The fact is that the structure of the industry has changed. Full-time employment is what is needed. It will provide those people who are unemployed with dignity. However, those people will not achieve it through casual employment. As we have already heard in this 
 debate, large numbers of young people are unemployed. However, those people are not the people being employed in industries such as the retail and service industries because of youth wages. Junior wages are not preventing these people from getting jobs but the structural problems in the industries put in place by employers are. That is a different issue which is certainly not being addressed by this legislation.
The employment practices in many industries, particularly the retail and the service industries, leave many people unemployed or underemployed. As a matter of fact, the retailers have affectionately called the retail industry—this is their terminology—a vestibule industry, because people are in there one day and before you can bat an eyelid they are out of it. So to use the argument that junior rates are necessary to sustain people in careers and to allow people to learn the job is nonsense. These people are turned over faster than you can bat an eyelid.
As Senator Cooney rightfully pointed out, the minister claimed in the second reading speech:
We show that junior wages help young people by giving them a foot in the door into employment.
The only thing I can say about that statement is that it is a revolving door. You are no sooner in the place than you are out. Anyone who does not believe that should go and have a close look at the industry. All the plaintive pleas from the retailers amount to nought.
There is no career based structure and no career based industry. This was one thing that the industry was moving towards some three to five years ago. It was looking at accomplishing genuine careers based on competency based rates of pay so that people could get genuine, meaningful and lasting employment within the industry. But what we have heard from many of the people on the other side in this debate is very much uninformed, unintelligent comment, particularly about the retail industry, of which few of them, if any, have any real knowledge whatsoever.
What is needed is an abolition of the junior rates, but it was never advocated that junior rates would disappear overnight. It was always advocated that there would be a 
 phasing out process and that that would be accompanied by an increase in the career based opportunities and the skills of those people in the industry. To entrench what the government is seeking here tonight is purely, as I said, to put up junior people as dollar cannon fodder for the retail and the service industry labour market. It serves no good and no purpose for the young people of this nation. I am sure and confident that this bill will meet its proper fate this evening.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-08,"—The Australian Greens oppose the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 . We oppose it for all the reasons we gave two years ago when opposing the industrial relations bill and the way in which that worked against the interests of not only workers in general but also young people.
I begin by commenting on Senator MacGibbon's contribution. He first of all referred to the United States situation. He argued that low starting wages for youth have led to millions of young people being placed in jobs. The situation in the United States is that it is low starting wages for everybody across the board. The sort of Hewson $3 an hour basic wage formula that horrified Australians is in place in the United States. The working poor have become a major factor in social disillusionment and social disruption in that country.
In Senator MacGibbon's statement we see that this is the thin end of the wedge and it is going to be followed by further efforts by the government under new industrial relations legislation to minimise wages to people right across the age spectrum. We are seeing a move towards the American situation, which would be intolerable to most Australians and will become much more a debate in this country as new and more draconian industrial relations legislation is brought into this parliament, no doubt during this current period of the Howard government.
Senator MacGibbon also referred to Asia. He said that over there they cannot believe that we have unfair dismissal laws and that we want to get rid of junior wage rates. In response, I cannot believe the social condi 
 tions levied by governments in many parts of Asia and elsewhere around the world either, and I do not think they should be tolerated.
—Only South Korea is worse than us.
—Yes, in this matter. But for Senator MacGibbon to say that employers in that part of the world are tut-tutting about workers' conditions in Australia is, again, to beg the question: do Senator MacGibbon and his government colleagues want Australia to follow the path towards those working conditions which are levied in so many countries to our north which, again, would horrify Australians?
That having been said, I would pause for a moment to speak of the situation that the Democrats have gotten themselves into. Had the Democrats two years ago voted with the Greens in support of Labor's amendments to end discrimination against young people in this country as concerned wages, this situation would not have arisen. But they did not.
From that point on, the argument put forward by those from the Democrats contributing to the debate ran thin. On the one hand, they said that they have had a policy going back years for non-discrimination, but that, on that particular occasion, to get legislation through which was draconian—but less draconian than the government was planning as far as workers in this country are concerned—they had to give up that policy. There is a lesson there to be learnt by some of the younger Democrat members, including Senator Stott Despoja, about real politics.
—She was there.
—About the minister, Senator Murray said this: his word, it seems, is not worth the paper it is written on. There was a lot of negotiation that went on with Mr Reith, you will remember. I can remember Senator Kernot leaving this chamber to go and talk with Senator Reith behind the partition—
—Order! I do not think Mr Reith is a senator.
—with Minister Reith—thank you, Chair—behind the partition when 
 the going got a bit hot during that debate; on that occasion, it was in connection with the secondary boycott legislation. The assurance that came back into the chamber was that if it did not work, if it injured the interests of community groups—including conservation groups and indigenous groups—in this country, they would change the legislation later on. That told the Senate that unsatisfactory legislation, as far as the Democrats were concerned, could be changed in some way or another by future negotiations with the government. That is an obvious nonsense because the Democrats do not have any members in the House of Representatives; there is no way an amendment going through the Senate could alter that legislation, because it would simply die once it got to the House of Representatives.
Senator Stott Despoja, for whom I have great respect, argued strongly for the end of discrimination for young people but then said that the political reality was that, on that occasion, they had to go along with the amendments that had been negotiated between her party and the minister. Senator Stott Despoja said today, `I didn't think he had the audacity to break his word with young people.' Apparently, the Democrats have no corporate memory, and I want to refresh their recollection here and now.
Mr Reith, on the very first day he was elected to the parliament, broke his word with young people right across this country. It was during the occasion of the Flinders by-election in Victoria that Mr Reith was strong on saving the Franklin from being dammed—although the Fraser government was non-interventionist and, effectively, supported the dam. On that occasion, the Democrats had just got legislation through this chamber supporting world heritage status which would have saved the Franklin, although of course they could not get it through the House of Representatives.
In that Flinders by-election the Democrats ran strongly, with 40 per cent of the voters going out of their way to write `no dams' on their ballot papers. Mr Reith was elected by a whisker. When asked on the Sunday after the election what his position on the Franklin 
 dam was, whether he was still in favour of there being no dams, Mr Reith effectively said, `That was 24 hours ago.' His position had changed overnight. There were young people right across this country who had been supporting the position he took during the campaign but did not take afterwards. Moreover, the Democrats, with their high profile in that election, took great umbrage with the Liberal's campaign, which effectively was to say, `After the Democrats, vote for us.' The Franklin dam was the big issue. The Liberals were saying, `After the Democrats, vote for Mr Reith.' But after the election, things changed dramatically.
The Democrats, a party which does not have a corporate memory on a fundamental issue like that, who repeatedly, and quite rightly, talks about its role in the Franklin campaign, will run into trouble repeatedly further down the line and be caught out. On this occasion, the Democrats have been caught out selling out the interests of young Australians. They ought to have taken this issue up to Mr Reith, the minister, two years ago and said, `We will not be letting this opportunity pass to end discrimination against young people in the Australian work force.'
The Democrats, of course, knew that the Greens or the Labor Party would move just such an amendment when the legislation came before the Senate. They were caught in the situation where it was up to any one of them—Senator Murray, Senator Woodley, Senator Stott Despoja—to come out and declare that they would vote against the Kernot-Reith pact by supporting Labor's amendment on that occasion. But they did not do so.
Tonight we are dealing with an amendment from the Democrats which, on the face of it, I would be supporting on behalf of the Greens. Its effect is to delay this legislation until the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has carried out the task which Minister Reith promised he would wait upon before making a decision like that incumbent in this legislation—that is, to see whether there are feasible alternatives to the current discriminatory legislation.
Let me say again to the Democrats that the Industrial Relations Commission are not being asked to adjudicate in their favour. They are being asked to come up with alternatives if they are feasible. There are a lot of ifs and buts in there. Again, I do not see that it is going to come up with a solution to their dilemma as to whether or not they should vote to end discrimination. Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Murray have both beautifully outlined the cases for ending this discrimination. The only thing to be done tonight is not to delay but to end that discrimination by opposing this legislation. It is a very important moment for the Senate to make up for the lost opportunity of 1997. It is an opportunity which we should take now to bring on track the policies of the Greens, the Labor Party, the Democrats and  hopefully Independent Senator Harradine, and we should end this discrimination.
Finally, Senator MacGibbon said that junior wage rates were there at the start of the century; so was hanging and so was the horse and buggy. That is no reason why we should be seeing it through into the next century. I think this is the moment we should choose to make sure that we go into the next century without this discrimination against young Australians.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-08,"—I thank honourable senators for contributing to this debate. As the penultimate speaker, Senator Bob Brown, said, this is an important debate. He was referring to comments by my colleague Senator David MacGibbon about references that Senator MacGibbon made to the comments he had picked up in leading economies in South-East Asia. If Senator Brown were accurate, he would have noted that Senator MacGibbon was careful not to infer or imply that we are looking for a labour market system that is comparable to that in developing countries in the region. He quite clearly said developed nations with living standards higher than Australia's.
—Which countries are they?
—He went on to name them—countries like Japan, for example.
—And where else?
—He picked on Japan and Hong Kong. They were the two that I remember. I think he named a couple of others. So he was very careful there. That is not the point that I am trying to make. The point I am trying to make in thanking honourable senators for their contributions is that this is a very important debate to have. That is where Senator Brown is correct. Senator Brown went on to talk about concepts of the working poor and what an absolute scandal it is in the United States to have people who are earning low rates of pay.
My personal opinion is that it is incredibly patronising to cast judgment upon some low income earner in another country who chooses to work and probably makes a decision that there is more dignity involved in working and still being relatively poor than in being a recipient of the dole or a recipient of welfare benefits. Some people would make the decision that they would rather be working poor. I do regard it as incredibly patronising and snobbish of senators opposite and other commentators in the labour market debate that there is something incredibly wrong—
—Have you got any views on slavery as well?
—Senator Quirke lives in a nice house, he earns a nice wage and he is going to retire on a nice superannuation, but he along with his snobbish Labor mates—
—Can you say anything about this bill?
—I am talking about this very important debate. Senator Jacinta Collins lives in a nice house and will retire on a nice superannuation if she gets to stick here long enough. But there are some people out there who have blue collars in this country who do not mind working on a low income and who probably do not choose to be poor but who would rather be working and poor than not working at all. But people on the other side would rather keep the poor 
 living on government handouts. A lot of people with blue collars do not want to be forced to do that.
There are a lot of young people who would like the chance to hang on to their jobs. Back in 1994 when Laurie Brereton was the minister and writing policies for the previous Keating government, they made a decision that they would ensure that there would be junior wage rates from 1994 to 1997. All of the Labor Party members opposite voted for the provisions in the then industrial relations law to ensure that junior wage rates would be available in this country for young people from 1994 to 1997.
What did the Australian Labor Party say back in 1994 to justify having age discrimination in the law then, Senator Brown? You talk about the hypocrisy coming from the senators who sit to your left, the lack of corporate memory from the Australian Democrats because they could not remember what someone said in the Flinders by-election. What about the hypocrisy of what the Australian Labor Party said back in 1994 when they put the exemption from the discrimination laws in the Industrial Relations Act? They said, `We will leave it in there till 1997.' Senator Murray will remember this because he has followed this debate. `We will leave it there until 1997 and we will hope that someone will come up with a solution to this discrimination problem.' 
What has the Labor Party's incredible policy machine done since 1994—this brains trust, the third way? God help Australia if they ever find the third way. When the Labor Party talk about the third way, there is 3(a), 3(b) or 3(c). You have to listen to either Laurie on one day or Kim, if he ever comes up with an original idea, on another day, or Gareth Evans. He rewrote the entire policy. When I was preparing for this debate I asked what the Australian Labor Party had done to come up with an alternative to junior wage rates. What was your policy at the last election? They did not have one. You hear Senator Hogg opposite saying, `This is a historic chance to get rid of junior wage rates and just see what happens.' That is their policy.
—Oh, rubbish!
—That's their policy—`Let's not come up with an alternative.'
—There was an alternative.
—`Let's have one of these sort of Labor policies.-
—You don't know what you are talking about.
—They came up with a tax policy and then quickly backed off it. Their best policy was to tax four-wheel drives and caviar and then copy the rest of our policy and hope no-one noticed that they were a policy-free zone. Luckily, enough people understood it.
—Can you address the bill?
—That is their policy. They do not have an alternative to junior wage rates.
—Yes, we do.
—Their alternative is to do nothing, to sit there and do what they always do here when they are in opposition and say no. They vote no to everything. They say no to everything. When someone like Mark Latham in the other place comes up with a policy, they say no to that too—`Don't be so bold. You can't come out and publish policies. We are in opposition.'
—Can you address the bill?
—And do you know what Mr Beazley's opposition does, with all his sycophants sitting opposite here?
—Tell us what this bill does.
—Do you know what their policy is? Their policy is to have no policy.
—Do you know what this bill does?
—The honourable senators asks, `Do you know what this bill does?' Mr Acting Deputy President, do you know what this bill does and what they are going to vote no to within a couple of 
 minutes? They are going to say, `No, we don't want junior rates.'
What does the ACTU say? They have got an alternative. At least they have had to put a policy forward. The ACTU put forward a policy the other day. Back in February they put forward a submission to the junior rates inquiry, and what they have said is, `We will ensure everyone over 18 has an adult wage.' I presume that senators opposite back the ACTU submission. John Quirke—Senator Quirke—is at least behind it. So he wants to say to all of those 18-year-olds out there on junior rates that if this were accepted and this became policy in Australia all their wages would be put up.
—You don't know what you are talking about.
—That is Senator Quirke to you.
—I did say Senator John Quirke. You were not listening, Senator Quirke. And that is what they would have done.
—Who are `they'?
—The Australian Labor Party. Senator Hogg says, `Let it rip.' They say, `We will replace the junior rates environment with a nothing environment. We will replace it with a Labor policy blackout, a policy vacuum.' That is the Labor Party's policy. They have no policy. They just want to say no to everything. They will vote no to this. They will vote no to the Telstra sale. They will vote no to a new tax system. In fact, they will vote no to anything that has got a hope of improving the employment prospects of Australia. They want to see Australia stuck in the double-digit unemployment that was the mark of their 13 years in power. They like, for some reason, to have double-digit unemployment rates—
—You are being childish now.
—double-digit interest rates and double-digit inflation rates. They tried for 13 years to implement some policies. The policies were an unmitigated disaster. They created the highest interest 
 rates this country has seen since the 1930s over a sustained period.
—They were higher when you were in government.
—Order! Senator Collins.
—They flicked up for a short period under the Fraser government, but these guys were able to keep unemployment—
—Oh! Just a short period.
—Order! Senator Collins, you have persistently and repeatedly interjected during this debate. I take it that generally vigorous debate is appropriate for the chamber and an occasional interjection is tolerated, but a continual barrage of interjection I regard as unparliamentary.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The honourable senator opposite who has just been called to order did make a long and rambling speech of nearly 20 minutes in duration. I sat here and listened very carefully to see if she could come up with an argument for tossing tens of thousands of young Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap by pricing them out of the labour market, and there was not an argument. So it is very hard to respond to whatever she had to contribute to the debate. But I do appreciate your calling her to order and asking her to allow the debate to be conducted in a sensible manner.
—This is not a debate. You are not even addressing the bill.
—Order! Senator Collins.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, if you had the policies of the Australian Labor Party and of the honourable senator opposite whom you have just called to order, you would not have had waterfront reform in this country. What they promote is a society where nothing changes—it is back to the 1950s. They want a waterfront where the ships would come in and hang around for days. You would get a crane to 
 move every now and again. If you were lucky you would get a container in and out. We all remember those days. Mr Acting Deputy President, you must remember all the ships lined up off Adelaide in the Gulf of St Vincent—you would look out to sea and all you would see is ships at anchor out there, waiting to come in, waiting to get the containers moved.
And, of course, the Labor Party said, `That is the sort of Australia we like.' The Australian Labor Party are like that. Do you know why? Some people do wonder why the Australian Labor Party is the party of the status quo, the quaint naive party that says, `As long as the unions have got a stranglehold on the work force, we don't want any change in workplace relations.' The sad thing for the unemployed in Australia is that the unemployed do not have a strong union representing them, because they are the one part of the work force that misses out under Labor.
As Senator MacGibbon pointed out, here is a government that has said, `If you want to get the country going, if you want to expand the economic capability, if you want to see Australia be a success and see everyone who wants a job get a job, then you can't put up with a waterfront that is controlled by the Maritime Union and that ensures that the crane rates are half what they should be.' And Labor said, `We like that. We like having twice the number of people we should have on the waterfront moving the cranes, moving the containers, at half the rate they should move at'—twice the number of people and half the number of containers, and that is what Senator Jacinta Collins and Senator Quirke opposite want.
—And running extortion rackets.
—I think we will have that withdrawn, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Are you raising a point of order?
—I am raising a point of order. I believe the honourable senator said that we in the Labor Party are into extortion. I believe that is a criminal offence in this 
 country, and I ask that the senator withdraw that remark.
—I made no such comment, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I will leave it up to your best judgment. What I said was—
—You are a liar!
—Order! Senator Collins, withdraw.
—I will withdraw if in fact the Hansard  record demonstrates that the senator did not make that remark. I believe that the record will show that he did.
—Senator Collins, I was allowing Senator McGauran to give his response to the point of order, and it was not for you—
—I said I will withdraw my remark if the record shows that the senator did not make the remark which he denies.
—You will withdraw unqualifiedly, Senator Collins.
—I will withdraw unqualifiedly, but I would like to refer to the record on this matter.
—You may refer to the record, Senator Collins, that is your privilege. Senator McGauran, you were speaking to the point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, my comment was directed towards the Maritime Union—not those opposite in the chamber but towards the union—that they were running extortion rackets.
—I accept the veracity of your explanation, Senator McGauran. There is therefore no point of order.
—I was actually accusing members opposite—and I would be very happy for them to take a point of order on this—of supporting the status quo on the waterfront. They, for some perverse—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, we will take him up on that offer. There is a point of order here. We are debat 
 ing—even though I think it has escaped the present debater—the bill before us. It has nothing to do with waterfront reform, the MUA or all the rest of it that has gone on for the last four or five minutes.
—Senator, there is no point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I ask that you call the senator to order on the matter of imputing to me a position that I do not support waterfront reform. I would challenge him to find any factual basis for that allegation.
—Senator Collins, that is not a point of order; that is a point of debate.
—Senators opposite in the Labor Party were opposed to the reforms that Peter Reith, the minister for industrial relations, put in place on the Australian waterfront during 1998. I think the minister and this government will be judged very positively for those reforms. We have seen the biggest jump in productivity in the history of the Australian waterfront and a reduction in the work force needed to increase the crane rate at which Australia's produce and goods are transported across the waterfront. Of course, we are an island nation that requires an efficient waterfront. It was one of the most significant reforms in the industrial relations area in the history of Australia. The press, the television cameras, the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party put all sorts of floss and gloss on it. I am sure that Minister Reith and the leadership at Corrigans would have preferred that the public relations surrounding the exercise had been more conducive to our point of view. But the cold reality of course—
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Are you telling me that this is relevant to this bill? Because if it is, I reckon you could get away with anything in here.
—There is no point of order. This is workplace relations legislation. The parliamentary secretary is addressing issues that are relevant to 
 jobs and employment, so I believe his comments have relevance. But I remind the parliamentary secretary that it is important to remain relevant to the matter under debate.
—Thank you.
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will remain strictly relevant to a workplace relations debate as it relates to employment in Australia. We are talking about a vote that is about to take place in this Senate. The Labor Party have informed me they will be voting against it. The Democrats have proposed an amendment which will seek to have this legislation halted within a couple of minutes in this chamber. We are talking about the prospects of employment for tens of thousands of young Australians.
I led this debate, I thought, in a very succinct way. I am not arguing the point of order here—I am saying why this is so relevant. Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you understand the relevance of this but I can understand that senators opposite do not see it as relevant. At times I think they question the control that the union movement has over their organisation. I know that some in the Australian Labor Party are doing that, that some are saying, like Tony Blair said a couple of years ago, that you cannot have faceless men or women having control of a political party and getting away with it.
—This is a new one. Who are the faceless women?
—There are lots of very successful women trade unionists and that is a great thing for Australia—a fantastic thing. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, this debate is all about jobs in Australia. If you stick with the Labor Party's policy on the waterfront which is to say, `Let's stay in the 1950s on the waterfront,' then you will cost younger people and older people jobs. We now have a more efficient waterfront and it could be argued—and I will do so—that there are probably thousands more people in employment as a direct result of Mr Reith's and this government's reforms on the waterfront in 1998 than there would have been if those reforms had not been put in place.
Mr Acting Deputy President, the Labor Party's position is that they are about to vote this down. They are making a decision to protect the unionised workers who elect them against the interests of unemployed young people. This legislation will give young people a chance. The Labor Party are standing up, as they do so often in the Senate, with a lollipop stick that has a great big stop sign on it. It is the same one that they have at the gates of the construction sites around Australia saying `Stop'. They are saying, `Stop. We don't want any change in this place. We want to be stuck in the 1950s and the 1960s. We do not want to give young Australians a chance.'
The Democrats are not as bad as that. Their attitude is to hang on, to wait and see. They use the other side of the sign. They have turned it around and it says `Go Slow'. Senator Murray, you have got the lollipop stick saying `Let's just go a bit slow'. Senator Quirke, Senator Collins, good old Senator Peter Cook with his trade union background and good old Kim Beazley are standing up there in front of the Australian people saying, `Hang on. Let's not change a thing. No reform legislation will get through the Senate. Just stop right there.' Mr Acting Deputy President, that is what they are saying and that is what the Australian people are sick of. It is time for some change. It is time for some reform. But for the old Labor Party, this is not the Third Way—this is just no way.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendment (Senator Murray's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH EMPLOYMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-08,"—The Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  reintroduces the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997, which lapsed without amendment when the previous parliament was dissolved. The bill forms part of the government's policy to open the Commonwealth's litigation services to the private sector and to private sector competition, applying the principles of competitive neutrality. The bill establishes the Australian Government Solicitor as a government business enterprise and establishes a mechanism whereby the Attorney-General can issue legal service directions to service providers as to the conduct of Commonwealth litigation.
In government, Labor opened up various other Commonwealth legal services to competition, but Commonwealth litigation services were not opened up to competition, subject to ongoing public interest assessment. The principles of competitive neutrality do not currently apply to the AGS. Labor previously opposed the enactment of this bill on three grounds—namely, that the government's overall policy failed to: one, acknowledge the likely increase in the cost of Commonwealth legal services arising from the enactment of the bill, particularly the application of competitive neutrality principles to the Australian 
 Government Solicitor; two, provide adequate resources for the new market regulator, the Office of Legal Services Coordination; and, three, provide transitional arrangements for staff who could be removed from their conditions and entitlements under the Public Service Act 1922 and moved onto public sector employment conditions. This opposition still remains.
We are concerned about the cost on Commonwealth legal services. While considerable market competition can be expected if the Commonwealth's litigation services are opened up to competition, it is expected that the price paid for acquiring those services will, in fact, rise. This is because the AGS, in terms of both its current taxation liability and employment terms and conditions, is highly price competitive. It is widely recognised that most private sector legal service providers are loss-leading in order to acquire market share in the wider Commonwealth legal services market.
A review of the AGS found that the effect of the application of competitive neutrality would increase the AGS's costs by some $5.154 million per year. These costs principally consist of sales tax, stamp duties on expense, leases and depreciable assets, payroll tax, financial institutions duty and professional indemnity insurance. The AGS will also be expected to contribute a dividend on investment similar to those expected from private sector service providers. This dividend will be set by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance and Administration and is expected to be in the order of some $5 million a year. Some of these costs are, of course, hidden within the current arrangements for the AGS and, as such, represent forgone income on the part of the Commonwealth, particularly those federal taxes and the target dividend. However, state taxes and the cost of financing the additional risk associated with and arising from the fixed nature of the target dividend would increase the cost structure of the AGS.
The most significant saving to the AGS results from the current use of public service terms and conditions. This, however, also decreases the ability of the AGS to attract suitable staff. While this is an ongoing con 
 cern for the AGS, there is no evidence as yet that the quality of, or the client satisfaction with, the AGS's output has, in fact, been affected. During Senate estimates it was revealed that the new AGS would no longer employ persons under the terms and conditions of the Public Service Act. The loss of many of these terms and conditions are, of course, of major concern to many AGS employees. Interestingly, however, some staff will receive substantially higher salaries as a result of this change, particularly those employed at partner levels. For such persons, private sector market forces are likely to drive up their salaries from current SES levels to amounts approaching $250,000 a year or more. Such people will also be eligible for fringe benefits and a range of benefits currently applying to private law firms.
If private sector terms and conditions are implemented, there will be an inevitable increase in the cost of the Commonwealth providing legal services, as prices generally paid within the Commonwealth legal services market then rise. As I said earlier, we are concerned that other staff, particularly junior staff, will have to cop cuts in their terms and conditions. It is a concern that we had in the previous parliament. It is a concern that we have in this parliament as well.
We are concerned with the significant transitional costs associated with the government's policy. They could range from some $20.3 million to $29.8 million across items such as systems and communications costs, policy work functions, AGS establishment costs, staffing costs, termination of leases and so on. As a result, any financial return to the Commonwealth will have to defray these costs. Accordingly, our concern is that this will lead to increases in fees charged by the AGS.
In terms of fee increases, a Senate estimates committee was told just a couple of weeks ago that there had been an increase in fees charged for AGS services already, by some five per cent in September last year. These increases reflected in part the increased costs to the AGS of meeting the competitive neutrality principles. It was also of concern to us at that estimates hearing that the AGS could 
 not give any commitment that its prices would not rise in the near future.
Private firms which the Labor Party has spoken to have also admitted that they would be likely to take advantage of an increase in the fees charged by the AGS and likewise increase their fees. As a result, as I said earlier, we are concerned that there are cost pressures in the system—pressures that either are transitional or relate to matters I have already mentioned. This will essentially mean that the savings the government anticipates could be illusory and the cost increases of the AGS could be reflected in increased costs to government.
We are also concerned in respect of legal service directions. As I mentioned earlier, the government's policy has recognised that there is a considerable public interest in the Attorney-General retaining some control over the conduct of litigation services to the Commonwealth. The good name of the Commonwealth could quite often be degraded if even some lawyers were to conduct sharp practices in the Commonwealth's name. To this end the Commonwealth has introduced a complex system of directives that the Attorney can issue for litigation matters generally and in relation to specific cases. These directives would be enforceable by contractual remedies only and would, of course, be subject to breaches of the directives coming to the Attorney's attention.
This is a wide ranging task. It is a task which covers the breadth of government. The office established to perform such a task was originally staffed by only three people. Given that the Commonwealth manages some 15,000 pieces of litigation per year, it was and continues to be our concern that this function could not be adequately performed with the resources allocated. Now the government has said that it will apply six staff to this function. However, it is fair to say that our concerns are real and they still remain in respect of administration of the directions under this part of the government's proposal.
Our concern is also heightened by the fact that the office is also expected to coordinate Commonwealth legal services to ensure consistency of advice. In essence, model 
 litigant rules will become meaningless if there is inadequate means to enforce them. Our firm opinion is that the resources applied by government to this particular task will mean inadequate resourcing.
As I said earlier, the Public Service terms and conditions are of concern to us. While the AGS must have greater flexibility in its future staffing arrangements, this should not be done at the expense of the rights of employees. All current AGS staff must have the right to retain employment with the APS or to an adequate redundancy package if they do not wish to be employed by the new AGS. So we will be moving amendments in the committee stage to protect these terms and conditions. The amendments will give the AGS employees the option of electing to retain their current APS terms and conditions. The government is looking only upward in terms of flexibility as to terms and conditions and it should have no problem supporting these amendments.
In conclusion, can I say that, given the very real interest in the Commonwealth's retaining control over the government related litigation services, we believe that the model proposed by the government does not adequately protect that public interest. Accordingly, we submit that, firstly, the bill should be opposed unless the government does agree to provide an independent mechanism to review the impact of the reforms and to recommend the supplementation of departmental and agency resources to take into account the increase in the price to be paid for legal services. Secondly, we believe the government should agree to increase the resources of the Office of Legal Services Coordination to ensure it can meet the full range of functions intended for it. Thirdly, we believe the government should provide appropriate transitional arrangements for the staff of the AGS.
We have approached the Attorney and his office over some period of time with these concerns—some couple of years now. We have also sought to raise these concerns with the government through third parties which have an interest in seeing the bill passed. As of the current date, unfortunately the government and the Attorney have shown little 
 interest in responding to these concerns. We have to ask ourselves whether the government is really committed to this policy or whether it is grandstanding for some of its big corporate mates. We do want to see this issue resolved. As I said, we will be moving amendments to try to target the three most immediate and pressing concerns that we have in respect of this legislation. I indicate now that, at the appropriate time, I will be moving the amendments circulated in my name.",SENATE,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-03-08,"—As Senator Bolkus has said, the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  is directed at placing the Australian Government Solicitor on a basis that it has been moving towards, I suppose, for some time now—that is, on the basis of being a separate legal entity, a little like the private enterprise firms. When I say `a little like' I mean that advisedly because the Australian Government Solicitor now has to go into competition with private firms, some of very big size indeed.
The work they go into competition for is very much government work. They cannot go into competition for work outside the government or the semi-government sector. This means that the firms that they are going to be contesting against have available to them a very wide range of work indeed—not only government work but non-government work, the work that they have been pursuing for years. That gives them economy of scale. It gives them economy of personnel, if you like, because they can have personnel in all fields of law and they can employ that personnel in all sorts of places amongst all sorts of clients whereas the Australian Government Solicitor is going to be confined very closely indeed. It seems to me that it is a misnomer to say that is competition. It is certainly not fair competition in any event. I want to come to that again a little later, but there is one other matter I want to deal with before I come to that. Under part VIIIC of this bill the Attorney-General may issue directions. Proposed section 55ZF, `Attorney-General may issue directions', says:
(1) 	 The Attorney-General may issue directions (Legal Services Directions ): 

	 (a)	 that are to apply generally to Commonwealth legal work; or
	 (b)	 that are to apply to Commonwealth legal work being performed, or to be performed, in relation to a particular matter.
And it goes on. But the issue I want to raise is whether or not those directions should be disallowable instruments. The attorney has said that, insofar as they are legislative in nature, they should be disallowable. He has had some correspondence with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and, as usual, has been very frank and very full in his explanation to that committee. While I am on my feet in this matter, I should perhaps note that, as far as the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is concerned, the Attorney-General has been always very prompt in his answers and very forthcoming.
On this occasion, he says yes, if these directions are of a proper nature, they should be disallowable, but the problem is that at the moment there is no way by which they can be made disallowable because we really need to have the legislative instruments bill made into an act before we can take a proper course with such directions as the Attorney-General makes which are appropriate to be disallowed. It would be proper, I think, not to bring this part of this legislation in until the legislative instruments bill is made into an act or, pending that, until some amendment has been made to the Acts Interpretation Act.
No doubt all this sounds very technical, but it does raise issues of some importance. The importance is that parliament should not be blocked out from its duty and its function of looking at subordinate legislation that it should look at and it should not be stopped from scrutinising the executive when that is appropriate. As the legislation now stands, together with the statutes that are in operation, a gap will be left in the ability of parliament to carry out its function if this legislation goes through and the legislative instruments bill does not and while there is no amendment to other legislation. So the position is that the Attorney agrees, `Yes, in certain circumstances these directions I give should be disallowed. Yes, there is no legislation presently in operation which would allow that to happen but, nevertheless, the bill should go on.' 
I now want to return to the issue of the Australian Government Solicitor. I notice it is almost 10 to 10, but perhaps I can read this bit from the second reading speech and then make some comments on it. It states:
The bill—
that is, the Judiciary Amendment Bill—
will establish the Australian Government Solicitor, the AGS, as a statutory corporation that will operate as a government business enterprises. It will strengthen the position of the AGS in the market for Commonwealth legal work with private sector law firms.
I have already said something about this, but this is another example of a very topsy-turvy approach to how services ought to be provided—a very strange approach, may I say, to getting good service from the Australian Government Solicitor. That has been with the Attorney-General's Department over the years that I have known it and has been a most distinguished body. It has been run by distinguished secretaries and been staffed by distinguished people.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-03-08,"—I rise this evening to remind the Senate of the ongoing situation at the Gordonstone mine, near Emerald in Central Queensland. The Gordonstone picket line is now into its 17th month, making this the longest ever picket in Australian coalmining history.
The conflict stems from the unfair dismissal of 312 miners by the multinational giant Arco back in October 1997. In February 1998, the AIRC ordered Arco to compensate for the unfair dismissals, additionally instructing the company to give preference to former workers in the recruiting of their new work force. Having failed to de-unionise Gordonstone, Arco packed up and left, selling out to another multinational giant, Rio Tinto.
In December, Rio Tinto commenced recruitment for Gordonstone in secret, employing 23 
 workers under a non-union agreement. The agreement overrides all existing obligations of any employer at the Gordonstone mine and was ratified on 2 February. The AIRC has no discretion when ratifying agreements under coalition legislation and union submissions were not even allowed at the hearing. Rio Tinto had intended to employ up to 200 workers under this new certified agreement.
Workers who had fought for 17 long months to try to regain their jobs were not about to take this latest attack lying down. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union went to the Federal Court in a bid to have Rio Tinto joined as a party to the proceedings being brought against the former owners, Arco. This would compel Rio Tinto to employ the workers unfairly dismissed back in 1997. The continuing dispute will come before the Federal Court in April.
As the industrial dispute at Gordonstone continues, I think it is of the utmost importance that we do not forget about the personal situations of the sacked workers. These are people who had worked hard for Arco and were rewarded with nothing but unfair dismissal for their service. There was never any evidence that these workers had been lazy or unproductive; on the contrary, they were among the most productive by international standards. Just months before their dismissal, Arco had erected a statue to the Gordonstone miners describing them as `the best miners in the world' after they had broken a succession of international production records. These were undoubtedly hardworking people. Suddenly, in October 1997, they were sacked en masse, and just before Christmas.
Since the closure of Gordonstone, the town of Emerald has experienced considerable economic and social upheaval. In a recent interview with the Courier-Mail, Emerald Chamber of Commerce president, Tony Webster, spoke of the impact the dismissals have had on local businesses. Mr Webster said that many businesses were struggling and more had actually sold up and moved on as a direct result of the ongoing dispute. Since October 1997, Emerald's population has declined from around 10,500 to 8,500 people. Those who have been able to secure work 
 elsewhere have done so, but many former Arco workers remain in Emerald and are suffering severe financial hardship. These people have maintained the picket line as they continue to fight for the jobs that were unfairly taken from them.
The Courier-Mail article of 22 February also outlined the considerable emotional distress suffered by the dismissed workers and their families during their 17-month ordeal. In the article, local Salvation Army Captain Stephen Metcher spoke of a number of attempted suicides by former Gordonstone miners and their children. These people are not rabblerousers. They are people who just want a fair go after having been unfairly sacked by their employer. They do not want more money or better conditions; they just want to go back to their jobs the way they were before.
Now Rio Tinto has sought to capitalise on their weakened condition after such a long dispute by seeking to implement a non-union agreement with substandard conditions. This multinational has sought to divide the community by offering an unfair agreement to individuals who are desperate to go back to work. It has replaced decent working people with scabs, it is as simple as that. Rio Tinto has a ready-made work force at its disposal in the form of the dismissed workers. Instead of getting on with the job at hand, it has sought to crush the union by instituting enterprise agreements that undermine prevailing standards and conditions. It has effectively put the boot into the workers after Arco already had them down. This government has abandoned the people of Emerald in favour of multinational corporations.
—What? The Beattie government?
—No, your government. The decisions of the AIRC were disregarded by Arco, who blatantly refused to re-employ the dismissed workers when the commission instructed them to do so. Now Rio Tinto is showing a similar flagrant disregard for Australian industrial relations provisions. The AIRC has the authority under Australian law to determine the outcome of such disputes, and our government should not condone the 
 actions of foreigners who seek to undermine that authority. However, we currently have a government that actually seeks to do away with the AIRC altogether. Who is to defend the rights of Australian workers if this government is determined to undermine the authority of the AIRC and take the side of multinational business interests?
This government has even sought to crush the union that has provided workers with their strongest support. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 February outlined secret government plans to undermine the CFMEU. Employers who fall foul of the CFMEU will receive extra time to complete government projects, according to a leaked document from the defence minister, Mr Moore. The article claimed the leaked document was `a further indication of the government's determination to reduce the CFMEU's power'. Without the AIRC and unions, workers would be left at the mercy of these multinational corporations which have no regard for their employees and their families. This is supposed to be a government democratically elected to represent the Australian people. It could more accurately be described as being representative of the interests of big business and big money as far as industrial relations are concerned.
On Saturday, 27 February, I attended a huge march and rally with the Gordonstone miners in Emerald. Over 1,000 people were in attendance at Emerald to offer their support to the miners and their families. Speeches mingled with the laughter of children at play nearby as the traditional Aussie Saturday afternoon barbecue got under way. That is what this dispute is really about—families. The miners have received constant support from their wives and children, who have also had to endure this long running stand-off with the foreign multinationals. These people are fighting to secure a livelihood for their families and that is what it all comes down to. The multinationals will always want to make more money, but all the Gordonstone miners want is a fair go for their families. I think it is a disgrace that a democratically elected government has left them to make this stand alone. 
In conclusion, I would just like to say that, even though a lot of the miners have moved on and work in other areas, those who are left on the picket line have told me that, because of their involvement in the mining industry and the union, they are black-listed by other mine owners. They are totally black-listed because they are seen as agitators when they are merely there in a peaceful picket.
One guy said to me, `I might never work again. If I go and look for a job in another mine, my resume says I have worked seven years in the mining industry, but I might as well put on my resume that I have been in gaol for seven years.' An employer may say, `Okay, I will give you a go,' but they will not give him a go because he has been working at Gordonstone and has been active in supporting himself, his family and his fellow workmates.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Gordonstone Coalmine</title>,Adjournment,27,1
