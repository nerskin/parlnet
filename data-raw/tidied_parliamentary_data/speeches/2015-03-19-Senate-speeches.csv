Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Today this Australian Senate is presented with an opportunity to debate and vote for the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. I know that many Australians, including up to one million voters nationwide, are influenced by how this government treats our Australian Defence Force and veterans' families and will be interested in the contributions from senators in this chamber. This is simple private member's legislation I had drafted before Christmas which links pay for members of the Australian Defence Force with pay for Australian parliamentarians or to the consumer price index, whichever is higher. 


The need for this legislation became obvious after this Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Abbott, announced a change in pay rates for members of our Army, Navy and RAAF which was in fact a pay cut after our nation's inflation rate was taken into consideration. It became clear to all fair-minded Australians that the system of determining wage rises for our diggers was broken and had to be fixed. The Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 will fix the broken system which determines the amount of pay that members of our Army, Navy and RAAF are awarded.


This simple piece of legislation, if agreed to by the majority of senators in this chamber, will give members of our Australian Defence Force certainty and a guarantee that they will receive a fair pay increase, because this bill puts in place a minimum pay rise which at the very least keeps track with the consumer price index or politicians' pay increase, whichever is higher. Of course, the bill also leaves open the opportunity for politicians and their public servants to ensure that our Defence families receive pay rises greater than current CPI rates or the rates of pay increases for politicians. I was tempted to put in this bill a legislative mechanism that would ensure that our diggers received a pay rise greater than the CPI rate of the day or greater than the current rate of pay increase for politicians. However, I chose to be prudent and more than reasonable given the fiscal restraint all Australians are now being asked to show.


In short, this bill is reasonable and measured. It does not have any provisions that are excessive. If you believe that Australian Defence Force members deserve a fair go when it comes to calculating their wages then my private member's bill will be very difficult to vote against. There may be some from the government who, for mischievous reasons, may want to confuse the debate. They could say: 'The latest national CPI rate is 1.7 per cent and the government has agreed to a two per cent pay rise. Won't that mean we are voting for a pay cut for our military?' Of course, that assertion would be absolute rubbish. This legislation is flexible enough to allow the government of the day to increase Australian Defence pay by however much they want to. If the government wanted to decrease the pay then it would be the government's responsibility, not the legislation's fault.


The legislation is simple and puts in place a safety net which, we have seen from past governments, is desperately needed. At the moment, Australia is governed by mean-spirited leaders who regularly need to be exposed to the heat of a near-death political experience in order to melt the ice frozen to their hearts and the wax built up in their ears. Unfortunately for voiceless members of the Australian Defence Force, doing the right thing does not come easy for our nation's leaders. So that is why this private member's legislation is so important: it is to keep the bastards wearing blue ties honest.


There would be some members of the Senate opposite me who may have forgotten exactly when the 1.5 per cent pay offer, the effective pay cut for our military, was announced by the Abbott government. I remind those members that it was the day before last year's Melbourne Cup Day. Of course, the choice of this day was deliberate. It showed that the Abbott government knew that they were being dishonest and doing the wrong thing by our diggers. It was proof that the Abbott government hoped that the extraordinary media attention devoted to the race that stops the nation would cover up a government decision which shamed a nation.


Thankfully, support from ordinary Australians spontaneously emerged. My office was bombarded with emails from Tasmanians and other states expressing their disgust at Mr Abbott and his Liberal members and the lack of support for our diggers. This government underestimated the love and respect that our nation has for the members of our Australian Defence Force, 365 days a year—not just the few days of the year that some members of the Abbott government fake affection for our diggers and their families.


Following the news of the Liberal Party cut to members of the Australian Defence Force, I appreciated that fact that Labor leader Bill Shorten wrote to the Prime Minister Abbott and asked him to reconsider the pay offer. I also appreciate the fact that Labor have indicated that they will support this legislation today, along with the Greens and many of my crossbench colleagues. So I sincerely thank them in advance.


In recent days and after a stunning electoral defeat in Queensland which was partly influenced by voters in a few key areas like Townsville and Brisbane—where there are high numbers of Australian Defence Force personnel, their supporters and their families—and pressure from their Liberal colleagues in New South Wales fearing a similar fate, this Abbott government belatedly chose to offer a further rise in our Australian Defence Force pay. This is my message to Prime Minister Abbott following his Defence Force pay backdown. It is relevant to today's debate on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 and touches on some of the broader defence issues:


Dear Prime Minister,


I note your decision on Wednesday 4th of March to ask the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) to take a proposed pay increase of only .5% to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, making for a total ADF pay rise of 2%.


In 2000 the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF)— the person you have just asked to increase ordinary diggers pay by .5%--received $305K p/a. The latest figures show that CDF in 2014 took home $764K.


That means the person you have just asked to increase ordinary Diggers pay by .5%—in the last 14 years, own pay increased by almost $460K or 250%. Apart from the obvious embarrassment and humiliation you're subjecting the CDF to, isn't this just another indicator that the system for determining our Diggers pay is broken?


While you attempt to justify this less than fair pay rise, by comparing it to the current inflation rate of 1.7% - I remind you that the core inflation rate is 2.1% and current weighted median Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate is 2.3%.


I also remind you that Parliamentary Library background research I commissioned reveals that the average yearly rise in Defence Pays over the last ten years is approximately 3%.


This stands in stark contrast with the average yearly rise in politician's pay, which since 2004 and taking into account the last two years of 0% pay rise, is still almost 7%.


I'm sure that you would agree, that our Diggers, particularly of the last decade and half, have earnt a pay rise equal to that of our politicians.


So therefore I respectfully ask that you reconsider your pay offer to members of Australia's Defence Force.


It's my view that in making your decision to increase defence pay, you should consider all the facts. If you do so there is a very strong case to:


1. Strengthen the ADF pay increase by .5% to an annual rate of 2.5%, rather than 2%.


2. Ensure that all ADF members receive back pay calculated from the 4th of November 2014 or Melbourne Cup Day (the day after their effective pay cut was sneakily announced by your government)


3. Restore ADF Combat Pay or War Zone Allowance back to $200 per day instead of the reduced $150 per day allowance.


I request that you agree to a meeting to discuss these three important issues.


During that meeting I would also like to receive from you a guarantee that Diggers who have served for 20 years, and are therefore covered by multiple compensation acts, and who are now re-deployed to Iraq - are not (because of a bureaucratic provision called offsetting) at a disadvantage compared with younger diggers, if they are injured.


I've been reliably informed that veteran Australian Diggers who have served previously in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq - and who have recently been redeployed to Iraq, compared with younger Diggers covered by only one compensation act - can receive compensation payments up to 10 times less, should they be injured during this new deployment.


It's my view that if you properly consider these four issues, you can only come to the conclusion that members of our Defence Force are not being fairly paid or compensated. I would hope that our meeting would find a resolution to these important matters.




Making our own position safe at home.



While I believe that we both share common feelings about Islamic State and the great evil they have brought to this world - I strongly disagree with your decision to send members of our ADF to Iraq in response to their attacks.


Forcing Australian Tax payers to pay for Australian Troops to be sent back into harms way in Iraq, given that America has only deployed about 3000 troops, is not a wise decision.


At best it will be a ""flag flying"" exercise. At worst we run the risk of supposedly friendly Iraqi troops betraying our Diggers and killing them - or handing them over to Islamic state forces who will use them to make further horrific online videos.


I believe that a prudent response to the threat Australia faces from Islamic state is to dramatically increase the size and capability of the Australian Defence force and that we should make our own country safe, before we try and make countries like Iraq, Syria, Lybia and North Africa safe from Islamic state fanatics and death cult members.


In advocating for that course of action, I draw your attention to the war-time experience of Prime Minister John Curtin, as described by Bob Wurth in his book ""1942"".


You will recall that following the Japanese Air Raids in February 1942 on Darwin, which killed 243 people and wounded more than 400 Australians, Prime Minister John Curtin received a cable which said that Churchill, acting with out Curtin's authority had already diverted Australian ""troop ships to Burma""- leaving our Nation more vulnerable to Japanese attack.


John Curtin is then reported to have told his friend the biographer Lloyd Ross: ""its the proper fate of a country which has not built up its own defences. The proper fate of a country which always fights someone else's war, without making its own position safe.""


Its my view that as a Nation we're now making the same mistake that Prime Minister Curtain spoke about at the beginning of WW2, namely that, ""We're being be drawn into a war and fighting someone else's battles, without making our own position safe at home.""


We need to address this problem in an honest manner—and start with a critical look at the numbers and capacity of our ADF.




Too few members of our ADF and combat troops on anti-psychotic medication



Our shocking Veterans' suicide and homeless rates which your government continues to cover up - is a direct result of successive Australian Governments asking too few members of our ADF to shoulder the burden of prolonged commitments in the Middle East war zones.


It's my view that many younger veterans who take their lives or end up homeless, will have spent 3 plus years or more in the War Zone in the space of a decade. This prompts the question:


What is the maximum period of time a combat troop can serve in a War Zone, before they are guaranteed to suffer psychological harm?


Some young veterans I have meet have in 13 or more years of service completed 10 combat deployments or tours of duty in war zones.


And while you can't criticize the commitment and love that these young men and women have for Australia, you can criticize the politicians and high ranking members of the ADF who know that we didn't - and still don't, have enough full time members of our military to safely commit our Nation to prolonged military engagements in Middle East war zones.


Senior ADF medical officers have personally confirmed to me that ADF members are allowed to enter War Zones armed, while officially receiving anti-psychotic medication.


Surely these well known facts would lead any reasonable person to come to the conclusion that we don't have a large enough permanent defence force?


And that to meet the threat posed to western civilization by Islamic maniacs who want to drag us back into the dark ages, then its time to dramatically increase the numbers and capacity of our ADF.


We could begin the process of boosting the numbers of our defence force by re-introducing a National Service Trade and Traineeship program. This would not only boost the capacity of our ADF but it would also address the dual problems of youth unemployment and national skills shortage.




Closing - Important Veterans
'
 Questions



In closing, I have been contacted by older veterans with strong connections to our serving ADF members being deployed to the Middle East.


They have requested that I ask you these confronting but relevant questions in relation to the Australian Soldiers preparing and being sent to train and assist Iraqi troops:


1. Do they receive the same combat pay or war zone allowance as the initial cohort of soldiers redeployed to Iraq?


2. Have they received instructions to the effect that: ""whatever you do save your last bullet for yourself, don't get captured""?


3. If these soldiers are being deployed armed and warned not to get captured – can you explain why they have been denied the benefits associated with full war like service - and full combat pay and allowances?


4. Has the Australian government deployed these ADF personnel using diplomatic type passports? If so, can you explain why?


5. Are they being warned to discretely advise their families in Australia to be on the lookout for, or vigilant against Islamic state supporters who may be gathering intelligence for future terrorist attacks?


6. If not, why not?


7. Are ADF personnel on Australian Military bases authorized to use their weapons to defend themselves when or if, they are attacked by terrorists?


8 If so, can you describe the chain of command and name who is responsible for authorizing our ADF personnel to arm themselves and use lethal force to defend themselves and others against terrorists attacks?


9. In relation to armed ADF members being authorized to use lethal force, in an emergency or terrorist attack, how long does their lethal force authorization last?


While I will also officially submit these questions as QON, I would appreciate if you provided answers as soon as possible and before the 30 day deadline.


Today I have tried to ask some of the important questions and described some the enormous and deadly challenges faced by serving and former members of our Defence Force. The job before them is one of the most complex, important and hardest that our nation not asks but demands of it citizens. To do the job of a sailor, soldier or member of the Royal Australian Air Force requires extreme courage, dedication, discipline, perseverance, love and loyalty to our country. The least we can do as law-makers is to ensure that they receive a fair day's pay for their extraordinary, unique service to this country. I commend this bill to the house.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. To be frank, I am somewhat surprised that this private senator's bill has not been withdrawn, notwithstanding Senator Lambie's abiding interest in this and notwithstanding her service to our country in the Defence Force. But I would point out that there are many in this place and in the other place who have served with distinction in our Defence Force. I look over my left shoulder and I see Brigadier Linda Reynolds. We have another Brigadier in Andrew Nikolic in the other place. Indeed one of the assistant ministers, Stuart Robert, has served. They are just three who have a deep and abiding interest and a commitment to supporting our armed forces and our Defence personnel. You do not even have to have served in the military to have enormous respect for those who choose to do so. I am in awe, quite frankly, of the servicemen and women who are prepared to give their all on behalf of our freedom. They stand in a great tradition and I stand with them albeit as someone who has not served.


With respect to this bill, some of the assertions that have been put forward by Senator Lambie are simply wrong and her draft bill will not achieve what she is seeking to achieve. I understand that Senator Lambie is concerned about Australian Defence Force pay—many of us are. But her bill to link ADF pay to politicians' pay or inflation as it is now, whichever is the higher, would most likely see no advance in ADF pay other than that which has occurred already. In actual fact, a case could be made that if this bill were successful, there could actually be a decline in ADF pay for personnel. The question arises: why is this? Let me explain.


First of all, parliamentary salaries are currently frozen. Parliamentarians will receive no pay rise in 2014 or in 2015. So if you were to tie ADF salaries to parliamentarians' pay at present, ADF personnel would get a zero increase. It is not the first time we have had a zero increase. A couple of years ago we had a zero increase as well, and who is to say what may happen in the future?


Secondly, Senator Lambie quotes some consumer price index inflation figures but she fails to look at the forward forecasts and the low inflation—in fact some would suggest deflationary—environment in which the world currently finds itself. Inflation for the year to December 2014 was 1.7 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecasting inflation to June of this year to fall to 1.25 per cent. The National Australia Bank's forward-looking forecast has a rate to December of this year of only 1.2 per cent. Once again, I say that we are experiencing what the rest of the world is experiencing—that is, a deflationary environment.


So ADF members, who were awarded a 1.5 per cent increase last November, which will be lifted to 2 per cent from March—assuming that Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal agrees with the government's proposal—are already keeping level with or doing slightly better than current inflation rates, which is unlikely to be more than two per cent for the foreseeable future. Were inflation to come into under two per cent—say, as forecast by the National Australia Bank, around 1.2—under Senator Lambie's bill, ADF personnel would get less than what the government is already proposing. So the two per cent per annum pay rise already on offer to the ADF personnel from the government is likely to be both better than inflation and better than what parliamentarians end up receiving. Therefore, it will be better than what would be delivered by Senator Lambie's formula. In fact, if you look at the pay rises awarded by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal over the past 10 years, they have averaged more than inflation. ADF pay rises under the workplace remuneration arrangements have totalled 38 per cent in simple addition terms, whereas CPI increases have totalled 28 per cent. So I would caution the Senate, and I would caution Senator Lambie, about being too keen to link ADF salaries to the CPI. If history is anything to go by, this would erode their advance very rapidly.


I would also like to deal with some of the misconceptions. Senator Lambie's press release announcing her bill underestimated ADF workplace remuneration agreement pay rises over 2005 to 2014. Between those years, ADF personnel have received increases of 32.8 per cent, an average increase of 3.28 per cent per year, which is marginally more—0.28 per cent—than that cited by Senator Lambie. Moreover, the large increase in remuneration for parliamentarians in 2012, which was included in Senator Lambie's calculations and purported to show that parliamentarians had done better than ADF personnel, resulted from a comprehensive work-value review. It is not dissimilar to the Defence Force Remuneration Reform Project, in 2007-09, which reformed ADF pay structures and resulted in many ADF members receiving increases from previous pay points.


If this work-value review is removed from the equation, ADF wage increases have actually been virtually equal to parliamentarians' wage increases in the 2005 to 2014 period selected by Senator Lambie. Parliamentarians' pay rises between that period awarded by the Remuneration Tribunal totalled 33.2 per cent, whereas ADF pay rises in this period totalled 32.8 per cent, meaning that there is less than half a per cent difference over the decade.


So, over the last decade, as it happens ADF wage increases have broadly reflected those received by parliamentarians. This does not count the advances between pay points or the promotions received by ADF personnel. So I do not see what Senator Lambie's bill will actually achieve. And, of course, at the moment parliamentarians' pay is frozen, whereas ADF personnel will get a two per cent increase over the next three years. I should also note that the Remuneration Tribunal has a long-held view that setting remuneration for one office by reference to another office does not lead to defensible or meaningful wage outcomes.


To recap, increasing the ADF pay offer to two per cent per annum will increase the likelihood going forward that ADF members do better than inflation and better than parliamentarians. I do not doubt that Senator Lambie is concerned about the issue of Defence Force pay. However, I think she needs to get the perspective right and she needs to get her assertions correct. It must also be remembered that salary is only one component of ADF remuneration. ADF personnel receive and deserve decent superannuation, competency based allowances, free medical and dental treatment, subsidised housing and a range of other benefits. ADF personnel involved in war-like operations receive a full tax exemption on their income. All of these, I reiterate, are absolutely right and proper, and, I believe, entirely well deserved.


Significantly, Labor supports the government's new policy of a two per cent per annum offer to ADF personnel. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, in a media release dated 4 March 2015 said that 'Labor welcomes the decision.' At question time on the same day he also said that Labor welcomes the decision. In a press conference that same day, Senator Conroy, the shadow defence minister said:


Labor welcomes this decision today to recognise the unique service of Australia's Defence personnel.


…   …   …


We think that this is an excellent decision …


Ms Brodtmann, the shadow parliamentary secretary for defence, also said 'we welcome this decision'. The conclusion is that Labor welcomes the government's decision.


That being the case I cannot imagine that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill currently before the Senate, because it would throw the government's two per cent per annum pay offer to ADF personnel into doubt, and it could in fact put ADF personnel in a worse position.


The coalition recognises the unique nature of military service and the sacrifices made by Defence personnel and their families, and we have had a strong record of supporting those who serve in our name. I make the point again that we have a number of people in the coalition who have served our country and our nation with absolute distinction. I think they provide a fantastic insight for the coalition into the serving conditions of our military personnel. As a consequence of that, the coalition has already delivered on substantial initiatives which assist ADF members and their families. In January 2014 the coalition delivered the ADF Family Health Program to more than 70,000 eligible dependents of ADF members. Under this program, eligible ADF dependents were reimbursed for all out-of-pocket expenses for GP services. Additionally, each ADF dependent is able to claim back up to $400 per year for allied health services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, psychology and podiatry. Importantly, families are able to pool their allocations to enable greater support for an eligible dependent with higher needs. The program has seen ADF dependents enjoy supported access to over 100,000 allied health and GP consultations, and this program demonstrates the government's commitment to supporting ADF members and their families.


The government's priority is also to ensure we have in place the mental health services and support mechanisms that are needed for veterans, ADF personnel and their families. With the increased operational deployment of the Australian defence forces over more than a decade and the draw-down of ADF operations in Afghanistan more recently, we need to better understand the physical, mental and social health needs of both serving and ex-serving personnel. In June 2014 the government provided $5 million to fund the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program—a crucial study into the mental health and wellbeing of service personnel and veterans. This program is the largest and most comprehensive program of study undertaken in Australia to examine the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel, and their families, who have been deployed to contemporary conflicts.


The Australian government is absolutely committed to ensuring ADF members are provided with the best possible health care. As part of this objective, the government launched the new $133 million Defence eHealth System in September 2014. This system links ADF members' health data from recruitment to discharge and improves the availability of accurate, up-to-date health data to Defence members' treating clinicians and their health care providers. Importantly, it will also allow health information to be easily and accurately passed to the Department of Veterans' Affairs as well as to civilian health providers.


The government has announced that it will provide a full income tax exemption for the pay and allowances of ADF personnel deployed on operations MANITOU and ACCORDION. This was outlined in the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2014-15. This change will align the tax treatment for all ADF members who serve on any of the operations across the Middle East region. Given the continuing disparities in the taxation arrangements for ADF personnel in the Middle East region, namely in relation to ADF personnel deployed on Operation OKRA, the Treasurer decided to allow a full income tax exemption for the pay and allowances of all ADF personnel deployed on that operation.


On 17 July 2014 the government delivered on its commitment to repeal the carbon tax. The coalition's legislation took effect from 1 July 2014 and ensured the burden of the carbon tax was removed from Defence personnel—as it was for families and individuals right across the country. Let us remind ourselves that under the Labor government the carbon tax was applied to everyone in the country, and the ADF were not immune from that. The Gillard government specifically regulated to ensure ADF personnel were hit by the cost of the carbon tax from 1 July 2012, and the ABS statistics show that that alone resulted in electricity prices rising by 15 per cent and gas prices rising by 14 per cent. These costs of course are passed onto ADF personnel utilising on-base, long-term and temporary accommodation. So scrapping the carbon tax has been a benefit for everyone in the country.


The coalition recognises that reserves are an important component of Australia's Defence Force. We have long supported the unique skills that reservists bring to Defence and have always supported the important work reservists carry out in order to meet the ADF's objectives both at home and abroad. There are approximately 47,000 reservists, and since 1999 over 21,000 have deployed on operations in locations in the Middle East, Timor Leste and here at home supporting disaster relief efforts. On 30 June 2014 the government announced reserve allowance reforms that reduced red tape and further recognised reservists' service obligations and contribution to capability.


This reform aligned reserve allowances with permanent ADF members' allowances and reduced the administrative burden associated with processing reserve allowances. On 25 August 2014, in recognition of the increasing integration of reservists into ADF operations, the coalition government also launched the trial Reserve Assistance Program. This program runs until 30 June this year and offers a comprehensive range of mental health and wellbeing support services.


Let us not forget it was the previous coalition government in 2001 who introduced landmark legislation to protect the rights of reservists in civilian employment and education. It was also the previous coalition government that created the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme in 2007, a scheme that provides ongoing incentives for both regular and reserve personnel to join and remain in the ADF. It was the previous coalition government who introduced the financial support scheme for employers to help offset the costs of releasing employees for Defence service along with implementing Exercise Executive Stretch, which is aimed at senior, middle and line management to show and involve them in the types of invaluable skills that can be gained through participation in ADF Reserves.


We have a good track record and I think there is no higher priority for a coalition government than ensuring our national security and that means supporting our ADF personnel. It was the Howard government upon its election in 1996 that first went about repairing and rebuilding Australia's modern defences. In the 13 Labor budgets between 1982 and 1983, and 1995 and 96 Labor cut Defence spending by 8.9 per cent in real terms. After the debt and deficit that was a consequence of the Hawke and Keating years, repairing the federal budget was a first priority but the Howard government recognised that a strong economy is critical to funding a strong Defence Force. Importantly, the Howard government quite rightly quarantined Defence from its initial budget repair work. Over that time, our economy stabilised and we grew the budget from $10.6 billion in 1995-96 to $22 billion in 2007-08, a 47 per cent increase in real terms. We wanted to provide funding certainty and assist the long-term planning needed when building capacity in Defence and that is why we released the 2000 Defence white paper, which committed to three per cent real growth for the defence budget over the following 10 years.


Once again, like Groundhog Day, a recently elected coalition government found itself needing to repair the budget and to stem the bleeding in the Defence portfolio caused by Labor's cuts. Let us remind ourselves that Labor cut $16 billion out of Defence through deferrals, through absorbed costs in the 2009 to 2022 period. As a proportion of GDP, Defence expenditure fell from the coalition's 1.75 per cent of GDP to 1.56 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. This was a figure not seen since 1938. Labor's cuts to Defence in the 2012-13 budget alone were worth $5.5 billion. That saw the largest single-year decrease in Defence expenditure, a massive 10.5 per cent, since the end of the Korean War in 1953. When Labor left office, Defence expenditure was forecast to remain below 1.7 per cent over the next decade. These cuts came despite Labor ministers stating on at least 38 separate occasions that Labor was committed to three per cent annual real growth in the Defence budget.


The coalition government has stated it will take a measured and purposeful approach to rebuilding Australia's defence forces. It is committed to increasing the Defence budget as a proportion of GDP to two per cent over the coming decade. We have provided a down payment on this commitment when this year's budget delivered a 6.1 per cent increase in funding to Defence. We are providing Defence with $29.2 billion in 2014-15 and will provide $122.7 billion over the forward estimates. The leadership and support provided to Defence by the coalition is what the Australian people are entitled to expect from the federal government and we will provide it because we understand the critical role that the Defence Force plays in ensuring our security in an uncertain world.


To conclude, while strongly supporting the serving men and women of the Australian defence forces, the coalition does not support Senator Lambie's private senator's bill. Senator Lambie's bill is the wrong solution to a problem that does not actually exist. The bill will be unnecessarily complex and, if enacted, will have a number of unintended consequences some of which, I think it is fair to say, even Senator Lambie does not intend to create. Finally, the government's move to increase the ADF pay offer from 1.5 per cent to two per cent will now provide an even higher pay increase for ADF personnel than what is provided for by Senator Lambie's bill. I would encourage the Senate not to support this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:09):  I rise today to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. Can I start off by responding to Senator Bernardi and admonishing him for selectively quoting from a press conference that I did. It is very disappointing on an important issue like this to see selective quotes being used to try and support Senator Bernardi's argument. I made it very clear in that press conference that we welcomed the government's decision not to cut the real pay of our defence personnel, but I made it clear that it is only the first of the three years of the deal where this will be the case.


On the government's own inflation forecast, two per cent will again be a real pay cut, if 2.5 per cent is the expected inflation rate next year. That is the government's forecast. I accept that it can vary, but let me be very clear. What I said at that press conference was that, if we believed as the inflation numbers rolled in that the government were going to again cut the real pay, we would be coming back to debate it with them. We would not be satisfied with allowing the government to cut next year's pay in real terms, or the third year's pay in real terms. So, while we do welcome the government's decision to reverse its cut, we are not saying that we are signed up to the deal over the full three years, because if inflation is exactly what the government has forecast it to be they will again be cutting the real wage of our defence personnel.


Can I indicate Labor will support this bill. I know there are a number of senators who want to speak on this bill, so I will keep my contribution short. We are here today because the government betrayed the men and women of the ADF when they decided last year to cut their pay. This bill, as a minimum—a minimum: this is the point that needs to be made very clear—links ADF pay to the higher of the increase to CPI or parliamentary allowances. This puts in place a floor that ADF pay cannot fall beneath. Through this bill, our ADF personnel know that their pay will, at the very least, always keep up with the cost of living. Nothing in this bill stops the government of the day providing a higher increase, which is what it has been dragged kicking and screaming to do. But it will prevent the government from doing what the Abbott government so callously did last year, and that was to cut the pay of our service men and women.


We are supporting this bill because this government cannot be trusted to do the right thing. Yes, as I have said, the Prime Minister, with his leadership under increasing threat, was dragged kicking and screaming to increase the government's defence pay offer from 1.5 per cent—a real cut—to 2.0 per cent, an increase. But the government did not do it because they believed it was the right thing to do; they did it to save Mr Abbott's leadership. But this bill ensures that, if inflation moves above this belated pay increase, the ADF will not be worse off.


A future Labor government will undertake a full review of the process for the determination of ADF pay to ensure that it is effective and transparent and properly takes into account the unique nature of military service. Some history here is important. After promising not to cut defence funding before the election, the coalition government cut ADF pay at the first opportunity. In 2012 the Prime Minister told the RSL National Conference:


A ""fair go"" is the least a grateful nation can offer to serving and former military personnel.


A fair go is not cutting the ADF's pay. A fair go is not cutting ADF Christmas leave and other allowances.


In October last year, reports began to emerge that the government was offering an unfair and below-inflation increase of 1.5 per cent a year across the three-year agreement. This pay cut came into force in November, just before Christmas. This disgraceful deal was explained away by the Prime Minister as a way to drive down the pay and conditions of all Commonwealth public servants. That is right: this offer not only ignored the unique nature of military service but was a designed political strategy to attack all public servants using our military personnel as a battering ram.


ADF personnel have a special place in our society, but, unlike other workers, they cannot bargain, speak out or strike for better pay. That is a fundamentally different place from that of other workers in Australia. As the member for Fisher rightly pointed out when he criticised the Prime Minister's pay decision: 'ADF personnel are not your typical public servants.' Our service men and women undertake unique, demanding and often dangerous work on behalf of all Australians. They put their lives on the line with dedication and courage to ensure Australia is safe. Right now we have ADF personnel deployed overseas supporting international efforts against Daesh in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. We also have them working on the high seas against drug traffickers. The ADF has been working tirelessly, supporting Australians affected by the recent natural disasters in Queensland and the Northern Territory. And they are doing the same today, supporting our friends in Vanuatu. This is why we have seen such a community backlash at the government for cutting the pay of our ADF personnel.


Australians instinctively respect and understand the ADF's contribution to our society. That is why it has not just been Labor that has been outraged by the Prime Minister's decision. Senator Lambie has been extremely vocal in her calls for the Prime Minister to pay the ADF more, and it is her bill that we debate today. Other crossbenchers have done the same. But this is an issue on which the community has also made its voice heard. The RSL and the Defence Force Welfare Association have pushed hard against this pay cut. And so have ADF families; they, more than anyone else, know how shameful this decision was.


I was proud to be able to receive a petition from Tony Dagger, whose son is in the army. Mr Dagger's petition called for a fair pay deal for ADF personnel and, in less than two months, it received more than 60,000 signatures.


But, as we have seen, with policy backflip after policy backflip, this Prime Minister only acts when his own job is at risk. He did not listen to the opposition leader when he wrote to him twice before the end of last year asking the Prime Minister to reconsider his unfair offer. He did not listen to opposition members and senators when they called on him to reverse the decision. He certainly did not listen to the minor parties. He did not listen to Senator Lambie. He did not listen to Mr Tony Dagger and his 60-thousand-strong petition. He did not listen to the soldier who said that the deal was 'essentially a kick in the teeth to every soldier, airman and sailor'. He did not listen to the RSL. He did not listen to the Defence Force Welfare Association when they told him:


The feeling within the Australian Defence Force … is as negative as I've ever seen it.


All of these groups and people pressured the Prime Minister over the unfair pay deal. They all told him this pay cut was the wrong captain's pick to make. But make no mistake: the only reason Tony Abbott backflipped on ADF pay was to save his own job. He was not interested in how his decision affected ADF personnel; he was only interested in his own job.


The government's new deal is an improvement. At two per cent, it is above the current inflation rate. The bill does not stop the government offering above-inflation pay deals. As I have said previously, this bill provides for a floor so that ADF personnel know they will not again get a below-inflation pay deal.


This bill should not be necessary but, because of the meanness and the unfairness of this government, it is. I urge all senators to support it.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-19,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  The Greens rise to support Senator Lambie's bill, the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014, and I am glad that it has been brought forward. Senators may remember—I think it was probably in the last or the second last sitting week of the 2014 parliamentary year—that we attempted to suspend standing orders, because at that point it looked as though the Prime Minister was planning on ignoring the calls from across the political spectrum and across the community. With some regret, we saw the suspension motion fail and we were not actually able to get on with substantive debate on the bill. I want to thank Senator Lambie for bringing this forward today, and I look forward to committing this bill to a vote.


When you consider that the annual national Defence budget is slated to grow to around $30.7 billion by 2016 and that the government is in the middle of two of the largest capital acquisition projects probably in the history of defence—the acquisition of the F35 Joint Strike Fighter and the highly-contested and divisive process that has been rolling for years around submarine procurement—the idea that the Prime Minister thought it was appropriate within weeks of committing ADF elements back into Iraq to offer a below-inflation pay deal and then stick to it was extraordinary.


What this bill does, rather than fixing a three per cent figure, is basically make sure that this can never happen again—that a Prime Minister or a government of the day, faced with budget circumstances entirely of their own making, would take a cohort of people, who from time to time will be called on to risk their lives or serious physical or mental injury in the line of their ordinary course of duty and who have no industrial representation. They cannot actually get their unions to go out in front, they cannot go on strike, and they basically have no real recourse. The passing of this bill will ensure that this can never happen again. The government will not be limited in the upper limit of a pay offer it could make to ADF personnel, but it would prevent the Prime Minister of the day doing what Prime Minister Tony Abbott tried to do, which was to offer a below-inflation pay increase to people who really have no recourse and no way of contesting that kind of appalling decision.


The Australian Greens believe that we have, essentially, a twofold obligation to our serving personnel. The first is that we should never deploy them unless it is absolutely necessary. We are well aware that in the past 15 years the ADF have been deployed into three wars of choice. I do not propose to get into arguments about where that decision should lie, or even the merits of those particular deployments. But we owe it to them—in fact, I think it is our highest responsibility—not to throw them into harm's way unless there is the very best possible reason for doing so. Obviously, we strongly disagree with some of the decisions that have been made in the recent past.


The second obligation we owe them is to look after them, both while they are on deployment and particularly when they come back. For anybody who is not aware of what I am talking about, view a Four Corners program that ran not long ago, or read Major General John Cantwell's book Exit Wounds, to get a vivid insight into what happens to some of these people who have been exposed to horrific violence—and these are some of the most highly-trained and disciplined people the ADF has—who, when they return, are basically unable to decompress and assimilate the things that they have seen and done, having been at very close quarters to people being killed or injured, or having suffering horrific injuries themselves.


One of the things that I was not aware of until that Four Corners piece was the fact that it may well be that suicide deaths of personnel after they have returned from deployment may be three times higher than the 41 combat deaths that Australia suffered during the Afghanistan conflict. The most distressing thing is that we do not actually know if that is true. It could in fact be higher. So people return with these invisible wounds and then they are actually, in many instances, very poorly treated, partly by the culture of the ADF, in which it is seen as a sign of weakness to admit that you are having a rough time, and partly by the intense bureaucracy. In one instance, DVA cleared one young soldier's payout and assistance two weeks after he killed himself. We are tying people up in a paralysing web of bureaucracy when actually they need our help.


I guess that second point is the idea that we have an obligation—not that parliamentarians in this place ever put their names to a motion to deploy, because of course that power still rests with the Prime Minister's office. But nonetheless it is amazing TV fodder for politicians to wrap themselves up in the flag and stand in front of the troops before sending them off into harm's way. But it is much harder to find politicians who will stand up for people who are suffering inordinately once they return home. It is that obligation to take care of these people that I think Senator Lambie's bill goes through today.


I think it is entirely responsible—rather than setting a hard and fast rate of pay increase, which we do not really do for any other cohorts—that we set effectively a rate that would float and would not be allowed to fall below the rate of inflation. Linking it to politicians' pay is cheeky, but nonetheless it is one way of ensuring that these people are not forgotten.


So the Australian Greens are pleased to support this bill. I look forward to committing it to a vote, and I think this debate can usefully be used as a way for those who have collectively sent soldiers into war, particularly those who turned up at the press conferences or spent—as I was very fortunate to do—a couple of days on deployment with them, to learn a bit. Politicians enjoy the political limelight, such as it is, but we should ask ourselves, 'What have we done since for these people?' particularly when we are given an opportunity, as we are being given this morning, to ensure—which is one of the least things we can do—that these people are paid fairly.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (10:27):  I too rise today to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. On 1 December last year, I rose in this place to speak on the initial ADF pay offer of 1.5 per cent per annum. At that time, I noted the budget constraints and the need to make tough decisions in today's fiscal environment, but I also noted the requirement to ensure it was a fair and reasonable outcome in the circumstances. Earlier this month, after quiet but persistent lobbying by me and many of my coalition colleagues, a fair and reasonable offer was proposed to the minister.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! I remind—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cameron may not take this issue seriously, but I can assure the Senate that I do.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, I remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly. Senator Reynolds, please continue.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. Earlier this month, after quiet lobbying by me and my coalition colleagues, a fair and reasonable offer was proposed to the minister, and subsequently the government announced that it had recommended the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal increase the pay offer to two per cent annum.


Initially, I would like to commend Senator Lambie's intent, and I support the sentiment that she shows behind this bill. While we certainly have different styles and approaches, I have absolutely no doubt that both of us want what is in the best interests of those who serve in uniform and the families who serve in partnership with them.


The first duty of any federal government is to protect the nation. The Australian Defence Force fulfils this responsibility on behalf of us all. Every single year, our service men and women reconfirm their availability and their readiness to deploy on operations and put their lives in harm's way in service of our country and of all Australians. Military service, in this fundamental respect, is unique.


For their part, Australians accept the moral obligation to preserve the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of our men and women in uniform and their families, who make their service to our nation possible. The government of the day is custodian of this covenant or moral obligation on behalf of all Australians. We have this moral obligation not only to our uniformed personnel but also to their families.


ADF personnel are not public servants. Their roles differ substantially from those of public servants, and their roles are unique. The contribution they make to us all is unique. No-one I know—and no-one I have ever met in 29 years in the Army—serves our nation for the pay, but pay and conditions must always be fair. Our moral obligation to our men and women in uniform goes much further than simply pay and conditions. Our reciprocal obligation is to ensure that those who serve are as safe and prepared as they can be. This means not only in pay and conditions but also in ensuring the best possible equipment, training, health, housing and other support for their families and themselves are provided to them. Senator Bernardi has listed these in great detail. It is entirely appropriate and right that the employment conditions of the ADF uniformed personnel are handled very differently from public servants, because ADF personnel are not public servants.


I would like to address some of the deep concerns I have with this bill and its unintended consequences. One of the underpinning provisions of the explanatory memorandum of this bill states:


The members of the ADF have their pay assessed arbitrarily by the Minister of Defence (the Minister) under section 58B of the Defence Act 1903.


I argue that this entire premise underpinning the bill is not correct. The Minister for Defence does not make determinations on ADF pay. In fact, under the act, this power is reserved specifically to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, the DFRT, pursuant to section 58H(2)(a) of the Defence Act.


Unlike what is said in the explanatory memorandum, the powers of the minister in relation to ADF remuneration, under section 58(B) of the Defence Act, relate to determinations regarding conditions of service for ADF members other than salary—that is, not pay. These determinations in the past have included housing benefits, relocation support, leave entitlements, the Abbott government's rollout of the ADF Family Health Program and a range of other non-salary related allowances. 


In fact, the Hawke government, in the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 1984 established a Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, which comprises three independent members: the vice president of Fair Work Australia, a person experienced in industrial relations matters and a person who has been a member of the ADF. This is a fundamental and critical fact that this bill has ignored and therefore renders it invalid.


The DFRT was established by Labor to ensure that all decisions and determinations made in relation to ADF pay are relevant to the contemporary roles and living and working environments of personnel serving in the ADF. This is a 30-year precedent—established by the Labor Party—which has worked very well until now. The DFRT determinations are to be made taking into account the special skills and capabilities required of ADF members and their unique employment circumstances. Last year, the DFRT determination was to offer a 1.5 per cent pay increase and was made with these considerations in mind.


In the aftermath of the decision to offer a 1.5 per cent pay increase to ADF personnel, I received a significant number of representations from serving and retired members of the ADF about the appropriateness of that outcome. I am also aware that many of my coalition colleagues—who enjoy very close working relationships with their Defence communities in their own electorates—received similar representations. The critical difference from those opposite is that we all understood that any pay outcome for uniformed personnel could not add further per pressure to this government's efforts to repair the economic damage done to this country by the previous Labor and Labor-Greens governments.


So, after carefully considering the extensive feedback we received on this matter, Andrew Nikolic and I approached the Minister for Defence with what we believed was a sensible and workable solution in the current fiscal environment—as did, I know, many of our colleagues—and that was a two per cent pay increase. Another powerful and ultimately persuasive argument to the minister was the fact that under the last government, the Labor government, the wage increases of ADF uniformed personnel lagged behind those of the APS workforce by up to 25 per cent. We believed, therefore, that this recommendation was not only appropriate but affordable.


The second serious concern I would like to raise in relation to this bill is its stated intent that it:


… ensures fairness in the assessment of annual wage increases for members of the Australian defence force by linking Defence Force pay to the higher of increases in Parliamentary allowance and CPI.


Again I congratulate and acknowledge Senator Lambie for the intent behind it, because I know it is a genuine intent to look after our men and women in uniform; I know this. But the practical consequences of this would be to see the ADF pay actually go backwards, and I will explain why. If ADF personnel's pay were tied to inflation, they would be worse off than under the currently proposed two per cent. That is because politicians and senior public servants have actually had their pay frozen to zero since last year, and the Prime Minister has given absolutely no indication that this decision will be overturned in the foreseeable future, so it is a zero per cent pay increase for parliamentarians. So we have a start point of zero per cent. As Senator Bernardi just said, currently the inflation rate is 1.7 per cent, but forward forecasts are that it will decrease, possibly below 1.5 per cent. So this bill is actually mandating an increase between zero and probably somewhere around 1.5 per cent, which would clearly mandate that ADF pay would in fact go backwards from what is currently proposed. That is, I know, absolutely an unintended consequence. I believe it is certainly not the intent of Senator Lambie that this would happen.


I would now like to address some of the technical detail in aspects of this bill, because I have some background in this area. All of us in this place know that the devil and sometimes further unintended consequences are in the detail of the legislation. Firstly, the explanatory memorandum and second reading speech for the bill appear to show that the bill's intent is to apply a minimum to the 'annual increases' arising from a Workplace Remuneration Arrangement, or WRA, type review. However, the definitions in the bill are far broader than just a minimum increase in the pay. I am sure, again, this is another unintended consequence of the wording of this bill. After a close review of the amendments, I believe it would be totally unworkable, and I will now explain why.


A definition that helps establish this potentially far broader scope than that indicated by Senator Lambie, the Labor Party and the Greens is that the proposed section 58Z defines Defence Force pay as 'salary (within the meaning of Division 2)'. Division 2 is the division actually dealing with the DFRT itself. The impact of that is that the bill affects all salary, not just annual increases. It might not sound significant, but it has wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts on the DFRT and on our service personnel.


A Defence Force pay determination is defined as 'a determination made by the Minister under division 1'—or section 58B—'or by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal under Division 2, in relation to Defence Force pay'. The practical implication of this is that the bill can impact on many more determinations than just those dealing with pay adjustments. It might sound innocuous, but I can assure this place that it is far from innocuous. Under existing section 58H(2)(a) of the act, the DFRT shall 'inquire into and determine the salaries and relevant allowances to be paid to members'—I stress 'relevant allowances to be paid to members'. This function is not limited to making 'annual increases' to ADF salaries, as currently determined under the recent Workplace Remuneration Arrangement.


Therefore, by extending to salary determinations, this bill potentially affects all of the DFRT work on salaries and not just the annual adjustments, as per the stated intent of the bill. The implications of that are wide ranging and have yet been unacknowledged by those opposite. For example, the DFRT can and does regularly review and determine individual salary placements and increases applying to employment categories within one of the services or triservice categories such as specialist structures for doctors, dentists, lawyers or our chaplains. This is part of the tribunal's day-to-day business and there is already a statutory requirement to review such determinations at least every two years, under section 58H(6) of the act.


Due to the broad definition of 'defence pay determination', the complex formula in the operative clause of this bill, clause 58ZC, would need to be applied to all of those individual pay reviews, not just the annual salary increase. This would force the tribunal to factor in the calculation of CPI and parliamentary allowances each and every time it makes one of its hundreds of salary determinations, remembering that under the proposed changes the calculation would currently result in lower rates, not higher rates. So proposed section 58ZC would introduce a mandatory formula into all Defence Force pay determinations and not just those suggested in the bill. The tribunal, in making any salary determination, would need to include a calculation that converts any amount it decides upon into a percentage increase for the purposes of working out a minimum salary increase, using the amount and rate comparison set out in the proposed new section 58ZC.


What is important to remember is that when the ADF seeks to adjust its pay structures it does so in two ways. First of all, there are general movements such as annual increases, which must be applied across all structures. But the ADF also makes adjustments to individual categories, which usually occur within the constraints of the existing pay points within the system.


The most recent WRA decision is applied to all salary structures and relevant allowances determined by the tribunal, and this occurs on average every two years. This matter has usually been progressed under section 58KD of the act, which states:


The Tribunal may, in making a determination, give effect to any agreement reached between the Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Chief of the Defence Force …


The interpretation of this section has always been one that suggests that giving effect to a section 58KD agreement does not give the tribunal scope to vary the agreed pay increase put before it. The tribunal in these circumstances essentially has a choice to say yes or no. In those circumstances, any application of the proposed new section 58ZC would have to occur between the parties agreeing on the matter to be put before the tribunal. I believe this in itself makes this proposal uncertain and unworkable for the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.


The bottom line in all of this technical detail, I believe, is that the scope of this bill applies beyond its intended target of annual salary increases. If it were clearly restricted to this intended target of salary alone, the detrimental effect of this bill would be lessened, although the system would become even more complex than it is and, in practicality, unworkable for the DFRT.


Additionally, as the WRA also applies to relevant allowances determined by the tribunal, including service allowances, and there is no requirement to apply clause 58ZC to that part of ADF remuneration, the bill could potentially cause additional distortions to the current ADF remuneration. For example, the service allowance is a stand-alone payment for ADF personnel of major-equivalent ranks and below. However, the service allowance for lieutenant colonel equivalents and above was rolled into their salaries in the 1980s and continues to be a component of these people's salaries. To not apply consistent increases to salary and relevant allowances of this type would cause further salary distortion. I know, Senator Lambie, that was not your intent in this bill, but that would be the practical implication.


If this bill was introduced, I believe the integrity of ADF pay structures for GOPS and GORPS would be impacted on by the application of this new section to individual employment category cases, which is fundamentally the day-to-day work of the tribunal. That is because any increase to individual pay placements would have to match the minimum pay clause, creating a range of additional pay points, distorting relativities between placements and creating distortion of the complete salary structures. With around 1,300 pay points remunerating more than 500 employment categories across all three services, the operation of Senator Lambie's proposed section 58ZC, with its minimum requirement for all adjustments the ADF seeks to make, I believe would completely distort this structure and render it almost unachievable.


In conclusion, I believe that the two per cent increase per annum for our ADF personnel that has already been negotiated is a fair outcome in our current circumstances. It represents the utmost respect that this government has for our defence forces and acknowledges the critical role they perform in ensuring a safe and secure Australia for us all. While I genuinely commend Senator Lambie for this initiative and the intent behind it, I cannot in good conscience support this bill because it would significantly disadvantage our brave men and women in uniform, who dedicate their lives to serving Australia, and their families. I know that was not her intent, but that is what the impact would be. It would make them worse off. For those reasons, I cannot support this bill.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (10:47):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. I think it would be fair to say at the outset that there is not a senator elected to this chamber who is not fully supportive of the Australian Defence Force and the contribution its members make and have made over an extremely long period of time. I think it is unfortunate that they have found themselves in this situation where they were let down—if not something more serious—by this government.


I want to pick up on a couple of points that Senator Reynolds made in her contribution. The first point was on repairing the budget. There are ways of repairing the budget, and I want to give one very specific example. The Public Works Committee, which is charged with examining Defence expenditure, had a proposal put to it to build 50 houses at RAAF Base Tindal. The bespoke, architecturally designed houses were to cost $89.4 million. The committee found that that was not value for money. After a number of hearings and a number of examinations of this situation that was put to it, another model was put up to build 50 tropical designed dwellings using the Defence Housing Association as business as usual to design and construct a delivery model at a cost of $47.15 million. If you are serious about repairing the budget and examining Defence expenditure then you can find an instance on the public record that was subject to public hearings where $40-odd million was saved in one project. It gives you an understanding of how deeply and widely felt the antagonism towards this government's decision clearly is. We see these projects ad hoc. Defence is a large part of the expenditure that goes to the Public Works Committee. We test whether it is value for money and fit for purpose in the public interest. If we can put up an example of where $40 million was proposed to be spent and a business-as-usual model delivered a $40 million saving, how do the people in Defence feel when they cannot get a modest increase when clearly there are savings to be made—and not insignificant ones?


Whilst repairing the budget is the goal of all governments, at what cost should it be? Should it be at the cost of the people who put their limbs and lives on the line every day in the service of this country? I think not. I think, actually, there is bipartisan support for that. I really do. I think there are many people in the coalition ranks who think that this is grossly unfair. I think their numbers are quite significant. There are a number who have gone on the public record to say that. The simple facts are that they should not be in this position. This is a fight that they should not have had to have.


Take the Prime Minister's comment that no-one in the public sector will be paid a higher rate of increase than our Defence Force—that is factually incorrect. If you look at the relevant agreements you will see that the CSIRO will receive an increase of 2.8 per cent per year for the next three years. Airservices Australia will receive a 5.1 per cent pay rise over the next 15 months up to July 2016. Future Fund employees have been reported to be receiving a three per cent annual pay increase. So is it any wonder that our serving men and women are feeling let down? Is it any wonder at all that the various stakeholders who support those men and women in the Defence Force are agitating for a better deal? There is no wonder at all.


This is really the consequence of the bravado of this government. After gaining a significant electoral victory, they said, 'The next thing we are going to do is chop.' There are some places you do not chop. In my view, Australian Defence Force personnel are entitled to a respectable, ongoing increase in their wages and conditions commensurate with the level of commitment that they give to this country without having to agitate in the way that they have been forced to this time. If the government are serious about budget repair, I suggest they have a very close look at some of the procurement contracts and expenditure that are ongoing in our Defence Force as we speak, rather than taking money out of the pockets of those hardworking men and women of our Australian Defence Force.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Today this Australian Senate is presented with an opportunity to debate and vote for the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. I know that many Australians, including up to one million voters nationwide, are influenced by how this government treats our Australian Defence Force and veterans' families and will be interested in the contributions from senators in this chamber. This is simple private member's legislation I had drafted before Christmas which links pay for members of the Australian Defence Force with pay for Australian parliamentarians or to the consumer price index, whichever is higher. 


The need for this legislation became obvious after this Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Abbott, announced a change in pay rates for members of our Army, Navy and RAAF which was in fact a pay cut after our nation's inflation rate was taken into consideration. It became clear to all fair-minded Australians that the system of determining wage rises for our diggers was broken and had to be fixed. The Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 will fix the broken system which determines the amount of pay that members of our Army, Navy and RAAF are awarded.


This simple piece of legislation, if agreed to by the majority of senators in this chamber, will give members of our Australian Defence Force certainty and a guarantee that they will receive a fair pay increase, because this bill puts in place a minimum pay rise which at the very least keeps track with the consumer price index or politicians' pay increase, whichever is higher. Of course, the bill also leaves open the opportunity for politicians and their public servants to ensure that our Defence families receive pay rises greater than current CPI rates or the rates of pay increases for politicians. I was tempted to put in this bill a legislative mechanism that would ensure that our diggers received a pay rise greater than the CPI rate of the day or greater than the current rate of pay increase for politicians. However, I chose to be prudent and more than reasonable given the fiscal restraint all Australians are now being asked to show.


In short, this bill is reasonable and measured. It does not have any provisions that are excessive. If you believe that Australian Defence Force members deserve a fair go when it comes to calculating their wages then my private member's bill will be very difficult to vote against. There may be some from the government who, for mischievous reasons, may want to confuse the debate. They could say: 'The latest national CPI rate is 1.7 per cent and the government has agreed to a two per cent pay rise. Won't that mean we are voting for a pay cut for our military?' Of course, that assertion would be absolute rubbish. This legislation is flexible enough to allow the government of the day to increase Australian Defence pay by however much they want to. If the government wanted to decrease the pay then it would be the government's responsibility, not the legislation's fault.


The legislation is simple and puts in place a safety net which, we have seen from past governments, is desperately needed. At the moment, Australia is governed by mean-spirited leaders who regularly need to be exposed to the heat of a near-death political experience in order to melt the ice frozen to their hearts and the wax built up in their ears. Unfortunately for voiceless members of the Australian Defence Force, doing the right thing does not come easy for our nation's leaders. So that is why this private member's legislation is so important: it is to keep the bastards wearing blue ties honest.


There would be some members of the Senate opposite me who may have forgotten exactly when the 1.5 per cent pay offer, the effective pay cut for our military, was announced by the Abbott government. I remind those members that it was the day before last year's Melbourne Cup Day. Of course, the choice of this day was deliberate. It showed that the Abbott government knew that they were being dishonest and doing the wrong thing by our diggers. It was proof that the Abbott government hoped that the extraordinary media attention devoted to the race that stops the nation would cover up a government decision which shamed a nation.


Thankfully, support from ordinary Australians spontaneously emerged. My office was bombarded with emails from Tasmanians and other states expressing their disgust at Mr Abbott and his Liberal members and the lack of support for our diggers. This government underestimated the love and respect that our nation has for the members of our Australian Defence Force, 365 days a year—not just the few days of the year that some members of the Abbott government fake affection for our diggers and their families.


Following the news of the Liberal Party cut to members of the Australian Defence Force, I appreciated that fact that Labor leader Bill Shorten wrote to the Prime Minister Abbott and asked him to reconsider the pay offer. I also appreciate the fact that Labor have indicated that they will support this legislation today, along with the Greens and many of my crossbench colleagues. So I sincerely thank them in advance.


In recent days and after a stunning electoral defeat in Queensland which was partly influenced by voters in a few key areas like Townsville and Brisbane—where there are high numbers of Australian Defence Force personnel, their supporters and their families—and pressure from their Liberal colleagues in New South Wales fearing a similar fate, this Abbott government belatedly chose to offer a further rise in our Australian Defence Force pay. This is my message to Prime Minister Abbott following his Defence Force pay backdown. It is relevant to today's debate on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 and touches on some of the broader defence issues:


Dear Prime Minister,


I note your decision on Wednesday 4th of March to ask the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) to take a proposed pay increase of only .5% to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, making for a total ADF pay rise of 2%.


In 2000 the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF)— the person you have just asked to increase ordinary diggers pay by .5%--received $305K p/a. The latest figures show that CDF in 2014 took home $764K.


That means the person you have just asked to increase ordinary Diggers pay by .5%—in the last 14 years, own pay increased by almost $460K or 250%. Apart from the obvious embarrassment and humiliation you're subjecting the CDF to, isn't this just another indicator that the system for determining our Diggers pay is broken?


While you attempt to justify this less than fair pay rise, by comparing it to the current inflation rate of 1.7% - I remind you that the core inflation rate is 2.1% and current weighted median Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate is 2.3%.


I also remind you that Parliamentary Library background research I commissioned reveals that the average yearly rise in Defence Pays over the last ten years is approximately 3%.


This stands in stark contrast with the average yearly rise in politician's pay, which since 2004 and taking into account the last two years of 0% pay rise, is still almost 7%.


I'm sure that you would agree, that our Diggers, particularly of the last decade and half, have earnt a pay rise equal to that of our politicians.


So therefore I respectfully ask that you reconsider your pay offer to members of Australia's Defence Force.


It's my view that in making your decision to increase defence pay, you should consider all the facts. If you do so there is a very strong case to:


1. Strengthen the ADF pay increase by .5% to an annual rate of 2.5%, rather than 2%.


2. Ensure that all ADF members receive back pay calculated from the 4th of November 2014 or Melbourne Cup Day (the day after their effective pay cut was sneakily announced by your government)


3. Restore ADF Combat Pay or War Zone Allowance back to $200 per day instead of the reduced $150 per day allowance.


I request that you agree to a meeting to discuss these three important issues.


During that meeting I would also like to receive from you a guarantee that Diggers who have served for 20 years, and are therefore covered by multiple compensation acts, and who are now re-deployed to Iraq - are not (because of a bureaucratic provision called offsetting) at a disadvantage compared with younger diggers, if they are injured.


I've been reliably informed that veteran Australian Diggers who have served previously in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq - and who have recently been redeployed to Iraq, compared with younger Diggers covered by only one compensation act - can receive compensation payments up to 10 times less, should they be injured during this new deployment.


It's my view that if you properly consider these four issues, you can only come to the conclusion that members of our Defence Force are not being fairly paid or compensated. I would hope that our meeting would find a resolution to these important matters.




Making our own position safe at home.



While I believe that we both share common feelings about Islamic State and the great evil they have brought to this world - I strongly disagree with your decision to send members of our ADF to Iraq in response to their attacks.


Forcing Australian Tax payers to pay for Australian Troops to be sent back into harms way in Iraq, given that America has only deployed about 3000 troops, is not a wise decision.


At best it will be a ""flag flying"" exercise. At worst we run the risk of supposedly friendly Iraqi troops betraying our Diggers and killing them - or handing them over to Islamic state forces who will use them to make further horrific online videos.


I believe that a prudent response to the threat Australia faces from Islamic state is to dramatically increase the size and capability of the Australian Defence force and that we should make our own country safe, before we try and make countries like Iraq, Syria, Lybia and North Africa safe from Islamic state fanatics and death cult members.


In advocating for that course of action, I draw your attention to the war-time experience of Prime Minister John Curtin, as described by Bob Wurth in his book ""1942"".


You will recall that following the Japanese Air Raids in February 1942 on Darwin, which killed 243 people and wounded more than 400 Australians, Prime Minister John Curtin received a cable which said that Churchill, acting with out Curtin's authority had already diverted Australian ""troop ships to Burma""- leaving our Nation more vulnerable to Japanese attack.


John Curtin is then reported to have told his friend the biographer Lloyd Ross: ""its the proper fate of a country which has not built up its own defences. The proper fate of a country which always fights someone else's war, without making its own position safe.""


Its my view that as a Nation we're now making the same mistake that Prime Minister Curtain spoke about at the beginning of WW2, namely that, ""We're being be drawn into a war and fighting someone else's battles, without making our own position safe at home.""


We need to address this problem in an honest manner—and start with a critical look at the numbers and capacity of our ADF.




Too few members of our ADF and combat troops on anti-psychotic medication



Our shocking Veterans' suicide and homeless rates which your government continues to cover up - is a direct result of successive Australian Governments asking too few members of our ADF to shoulder the burden of prolonged commitments in the Middle East war zones.


It's my view that many younger veterans who take their lives or end up homeless, will have spent 3 plus years or more in the War Zone in the space of a decade. This prompts the question:


What is the maximum period of time a combat troop can serve in a War Zone, before they are guaranteed to suffer psychological harm?


Some young veterans I have meet have in 13 or more years of service completed 10 combat deployments or tours of duty in war zones.


And while you can't criticize the commitment and love that these young men and women have for Australia, you can criticize the politicians and high ranking members of the ADF who know that we didn't - and still don't, have enough full time members of our military to safely commit our Nation to prolonged military engagements in Middle East war zones.


Senior ADF medical officers have personally confirmed to me that ADF members are allowed to enter War Zones armed, while officially receiving anti-psychotic medication.


Surely these well known facts would lead any reasonable person to come to the conclusion that we don't have a large enough permanent defence force?


And that to meet the threat posed to western civilization by Islamic maniacs who want to drag us back into the dark ages, then its time to dramatically increase the numbers and capacity of our ADF.


We could begin the process of boosting the numbers of our defence force by re-introducing a National Service Trade and Traineeship program. This would not only boost the capacity of our ADF but it would also address the dual problems of youth unemployment and national skills shortage.




Closing - Important Veterans
'
 Questions



In closing, I have been contacted by older veterans with strong connections to our serving ADF members being deployed to the Middle East.


They have requested that I ask you these confronting but relevant questions in relation to the Australian Soldiers preparing and being sent to train and assist Iraqi troops:


1. Do they receive the same combat pay or war zone allowance as the initial cohort of soldiers redeployed to Iraq?


2. Have they received instructions to the effect that: ""whatever you do save your last bullet for yourself, don't get captured""?


3. If these soldiers are being deployed armed and warned not to get captured – can you explain why they have been denied the benefits associated with full war like service - and full combat pay and allowances?


4. Has the Australian government deployed these ADF personnel using diplomatic type passports? If so, can you explain why?


5. Are they being warned to discretely advise their families in Australia to be on the lookout for, or vigilant against Islamic state supporters who may be gathering intelligence for future terrorist attacks?


6. If not, why not?


7. Are ADF personnel on Australian Military bases authorized to use their weapons to defend themselves when or if, they are attacked by terrorists?


8 If so, can you describe the chain of command and name who is responsible for authorizing our ADF personnel to arm themselves and use lethal force to defend themselves and others against terrorists attacks?


9. In relation to armed ADF members being authorized to use lethal force, in an emergency or terrorist attack, how long does their lethal force authorization last?


While I will also officially submit these questions as QON, I would appreciate if you provided answers as soon as possible and before the 30 day deadline.


Today I have tried to ask some of the important questions and described some the enormous and deadly challenges faced by serving and former members of our Defence Force. The job before them is one of the most complex, important and hardest that our nation not asks but demands of it citizens. To do the job of a sailor, soldier or member of the Royal Australian Air Force requires extreme courage, dedication, discipline, perseverance, love and loyalty to our country. The least we can do as law-makers is to ensure that they receive a fair day's pay for their extraordinary, unique service to this country. I commend this bill to the house.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I rise to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. To be frank, I am somewhat surprised that this private senator's bill has not been withdrawn, notwithstanding Senator Lambie's abiding interest in this and notwithstanding her service to our country in the Defence Force. But I would point out that there are many in this place and in the other place who have served with distinction in our Defence Force. I look over my left shoulder and I see Brigadier Linda Reynolds. We have another Brigadier in Andrew Nikolic in the other place. Indeed one of the assistant ministers, Stuart Robert, has served. They are just three who have a deep and abiding interest and a commitment to supporting our armed forces and our Defence personnel. You do not even have to have served in the military to have enormous respect for those who choose to do so. I am in awe, quite frankly, of the servicemen and women who are prepared to give their all on behalf of our freedom. They stand in a great tradition and I stand with them albeit as someone who has not served.


With respect to this bill, some of the assertions that have been put forward by Senator Lambie are simply wrong and her draft bill will not achieve what she is seeking to achieve. I understand that Senator Lambie is concerned about Australian Defence Force pay—many of us are. But her bill to link ADF pay to politicians' pay or inflation as it is now, whichever is the higher, would most likely see no advance in ADF pay other than that which has occurred already. In actual fact, a case could be made that if this bill were successful, there could actually be a decline in ADF pay for personnel. The question arises: why is this? Let me explain.


First of all, parliamentary salaries are currently frozen. Parliamentarians will receive no pay rise in 2014 or in 2015. So if you were to tie ADF salaries to parliamentarians' pay at present, ADF personnel would get a zero increase. It is not the first time we have had a zero increase. A couple of years ago we had a zero increase as well, and who is to say what may happen in the future?


Secondly, Senator Lambie quotes some consumer price index inflation figures but she fails to look at the forward forecasts and the low inflation—in fact some would suggest deflationary—environment in which the world currently finds itself. Inflation for the year to December 2014 was 1.7 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecasting inflation to June of this year to fall to 1.25 per cent. The National Australia Bank's forward-looking forecast has a rate to December of this year of only 1.2 per cent. Once again, I say that we are experiencing what the rest of the world is experiencing—that is, a deflationary environment.


So ADF members, who were awarded a 1.5 per cent increase last November, which will be lifted to 2 per cent from March—assuming that Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal agrees with the government's proposal—are already keeping level with or doing slightly better than current inflation rates, which is unlikely to be more than two per cent for the foreseeable future. Were inflation to come into under two per cent—say, as forecast by the National Australia Bank, around 1.2—under Senator Lambie's bill, ADF personnel would get less than what the government is already proposing. So the two per cent per annum pay rise already on offer to the ADF personnel from the government is likely to be both better than inflation and better than what parliamentarians end up receiving. Therefore, it will be better than what would be delivered by Senator Lambie's formula. In fact, if you look at the pay rises awarded by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal over the past 10 years, they have averaged more than inflation. ADF pay rises under the workplace remuneration arrangements have totalled 38 per cent in simple addition terms, whereas CPI increases have totalled 28 per cent. So I would caution the Senate, and I would caution Senator Lambie, about being too keen to link ADF salaries to the CPI. If history is anything to go by, this would erode their advance very rapidly.


I would also like to deal with some of the misconceptions. Senator Lambie's press release announcing her bill underestimated ADF workplace remuneration agreement pay rises over 2005 to 2014. Between those years, ADF personnel have received increases of 32.8 per cent, an average increase of 3.28 per cent per year, which is marginally more—0.28 per cent—than that cited by Senator Lambie. Moreover, the large increase in remuneration for parliamentarians in 2012, which was included in Senator Lambie's calculations and purported to show that parliamentarians had done better than ADF personnel, resulted from a comprehensive work-value review. It is not dissimilar to the Defence Force Remuneration Reform Project, in 2007-09, which reformed ADF pay structures and resulted in many ADF members receiving increases from previous pay points.


If this work-value review is removed from the equation, ADF wage increases have actually been virtually equal to parliamentarians' wage increases in the 2005 to 2014 period selected by Senator Lambie. Parliamentarians' pay rises between that period awarded by the Remuneration Tribunal totalled 33.2 per cent, whereas ADF pay rises in this period totalled 32.8 per cent, meaning that there is less than half a per cent difference over the decade.


So, over the last decade, as it happens ADF wage increases have broadly reflected those received by parliamentarians. This does not count the advances between pay points or the promotions received by ADF personnel. So I do not see what Senator Lambie's bill will actually achieve. And, of course, at the moment parliamentarians' pay is frozen, whereas ADF personnel will get a two per cent increase over the next three years. I should also note that the Remuneration Tribunal has a long-held view that setting remuneration for one office by reference to another office does not lead to defensible or meaningful wage outcomes.


To recap, increasing the ADF pay offer to two per cent per annum will increase the likelihood going forward that ADF members do better than inflation and better than parliamentarians. I do not doubt that Senator Lambie is concerned about the issue of Defence Force pay. However, I think she needs to get the perspective right and she needs to get her assertions correct. It must also be remembered that salary is only one component of ADF remuneration. ADF personnel receive and deserve decent superannuation, competency based allowances, free medical and dental treatment, subsidised housing and a range of other benefits. ADF personnel involved in war-like operations receive a full tax exemption on their income. All of these, I reiterate, are absolutely right and proper, and, I believe, entirely well deserved.


Significantly, Labor supports the government's new policy of a two per cent per annum offer to ADF personnel. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, in a media release dated 4 March 2015 said that 'Labor welcomes the decision.' At question time on the same day he also said that Labor welcomes the decision. In a press conference that same day, Senator Conroy, the shadow defence minister said:


Labor welcomes this decision today to recognise the unique service of Australia's Defence personnel.


…   …   …


We think that this is an excellent decision …


Ms Brodtmann, the shadow parliamentary secretary for defence, also said 'we welcome this decision'. The conclusion is that Labor welcomes the government's decision.


That being the case I cannot imagine that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill currently before the Senate, because it would throw the government's two per cent per annum pay offer to ADF personnel into doubt, and it could in fact put ADF personnel in a worse position.


The coalition recognises the unique nature of military service and the sacrifices made by Defence personnel and their families, and we have had a strong record of supporting those who serve in our name. I make the point again that we have a number of people in the coalition who have served our country and our nation with absolute distinction. I think they provide a fantastic insight for the coalition into the serving conditions of our military personnel. As a consequence of that, the coalition has already delivered on substantial initiatives which assist ADF members and their families. In January 2014 the coalition delivered the ADF Family Health Program to more than 70,000 eligible dependents of ADF members. Under this program, eligible ADF dependents were reimbursed for all out-of-pocket expenses for GP services. Additionally, each ADF dependent is able to claim back up to $400 per year for allied health services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, psychology and podiatry. Importantly, families are able to pool their allocations to enable greater support for an eligible dependent with higher needs. The program has seen ADF dependents enjoy supported access to over 100,000 allied health and GP consultations, and this program demonstrates the government's commitment to supporting ADF members and their families.


The government's priority is also to ensure we have in place the mental health services and support mechanisms that are needed for veterans, ADF personnel and their families. With the increased operational deployment of the Australian defence forces over more than a decade and the draw-down of ADF operations in Afghanistan more recently, we need to better understand the physical, mental and social health needs of both serving and ex-serving personnel. In June 2014 the government provided $5 million to fund the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program—a crucial study into the mental health and wellbeing of service personnel and veterans. This program is the largest and most comprehensive program of study undertaken in Australia to examine the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel, and their families, who have been deployed to contemporary conflicts.


The Australian government is absolutely committed to ensuring ADF members are provided with the best possible health care. As part of this objective, the government launched the new $133 million Defence eHealth System in September 2014. This system links ADF members' health data from recruitment to discharge and improves the availability of accurate, up-to-date health data to Defence members' treating clinicians and their health care providers. Importantly, it will also allow health information to be easily and accurately passed to the Department of Veterans' Affairs as well as to civilian health providers.


The government has announced that it will provide a full income tax exemption for the pay and allowances of ADF personnel deployed on operations MANITOU and ACCORDION. This was outlined in the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2014-15. This change will align the tax treatment for all ADF members who serve on any of the operations across the Middle East region. Given the continuing disparities in the taxation arrangements for ADF personnel in the Middle East region, namely in relation to ADF personnel deployed on Operation OKRA, the Treasurer decided to allow a full income tax exemption for the pay and allowances of all ADF personnel deployed on that operation.


On 17 July 2014 the government delivered on its commitment to repeal the carbon tax. The coalition's legislation took effect from 1 July 2014 and ensured the burden of the carbon tax was removed from Defence personnel—as it was for families and individuals right across the country. Let us remind ourselves that under the Labor government the carbon tax was applied to everyone in the country, and the ADF were not immune from that. The Gillard government specifically regulated to ensure ADF personnel were hit by the cost of the carbon tax from 1 July 2012, and the ABS statistics show that that alone resulted in electricity prices rising by 15 per cent and gas prices rising by 14 per cent. These costs of course are passed onto ADF personnel utilising on-base, long-term and temporary accommodation. So scrapping the carbon tax has been a benefit for everyone in the country.


The coalition recognises that reserves are an important component of Australia's Defence Force. We have long supported the unique skills that reservists bring to Defence and have always supported the important work reservists carry out in order to meet the ADF's objectives both at home and abroad. There are approximately 47,000 reservists, and since 1999 over 21,000 have deployed on operations in locations in the Middle East, Timor Leste and here at home supporting disaster relief efforts. On 30 June 2014 the government announced reserve allowance reforms that reduced red tape and further recognised reservists' service obligations and contribution to capability.


This reform aligned reserve allowances with permanent ADF members' allowances and reduced the administrative burden associated with processing reserve allowances. On 25 August 2014, in recognition of the increasing integration of reservists into ADF operations, the coalition government also launched the trial Reserve Assistance Program. This program runs until 30 June this year and offers a comprehensive range of mental health and wellbeing support services.


Let us not forget it was the previous coalition government in 2001 who introduced landmark legislation to protect the rights of reservists in civilian employment and education. It was also the previous coalition government that created the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme in 2007, a scheme that provides ongoing incentives for both regular and reserve personnel to join and remain in the ADF. It was the previous coalition government who introduced the financial support scheme for employers to help offset the costs of releasing employees for Defence service along with implementing Exercise Executive Stretch, which is aimed at senior, middle and line management to show and involve them in the types of invaluable skills that can be gained through participation in ADF Reserves.


We have a good track record and I think there is no higher priority for a coalition government than ensuring our national security and that means supporting our ADF personnel. It was the Howard government upon its election in 1996 that first went about repairing and rebuilding Australia's modern defences. In the 13 Labor budgets between 1982 and 1983, and 1995 and 96 Labor cut Defence spending by 8.9 per cent in real terms. After the debt and deficit that was a consequence of the Hawke and Keating years, repairing the federal budget was a first priority but the Howard government recognised that a strong economy is critical to funding a strong Defence Force. Importantly, the Howard government quite rightly quarantined Defence from its initial budget repair work. Over that time, our economy stabilised and we grew the budget from $10.6 billion in 1995-96 to $22 billion in 2007-08, a 47 per cent increase in real terms. We wanted to provide funding certainty and assist the long-term planning needed when building capacity in Defence and that is why we released the 2000 Defence white paper, which committed to three per cent real growth for the defence budget over the following 10 years.


Once again, like Groundhog Day, a recently elected coalition government found itself needing to repair the budget and to stem the bleeding in the Defence portfolio caused by Labor's cuts. Let us remind ourselves that Labor cut $16 billion out of Defence through deferrals, through absorbed costs in the 2009 to 2022 period. As a proportion of GDP, Defence expenditure fell from the coalition's 1.75 per cent of GDP to 1.56 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. This was a figure not seen since 1938. Labor's cuts to Defence in the 2012-13 budget alone were worth $5.5 billion. That saw the largest single-year decrease in Defence expenditure, a massive 10.5 per cent, since the end of the Korean War in 1953. When Labor left office, Defence expenditure was forecast to remain below 1.7 per cent over the next decade. These cuts came despite Labor ministers stating on at least 38 separate occasions that Labor was committed to three per cent annual real growth in the Defence budget.


The coalition government has stated it will take a measured and purposeful approach to rebuilding Australia's defence forces. It is committed to increasing the Defence budget as a proportion of GDP to two per cent over the coming decade. We have provided a down payment on this commitment when this year's budget delivered a 6.1 per cent increase in funding to Defence. We are providing Defence with $29.2 billion in 2014-15 and will provide $122.7 billion over the forward estimates. The leadership and support provided to Defence by the coalition is what the Australian people are entitled to expect from the federal government and we will provide it because we understand the critical role that the Defence Force plays in ensuring our security in an uncertain world.


To conclude, while strongly supporting the serving men and women of the Australian defence forces, the coalition does not support Senator Lambie's private senator's bill. Senator Lambie's bill is the wrong solution to a problem that does not actually exist. The bill will be unnecessarily complex and, if enacted, will have a number of unintended consequences some of which, I think it is fair to say, even Senator Lambie does not intend to create. Finally, the government's move to increase the ADF pay offer from 1.5 per cent to two per cent will now provide an even higher pay increase for ADF personnel than what is provided for by Senator Lambie's bill. I would encourage the Senate not to support this bill.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:09):  I rise today to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. Can I start off by responding to Senator Bernardi and admonishing him for selectively quoting from a press conference that I did. It is very disappointing on an important issue like this to see selective quotes being used to try and support Senator Bernardi's argument. I made it very clear in that press conference that we welcomed the government's decision not to cut the real pay of our defence personnel, but I made it clear that it is only the first of the three years of the deal where this will be the case.


On the government's own inflation forecast, two per cent will again be a real pay cut, if 2.5 per cent is the expected inflation rate next year. That is the government's forecast. I accept that it can vary, but let me be very clear. What I said at that press conference was that, if we believed as the inflation numbers rolled in that the government were going to again cut the real pay, we would be coming back to debate it with them. We would not be satisfied with allowing the government to cut next year's pay in real terms, or the third year's pay in real terms. So, while we do welcome the government's decision to reverse its cut, we are not saying that we are signed up to the deal over the full three years, because if inflation is exactly what the government has forecast it to be they will again be cutting the real wage of our defence personnel.


Can I indicate Labor will support this bill. I know there are a number of senators who want to speak on this bill, so I will keep my contribution short. We are here today because the government betrayed the men and women of the ADF when they decided last year to cut their pay. This bill, as a minimum—a minimum: this is the point that needs to be made very clear—links ADF pay to the higher of the increase to CPI or parliamentary allowances. This puts in place a floor that ADF pay cannot fall beneath. Through this bill, our ADF personnel know that their pay will, at the very least, always keep up with the cost of living. Nothing in this bill stops the government of the day providing a higher increase, which is what it has been dragged kicking and screaming to do. But it will prevent the government from doing what the Abbott government so callously did last year, and that was to cut the pay of our service men and women.


We are supporting this bill because this government cannot be trusted to do the right thing. Yes, as I have said, the Prime Minister, with his leadership under increasing threat, was dragged kicking and screaming to increase the government's defence pay offer from 1.5 per cent—a real cut—to 2.0 per cent, an increase. But the government did not do it because they believed it was the right thing to do; they did it to save Mr Abbott's leadership. But this bill ensures that, if inflation moves above this belated pay increase, the ADF will not be worse off.


A future Labor government will undertake a full review of the process for the determination of ADF pay to ensure that it is effective and transparent and properly takes into account the unique nature of military service. Some history here is important. After promising not to cut defence funding before the election, the coalition government cut ADF pay at the first opportunity. In 2012 the Prime Minister told the RSL National Conference:


A ""fair go"" is the least a grateful nation can offer to serving and former military personnel.


A fair go is not cutting the ADF's pay. A fair go is not cutting ADF Christmas leave and other allowances.


In October last year, reports began to emerge that the government was offering an unfair and below-inflation increase of 1.5 per cent a year across the three-year agreement. This pay cut came into force in November, just before Christmas. This disgraceful deal was explained away by the Prime Minister as a way to drive down the pay and conditions of all Commonwealth public servants. That is right: this offer not only ignored the unique nature of military service but was a designed political strategy to attack all public servants using our military personnel as a battering ram.


ADF personnel have a special place in our society, but, unlike other workers, they cannot bargain, speak out or strike for better pay. That is a fundamentally different place from that of other workers in Australia. As the member for Fisher rightly pointed out when he criticised the Prime Minister's pay decision: 'ADF personnel are not your typical public servants.' Our service men and women undertake unique, demanding and often dangerous work on behalf of all Australians. They put their lives on the line with dedication and courage to ensure Australia is safe. Right now we have ADF personnel deployed overseas supporting international efforts against Daesh in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. We also have them working on the high seas against drug traffickers. The ADF has been working tirelessly, supporting Australians affected by the recent natural disasters in Queensland and the Northern Territory. And they are doing the same today, supporting our friends in Vanuatu. This is why we have seen such a community backlash at the government for cutting the pay of our ADF personnel.


Australians instinctively respect and understand the ADF's contribution to our society. That is why it has not just been Labor that has been outraged by the Prime Minister's decision. Senator Lambie has been extremely vocal in her calls for the Prime Minister to pay the ADF more, and it is her bill that we debate today. Other crossbenchers have done the same. But this is an issue on which the community has also made its voice heard. The RSL and the Defence Force Welfare Association have pushed hard against this pay cut. And so have ADF families; they, more than anyone else, know how shameful this decision was.


I was proud to be able to receive a petition from Tony Dagger, whose son is in the army. Mr Dagger's petition called for a fair pay deal for ADF personnel and, in less than two months, it received more than 60,000 signatures.


But, as we have seen, with policy backflip after policy backflip, this Prime Minister only acts when his own job is at risk. He did not listen to the opposition leader when he wrote to him twice before the end of last year asking the Prime Minister to reconsider his unfair offer. He did not listen to opposition members and senators when they called on him to reverse the decision. He certainly did not listen to the minor parties. He did not listen to Senator Lambie. He did not listen to Mr Tony Dagger and his 60-thousand-strong petition. He did not listen to the soldier who said that the deal was 'essentially a kick in the teeth to every soldier, airman and sailor'. He did not listen to the RSL. He did not listen to the Defence Force Welfare Association when they told him:


The feeling within the Australian Defence Force … is as negative as I've ever seen it.


All of these groups and people pressured the Prime Minister over the unfair pay deal. They all told him this pay cut was the wrong captain's pick to make. But make no mistake: the only reason Tony Abbott backflipped on ADF pay was to save his own job. He was not interested in how his decision affected ADF personnel; he was only interested in his own job.


The government's new deal is an improvement. At two per cent, it is above the current inflation rate. The bill does not stop the government offering above-inflation pay deals. As I have said previously, this bill provides for a floor so that ADF personnel know they will not again get a below-inflation pay deal.


This bill should not be necessary but, because of the meanness and the unfairness of this government, it is. I urge all senators to support it.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-19,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  The Greens rise to support Senator Lambie's bill, the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014, and I am glad that it has been brought forward. Senators may remember—I think it was probably in the last or the second last sitting week of the 2014 parliamentary year—that we attempted to suspend standing orders, because at that point it looked as though the Prime Minister was planning on ignoring the calls from across the political spectrum and across the community. With some regret, we saw the suspension motion fail and we were not actually able to get on with substantive debate on the bill. I want to thank Senator Lambie for bringing this forward today, and I look forward to committing this bill to a vote.


When you consider that the annual national Defence budget is slated to grow to around $30.7 billion by 2016 and that the government is in the middle of two of the largest capital acquisition projects probably in the history of defence—the acquisition of the F35 Joint Strike Fighter and the highly-contested and divisive process that has been rolling for years around submarine procurement—the idea that the Prime Minister thought it was appropriate within weeks of committing ADF elements back into Iraq to offer a below-inflation pay deal and then stick to it was extraordinary.


What this bill does, rather than fixing a three per cent figure, is basically make sure that this can never happen again—that a Prime Minister or a government of the day, faced with budget circumstances entirely of their own making, would take a cohort of people, who from time to time will be called on to risk their lives or serious physical or mental injury in the line of their ordinary course of duty and who have no industrial representation. They cannot actually get their unions to go out in front, they cannot go on strike, and they basically have no real recourse. The passing of this bill will ensure that this can never happen again. The government will not be limited in the upper limit of a pay offer it could make to ADF personnel, but it would prevent the Prime Minister of the day doing what Prime Minister Tony Abbott tried to do, which was to offer a below-inflation pay increase to people who really have no recourse and no way of contesting that kind of appalling decision.


The Australian Greens believe that we have, essentially, a twofold obligation to our serving personnel. The first is that we should never deploy them unless it is absolutely necessary. We are well aware that in the past 15 years the ADF have been deployed into three wars of choice. I do not propose to get into arguments about where that decision should lie, or even the merits of those particular deployments. But we owe it to them—in fact, I think it is our highest responsibility—not to throw them into harm's way unless there is the very best possible reason for doing so. Obviously, we strongly disagree with some of the decisions that have been made in the recent past.


The second obligation we owe them is to look after them, both while they are on deployment and particularly when they come back. For anybody who is not aware of what I am talking about, view a Four Corners program that ran not long ago, or read Major General John Cantwell's book Exit Wounds, to get a vivid insight into what happens to some of these people who have been exposed to horrific violence—and these are some of the most highly-trained and disciplined people the ADF has—who, when they return, are basically unable to decompress and assimilate the things that they have seen and done, having been at very close quarters to people being killed or injured, or having suffering horrific injuries themselves.


One of the things that I was not aware of until that Four Corners piece was the fact that it may well be that suicide deaths of personnel after they have returned from deployment may be three times higher than the 41 combat deaths that Australia suffered during the Afghanistan conflict. The most distressing thing is that we do not actually know if that is true. It could in fact be higher. So people return with these invisible wounds and then they are actually, in many instances, very poorly treated, partly by the culture of the ADF, in which it is seen as a sign of weakness to admit that you are having a rough time, and partly by the intense bureaucracy. In one instance, DVA cleared one young soldier's payout and assistance two weeks after he killed himself. We are tying people up in a paralysing web of bureaucracy when actually they need our help.


I guess that second point is the idea that we have an obligation—not that parliamentarians in this place ever put their names to a motion to deploy, because of course that power still rests with the Prime Minister's office. But nonetheless it is amazing TV fodder for politicians to wrap themselves up in the flag and stand in front of the troops before sending them off into harm's way. But it is much harder to find politicians who will stand up for people who are suffering inordinately once they return home. It is that obligation to take care of these people that I think Senator Lambie's bill goes through today.


I think it is entirely responsible—rather than setting a hard and fast rate of pay increase, which we do not really do for any other cohorts—that we set effectively a rate that would float and would not be allowed to fall below the rate of inflation. Linking it to politicians' pay is cheeky, but nonetheless it is one way of ensuring that these people are not forgotten.


So the Australian Greens are pleased to support this bill. I look forward to committing it to a vote, and I think this debate can usefully be used as a way for those who have collectively sent soldiers into war, particularly those who turned up at the press conferences or spent—as I was very fortunate to do—a couple of days on deployment with them, to learn a bit. Politicians enjoy the political limelight, such as it is, but we should ask ourselves, 'What have we done since for these people?' particularly when we are given an opportunity, as we are being given this morning, to ensure—which is one of the least things we can do—that these people are paid fairly.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (10:27):  I too rise today to speak on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014. On 1 December last year, I rose in this place to speak on the initial ADF pay offer of 1.5 per cent per annum. At that time, I noted the budget constraints and the need to make tough decisions in today's fiscal environment, but I also noted the requirement to ensure it was a fair and reasonable outcome in the circumstances. Earlier this month, after quiet but persistent lobbying by me and many of my coalition colleagues, a fair and reasonable offer was proposed to the minister.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! I remind—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cameron may not take this issue seriously, but I can assure the Senate that I do.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, I remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly. Senator Reynolds, please continue.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. Earlier this month, after quiet lobbying by me and my coalition colleagues, a fair and reasonable offer was proposed to the minister, and subsequently the government announced that it had recommended the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal increase the pay offer to two per cent annum.


Initially, I would like to commend Senator Lambie's intent, and I support the sentiment that she shows behind this bill. While we certainly have different styles and approaches, I have absolutely no doubt that both of us want what is in the best interests of those who serve in uniform and the families who serve in partnership with them.


The first duty of any federal government is to protect the nation. The Australian Defence Force fulfils this responsibility on behalf of us all. Every single year, our service men and women reconfirm their availability and their readiness to deploy on operations and put their lives in harm's way in service of our country and of all Australians. Military service, in this fundamental respect, is unique.


For their part, Australians accept the moral obligation to preserve the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of our men and women in uniform and their families, who make their service to our nation possible. The government of the day is custodian of this covenant or moral obligation on behalf of all Australians. We have this moral obligation not only to our uniformed personnel but also to their families.


ADF personnel are not public servants. Their roles differ substantially from those of public servants, and their roles are unique. The contribution they make to us all is unique. No-one I know—and no-one I have ever met in 29 years in the Army—serves our nation for the pay, but pay and conditions must always be fair. Our moral obligation to our men and women in uniform goes much further than simply pay and conditions. Our reciprocal obligation is to ensure that those who serve are as safe and prepared as they can be. This means not only in pay and conditions but also in ensuring the best possible equipment, training, health, housing and other support for their families and themselves are provided to them. Senator Bernardi has listed these in great detail. It is entirely appropriate and right that the employment conditions of the ADF uniformed personnel are handled very differently from public servants, because ADF personnel are not public servants.


I would like to address some of the deep concerns I have with this bill and its unintended consequences. One of the underpinning provisions of the explanatory memorandum of this bill states:


The members of the ADF have their pay assessed arbitrarily by the Minister of Defence (the Minister) under section 58B of the Defence Act 1903.


I argue that this entire premise underpinning the bill is not correct. The Minister for Defence does not make determinations on ADF pay. In fact, under the act, this power is reserved specifically to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, the DFRT, pursuant to section 58H(2)(a) of the Defence Act.


Unlike what is said in the explanatory memorandum, the powers of the minister in relation to ADF remuneration, under section 58(B) of the Defence Act, relate to determinations regarding conditions of service for ADF members other than salary—that is, not pay. These determinations in the past have included housing benefits, relocation support, leave entitlements, the Abbott government's rollout of the ADF Family Health Program and a range of other non-salary related allowances. 


In fact, the Hawke government, in the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 1984 established a Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, which comprises three independent members: the vice president of Fair Work Australia, a person experienced in industrial relations matters and a person who has been a member of the ADF. This is a fundamental and critical fact that this bill has ignored and therefore renders it invalid.


The DFRT was established by Labor to ensure that all decisions and determinations made in relation to ADF pay are relevant to the contemporary roles and living and working environments of personnel serving in the ADF. This is a 30-year precedent—established by the Labor Party—which has worked very well until now. The DFRT determinations are to be made taking into account the special skills and capabilities required of ADF members and their unique employment circumstances. Last year, the DFRT determination was to offer a 1.5 per cent pay increase and was made with these considerations in mind.


In the aftermath of the decision to offer a 1.5 per cent pay increase to ADF personnel, I received a significant number of representations from serving and retired members of the ADF about the appropriateness of that outcome. I am also aware that many of my coalition colleagues—who enjoy very close working relationships with their Defence communities in their own electorates—received similar representations. The critical difference from those opposite is that we all understood that any pay outcome for uniformed personnel could not add further per pressure to this government's efforts to repair the economic damage done to this country by the previous Labor and Labor-Greens governments.


So, after carefully considering the extensive feedback we received on this matter, Andrew Nikolic and I approached the Minister for Defence with what we believed was a sensible and workable solution in the current fiscal environment—as did, I know, many of our colleagues—and that was a two per cent pay increase. Another powerful and ultimately persuasive argument to the minister was the fact that under the last government, the Labor government, the wage increases of ADF uniformed personnel lagged behind those of the APS workforce by up to 25 per cent. We believed, therefore, that this recommendation was not only appropriate but affordable.


The second serious concern I would like to raise in relation to this bill is its stated intent that it:


… ensures fairness in the assessment of annual wage increases for members of the Australian defence force by linking Defence Force pay to the higher of increases in Parliamentary allowance and CPI.


Again I congratulate and acknowledge Senator Lambie for the intent behind it, because I know it is a genuine intent to look after our men and women in uniform; I know this. But the practical consequences of this would be to see the ADF pay actually go backwards, and I will explain why. If ADF personnel's pay were tied to inflation, they would be worse off than under the currently proposed two per cent. That is because politicians and senior public servants have actually had their pay frozen to zero since last year, and the Prime Minister has given absolutely no indication that this decision will be overturned in the foreseeable future, so it is a zero per cent pay increase for parliamentarians. So we have a start point of zero per cent. As Senator Bernardi just said, currently the inflation rate is 1.7 per cent, but forward forecasts are that it will decrease, possibly below 1.5 per cent. So this bill is actually mandating an increase between zero and probably somewhere around 1.5 per cent, which would clearly mandate that ADF pay would in fact go backwards from what is currently proposed. That is, I know, absolutely an unintended consequence. I believe it is certainly not the intent of Senator Lambie that this would happen.


I would now like to address some of the technical detail in aspects of this bill, because I have some background in this area. All of us in this place know that the devil and sometimes further unintended consequences are in the detail of the legislation. Firstly, the explanatory memorandum and second reading speech for the bill appear to show that the bill's intent is to apply a minimum to the 'annual increases' arising from a Workplace Remuneration Arrangement, or WRA, type review. However, the definitions in the bill are far broader than just a minimum increase in the pay. I am sure, again, this is another unintended consequence of the wording of this bill. After a close review of the amendments, I believe it would be totally unworkable, and I will now explain why.


A definition that helps establish this potentially far broader scope than that indicated by Senator Lambie, the Labor Party and the Greens is that the proposed section 58Z defines Defence Force pay as 'salary (within the meaning of Division 2)'. Division 2 is the division actually dealing with the DFRT itself. The impact of that is that the bill affects all salary, not just annual increases. It might not sound significant, but it has wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts on the DFRT and on our service personnel.


A Defence Force pay determination is defined as 'a determination made by the Minister under division 1'—or section 58B—'or by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal under Division 2, in relation to Defence Force pay'. The practical implication of this is that the bill can impact on many more determinations than just those dealing with pay adjustments. It might sound innocuous, but I can assure this place that it is far from innocuous. Under existing section 58H(2)(a) of the act, the DFRT shall 'inquire into and determine the salaries and relevant allowances to be paid to members'—I stress 'relevant allowances to be paid to members'. This function is not limited to making 'annual increases' to ADF salaries, as currently determined under the recent Workplace Remuneration Arrangement.


Therefore, by extending to salary determinations, this bill potentially affects all of the DFRT work on salaries and not just the annual adjustments, as per the stated intent of the bill. The implications of that are wide ranging and have yet been unacknowledged by those opposite. For example, the DFRT can and does regularly review and determine individual salary placements and increases applying to employment categories within one of the services or triservice categories such as specialist structures for doctors, dentists, lawyers or our chaplains. This is part of the tribunal's day-to-day business and there is already a statutory requirement to review such determinations at least every two years, under section 58H(6) of the act.


Due to the broad definition of 'defence pay determination', the complex formula in the operative clause of this bill, clause 58ZC, would need to be applied to all of those individual pay reviews, not just the annual salary increase. This would force the tribunal to factor in the calculation of CPI and parliamentary allowances each and every time it makes one of its hundreds of salary determinations, remembering that under the proposed changes the calculation would currently result in lower rates, not higher rates. So proposed section 58ZC would introduce a mandatory formula into all Defence Force pay determinations and not just those suggested in the bill. The tribunal, in making any salary determination, would need to include a calculation that converts any amount it decides upon into a percentage increase for the purposes of working out a minimum salary increase, using the amount and rate comparison set out in the proposed new section 58ZC.


What is important to remember is that when the ADF seeks to adjust its pay structures it does so in two ways. First of all, there are general movements such as annual increases, which must be applied across all structures. But the ADF also makes adjustments to individual categories, which usually occur within the constraints of the existing pay points within the system.


The most recent WRA decision is applied to all salary structures and relevant allowances determined by the tribunal, and this occurs on average every two years. This matter has usually been progressed under section 58KD of the act, which states:


The Tribunal may, in making a determination, give effect to any agreement reached between the Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Chief of the Defence Force …


The interpretation of this section has always been one that suggests that giving effect to a section 58KD agreement does not give the tribunal scope to vary the agreed pay increase put before it. The tribunal in these circumstances essentially has a choice to say yes or no. In those circumstances, any application of the proposed new section 58ZC would have to occur between the parties agreeing on the matter to be put before the tribunal. I believe this in itself makes this proposal uncertain and unworkable for the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.


The bottom line in all of this technical detail, I believe, is that the scope of this bill applies beyond its intended target of annual salary increases. If it were clearly restricted to this intended target of salary alone, the detrimental effect of this bill would be lessened, although the system would become even more complex than it is and, in practicality, unworkable for the DFRT.


Additionally, as the WRA also applies to relevant allowances determined by the tribunal, including service allowances, and there is no requirement to apply clause 58ZC to that part of ADF remuneration, the bill could potentially cause additional distortions to the current ADF remuneration. For example, the service allowance is a stand-alone payment for ADF personnel of major-equivalent ranks and below. However, the service allowance for lieutenant colonel equivalents and above was rolled into their salaries in the 1980s and continues to be a component of these people's salaries. To not apply consistent increases to salary and relevant allowances of this type would cause further salary distortion. I know, Senator Lambie, that was not your intent in this bill, but that would be the practical implication.


If this bill was introduced, I believe the integrity of ADF pay structures for GOPS and GORPS would be impacted on by the application of this new section to individual employment category cases, which is fundamentally the day-to-day work of the tribunal. That is because any increase to individual pay placements would have to match the minimum pay clause, creating a range of additional pay points, distorting relativities between placements and creating distortion of the complete salary structures. With around 1,300 pay points remunerating more than 500 employment categories across all three services, the operation of Senator Lambie's proposed section 58ZC, with its minimum requirement for all adjustments the ADF seeks to make, I believe would completely distort this structure and render it almost unachievable.


In conclusion, I believe that the two per cent increase per annum for our ADF personnel that has already been negotiated is a fair outcome in our current circumstances. It represents the utmost respect that this government has for our defence forces and acknowledges the critical role they perform in ensuring a safe and secure Australia for us all. While I genuinely commend Senator Lambie for this initiative and the intent behind it, I cannot in good conscience support this bill because it would significantly disadvantage our brave men and women in uniform, who dedicate their lives to serving Australia, and their families. I know that was not her intent, but that is what the impact would be. It would make them worse off. For those reasons, I cannot support this bill.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (10:47):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. I think it would be fair to say at the outset that there is not a senator elected to this chamber who is not fully supportive of the Australian Defence Force and the contribution its members make and have made over an extremely long period of time. I think it is unfortunate that they have found themselves in this situation where they were let down—if not something more serious—by this government.


I want to pick up on a couple of points that Senator Reynolds made in her contribution. The first point was on repairing the budget. There are ways of repairing the budget, and I want to give one very specific example. The Public Works Committee, which is charged with examining Defence expenditure, had a proposal put to it to build 50 houses at RAAF Base Tindal. The bespoke, architecturally designed houses were to cost $89.4 million. The committee found that that was not value for money. After a number of hearings and a number of examinations of this situation that was put to it, another model was put up to build 50 tropical designed dwellings using the Defence Housing Association as business as usual to design and construct a delivery model at a cost of $47.15 million. If you are serious about repairing the budget and examining Defence expenditure then you can find an instance on the public record that was subject to public hearings where $40-odd million was saved in one project. It gives you an understanding of how deeply and widely felt the antagonism towards this government's decision clearly is. We see these projects ad hoc. Defence is a large part of the expenditure that goes to the Public Works Committee. We test whether it is value for money and fit for purpose in the public interest. If we can put up an example of where $40 million was proposed to be spent and a business-as-usual model delivered a $40 million saving, how do the people in Defence feel when they cannot get a modest increase when clearly there are savings to be made—and not insignificant ones?


Whilst repairing the budget is the goal of all governments, at what cost should it be? Should it be at the cost of the people who put their limbs and lives on the line every day in the service of this country? I think not. I think, actually, there is bipartisan support for that. I really do. I think there are many people in the coalition ranks who think that this is grossly unfair. I think their numbers are quite significant. There are a number who have gone on the public record to say that. The simple facts are that they should not be in this position. This is a fight that they should not have had to have.


Take the Prime Minister's comment that no-one in the public sector will be paid a higher rate of increase than our Defence Force—that is factually incorrect. If you look at the relevant agreements you will see that the CSIRO will receive an increase of 2.8 per cent per year for the next three years. Airservices Australia will receive a 5.1 per cent pay rise over the next 15 months up to July 2016. Future Fund employees have been reported to be receiving a three per cent annual pay increase. So is it any wonder that our serving men and women are feeling let down? Is it any wonder at all that the various stakeholders who support those men and women in the Defence Force are agitating for a better deal? There is no wonder at all.


This is really the consequence of the bravado of this government. After gaining a significant electoral victory, they said, 'The next thing we are going to do is chop.' There are some places you do not chop. In my view, Australian Defence Force personnel are entitled to a respectable, ongoing increase in their wages and conditions commensurate with the level of commitment that they give to this country without having to agitate in the way that they have been forced to this time. If the government are serious about budget repair, I suggest they have a very close look at some of the procurement contracts and expenditure that are ongoing in our Defence Force as we speak, rather than taking money out of the pockets of those hardworking men and women of our Australian Defence Force.

At the end of the motion, add, ""but, in respect of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014, the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 25 June 2015."".


I recognise that this is slightly unorthodox and it is not something that we do lightly. It is reasonably rare that the chamber would seek to dispute or amend a report of the Selection of Bills Committee, but this is an unusual occasion. I understand that the member for Wentworth, the Minister for Communications, Mr Turnbull, has just adjourned the second-reading debate on the data retention bill in the House, so it may be some time yet before this matter comes before the Senate.


Let us understand what they have been conducting in the other place. They have just conducted an entire second-reading debate on a bill that none of them have seen. The minister and, presumably, Mr Shorten and the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, have done some kind of handshake deal in the dead of night to come to some sort of agreement to buy the Labor Party's assent to a two-year mandatory data retention proposal for the entire country, but nobody—not a single member of the House of Representatives—has seen the amendments, because they have not yet been drafted. They are being drafted as we speak. I think it is extraordinary, given the immense degree of controversy that this proposal has attracted, that our colleagues in the other place have been forced to debate a bill which is proposed to be heavily amended but whose amendments have not been seen.


There has been a lot of commentary that concerns are overblown or that there may have been some kind of fix arranged between Mr Shorten and Mr Abbott to buy the Labor Party's support for Senator Brandis and for the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, but the fact is that the dissent and opposition to mandatory data retention for this country is widespread and very deep. There was a joint letter this week from Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, M2, iiNet, Macquarie Telecom and a host of other telecommunications providers demanding to know how much this thing is going to cost and who will pay. The Australian government does not know to within the nearest $100 million who will be paying this surveillance tax. The fact is, we all will either through higher data charges or through higher taxes. I do not recall hearing then opposition leader Tony Abbott or any of the other spokespeople on that side of the chamber announcing a $400 million surveillance tax before the 2013 election. Nonetheless, that is what we are faced with. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the journalists union, irrespective of whatever deal has been done between Mr Shorten and Mr Abbott, has been scathing about the fact that the government seems intent on pursuing journalists and their sources. That should not occur in a democracy.


Senator Brandis has pointed out, quite rightly, that this bill does not change the existing arrangements, and that is precisely the problem. It welds on two years worth of additional data which can be indiscriminately accessed by agencies. Nobody has seen the amendments in the deal that has been done between the Labor Party and Prime Minister Abbott, but we would want to look at them very closely. We do not believe that debate should proceed in this place until the amendments have been seen and considered by the legal and constitutional affairs committee, and that is what this motion goes to today. The bill was not referred, as it properly should have been, to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. 


What this motion proposes—and we respectfully dissent from the Selection of Bills Committee's view on this matter—is that the bill be given a thorough airing because so many issues that have been raised have simply been pushed under the carpet: how much will it cost, who will pay? 


Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim has raised significant concerns, as have Human Rights Commissioner Triggs, the Law Council of Australia, the Communications Alliance, the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association and Councils for Civil Liberties right across the country; and business groups, including Blueprint for Free Speech, ThoughtWorks, the Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Institute of Public Affairs—not a group who would traditionally be lining up to support the Greens, and for me that underlines the fact that this is beyond Left and Right. This is not something that should have become as partisan as it has, but it is hardly a left-wing position to argue against increasing the power of the state over private individuals for indiscriminate surveillance. That is why we have groups like the Institute of Public Affairs coming out against this, as well as the Australian Privacy Foundation, and Electronic Frontiers Australia, who have been staunch in their opposition to this proposal and staunch in their advocacy for digital rights.


There are so many unknown costs and very poorly described benefits associated with this bill that it should be immediately referred for committee review. (Time expired)

That the Senate—


(a) congratulates the Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilience and Safer Communities for being the first private sector organisation to win the prestigious 2015 United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Risk Reduction;


(b) notes the work of the Productivity Commission that the Federal Government has spent record levels of over $13.7 billion on post-disaster relief and recovery in the past decade, while outlays on pre-disaster mitigation were only 3 per cent of this figure;


(c) notes the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events as global temperatures rise; and


(d) calls on the Federal Government to invest in pre-disaster mitigation in order to reduce post-disaster spending, while saving homes, lives, critical infrastructure and reducing insurance premiums.


I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MILNE:
  I want to draw attention to the operational paragraph, which calls on the government to invest in pre-disaster mitigation in order to reduce post-disaster spending. I want to make it clear that it is not one substituting for the other; I would want both pre-disaster spending and post-disaster spending. This is not a cost-shifting exercise to the states. It clearly is not that; it is about recognising that if you spend money up-front, you are likely to save yourself on the actual amount you have to spend afterwards, but it does not actually suggest that you would not be spending afterwards.

Senator FIFIELD:
  We congratulate the business roundtable for achieving a certificate of distinction in the 2015 United Nations Sasakawa awards for risk reduction. The awards ceremony form part of the third United Nations world conference on disaster risk reduction, which was attended by the Minister for Justice in Japan over the weekend. During the UN conference, the minister spoke about the Productivity Commission inquiry, that the inquiry was commissioned at the request of all states and territories in recognition of the increasing impacts of disasters in recent years. 


Since 2009, natural disasters around the country have claimed more than 200 lives, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 homes and devastated hundreds of thousands of Australians. While extreme weather is affecting life in this country, the commission's draft report found that demographic factors, including where and how we build, are leaving us increasingly exposed. More focus is needed on how we can be better prepared and how we can target our investments to get the best outcomes for individuals, communities and businesses and governments. The reforms being considered by the inquiry are complex and wide-ranging, and the government will respond once it has had the opportunity to thoroughly consider all options.


Question agreed to.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (11:37):  I thank my fellow senators for contributing to this important debate on the Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill, together with the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014, passed by the parliament in December last year, forms a package of legislative reforms required to increase efficiency and enhance integrity in the protection status determination process. Specifically, the measures in this bill respond to the challenges in the onshore component of Australia's humanitarian program and aim to reduce fraud, improve administrative processes and provide greater consistency and quality in protection assessment outcomes.


I would like to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for their consideration and reports on this bill. Following consideration of these reports and in response to concerns that have been raised by my fellow senators regarding certain measures in the bill, I can advise the Senate that the government has tabled an addendum to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which provides further detail on certain amendments made by schedules 1 and 4 of the bill. These measures relate to the identity and integrity measures in schedule 1 of the bill, specifically proposed sections 91W, 91W(a) and 43A; and to the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Tribunal integrity measures relating to providing oral statements of reasons following an oral decision.


I also foreshadow that at the committee stage I will be moving some amendments to the bill on behalf of the government. These amendments will amend schedule 3 to take into account the reintroduction of temporary protection visas by the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014, amend schedule 4 to increase the time frame from seven to 14 days in which an application for reinstatement may be made by a review applicant who fails to appear before the MRT or the RRT and whose application was subsequently dismissed as a result of that nonattendance, and add a new schedule 5 to the bill. This new schedule amends references to the bill in the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014 and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Act 2014 as the references currently refer to this bill as being enacted in 2014.


I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for their report on the bill and note the additional comments from Labor senators and the Greens' dissenting report. I remind the chamber that with this bill the government is striking the right balance between fairness and supporting an effective and coherent protection determination process which responds to the evolving challenges in the asylum seeker caseload arising from judicial decisions and management of the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals. The government is also ensuring the system works more efficiently, therefore reducing costs and delay.


Implementation of this bill does not mean Australia will resile from its protection obligations; in fact, the government is seeking to restore the same threshold that was adopted by the Labor government for assessing Australia's complementary protection obligations.


I thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights for the comments in relation to this bill. The government's position is that the measures in this bill are reasonable, necessary and proportionate to achieve its legitimate objective, which I have already stated: to reduce fraud, improve administrative processes and provide greater consistency and quality in protection assessment outcomes. Decision makers are obliged to act in good faith to fully assess a protection visa application and afford procedural fairness to asylum seekers as required by the code of procedure in the Migration Act. A primary application information service will provide application assistance to those who are considered vulnerable.


I would also like to thank the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for its contribution to this bill. Former Minister Morrison and I have provided further information and advice as requested by the committee. I note the committee's comments in relation to guidance decisions and reiterate that this measure seeks to align and reduce inconsistencies in decision making. It is still for the tribunal to ensure that a correct and preferable decision is reached on the merits of a case.


I now remind the Senate of some of the key measures in this bill. While the Australian community has long accepted a responsibility to provide refuge to people who engage our protection obligations, the reciprocal responsibilities of people who seek protection in Australia were not clear in our law. The protection and other measures bill will state those responsibilities on the face of our legislation. If a person wants our help, that person is obliged to show good faith and honestly state their case as to who they are and why they need Australia's protection. As a result of this bill, applicants will need to provide documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship or have taken reasonable steps to do so in order to be granted a protection visa.


Establishing an applicant's identity is a keystone of making a decision to grant or refuse any visa. This is especially the case for protection visa applicants because their identity, nationality or citizenship can have a direct bearing on whether they engage Australia's protection obligations. Identity in the global age is increasingly complex to determine, and many people hold dual or multiple nationalities or seek an advantage from not disclosing their genuine identity. Proposed sections 91W and 91W(a) empower decision makers to refuse applicants who provide bogus documents or destroy or discard documentary evidence of heir identity, nationality or citizenship. An applicant who does not give a reasonable explanation of these types of actions and does not provide or take reasonable steps to provide genuine proof of identity, nationality or citizenship will have their protection visa application refused. The same applies to an applicant who has destroyed or discarded identity documents or has caused that to happen at the hands of another person such as a people smuggler. It is appropriate to refuse a protection visa where an applicant fails or refuses to comply with a request to establish their identity where it is in fact possible for them to do so


Again I note that these measures are aimed at encouraging applicants to comply with these requirements. They do not mean Australia will resile from its protection obligations. These measures make it clear that Australians expect protection visa applications to be made in good faith and with full disclosure of identity. Cooperation is the key in these cases. The proposed changes also respect the fact that in some circumstances, including some cases where a person is stateless, it may not be possible for a protection visa applicant to provide documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship even if they want to and have taken all reasonable step to do so. The requirement that an applicant has taken reasonable steps has been included to accommodate these circumstances. Other instances that constitute having taken reasonable steps may include an applicant contacting family and friends in their home country to obtain existing documentary evidence of identity, nationality or citizenship; obtaining such evidence from the authorities of their home country in cases where an applicant is claiming harm from a nonstate actor, for example an organised criminal group; or obtaining such evidence from a safe third country where they may have previously resided. However, to be clear, there is no expectation on an applicant to approach the authorities of the country from which they fear state persecution.


The proposed section 5AAA clarifies a noncitizen's responsibility regarding their protection claims by legislating that it is the asylum seeker's responsibility to specify all particulars of their claim and to provide sufficient evidence to establish that claim. This measure formalises a reasonable expectation and is consistent with practices in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It does not change the decision maker's duty to evaluate and ascertain all of the relevant facts—it simply clarifies that it is not the decision maker's role to advocate on behalf of the applicant. Notwithstanding this amendment, the government acknowledges that there will be always a small number of vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, who may not be able to clearly present their claims without assistance.


The government will continue to have arrangements in place to provide funded application assistance to a small number of the most vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, through a primary application information service. Section 5AAA works in tandem with the new section 423A to encourage protection visa applicants to provide all of their claims and supporting evidence as soon as possible. It sends a clear message that if claims can be presented and supported at the initial application stage, they should be. Section 423A does not empower the Refugee Review Tribunal to disregard new claims or evidence but, rather, to draw an inference unfavourable to the credibility of claims or evidence presented before the tribunal for the first time unless the applicant provides a reasonable explanation to justify why the claims or evidence were not raised before the primary decision was made by the department. The Refugee Review Tribunal will be required to notify an applicant and give them a reasonable period in which to respond if they propose to draw an inference unfavourable to the applicant due to presenting new claims or evidence. This measure will also work in conjunction with the Refugee Review Tribunal's already existing legal obligations under case law and procedural fairness requirements under the Migration Act.


I note that questions have been raised about the meaning of 'reasonable explanation'. Decision makers are bound to act in good faith to fully assess protection visa applications and afford procedural fairness to visa applicants in accordance with the codes of procedure in the migration act. A reasonable explanation is generally credible and does not run counter to or at variance with generally known facts. The bill also brings in measures that affect the Migration Review Tribunal and the RRT. These measures will improve efficiency and provide greater consistency of outcomes for review applicants without affecting the independence of the merits review process. The principal member of the MRT-RRT will be empowered to issue practice directions about review procedures and processing practices, as well as issue guidance decisions to tribunal members, although individual tribunal members will continue to have sole responsibility for making their decisions independently according to the merits of each case. The tribunals will also have the discretionary power to provide an oral rather than written statement of reasons following an oral decision, but a written one will be available on request within 14 days. It is not anticipated that oral decisions and statements will be made in complex cases but will be reserved only for a review of cases involving simple facts and very straightforward statutory interpretation where the relevant case law is well settled.


The bill as currently drafted also legislates the same threshold for assessing complementary protection claims that was originally put in place by the Labor government. Under the bill, Australia's non-refoulement obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment will be engaged if it is found to be more likely than not that a person seeking protection would suffer a significant harm if returned to a receiving country. The 'more likely than not' threshold was initially adopted by the Labor government when the complementary protection provisions were first introduced into the Migration Act in March 2012 but was stated in policy rather than on the face of the legislation. This threshold was lowered by subsequent full Federal Court decisions which adopted the 'real chance' test that applies to the refugees convention. The government does not accept that the real chance threshold adopted by the full Federal Court accurately reflects Australia's obligations under the ICCPR and the CAT. The real chance threshold is considered by the High Court to be less than a 50 per cent chance of harm and it could be as low as a 10 per cent chance. The government considers the more likely than not threshold—the same threshold adopted by the Labor government, and considered to be a greater than 50 per cent chance—to be more appropriate and an acceptable position open to Australia under international law. However, to be clear, decision makers do not need to calculate a risk of harm according to a mathematical formula or in statistical terms. The individual circumstances and merits of each case are considered before a decision is made. Expressing the risk threshold as a percentage is simply an explanatory tool. The government still maintains the more likely than not threshold is the most appropriate. Having said this, the government recognises the voting intention of the majority of senators and expects that schedule 2 will be removed at the committee stage.


In summary, the bill deserves the support of all parties. This bill is about enhancing integrity in Australia's protection visa determination process. It incorporates the expectations of the Australian community and internationally accepted principles of refugee status determination in Australia's domestic law. I commend the bill to the Senate. I also table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum.

Could the minister please outline the purpose of those additions to the explanatory memorandum and the impact that they will have on those affected by this bill overall.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (11:59):  I, unfortunately, have to say that I do not think that anything I actually say is going to change the way that Senator Hanson-Young votes in relation to this particular piece of legislation. Quite frankly, I think I am wasting the committee's and the Senate's time in seeking to address something upon which the government and the Australian Greens are fundamentally at different ends of the political spectrum. I do not think there is one part of this legislation that Senator Hanson-Young is going to agree to. But, Senator Hanson-Young, I have tabled the explanatory memoranda and I refer you to them.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:00):  I take that to mean that perhaps the minister does not want to have a conversation about this. However, at the last minute, we have received a nine-page addition to the explanatory memorandum. For the sake of clarity, I would like the minister to explain why this was needed and the impacts of it. I think this is what the committee stage is for: being able to understand the legislation better and to inform not just us as legislators but of course those interpreting the act once it passes. It is absolutely in line with what we do in this place. If the minister does not like it, perhaps she is in the wrong house.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:01):  If Senator Hanson-Young had actually listened to my summing up speech she may have been enlightened as to the reasons that the explanatory memorandum has been updated. 


The purpose of the addendum is to provide additional material to the explanatory memorandum to the Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The addendum is a response to a request by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its 10th report of 2014 dated 27 August 2014 and questions that had arisen in relation to certain measures in this bill as it progressed through the Senate. I am happy if the senator would like me to re-read exactly what I have already read into the Hansard. Following consideration of and reports by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, we have:


tabled an addendum to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which provides further detail on certain amendments made by schedules 1 and 4 of the bill. These measures relate


as I have already stated—


to the identity and integrity measures in schedule 1 of the bill, specifically proposed sections 91W, 91W(a) and 43A; and to the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Tribunal integrity measures relating to providing oral statements of reasons following an oral decision.


In relation to the reasons for providing an oral decision, again, I took the Senate through those in my summing-up speech, where I stated:


The tribunals will also have the discretionary power to provide an oral rather than written statement of reasons following an oral decision, but a written one will be available—


and this was one of the concerns that was raised—


on request within 14 days. It is not anticipated that oral decisions and statements will be made in complex cases but will be reserved only for a review of cases involving simple facts and very straightforward statutory interpretation where the relevant case law is well settled.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:04):  Could the minister enlighten us as to why this was needed in the explanatory memorandum rather than as an amendment in the legislation itself. It would make much more sense to safeguard against anybody being subject to a miscarriage of justice by having it in the legislation itself rather than in the explanatory memorandum. Perhaps I am missing something: could the minister explain why the government's advice is that it should be in the EM rather than the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,15,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:05):  The minister will no doubt answer the inquiry just made by the Greens senator. I chaired the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee where we went into this bill in great detail. The senator who has just spoken is a participating member of that committee and usually involves herself in deliberations relating to migration matters. 


The Greens senator, had she been paying attention at the Senate committee inquiries, would have known when these issues that the minister has just referred to were raised. She would also have seen the majority report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which went through these matters in some detail. In fact, the government's amendments and additions to the explanatory memorandum were exactly what the committee by majority agreed to. 


I cannot help but agree with the minister in that this seems to be an ongoing campaign by the Greens political party simply to garner some political support by what I call the migration industry—an industry that has grown up and which does not like some of the things which, effectively, bring some order and regularity to our immigration system and the way we deal with claims from asylum seekers. 


Much of the work of the committee is extended because of questions by the representatives of the Greens political party, who never seem to listen to the evidence but simply, as is appropriate to their political outcomes, raise issues which have already been raised and spoken about and explained by various of the witnesses. But the Greens political party seem to just use these proceedings to run out the standard mantra that they always use. It does not matter what the bill is, there is a series of emotive words used by the Greens political party about any migration matter, whether it is relevant to the bill or not. Quite frankly, I could not agree more strongly with the minister's comments that it is not part of the process that really assists this committee; it is just something to grab a headline, using emotive words—the same words that are used, I might say, no matter what the issue is.


The particular Greens senator involved does, as I say, insert herself as a participating member in some of the inquiries. Regrettably, it is not often that that particular representative of the Greens political party stays for the whole time. She simply comes in, gets the attention of the media and then leaves. I only raise these matters because, quite frankly, the Senate has a lot of work to do. There are a lot of serious bills to be addressed. The questions that the representative of the Greens political party is asking were all fully canvassed at the Senate committee hearings. The reasons were given. As a result of that, the majority of the committee put forward recommendations, which I am delighted to say the government has taken up. It shows that this is a government that does listen to sensible options put forward by members of the community. It is a government that does listen to senators in this parliament working, usually constructively, through these committees to improve on legislation which the government wants to gets through and which the committee acknowledges has a purpose. But the committee has, on a number of occasions, identified things where bills could be improved. As I say, I am absolutely delighted that we have a government that is prepared to listen to suggestions for improvements and to act on them.


The questions which are being raised with the minister now by a representative of the Greens political party are the sorts of questions that were fully canvassed in the committee hearings. They are, again, issues which were the subject of a written report, which I would have hoped the senator might have read. If she had, she would not be asking these questions, because the answers are all clearly explained in the committee report, which again I commend to the chamber. I thank again the government for listening to the suggestions made for improvements.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:11):  Senator Macdonald is correct: the revised addendum addresses crossbench and opposition concerns that were raised during the various Senate hearings that have been held in relation to this bill. As I said, I actually thanked the crossbenchers and the opposition for working with the government in a constructive manner so that we could come to some form of consensus on this bill. As I have already stated in the summing-up speech, as I have also already stated in my first answer to Senator Hanson-Young, the government considered the reports that were provided by the various committees, we acknowledged the concerns that were raised and we have now addressed those concerns within the addendum to the explanatory memorandum of the Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014.


But I go back to this again: it really does not matter what I say, Senator Hanson-Young, you and I both know that, on this particular issue, you dealt yourself out approximately six years ago. The crossbench and the opposition have negotiated with the government and we have come to a reasonable conclusion. But, in terms of the addendum, you were part of those committee hearings, you know exactly what the majority reports say, and the government has addressed the concerns raised. We have not addressed your concerns, I have no doubt, Senator Hanson-Young, but, as I said, I do not think it matters what we do in this place; it is not about to address your concerns.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:13):  Chair, I will take your direction about moving through the circulated amendments.



The CHAIRMAN:  There is a running sheet, but I am happy to take any amendments that are moved. There are none before the chair now.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (3) and (1) on sheet 7572:


(3) Schedule 1, page 4 (before line 2), before Part 1, insert:




Part


1A—Amendments commencing on Royal Assent





Migration Act 1958





1A


After section


35A



   Insert:




35B


Protection visas—advice and application assistance





Scope



(1) This section applies to an applicant for a protection visa who meets the criteria prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.




Entitlement to advice and assistance



(2) Subject to subsection (3), the applicant is entitled to receive independent immigration legal advice and assistance in relation to his or her application.




Limitation on assistance



(3) The applicant is not entitled to any assistance after:


   (a) the protection visa has been granted; or


   (b) if the protection visa is not granted and the application applies to have the decision reviewed—the review has been finally determined.


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (after table item 1), insert:





1A. Schedule 1, Part 1A




The day this Act receives the Royal Assent.









These amendments go to the need for legal assistance. The minister is right in one respect—that the Australian Greens are fundamentally opposed to a number of the things that are in this bill and we do not support the bill. We do not support the idea of schedule 2, in particular, in terms of its watering down protections for those who fall outside of the refugee convention but need complementary protection, particularly young women and girls who are facing some of the world's most awful atrocities—honour killings and awful things like that. But there are a number of other elements of this bill as well that are fundamentally bad in terms of what they are going to do in putting people's lives at risk. As I said in my speech on the second reading, this bill misses the point. It misses the realities of what it is like to be a refugee—the realities of how many people have to flee, what they have to do to get out of their countries in the first place and the journey that they take to find safety, whether it is here in Australia or elsewhere.


Given all of that, the minister is right that the Greens are opposed to this bill. But we also accept that there is majority support in this place between the Labor Party and the government on this. They believe that things need to be tougher when it comes to how Australia treats asylum seekers and refugees. I do not understand how much tougher it can really get when we lock children up, throw away the key, have them sit in indefinite detention and drive them mentally crazy. You would wonder how much tougher it can get, but, apparently, both the Labor Party and the government are willing to find out.


One of the things that we have tried to do in this bill, despite our opposition to it, is to say that there are some fundamental aspects that, if tweaked, would give a little more fairness to the system—a bit more in line with what you would expect from a fair and decent country like Australia, a country that upholds the notion of the rule of law. These two amendments, (3) and (1), go to providing legal assistance to those affected directly by this bill. One of the reasons this is important is that we know that the decisions made about whether a refugee's claim is accepted or not are life and death decisions. We have to make sure that we are not unnecessarily putting people's lives at risk. That means ensuring that people have the ability to put forward their case clearly, with an understanding of their requirements. It makes the system more efficient, which I know is one of the objectives of everybody in this place—to make the assessment process, the processing of people's claims, more efficient so that we are not unnecessarily tying up the process or, indeed, keeping people in detention or on bridging visas for any longer than need be. But, in order to do that, we need to provide legal assistance to people to help them fill out their applications.


People used to be given legal assistance to help them fill out their claims to ensure that they knew what their obligations were and to streamline the process. That legal assistance was cut some time ago. It has not been afforded to asylum seekers in this country for quite a while now, and it is time we reinstated it. If we are going to start changing the rules, people need to know what those new rules are and how they can abide by them. It is simply about showing not just a bit of care but a bit more fairness towards people as they have to manoeuvre their way through what is now becoming a pile of new processes and hurdles that they have to jump over. That is what these amendments do: they reinstate legal assistance for people so that they can successfully abide by the new rules as set out in this bill and in the bill that was passed by this place last year. It will hopefully mean that fewer mistakes are made by our immigration department, by the people who are making the assessments. If we believe that people need to give all of the information up-front and that they need to give clear explanations about where their identity documents have come from or where they have gone, we need to make sure that they have a full understanding of what the rules are and what is expected of them. Giving them legal assistance is, of course, the best way of doing that.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:19):  The government will be opposing the Greens amendments. As I have already stated, the government acknowledges that there will always be a small number of vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, who may not be able to clearly present their claims without assistance. The government will continue to have arrangements in place to provide funded application assistance to a small number of the most vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, through a primary application information service. Replacing the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme with a needs based system for primary processing, which is the primary application information service, for only the most vulnerable eligible persons is similar to government funded assistance arrangements for those who arrive lawfully by air or sea and seek protection, and provides a clear focus to funding migration assistance to only those people who are considered vulnerable. Removing access to the IAAAS from all protection visa applications at review is designed to encourage the provision of full, personal and accurate claims as early as possible in the primary application process.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:20):  The opposition has entered into an arrangement with the government in regard to the detail of this bill. As a consequence, it may be of assistance to the committee to know that the Labor Party will not be supporting any of the Greens amendments. In terms of the specifics—and I do not need to go through this on each and every occasion, but I will on this matter—the Labor Party's view is that we have to ensure that we are able to offer protection to people in need. To do so, we have to have a robust and efficient framework for the administration of decisions and the making of decisions about who qualifies and who is established as a genuine refugee, and to have measures in place to prevent the gaming of the system. There is no doubt that there are some who will seek to game any system. This includes applicants who use primary application as a dry run and then rebuild their application for review at a review stage based on feedback from the primary decision maker. This is clearly not the intent of the review process. It is reasonable if there is new information that is provided but it is equally reasonable that the applicant provide a reasonable explanation as to why that information was not available at an earlier stage.


The Greens have moved a couple of matters within the one set of amendments and I want to note that item 3 seeks to reinstate the regime of independent legal assistance for applicants that was a feature of the former Labor government and would be a feature of a future Labor government's regime.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendments (1) and (3) on sheet 7572 be agreed to.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-03-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:29):  The Australian Greens oppose part 1 of schedule 1 in the following terms:


(4) Schedule 1, Part 1, page 4 (lines 2 to 25), to be opposed.


These are amendments being made to the issue of burden of proof and new claims.


This is one of the issues that was raised consistently throughout the Senate committee process—particularly, a number of legal experts are concerned about changing the expectations and shifting the burden of proof onto asylum seekers, particularly those who have been traumatised for many years in having to flee persecution and then again, of course, through Australia's detention process.


Remember that this bill will impact directly on those who have been considered to be part of the legacy caseload. These are people who have not been able to have their claims dealt with up until now. The idea that without legal assistance—that we have just seen voted down in this place—the burden of proof is shifted to them in such a unfair and unbalanced way, I think—and this is the Australian Greens view—is going to put lives at extreme risk. We are quite concerned about it.


Also, of course, there is the issue of the new claims element—identity documents—and how that impacts on family members. When they have been on their journey as a refugee for a number of years, many people—for example, people who have fled Afghanistan four or five years ago and who are now living in Australia—have not been able to put forward their claim. The circumstances in their home towns in Afghanistan has changed a lot in the last four or five years. Often the safety of family members has been impacted throughout that time—those who remained behind. In fact, we continue to hear, sadly, on a very regular basis that asylum seekers who are living here in Australia and waiting for their refugee claims even to be started are getting awful phone calls or notices from home that their sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters or family members have been targeted and killed by the Taliban throughout that process, over that long period of time that they have been waiting to get their refugee claim sorted and, of course, for family reunion.


We have already put these people through enough. The shifting of the burden of proof and not allowing an understanding of the very real impacts of this time lag are having very real life-and-death impacts on them and their families. It is a little callous—just trying to ignore the realities of that. So that is what this amendment is about, and I hope there are other members in this place who are willing to support this amendment. It is not outlandish, it is simply about trying to put a bit more balance into this legislation.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:33):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. It merely provides a smaller reasonable obligation on the applicant. It is subject to the reasonableness test and the measure formulises a reasonable expectation. It is actually consistent with practices in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that part 1 of schedule 1 stand as printed.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,15,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-03-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:39):  The Australian Greens oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 3 to 12), to be opposed.


(3) Schedule 1, items 4 to 10, page 5 (line 18) to page 6 (line 22), to be opposed.


(4) Schedule 1, item 11, page 6 (line 25) to page 7 (line 14), section 91WA to be opposed.


(5) Schedule 1, items 12 and 13 (lines 28 to 32), to be opposed.


These amendments also follow another one, which will have to be tested separately. Together, these amendments remove the elements that this bill deals with in terms of bogus documents. I understand on face value the argument that people who do not have their right documents should not be given the benefit of the doubt. I understand on face value why that seems like a very reasonable argument.


But what that argument does is dismiss the realities of the circumstances people are in when they flee persecution. Often, people have to be smuggled out of their countries in order to keep them safe and to get them across the border. If you were a government official in the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein, for example, and you started to raise concerns with what was going on, perhaps speaking to the media or speaking to officials outside Iraq about the acts things the Saddam Hussein government was committing, it would be very difficult for you to leave that country with your own identity and your passport stamped, knowing that the government is watching your every step. That is the reality of people who are fleeing for genuine protection reasons.


Unfortunately, it does create complexities for a country like Australia when people do arrive on our doorstep. It does mean that is difficult to find out exactly who people are. It does mean that we need to do a little bit more digging and a bit more research. It does mean that sometimes we have to give people the benefit of the doubt. I must say, I would prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt than to say no to giving somebody protection because we simply do not want to understand the realities of why that person had to come here with a fake passport.


I remember being in high school and reading stories and watching films about the heroic decisions to flee Nazi Germany or occupied France. Many hundreds and thousands of Jews were smuggled out of those countries on false identity documents. It is how they did it safely. I am not saying that these people should not be questioned and I am not saying that we should not look at the details of their identity documents; what I am saying, however, is that we should not just put a cross next to their application because a document in the first instance does not look genuine or, indeed, is not genuine because they have had to use it in order to flee atrocities and to flee safely. It is often getting out of your country that is the hardest thing to do in the first place: being undetected, without being caught and often having to lie to your family about where you are going and the journey you are going to take.


I tell you what, if I had to leave my country because my government was targeting me or my family and I had to use a fake passport to do it, I would. I would assume that every other one of us in this room, if it was about life or death and saving our children, if it meant having to take a fake passport to get out before you are caught, before you are in jail, before you disappeared and before there was bullet put in your head, then you would.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (11:37):  I thank my fellow senators for contributing to this important debate on the Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This bill, together with the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014, passed by the parliament in December last year, forms a package of legislative reforms required to increase efficiency and enhance integrity in the protection status determination process. Specifically, the measures in this bill respond to the challenges in the onshore component of Australia's humanitarian program and aim to reduce fraud, improve administrative processes and provide greater consistency and quality in protection assessment outcomes.


I would like to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for their consideration and reports on this bill. Following consideration of these reports and in response to concerns that have been raised by my fellow senators regarding certain measures in the bill, I can advise the Senate that the government has tabled an addendum to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which provides further detail on certain amendments made by schedules 1 and 4 of the bill. These measures relate to the identity and integrity measures in schedule 1 of the bill, specifically proposed sections 91W, 91W(a) and 43A; and to the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Tribunal integrity measures relating to providing oral statements of reasons following an oral decision.


I also foreshadow that at the committee stage I will be moving some amendments to the bill on behalf of the government. These amendments will amend schedule 3 to take into account the reintroduction of temporary protection visas by the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014, amend schedule 4 to increase the time frame from seven to 14 days in which an application for reinstatement may be made by a review applicant who fails to appear before the MRT or the RRT and whose application was subsequently dismissed as a result of that nonattendance, and add a new schedule 5 to the bill. This new schedule amends references to the bill in the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014 and the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Act 2014 as the references currently refer to this bill as being enacted in 2014.


I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for their report on the bill and note the additional comments from Labor senators and the Greens' dissenting report. I remind the chamber that with this bill the government is striking the right balance between fairness and supporting an effective and coherent protection determination process which responds to the evolving challenges in the asylum seeker caseload arising from judicial decisions and management of the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals. The government is also ensuring the system works more efficiently, therefore reducing costs and delay.


Implementation of this bill does not mean Australia will resile from its protection obligations; in fact, the government is seeking to restore the same threshold that was adopted by the Labor government for assessing Australia's complementary protection obligations.


I thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights for the comments in relation to this bill. The government's position is that the measures in this bill are reasonable, necessary and proportionate to achieve its legitimate objective, which I have already stated: to reduce fraud, improve administrative processes and provide greater consistency and quality in protection assessment outcomes. Decision makers are obliged to act in good faith to fully assess a protection visa application and afford procedural fairness to asylum seekers as required by the code of procedure in the Migration Act. A primary application information service will provide application assistance to those who are considered vulnerable.


I would also like to thank the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for its contribution to this bill. Former Minister Morrison and I have provided further information and advice as requested by the committee. I note the committee's comments in relation to guidance decisions and reiterate that this measure seeks to align and reduce inconsistencies in decision making. It is still for the tribunal to ensure that a correct and preferable decision is reached on the merits of a case.


I now remind the Senate of some of the key measures in this bill. While the Australian community has long accepted a responsibility to provide refuge to people who engage our protection obligations, the reciprocal responsibilities of people who seek protection in Australia were not clear in our law. The protection and other measures bill will state those responsibilities on the face of our legislation. If a person wants our help, that person is obliged to show good faith and honestly state their case as to who they are and why they need Australia's protection. As a result of this bill, applicants will need to provide documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship or have taken reasonable steps to do so in order to be granted a protection visa.


Establishing an applicant's identity is a keystone of making a decision to grant or refuse any visa. This is especially the case for protection visa applicants because their identity, nationality or citizenship can have a direct bearing on whether they engage Australia's protection obligations. Identity in the global age is increasingly complex to determine, and many people hold dual or multiple nationalities or seek an advantage from not disclosing their genuine identity. Proposed sections 91W and 91W(a) empower decision makers to refuse applicants who provide bogus documents or destroy or discard documentary evidence of heir identity, nationality or citizenship. An applicant who does not give a reasonable explanation of these types of actions and does not provide or take reasonable steps to provide genuine proof of identity, nationality or citizenship will have their protection visa application refused. The same applies to an applicant who has destroyed or discarded identity documents or has caused that to happen at the hands of another person such as a people smuggler. It is appropriate to refuse a protection visa where an applicant fails or refuses to comply with a request to establish their identity where it is in fact possible for them to do so


Again I note that these measures are aimed at encouraging applicants to comply with these requirements. They do not mean Australia will resile from its protection obligations. These measures make it clear that Australians expect protection visa applications to be made in good faith and with full disclosure of identity. Cooperation is the key in these cases. The proposed changes also respect the fact that in some circumstances, including some cases where a person is stateless, it may not be possible for a protection visa applicant to provide documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship even if they want to and have taken all reasonable step to do so. The requirement that an applicant has taken reasonable steps has been included to accommodate these circumstances. Other instances that constitute having taken reasonable steps may include an applicant contacting family and friends in their home country to obtain existing documentary evidence of identity, nationality or citizenship; obtaining such evidence from the authorities of their home country in cases where an applicant is claiming harm from a nonstate actor, for example an organised criminal group; or obtaining such evidence from a safe third country where they may have previously resided. However, to be clear, there is no expectation on an applicant to approach the authorities of the country from which they fear state persecution.


The proposed section 5AAA clarifies a noncitizen's responsibility regarding their protection claims by legislating that it is the asylum seeker's responsibility to specify all particulars of their claim and to provide sufficient evidence to establish that claim. This measure formalises a reasonable expectation and is consistent with practices in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It does not change the decision maker's duty to evaluate and ascertain all of the relevant facts—it simply clarifies that it is not the decision maker's role to advocate on behalf of the applicant. Notwithstanding this amendment, the government acknowledges that there will be always a small number of vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, who may not be able to clearly present their claims without assistance.


The government will continue to have arrangements in place to provide funded application assistance to a small number of the most vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, through a primary application information service. Section 5AAA works in tandem with the new section 423A to encourage protection visa applicants to provide all of their claims and supporting evidence as soon as possible. It sends a clear message that if claims can be presented and supported at the initial application stage, they should be. Section 423A does not empower the Refugee Review Tribunal to disregard new claims or evidence but, rather, to draw an inference unfavourable to the credibility of claims or evidence presented before the tribunal for the first time unless the applicant provides a reasonable explanation to justify why the claims or evidence were not raised before the primary decision was made by the department. The Refugee Review Tribunal will be required to notify an applicant and give them a reasonable period in which to respond if they propose to draw an inference unfavourable to the applicant due to presenting new claims or evidence. This measure will also work in conjunction with the Refugee Review Tribunal's already existing legal obligations under case law and procedural fairness requirements under the Migration Act.


I note that questions have been raised about the meaning of 'reasonable explanation'. Decision makers are bound to act in good faith to fully assess protection visa applications and afford procedural fairness to visa applicants in accordance with the codes of procedure in the migration act. A reasonable explanation is generally credible and does not run counter to or at variance with generally known facts. The bill also brings in measures that affect the Migration Review Tribunal and the RRT. These measures will improve efficiency and provide greater consistency of outcomes for review applicants without affecting the independence of the merits review process. The principal member of the MRT-RRT will be empowered to issue practice directions about review procedures and processing practices, as well as issue guidance decisions to tribunal members, although individual tribunal members will continue to have sole responsibility for making their decisions independently according to the merits of each case. The tribunals will also have the discretionary power to provide an oral rather than written statement of reasons following an oral decision, but a written one will be available on request within 14 days. It is not anticipated that oral decisions and statements will be made in complex cases but will be reserved only for a review of cases involving simple facts and very straightforward statutory interpretation where the relevant case law is well settled.


The bill as currently drafted also legislates the same threshold for assessing complementary protection claims that was originally put in place by the Labor government. Under the bill, Australia's non-refoulement obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment will be engaged if it is found to be more likely than not that a person seeking protection would suffer a significant harm if returned to a receiving country. The 'more likely than not' threshold was initially adopted by the Labor government when the complementary protection provisions were first introduced into the Migration Act in March 2012 but was stated in policy rather than on the face of the legislation. This threshold was lowered by subsequent full Federal Court decisions which adopted the 'real chance' test that applies to the refugees convention. The government does not accept that the real chance threshold adopted by the full Federal Court accurately reflects Australia's obligations under the ICCPR and the CAT. The real chance threshold is considered by the High Court to be less than a 50 per cent chance of harm and it could be as low as a 10 per cent chance. The government considers the more likely than not threshold—the same threshold adopted by the Labor government, and considered to be a greater than 50 per cent chance—to be more appropriate and an acceptable position open to Australia under international law. However, to be clear, decision makers do not need to calculate a risk of harm according to a mathematical formula or in statistical terms. The individual circumstances and merits of each case are considered before a decision is made. Expressing the risk threshold as a percentage is simply an explanatory tool. The government still maintains the more likely than not threshold is the most appropriate. Having said this, the government recognises the voting intention of the majority of senators and expects that schedule 2 will be removed at the committee stage.


In summary, the bill deserves the support of all parties. This bill is about enhancing integrity in Australia's protection visa determination process. It incorporates the expectations of the Australian community and internationally accepted principles of refugee status determination in Australia's domestic law. I commend the bill to the Senate. I also table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator Dastyari today relating to government debt.


The front page of the Australian Financial Review this morning tells it all. The splash headline of the country's main business newspaper is 'Abbott loses the plot on debt', and the subheadings read, 'PM says 60pc of GDP a ""pretty good result""; 'Economists lose hope in budget'; and 'Business urges coalition not to give up'. So there you have it: the verdict on the Abbott government's economic credibility in the crisp and concise language of the headline writer—the verdict to which Australia's business executives woke up this morning; the verdict being read by investors and financial markets. Mr Abbott's deceit on the budget and debt has caught up with him and his incompetence is exposed. It has been exposed. This Prime Minister's last shred of economic credibility has evaporated.


We all remember that, before the last election, Mr Abbott talked down the Australian economy and he ran a scare campaign about government debt. We all remember it: Australia was in a 'budget emergency'—do you remember that?—and a 'debt and deficit crisis'. He compared Australia to Greece. The truth is that Labor left Australia with one of the lowest levels of government debt of any advanced economy. The Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, prepared by Treasury and Finance, showed net debt peaking at 13 per cent of GDP in 2014-15. IMF figures showed that, out of the world's 26 advanced economies, we had the sixth lowest level of government net debt in 2013-14. Yet before the election Mr Abbott told the public that debt peaking at 13 per cent of GDP was a 'budget emergency'. 


What did he say yesterday? He said that net debt under his government policy settings will climb to 60 per cent of GDP—some $960 billion in today's money—and Mr Abbott said that this would be a 'pretty good result'. So net debt at 13 per cent of GDP under Labor is a 'budget emergency' but net debt at 60 per cent of GDP under the Liberals is a 'pretty good result'! No wonder the Financial Review says 'Mr Abbott has lost the plot'. But the trouble is that this Prime Minister is taking the wider economy down with him. This selfish and irrational Prime Minister is taking the wider economy down with him. Since the Abbott government handed down its budget, we have seen business confidence plunge, consumer confidence taking a hit, the slowing of growth, and unemployment rising to its highest level in more than a decade.


But Mr Abbott is not only trashing the economy; he is trashing the credibility of his ministers—like the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. Let's recall: under the Labor government we had lower spending as a share of GDP than this government; lower taxes as a share of GDP than this government; and we left Australia with one of the lowest levels of government debt of any advanced economy. By contrast, Senator Cormann, as Mr Abbott's finance minister, is budgeting to increase spending, increase taxes and increase net debt. This finance minister likes to posture like an anti-debt vigilante, but he is actually taking Australia on a path to net debt of nearly a trillion dollars in today's money. Senator Cormann pretends that he is the 'Terminator' but the reality is he is the 'Debt-o-nator'. He is presiding over an explosion in government debt—an explosion which this Prime Minister says will be a 'pretty good result'.


Australia cannot afford to be governed by a finance minister who has blown out the budget deficit, a Treasurer who thinks it is okay to hike petrol taxes because 'poor people don't drive cars' and a Prime Minister who has deceived the Australian public and lost the plot on the economy.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  While Senator Wong is still in the chamber, I was wondering whether she could qualify, with the term 'detonator', whether there was a 'b' before the 't'. Perhaps, if you would like to write it down, Senator Wong, you will see the humour. 


On a much more serious note—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  One thing that never ceases to amaze me when we have this particular debate about debt is that I am not quite sure what the opposition want. On one hand, when we come into this place and try and put in some tough measures to try and restore the budget, they throw a whole heap of mud at us and say, 'You can't do that; you're being too tough in the budget'. Now, when the Prime Minister has acknowledged that a softer approach will occur at the next budget, we are being attacked because we are supposedly being too soft. I am not quite sure what the opposition wants us to do. 


Senator Wong rose a moment ago and spoke about the debt situation. I congratulate Senator Wong. She is about to become a parent again in a few weeks time. I know that, as a parent, I am certainly not going to spend and build a debt that I am going to make my children pay. The one thing that responsible parents do, just like responsible governments should do, is live within their means. To stand in here and suggest that it is responsible to continue on building and increasing the level of debt this country so that our children and their children have to continue to pay it off seems a little bit odd, because I am sure that nobody in this place who is a parent would do that to their children. Therefore, I do not believe that any government should be doing it to their people.


We talk about the debt to GDP ratio and the comment that the debt to GDP ratio in Australia, at the moment, is probably not as high as it is in some of the countries that we trade with. One of the things that we have to remember is that the rate at which our deficit is increasing is much, much higher than the rate for the majority of countries that we do business with. Whilst things may be okay at the moment, if you have the fastest rising deficit, it does not take a rocket scientist to realise that in a minute we will have a debt to GDP ratio problem. We also need to remember the fact that Australia is an extraordinarily trade-exposed nation. It is a country that relies extraordinarily on exports. So therefore we are not in the same position as many of our trading partners overseas, or the countries which we benchmark ourselves against in this particular space. I think we just need to be very careful that we compare apples with apples. 


Unlike those opposite when they came into government in 2007, we came into government with a massive debt. They came in with a surplus. They had money to spend, and so they did. They spent it; they certainly spent it. We came to government with a massive debt and an increasing deficit. We thought that a very sensible thing for all responsible governments is to do something about our debt.




Senator Conroy:
  There's no cause for alarm with a 60 per cent debt ratio. 




Senator RUSTON:
  Senator Conroy, I do not know whether you bothered to listen to what I was saying. Our deficit is increasing at a rate far faster than in most other countries around the world.


We have a plan. The coalition have a plan for the economic future of this country. The plan is that we want to deliver jobs. We heard today in question time that the Victorian Labor government is prepared to waste in excess of $1 billion not to build a road. 



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  If that is sensible economic practice, Senator Conroy, I am afraid that I missed the economics lesson that you must have gone to when you were at school. All that the irresponsible behaviour in this space is going to do is push the issue to the next generation. 


In the Intergenerational report that has just come down, we were given three quite clear scenarios. One was where the budget position was going under those opposite. It was going to end up with a Greece type outcome. That is something I do not think any of us would want for our country or our children. Another was that we could end up with a budget position which was what was proposed under last year's budget— (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:13):  I also rise to take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I do not always agree with the front page of The Australian Financial Review, but today their front page could not have been more accurate when it said, as Senator Wong has shown, 'Abbott loses the plot on debt'. I could not believe it; I texted the journalist and said, 'Are you quoting him directly? Where did he say this?' And he said, 'In a press conference'. So I went and got the transcript, because I could not believe it. He was asked:


… you've resurrected this line that we're heading towards Mediterranean style levels of debt. You mentioned Greece again today …


And he says:


Andrew, there's no cause for alarm under this Government …


Then he goes on to say: 


… a ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 or 60 per cent—


which we are going to achieve over time—


is a pretty good result looking around the world …


He says that a 60 per cent ratio of debt to GDP is a pretty good effort compared to the rest of the world! 


We only left him with 13 per cent and that was a national emergency. Now he says 60 per cent is fine. Just look at what he has been saying, look at what the government and the previous opposition have been saying over time.


This Prime Minister has been saying Australia is going down the road of Greece, but now he is happy to grow Australia's net debt from 15 per cent to 60 per cent. That is not a bad effort! He said just yesterday, 'Well, yes, under the former Labor government, we were heading to a Greek style economic future.' And yesterday, he told Neil Mitchell on 3AW, 'We're getting down to Greek levels of debt and deficit as a result of Labor's policies.' What an absolute joke this Prime Minister is becoming. I have to tell you, if this is Mr Tony Abbott unplugged then please bring back Peta Credlin because she is vital to the survival of this man. What a joke this man is becoming.


Labor left the coalition with a AAA credit rating and a debt to GDP ratio of 13 per cent, and apparently we were taking us down the path to Greece. No wonder The Australian Financial Review says he has lost the plot. We can see why the Prime Minister's chief of staff has been so critical over the last few years in keeping Mr Tony Abbott in check. Come back, all is forgiven, Peta Credlin. She is desperately getting a government jet to fly to Fiji to get her back in the country! Even Senator Arthur Sinodinos is paying to bring her back early because they just cannot afford to allow this sort of incompetence from the Prime Minister to keep running along!


Due to the hypocritical rhetoric the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been parading around this country, this government has driven unemployment up. It has business confidence down.




Senator Abetz:
  Absolute nonsense.




Senator CONROY:
  I will take that interjection from Senator Abetz, who, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, obviously supports that 60 per cent debt is okay. That is what the Prime Minister said. I am assuming you are supporting him, Senator Abetz? You support him.


You have driven unemployment up. It has gone up since you came to power. You have driven the car industry out of this country. You are trying to give submarine jobs in this country to Japan. Your National Security Committee sat there and every single one of them around the table said 'yes' to the Japan deal. That is what happened. Then you misled Senator Ruston, Senator Edwards and Senator Fawcett. You pretended to them that you were going to look after South Australia. You have absolutely misled them because your National Security Committee did a deal with Japan. You know you cannot deny it because it is true. You cannot deny it. 


You have driven unemployment up in this country. You have driven business confidence through the floor. No consumer will spend money. You know what the best way to get GDP growing is? It is by having a responsible budget. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-03-19,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:18):  It gives me great pleasure to contribute to this debate. Shadow minister Wong, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, cites the front page of The Financial Review, whilst her and her colleagues were very quiet when we quoted that very paper in another question in question time today. They were silent and were turning their backs and only focused on some aspects of The Financial Review. But as Senator Wong went through her government's record, it is not a record she should be proud of. When you are comparing yourself to economies in the global context—'We're better than Greece', 'We're better than Spain'—you know what? That is like claiming the cup when the only people you are racing against are toddlers. It is absolutely ridiculous. 



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  The reality is when you are paying $1 billion a month in interest, Senator Polley, that is three Adelaide hospitals every year—paid in full, every year. Three billion dollars in interest is a new Adelaide hospital every three months. 


This government is committed to a sustainable return to surplus. Last week, we had the release of the Intergenerational report by the Treasurer which outlined the very significant challenges for our nation going forward. You know what? There are swings and roundabouts in this game we are all in. If the opposition are serious about leadership, if they seriously had a backbone, if they seriously had an iota of credibility to contribute to this debate and to the challenges that face us all as a nation going forward, they would be taking on board the issues raised in the Intergenerational report and thinking, 'How do we actually assist the government in getting back to a sustainable, credible path to surplus?' 


We do not know who is actually going to be in charge of the budget as the ageing population tsunami is coming towards us. How are we going to ensure that millions of Australians approach retirement in a way that can guarantee a way of life that they have known so well? We are absolutely committed to building the strong foundation that we laid last year and having a prudent, frugal and responsible budget, in direct contrast to those opposite in their time in government.


Our economic plan is already underway, and Senator Ruston did make reference to some of the principles of that plan. We are actually targeting two million new jobs over the next decade. We are absolutely focused on getting more Australians, young and old, into the workforce in a sustainable way. That means growing financial security not only at a local level and a regional level but at a national level to ensure a strong economy. We have done that through the free trade agreements that we have negotiated. We have been building infrastructure. We heard questions today from those opposite complaining about building essential infrastructure. That is going to not only provide jobs in construction but contribute to jobs in the regions. For instance, as we get our fabulous green produce to the docks in Melbourne, we needs those roads. We need those roads. It is something you need to get on board with.


We are going to be focusing on growing jobs for older Australians through our various strategies and incentives that will encourage employers to put on those long-term unemployed who need that extra bit of assistance to get back into the workforce. We know that having a job is the very best form of welfare. We know that Australians want to be in full-time employment not because they like to make a lot of money but so that they can care for those they love, so they can provide a roof over their heads. That is why we have also committed to a comprehensive family package. We want a more productive economy not only for our nation's future but also so we as parents and citizens can care for those we love. That is why our families package will be focused on getting more women back into the workforce by ensuring our child care is sustainable.


We have abolished the carbon tax and the mining tax. That has put real money back into people's pockets but, more importantly, has allowed businesses to flourish and employ more people because they are not being constrained by that job-destroying tax. Labor turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt well over $200 billion, the fastest deterioration in debt in dollar terms as a share of GDP in modern Australian history. Labor's debt is already costing— (Time expired)

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (15:23):  I am gobsmacked. From a government that has promised us stable and somewhat dull government, they come up with this clanger. It is unbelievable. Let me reiterate. Mr Abbott has spent the last three years while in opposition and government talking about a so-called budget emergency. I will say it again for everybody out there: a budget emergency. He has been spreading fear about the Australian economy which has been driving down business and consumer confidence. His whole tactic has been to trash the economy. When the debt was 13 per cent of GDP, Mr Abbott called it disaster, but yesterday Mr Abbott said a ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 to 60 per cent is a pretty good result when you look around the world. Wake up and smell the roses. It must have been a bad hair day for Mr Abbott when he looked at that.


How this is possible is a complete mystery to me when you look at the position this government has put itself in. Net government debt is now 35 per cent higher than in January 2014, but according to Mr Abbott the budget emergency is now over as the government has got the budget situation from out of control to manageable. This is from a man who was running around the country before the election and since saying that this is a budget emergency, which is the reason he ground an unfair budget in. The reason we copped a bad budget was the budget emergency which has now evaporated.


Let's remind ourselves of what Mr Abbott said previously:


What we're not prepared to do though is sell out the fundamentals and the fundamentals are that we have absolutely got to get this budget crisis back under control. I mean, Labor left us with a debt and deficit disaster.


This government has taken one step more and found a 50 to 60 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio manageable somehow—quite an extraordinary circumstance.


I think the editorial in the SMH really sums it up when it says:


This ""being in government"" business is proving to be all too hard for Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his ministers.


Too hard to frame a fair budget.


…   …   …


Too hard to be civil and constructive on policy options. Too hard to explain to voters the need for reform. Too hard to find a consistent message.


And way too hard to provide the sort of ""stable, no surprises"" government Mr Abbott promised just 18 months ago.


Who would believe 18 months ago that he made such a promise?


The Herald said then that voters would get to judge Mr Abbott on trust and stability ""in three years or, should he prove unable to manage a democratic parliament, much sooner"".


…   …   …


Indeed, being in government has turned out to be so hard that some ministers and others in his inner circle even considered plans to commit hara kiri through a double dissolution election.


What a shambles.


Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Thursday: ""The important thing is to keep heading in the right direction.""


Tell us what that direction is because we do not know, the public do not know and the commentators do not know. If you can find a direction in all of the dropped pie, let us know; we might be able to at least discern your position. That is what your government looks like. It looks like a dropped pie: completely shambolic, completely rudderless and directionless and one which does not have any consistent message.


Are we now going to drop the budget crisis message and move to a dull and boring government? Let me tell you, from a person who understands a bit of dullness; you guys are not dull! It is an extraordinary circumstance that you have now laid out. The message is quite clear though. One, we have to hide Mr Hockey. Don't let him out! We have to hide Mr Hockey, and Mr Abbott is going to take the lead. Nobody has told Ms Credlin this, because it would not be one— (Time expired)

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:34):  I present the second interim report of the Select Committee on the National Broadband Network.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator LUNDY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


First, I acknowledge the efforts of the staff of the select committee's secretariat. The hard work they do and their dedication as this committee conducts its work across the country are genuine testament to their professionalism. I also thank my Senate colleagues on the committee for their cooperation and contributions. The Select Committee on the National Broadband Network no doubt will continue its work but I think the necessity for an interim report encapsulates the work that the government has sought to do over the last little while. This report primarily lends itself to reflecting on a plethora of reports and reviews that the Abbott government has undertaken with respect to the National Broadband Network.


I will make three points and then reflect very briefly on the recommendations. Eighteen months into this government's term the NBN Co is still too uncertain to divulge how much the multi-technology mix, or MTM, will cost or how long it will take to build. The committee noted that the headline financial and deployment numbers that have been divulged to date by NBN Co and the government are outdated and indeed unreliable. The committee also found that NBN Co's strategic review was unreliable in the case of all examined scenarios. We know it was completed in just five weeks, with no external independent oversight, and the committee found that it contained financial manipulations and other irregularities. Over the past 12 months these concerns have largely been borne out, with key NBN Co management distancing themselves from the report 


The report also found that the cost-benefit analysis conducted by the government was deeply flawed and is not credible. 


I know my colleague Senator Conroy will expand on these points, so let me conclude by making a couple of my own. I believe a network that relies in any way on Telstra's copper network is not and can never be a national broadband network. I spent years—many years ago now—in this place examining the state of Telstra's copper network. This work contributed to informing not only our policy to build a national broadband network based on fibre to the premises but an understanding that an overbuild was necessary—because Telstra's copper will not stand the test of time. It has already been failing for years. 


To allow part of that existing copper network to form part of a multitechnology mix is absolute folly. It ensures that, under this government, what they continue to call the National Broadband Network will never be any such thing. In this report we have documented in a very detailed way the great travesties and manipulations concerning the business and conduct of the National Broadband Network. But the fundamental issue is that a network that is no longer a fibre-to-the-premises network but has gone back to the old multitechnology-mix approach of the former Howard government will never deliver the universal high-bandwidth network to Australia—nor the commensurate economic and social benefits—that would have put us ahead of the pack and allowed Australia to be the most substantial test-bed network for high-bandwidth connectivity among the developed nations of the world. That is a great shame. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:39):  Before I make some remarks on the second interim report of the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, I acknowledge the work of Senator Lundy, who has been the chair of the committee since I have been on it—since the coalition took government. I wish her all the best in her retirement from this place. I also acknowledge the extraordinarily hard work of the committee secretariat. This has not been an easy committee to work for, so I acknowledge the way they have managed to manage a committee that has met on so many occasions. It has met so often that I have started to dream about the NBN committee during my sleep!


The National Broadband Network is an amazing concept and something I think all Australians look forward to being part of in due course. However, I have to make the comment that we, through this committee, have to stop looking backwards. We have to start looking forward. 




Senator Conroy:
  We can't because you won't give us the numbers!




Senator RUSTON:
  I will get to that, Senator Conroy. We need to start looking at how we can best roll this project out so that the people of Australia can benefit from what is a huge infrastructure project, a project that is going to cost Australian taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. Regardless of what the final multitechnology mix looks like, it is still going to be one of Australia's largest infrastructure projects ever. It was quite interesting listening to Senator Ludwig earlier. He referred to something as 'looking like a dropped pie.' We need to remember, Senator Conroy, that what we inherited when we picked up this project upon coming into government resembled that dropped pie that Senator Ludwig was referring to. 


This was a committee that was established using the numbers in the Senate, so it does not reflect the government. It is a select committee that can meet without any government members being present—and did so on a number of occasions before government senators were appointed to it. Beyond that, it is appropriate and timely to put on the record that, since November 2013 when this committee was first established, it has called 22 hearings. The committee has demanded that NBN executives appear before it for a total of not less than 272 hours. Consider what the cost of attendance at these the hearings has been, not to mention the cost in lost hours—including the hours these executives have had to spend travelling to and from the hearings, because of course they are not Canberra based—the lost productivity, the airfares et cetera. Over a space of about 15 months, this has been an extraordinary amount of time to be demanded of the executives of any government business enterprise. They have turned up time and time again and have often been asked the same questions over and over. This is despite the fact that sometimes committee members have already known the answers to their questions—they have just been attempting to be mischievous. 


In contrast, the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which was a committee of the previous parliament—a committee of both houses of parliament and a committee that reflected the make-up of that parliament—met for a combined total of 39 hours through eight hearings. I wanted to put that on the record so that anyone who was seeking to hear or read the contributions in relation to this report can understand that this committee has degenerated into little more than a witch-hunt. I hope that, now that this report is out of the way, we can settle down and start doing something positive. I hope we can start doing the real job of the select committee, which is to monitor the rollout of this extraordinarily important project for Australia. 


We need to set the agenda to go forward in a way that will allow us to get some productive outcomes from this committee. To achieve that, this committee needs to be a properly constituted committee—and preferably, because of the importance of the NBN project, not just a Senate committee but a joint standing committee of both houses of this parliament. The sooner we get back to that, and the sooner we start focusing on the future rollout of this very important project, the better. I stand today to say that I do not believe that this report of the NBN select committee reflects the sentiments of everybody who attended nor the evidence of the witnesses.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-03-19,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:44):  I do have to respond to some of the quite misleading claims that have just been put on the public record—quite misleading statements. Let's us be very, very clear about this—




Senator Ruston:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I seek clarification through you as to whether Senator Conroy is accusing me of misleading the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think he is; I think that is what he has said. 




Senator CONROY:
  The claims that this committee is meeting an extraordinary number of times—




Senator Ruston:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I would seek that Senator Conroy withdraws his comment that I am misleading the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy can, if he chooses to, but I am not going to ask him to.




Senator CONROY:
  I withdraw; I would not want to offend Senator Ruston. Let me be very clear: so many meetings of this committee are needed, because not one single answer has been given to the committee on the simple fact of: how much Mr Malcolm Turnbull's dog of a network is going to cost—not one answer to that question no matter how many times we ask it and no matter how many times we sit there and ask the simplest and most straightforward questions. 


We do not know how long it is going to take to build. We do not know what it is going to cost. We do not know what its revenue forecasts are. We do not know what the expenses of its teams are—simply stonewalled every single time. 


At the last hearing, I think I commented that nearly 80 per cent—that is eight, zero per cent—of the questions that I asked were taken on notice. Over a five-hour hearing, 80 per cent of the questions I asked were taken on notice. It will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy President Marshall, that when we get these answers heavily doctored by Minister Turnbull's office, we will need to ask the same questions again, because the officers of NBN are not allowed to answer questions. 


We had the quite extraordinary example at the recent committee hearing, when I asked a very straightforward and simple question to the expert of HFC technology—the newly-hired one, $800 million a year—the chief executive leaned over and said out loud: 'Don't answer that question.' Just leaned over—it was that blatant. 


Mr Turnbull used to laugh and make jokes about the Kremlin when it came to NBN before. The Kremlin is a beacon of transparency compared to the gulag at NBN headquarters in North Korea that is being run by this government. 


After 18 months, the public of Australia do not know the cost of Mr Turnbull's dog of a network—not a single cost, not a single revenue, not a single expense and not a single contract. In fact it is so absurd now on this committee that, when you ask them: what is the cost of the contract with this company?'—a major public company? They say, 'We can't tell you.' I say, 'But this company have released this information to the stock exchange, because it is material to them. Can I read you their press release to the stock exchange? Can you confirm this is the truth?' And they say, 'We can't comment. 


So do not come in here and cry crocodile tears about the number of meetings and the number of hours when these officers are directed by the minister, the chair and the CEO of NBN Co in front of the committee to refuse to answer a single question. 


You might find it funny but there are times when you will not always be in government. You are breaching every possible informal rule that we have about how we deal with public servants. 'I won't


 tell you the cost of a contract. 'But it is released to the stock exchange.' Or: 'I can't comment on that.' 'Is it true?' 'I can't comment on that.' 'So are they lying to the stock exchange?' 'I can't comment on that.'


Abusing the committee processes of this chamber is a disgrace. The minister stands condemned. The board of NBN Co stands condemned. The executives of NBN Co stand condemned for treating the committee of this parliament and the people of Australia with open and cold contempt—and then they laugh about it while they sit there in front of us. 


I also want to speak on the second interim report. You will recall that the first interim report found that the NBN's strategic review contained financial manipulations and other irregularities. That was no great surprise as I talked about last time: it was put together by Minister Turnbull's yachting buddy of 15 years—they actually jointly own a yacht on Sydney Harbour. You have to put someone in place that is your best mate to give you the dodgy report to start with.


But time has proven that the committee was right in its statements. NBN Co management have been crab-walking away from this disgraceful, dodgy report prepared in 11 weeks and they will not endorse it—they just cannot get away from it fast enough. That has left the minister with a couple of problems: first, it was on the basis of this dodgy report that he used this fig leaf to say that fibre to the premise was too expensive to build; and, second, he no longer has a platform to say that fibre to the premise is too expensive to build. So what does he do? He has another review—his seventh review in 18 months. This minister is very fond of providing his mates with a steady stream of income on the taxpayer dime but not so good at actually rolling out a network by 2016. The latest review makes wildly inflated estimates of the cost of fibre. Internationally, the estimates by NBN Co executives are a joke. People laugh openly when they see the fabrications and constructions used to inflate these numbers. 


The minister has engaged in some creative accounting here. Let us be very clear about this. First, even though NBN Co use this figure as an expense internally, inside NBN Co, he has decided to capitalise opex to Telstra for its ducts. So you take an expense that is an internal expense. You say: 'No, no; that's not good enough. The numbers are not high enough to back up the numbers we've claimed for the last two years, so we've got to actually take an expense from a different part of the accounts and capitalise it and add it to the numbers to try and bloat up the fibre-to-the-premise costs.' So $737 of the alleged cost of NBN's fibre-to-the-premise rollout is entirely a dodgy fix—from one set of the accounts in NBN Co to an external claim that it is part of the cost. No other country in the world, no other company in the world, tries to pretend that those sorts of opex expenses are part of the cost of an FTTP build—none of them. Shame on you, Minister. Shame on the board of NBN Co for having to prop up its dodgy decisions with absolutely fabricated numbers like this.


Second: 'Let's throw in some opex costs from internal labour. There's another $170. Oh my goodness; we still can't get the number high enough to justify wasting $30 billion of taxpayers' money on this dog. Let's just say: all of those people sitting in that corner—all of those people and their wages—we're going to capitalise their costs for the purposes of NBN Co's fibre-to-the premise rollout.' Again, no other company in the world tries to account for its fibre-to-the-premise costs like this. It is totally and utterly a disgrace.


Third: 'Give in to delivery partners' ambit claims. Pay them whatever they want.' A whole bunch of disputes arose during the course of the rollout, and this board, this management, rolled over and just paid out as much money as it could to deliberately inflate the cost of the rollout to date. It rolled over and paid out hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, just for the purpose of being able to pump up the numbers on fibre to the premise that was being rolled out. We have not been able to finally get a number on that one. NBN Co is hiding it.


Fourth: 'Direct officers inside NBN Co to stop rolling out cost savings.' That is what has gone on in the last 18 months. My time is almost up. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The speech read as follows—



LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR MARITIME CLAIMS AMENDMENT BILL 2015



Introduction



To ensure international shipping continues to be an economically viable proposition, shipowners are generally entitled to limit their liability in respect of claims arising from damage caused by their ships. This means that if a ship is involved in an incident which causes damage to persons, property or the environment, there is a limit on the maximum amount of compensation that a court can order the shipowner to pay. 


The maximum liability of a shipowner is usually calculated based on the size of the ship involved in the incident and has no relationship to the amount of damage caused by the incident.


The rationale for allowing shipowners to limit their liability in respect of ship-sourced damage is to encourage shipping and trade.  This involves balancing the competing objectives of compensating anybody who suffers loss or damage caused by shipowners or their representatives, while ensuring that ship operators are able to access commercially available insurance to cover their liability for that damage.


Australia is a Party to the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, which allows a shipowner (including the charterer, manager and operator of the ship) or salvor to limit the total amount they can be required to pay for damage caused by the ship, the shipowner or the salvor. Limits are specified for two types of claims: those for loss of life or personal injury; and those for other claims, such as damage to ships, property or harbour works. The limits are based on the gross tonnage of the ship, with larger ships having higher limits. It is administered by the International Maritime Organization, a specialised agency of the United Nations.


Other international maritime conventions adopt the limits of liability in the 1996 LLMC Protocol and apply them to shipowners for the purpose of limiting their liability under those conventions, including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage which limits the liability of shipowners for pollution damage caused by bunker oil spills and requires shipowners to maintain liability insurance in respect of such damage up to the limit of their liability.




Purpose of the bill



The purpose of the bill is to implement amendments to the 1996 LLMC Protocol which will come into force on the later of either the day this act receives the Royal Assent and 8 June 2015.  The bill will increase the liability limits for ship owners and salvors for maritime claims relating to ship-sourced damage to more adequately reflect the costs of such incidents.  


Australia was the leading advocate of increasing the liability limits under the 1996 LLMC Protocol. A proposal to increase the limits was brought forward at the IMO by Australia following the Pacific Adventurer incident off the Queensland coast on 11 March 2009, which involved a bunker oil spill. The costs for cleaning up the spill were estimated at $34 million.  However, under the 1996 LLMC Protocol (and therefore under the LLMC act) the shipowner was legally entitled to limit its liability to approximately $17.5 million. The 1996 LLMC Protocol uses 'Special Drawing Rights' to quantify the liability limits.  Based on conversion rates as at 


5 February 2015, the financial liability for a medium sized vessel of 


50,000 Gross Tonnes ""in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury"" amounts to an increase of approximately $AUD 33,600,000.  A claim for the same sized vessel made ""in regard to any other claims"" amounts to an increase of approximately $AUD 16,800,000.




Conclusion



Ensuring the LLMC liability limits are raised in Australia as soon as they enter into force will reduce the risk of having to seek an increase to the Protection of the Sea Levy in the event that the shipowner's liability and/or insurance for an incident is insufficient or absent.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:30):  At the request of Senator Siewert, I move: 


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


(i) the negative impacts of coal and coal seam gas mining on Australia's environment, including prime agricultural land and water, and the wellbeing of regional communities, and


(ii) the concerning relationship between these mining activities and political corruption, particularly in New South Wales, as evidenced by the findings of the Independent Commission Against Corruption; and


(b) calls on all parties contesting the New South Wales state election to commit to a ban on coal and coal seam gas mining.


This is an absolutely critical motion for the Senate to consider. I have been in politics for over 25 years, and I have got to the point where I do not believe that we live in a democracy anymore. We are living in a plutocracy in Australia—that is, government by the wealthy in the interests of the wealthy. I have now got to the point where I recognise that we can vote, we can march, we can write letters, we can make calls, we can post tweets, but, as long as the rich few can buy the political process, there is very little hope.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  Order! I remind senators that the standing orders require that senators will be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said, to get our country back, to give ourselves a chance, we have to restore the health of our democracy. We need to educate everyone to put up in lights just how big business and wealthy individuals use their money and connections to take and retain power. That is precisely what has happened in Australia, particularly with regard to resource extractive companies. It has been the case for a very long time. I got into politics on this very issue, when North Broken Hill ran the Tasmanian Liberal government under the then Premier, Robin Gray. It got to the point where North Broken Hill, holed up in what was then the Sheraton Hotel, issued a press release on North Broken Hill letterhead recalling the Tasmanian parliament to get it to pass doubts removal legislation that would give North Broken Hill all the rights to pollute and do as it liked in Tasmania.


That is what has happened over the years in Tasmania—crony capitalism. Quentin Beresford has just written a brilliant book, The Rise and Fall of Gunns Ltd, that documents how the timber company North Broken Hill, in cahoots with a whole lot of people in government and in Forestry Tasmania, destroyed democracy in Tasmania for a long time. The governments of Tasmania became the puppets of the forest industry. I would argue that that same cronyism between resource based companies and parliament has existed in New South Wales for some time. It got to the point in Tasmania in 1989 where the graffiti all over the state was: 'Vote 1 North Broken Hill and cut out the middle man'. That is what people thought about the role of the parliament. You could do that in New South Wales right now. You could say: 'Vote 1 coal seam gas, Vote 1 coal and cut out the middle man in the New South Wales parliament', because effectively that is what has occurred.


We heard the same sort of attitude today in question time, when my colleague Senator Janet Rice from Victoria asked the government to explain how it is that the proponents of the East West Link in Victoria drafted the letter for the Liberal government of Victoria to sign. The letter said that they would be granted compensation if the East West Link did not proceed, because they thought there was a likelihood that the Liberals would not win the election. We asked a serious question about corruption—how else would you describe it?—and Minister Cash stood in here and laughed and shouted and failed to address the question, even though she was brought back to it three times. I happen to think it matters that the corporations that were proposing a road for which Infrastructure Australia said there was no business case wrote the letter to deliver themselves that level of compensation, and it was signed off by a Victorian Liberal Premier. Of course, the Liberal Party lost the election and the road will not proceed. This is exactly what has happened in New South Wales, and that is where I go now.


It is not just the Greens saying it. The New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, ICAC, put out a shocking report in October 2013 entitled Reducing the opportunities and incentives for corruption in the state's management of coal resources. That ICAC report found shocking levels of corruption and incentives for it in New South Wales under what was then a Labor government but that continues now, I would argue, under a Liberal government. We have corruption in New South Wales. There is no other way that you can describe the absolutely disgraceful behaviour.


The investigation in Operation Jasper followed an allegation made by a private individual in February 2011 that confidential information regarding the tender process for awarding the Mount Penny coal tenement had been leaked to the Obeid family. As part of that investigation, the commission examined the circumstances surrounding a decision made in 2008 by the Hon. Ian Macdonald MLC, then Minister for Primary Industries and Minister for Mineral Resources, to grant a coal exploration licence to Cascade Coal Pty Ltd and the circumstances relating to the tendering process and the way in which the tender bids were assessed.


The commission found that Mr Macdonald's corrupt conduct was motivated by an agreement with the Hon. Edward Obeid Senior and Moses Obeid to financially benefit the Obeid family. Mr Macdonald, Edward Obeid and Moses Obeid were found to have engaged in corrupt conduct by conspiring to defraud in the creation of the Mount Penny tenement. The commission also discovered that several co-investors, including Travers Duncan, John McGuigan, John Atkinson, John Kinghorn and Richard Poole, had engaged in corrupt conduct to obtain financial advantage by deception—and on and on it goes. The commission said:


In preparing this report, the question facing the Commission was not simply how the state's policy and regulatory framework could allow … ELs—


exploration licences—


of great value to be corruptly provided to favoured recipients, but how it could have been so easy to do so.


It is inconceivable that in any other portfolio area of government such value could corruptly be transferred from the state to favoured individuals with such relative ease.


That is the definition of plutocracy. New South Wales is not a democratically governed state; it is a plutocracy where the rich buy what they need through corruption in the political process. That is not found by the Greens; it is not an allegation; it is proven in this report by ICAC. Read it. It goes on to explain corrupt deal after corrupt deal. When you look at this, it is why we are moving today to call on all parties contesting the New South Wales state election to commit to a ban on coal and coal seam gas mining but also to note the concerning relationship between these mining activities and political corruption.


I go to the political corruption. Just have a look at the disgraceful and appalling behaviour that has given us Whitehaven and has given us the Maules Creek mine and the loss of the irreplaceable Leard forest. This goes absolutely to the heart of corruption. You had Mark Vaile, former National Party Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, who is now Chairman of Whitehaven Coal. Before that, however, he was also chair of Nathan Tinkler's company Aston Resources. Evidence tendered at ICAC reveals allegedly prohibited donations passed between the Aston Resources board and Chris Hartcher, through the Free Enterprise Foundation and eventually to the New South Wales Liberal Party, and that ministers who received donations allegedly assisted various Tinkler developments through the planning process. It is alleged that Aston donations to the National Party were made at the suggestion of the chairman of its board, Mark Vaile. That is just appalling, but that just tells you where the Nationals have come from and have been and remain in New South Wales when it comes to coal seam gas and coal. They are in it as much as the Liberal and Labor parties in delivering for coalmines and coal seam gas companies to the detriment of the community.


I am going to talk about the detriment to the community. I have sat at kitchen tables. I have been out to the Liverpool Plains. I have talked to people in the Hunter Valley. I have been onto some of those horse studs in the Hunter Valley. People have just looked at me and said they just cannot understand how it is possible that this would occur. And now we have the New South Wales Premier saying that he has delayed 16 new coalmines in the Upper Hunter. 'Delayed'? What does that mean? That means until after the election. I ask you: what will happen then to those 16 mines in the Upper Hunter?


It is the same with coal seam gas. We have a situation where the New South Wales government enabled the companies to get the licences in spite of absolutely shonky assessments in relation to impacts on water and impacts on prime agricultural land. It is just disgraceful that we would be doing this at a time when the international community, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has said we are facing an urgent crisis with global warming and two-thirds of all fossil fuel resources have to stay in the ground. 'Stay in the ground' means not extracting coal seam gas and not expanding coalmines and coalmining around the country. The Galilee Basin should stay as it is: no mines in the Galilee Basin.


And yet there are very serious questions about the arrangements that were previously made under the Newman government in Queensland: Jeff Seeney and Adani. That will come out eventually, no doubt. But there are serious allegations being made about who reversed decisions in Queensland, who fast-tracked the process and what they got for it.


But I return to New South Wales, where again, even at the federal level, you have all this doublespeak. Former minister Tony Burke gave approval to the Gloucester CSG licence, the biggest coal seam gas licence in New South Wales, delivered by Labor, saying, 'Oh, look, I had concerns about it,' but, because the New South Wales minister decided to leak a letter, he had to announce the approvals and has no idea whether it is going to go ahead or not. And now all those communities are stuck with it. All those communities have had to suffer because of the corrupt behaviour of the New South Wales minister, going out there and leaking it, and then the federal minister going ahead and granting the approval.


But I come back to Maules Creek and the offsets. The Commonwealth, under EPBC, had to guarantee the offsets that were there for the Leard forest, for those irreplaceable, critically endangered species. They had to have the appropriate offsets. They did not have them. The Commonwealth had the capacity to say, 'No, the offsets don't exist,' pick up the company and take them to court for misleading under EPBC—for putting in documents which did not provide the offsets.


Someone here in this federal government under Minister Hunt, whether it was Minister Hunt himself or the bureaucracy, decided not to take them to court and not prosecute them. I ask why not? Why weren't they prosecuted? At estimates nobody would own up to who actually made that decision. Which person? Was it the minister? He must ultimately take responsibility because this is a democracy in which ministerial responsibility, if it means something, means you have to have accountability. 


How do you think people who are suffering as a result of corruptly granted licences feel about the Commonwealth deciding not to prosecute the company involved when the company has clearly misled the community on the offsets, and we are going to lose irreplaceable, critically endangered species? Again, I have been out there to look and it is absolutely the case. The Leard forest will be lost, and the offsets are nothing like the vegetation types that are required to sustain ecosystems there. 


That is why we are saying that, at the highest level, coal and coal seam gas should stay in the ground because of the impacts of global warming. More particularly, we are highlighting the corrupt culture that has extended through the Liberals, the Nationals and the Labor Party in New South Wales. No amount of saying it has not changes the fact that if there was real justice in New South Wales then we would see every single one of those corrupt licences that have been given cancelled. Why haven't they been cancelled? Instead, bad behaviour has been rewarded. They are proceeding and Mark Vaile is going to make a great deal of money out of the fact that he is proceeding on the board of Whitehaven with a mine that should never have been allowed to proceed. How is that just and fair in Australia? Well, it is not. It goes back to my point: government by the wealthy, for the wealthy, through the corrupt processes set out by ICAC. The Greens join with ICAC in the question: how is it possible that this could have happened in New South Wales? It is inconceivable that such value could be corruptly transferred from the state to favoured individuals with such relative ease.


We have to get serious about this. It is no laughing matter when corruption is brought to the attention of governments. What we saw today in question time was disgraceful behaviour. But it will come out eventually. The relationship that we raised today between the proponents of East West Link and the former Liberals in Victoria will come out eventually. The grossly corrupt behaviour of the Labor Party and the Labor ministers in New South Wales has already come out, about how they were involved in the granting of licences to coalmining. Equally, the corrupt behaviour of the Liberal Party has come out through ICAC and that dodgy trail of political donations to get where they are. As I said before, it went through Aston Resources, Boardwalk Resources, Chris Hartcher, Free Enterprise Foundation and eventually the New South Wales Liberal Party. That is how the money trail went—clear as anything that that is the case. These were donations which should not be allowed. 


Yet, we now have the Shenhua Watermark coalmine on the Liverpool Plains. Of course, everyone is seeing the deferred approval for Shenhua as a way of stopping this ahead of the New South Wales election. This should be cancelled. The licence should be cancelled. We know the amount of money involved in this Shenhua proposal. For example, it was granted a mining exploration licence by the former Labor mining minister Ian Macdonald, who has been found to be corrupt after Shenhua paid $300 million to the New South Wales government. Part of this commercial agreement saw Shenhua agree to a further payment of $200 million on the granting of its mining licence. Shenhua paid $300 million and was going to pay another $200 million when the licence was granted to a minister who is known to be corrupt. Why hasn't the Shenhua licence been cancelled? If there is any justice, that Shenhua licence should be cancelled. That is why we are standing here today on this very, very serious matter. 


We have to end the connection between political donations and licences for coal and coal seam gas. We have to look after our agricultural land and water and regional communities. Food security in an age of global warming is critical. We are going to see the loss of crops and food around the world because of extreme weather events. Just as oil was one of the critical resources of this last century, food will be the critical resource of this century. Therefore, agricultural land and water are essential. Food is the oil of this century; land and water are the gold of this century. There will be resource wars in this century, but they will not be over coal; they will be over land and water to sustain ecosystems and grow food. Please, consider this corruption case. Consider why it is essential to ban political donations from these coal and coal seam gas companies. Get some justice for people and let's restore our democracy from its plutocracy.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-03-19,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:50):  I am happy to speak against this motion. As I was listening to Senator Milne, I was reminded of some of the talk about the ferals in the Senate that we have heard in recent times. This is a motion that would seek to make ferals of us all. It is the sort of motion that is part of the Greens overall agenda to shut down the coal industry that will send us all back to the caves. The ferals would well and truly be in charge if we were to support a motion like this and if any sensible political party were to take the advice of the Greens on this issue. Let's be clear: the Greens are anti coal. They are anti gas. They are anti mining of any sort. They are anti roads, as we heard today. They are anti-new houses. They are anti development. They are anti jobs. We all know it to be true. It think it was Warren Mundine who recently challenged the Greens to point to anywhere in the country where they might support a new mining project, and they would not point to one. So they are happy to have the iPhones that come from mining, the cars that come from mining and all of the development that comes from mining, but they are anti it all. They would see the jobs of tens of thousands of Australians thrown down the gurgler if we were to accept this motion. If we were to accept this motion, we would be condemning the state of New South Wales to a bleak economic future indeed.


Before I got into some of the economic impact that such an approach as the Greens are calling for in this motion would have, I think it is worth talking about political donations, which Senator Milne spoke a lot about. There was no mention of Graeme Wood, no mention of the $1.6 million donation—the largest in political history in Australia—to the Greens, which they were very grateful for. Bob Brown was very grateful.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Seselja is misleading the Senate by not indicating that that donation went through the Electoral Commission and was appropriately declared, not hidden like the ones to the Liberal Party.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  There is no point of order.




Senator SESELJA:
  I can see the sensitivity; you mention Graeme Wood and the Greens are immediately on their feet. They do not want to talk about the $1.6 million donation which Bob Brown said he was 'eternally grateful' for. I think they are also eternally grateful for the donations they get from the CFMEU. They get the donations from the CFMEU and they back it up by opposing efforts to stamp out corruption and lawlessness on building sites. They get the donations from the CFMEU and respond very strongly with their vote, because they do not support efforts to clean up our building sites, to get rid of corrupt behaviour on our building sites, to get rid of unlawful, thuggish behaviour as we have been hearing about just in the law few days on our building sites around the country. So forgive me if I will not take advice from the Greens on some of these issues.


But let's go to the economic impacts. I will deal with the coal seam gas issues, but this motion calls on the parties in the New South Wales election to ban coalmining and coal seam gas. I am going to deal with both. Before I go into some of the regulation of coal seam gas in the state of New South Wales I will deal with the impacts if that advice were to be followed. Let's have a look at the contribution of coalmining around the country and then in New South Wales. Let's take one part of this motion. The Greens want to shut this industry down, and I think people should know how many jobs are at stake.


Around the country there are approximately 55,000 direct jobs for Australians in the coal industry. There are around 145,000 related jobs for Australians. That is $6 billion in wages paid to Australian workers through the coal industry. The Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics estimates coal is responsible for export earnings of $40 billion. It accounts for around 15 per cent of Australia's total exports. Senator Milne gets on her feet and says she wants to see $40 billion of export industry, $6 billion of wages and 145,000 jobs killed through a motion like this if their policy prescription were followed.


It goes further. State treasury papers record that the coal industry was responsible for royalty payments of $20.5 billion between 2006-07 and 2012-13. Deloitte Access Economics estimate the coal industry is responsible for $17.7 billion in company tax in that same period. Think of the impact if that amount of company tax were not paid, if that amount of royalties had not been paid to the states. Who would pay for the hospitals? Who would pay for the schools? Who would pay for the roads? It is an extraordinary argument that we are hearing. Professor Sinclair Davidson says coal's overall contribution to our economy can be estimated at up to $60 billion. This is a massive industry for Australia, and to say we can kill an industry because the Greens do not like it is absurd and should be rejected.


Coal is responsible for 34 per cent of Australia's primary energy and 75 per cent of our grid electricity. In New South Wales it accounts for 90 per cent of grid electricity. Let's have a look at New South Wales stats when it comes to coalmining. In 2012-13 $17.8 billion worth of coal was mined in New South Wales. Eighty-five per cent of that, worth $15.2 billion, was exported. More generally in mining in New South Wales, there are 40,000 jobs and $1.3 billion in royalties a year. This is the size of this industry that the Greens are now arguing should be shut down. No party deserves to be taken seriously when they come out with these kinds of statements. This would be the world according to the Greens: an industry that employs 145,000 Australians, an industry which is one of our largest exporters would be shut down. For the states we would not have the ability to fund the essential services that they need if they were just going to shut down industries and throw out jobs as the Greens would have them do.


Let's go to the issue of coal seam gas. I think the other point to make about this motion is that it also seeks to have the Senate dictate to the state of New South Wales what their policies should be. That is the other aspect of this that I object to. I do believe that the people of New South Wales should be able to decide how they use their resources, how they manage their economy, what kind of rules and regulations they put in place for environmental approvals and others. I think it is an important point to make. But, given this motion does try to dictate terms to the New South Wales government, I think it is worth looking at some of what has actually been put in place by the New South Wales coalition government.


When it comes to coal seam gas, there is no doubt that the New South Wales government wants to see things done sustainably, reasonably and using world's-best-practice standards. I think all people in New South Wales, and all Australians, do not want just to see industries completely banned; they want us to be careful, to be cautious, to ensure that we have excellent environmental standards. The former New South Wales Labor government gave out 39 petroleum exploration licences with no oversight and no regard for the environment, no regard for water or the impacts on our best agricultural land. There was no community consultation. The Baird government has taken a different approach. It has a sensible plan to manage coal seam gas and clean up the former Labor government's mess. They are buying back the licences that Labor issued without any consideration of the impact on the community—12 licences have been bought and cancelled—and they have put a freeze on new licences for 12 months. They are taking a very cautious and responsible approach to this issue. 


As a result of steps taken by the Baird government, New South Wales now has the toughest CSG regulations in the country. They have put in place a moratorium on CSG exploration in Sydney's drinking water catchment, they have implemented CSG exclusion zones within two kilometres of homes and critical industries, they have mapped more than two million hectares of prime agricultural land and protected it from CSG activities and they have banned the use of BTEX chemicals and evaporation ponds. Importantly, the New South Wales coalition government has appointed a Land and Water Commissioner to assist landowners and oversee CSG exploration. As usual, Labor caused the problem and it is up to the coalition to clean it up. As usual, the Greens are not interested in what is being done—they are simply interested in slogans and grandstanding. Unlike the Greens, the Baird government has done the hard work—it has examined the issue, discussed the issue, developed a policy and dealt with the issue. The Greens would rather just make noise in the Senate—yell and shut down entire industries that employ hundreds of thousands of Australians and that are responsible for tens of billions of dollars of economic activity and exports. The Baird government has been far more sensible than that. The coalition have a different approach from the Greens.


Going back to coal, coal is one of our largest export commodities. We are exporting to places in the world where many people do not have access to electricity. There are billions of people in the world, who the Greens do not care about, who do not have access to electricity. Exporting to those places helps to lift people out of poverty. The Greens are interjecting, but what is it about lifting people out of poverty that they object to so much? It is all very well to sit in a comfortable place with a middle-class existence in Australia and say we are going to shut down the coal industry, we are no longer going to help people out of poverty; we are not just going to put tens of thousands of Australians out of a job but we are going to forget about the hundreds of millions of people in India who do not have access to electricity. We have the opportunity to provide cheap and affordable electricity that will lift people out of poverty. Surely that is something we should be celebrating. Surely we should be proud of being able to assist. The Greens would kill all that. That is their approach to people living in abject poverty around the world. That is the other aspect of this issue that is worth mentioning. As I said at the start, the Greens would have us shut down entire industries—under the Greens approach the ferals would be well and truly in charge.


I turn to the national regulations on CSG. The Commonwealth government is also committed to ensuring strong and appropriate regulations for CSG mining. Through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act the government is able to use the water trigger to assess coal-seam gas and large coal mining developments that are likely to have a significant impact on water resources on a national level. The water trigger was introduced in June 2013, so the protection of water resources was made a matter of national environmental significance. As a result of the introduction, the minister can set appropriate conditions as part of the project approval to ensure any impacts from these projects on a water resource are acceptable. Since 2012 these projects have been referred to the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Developments for advice on the likely impacts on water resources. The minister takes this advice into consideration when making a final decision on approval. As at 31 January 2015 the IESC has provided advice in response to 14 requests from government regulators on coal seam gas projects—eight in Queensland, five in New South Wales and one in South Australia. Regional scale assessments of coal seam gas and large coal mining developments across New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria and other research will address key knowledge gaps, provide base line information and inform an integrated understanding of the cumulative impacts that coal seam gas and large coal mining developments have on water related assets. The priority areas of research are hydrology, ecology and chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing. 


Research is also being undertaken by the CSIRO to improve the understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from coal seam gas production. The data collected from coal-seam gas activities will inform future updates to Australia's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and methods used for the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System. Despite bringing in the water trigger, Labor never employed it. Conversely, this government has applied the water trigger to over 50 projects since taking office.




Senator Waters:
  You passed legislation to get rid of it.




Senator SESELJA:
  I am not sure the Greens heard what I just said.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Order! Senator Seselja has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator SESELJA:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I am always happy if the Greens want to contribute to the debate. If they want to continue to contribute to the debate I am happy for them to, but they did not appear to hear what I just said so I will have to repeat it: Labor, who brought in the water trigger, never used it, they never employed it once. However, the coalition has applied the water trigger to over 50 projects since taking office. The Greens interjected straight away when I mentioned that, but what part of it don't they agree with? What part of that is wrong? What part of that approach don't they support?




Senator Rhiannon:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: the senator is being misleading. In the House of Representatives, the government has passed legislation to get rid of the water trigger. That is on the record. That is their aim.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point.




Senator SESELJA:
  It is a debating point. I do not think that it is appropriate for them to spuriously use points of order because they have so badly failed in getting their message across under their leader, Senator Milne. Let me repeat, because there seems to be some confusion: this government has applied the water trigger to over 50 projects since taking office. The Labor Party did not get this policy right. We have come in and taken a sensible and appropriate approach, not one of outright bans—banning the entire coal industry as the Greens are arguing for—but one of appropriate regulation and appropriate protections. That is the sensible approach—not to just kill jobs as the Greens are arguing for with this motion.


The Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development has produced 15 scientific reports informing bioregional assessments and 20 scientific reports on risks to environmental health from chemicals, on ecosystems, on water and on aquifer connectivity. Labor did not publish any of these reports. They preferred to hide the facts from the public in order to preserve their political relationship with the Greens, and the Greens were happy to swallow it. They were happy to swallow that from the Labor Party because it was in their interests—since they formed part of that government. They had no real concern; they were happy to swallow it. They did not seem to be interested in any of this.


We on this side of the chamber have taken a very different approach—a science based approach. We are getting the research done to make sure that, as we proceed, we do so carefully and cautiously. We proceed with a view to growing our economy whilst preserving prime agricultural land and protecting our natural resources. Surely that is the sensible policy option—employing the best scientists from the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia to do the work to ensure we get it right. I know that Minister Hunt takes his responsibilities under the EPBC Act very seriously. That is in stark contrast to what we have seen from those opposite. 


In looking at the hypocrisy of the Greens on some of these issues, I think Martin Ferguson, the former Labor Minister for Resources and Energy, said it best:


Their rhetoric is symptomatic of a broader malaise; our increasing inability to listen to, analyse, and properly understand the words and numbers underpinning complex policy. 


Slogans should not be a substitute for serious discussion or critical thinking.


That is well said by Martin Ferguson. Slogans should not be a substitute for serious discussion or critical thinking, but that is all we get from the Greens. They want to shut down industries—based on slogans, not based on science. 


In conclusion, to support this motion would be to support calls to shut down an industry which indirectly employs around 145,000 Australians. It is one of our largest export industries and is responsible for $60 billion of economic activity. That would be absolute economic vandalism. For all of those reasons, this misguided motion from the Greens should not be supported. (Time expired)

 (Queensland) (17:11):  When a party comes before this place seeking to shut down an industry, I for one have grave concerns—particularly when we are talking about industries which make an incredible contribution to my home state of Queensland. Properly regulated oil and gas operations are safe and the Australian minerals and oil and gas industries have a strong compliance record. Senator Siewert's motion, spoken on by Senator Milne, makes a number of points that require a response. The motion is obviously timed to coincide with the New South Wales election and to contribute to the anti-science scare campaign currently being waged by inner-city activists. 


Coal seam gas is not a well-developed industry in New South Wales. In fact New South Wales imports 95 per cent of its gas from other states. Senator Siewert's call for a ban on such mining in that state would see more CSG development across the border in my home state of Queensland and in South Australia. We always need to make sure we have the right environmental approval processes in place for mining, processing and exporting our resources, including coal seam gas and coal. These approval processes should be driven by science, by thoughtful and logical policymaking and by respectful community dialogue.


It is important to focus on the scientific evidence before us. In my last speech on coal seam gas, approximately two weeks ago, I referred to a report by Mary O'Kane, the New South Wales Chief Scientist and Engineer. She conducted an independent review of coal seam gas activities in New South Wales. That report was released in September of last year and concluded that the risks associated with coal seam gas exploration and production can be managed. With an almost identical result, the Northern Territory's inquiry—recently conducted by Allan Hawke AC—found that the environmental risks associated with some of the more contentious practices can be managed effectively, subject to the creation of a robust regulatory regime. That report was finalised on 28 November last year.


At budget estimates last year, Dr Chris Pigram, the CEO of Geoscience Australia, made comments to the effect that the concerns around the practices employed by the industry are unwarranted and 'they do not represent a problem for the community by and large'. 


I would also like to make reference to the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. It was established by the former Labor government as a statutory body under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999—which we call the EPBC Act—in late 2012. The committee consists of eight members with extensive scientific qualifications and expertise in the fields of geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, ecology, eco-toxicology, natural resource management and environment protection. 


Under the EPBC Act, the committee has several legislative functions: to provide scientific advice to the Commonwealth environment minister and relevant state ministers on the water related impacts of proposed coal seam gas or large coalmining developments; provide scientific advice to the Commonwealth environment minister on bioregional assessments, including the methodology, research priorities and projects; and publish and disseminate scientific information about the impacts of coal seam gas and large coalmining activities on water resources.


The reports by Mary O'Kane and Allan Hawke are recent, credible and independent. Along with the advice provided by Geoscience Australia and the independent expert scientific committee, I would encourage all senators to make the most of this expert research and educate themselves on this issue. 


Turning to the subject of coal: Australia is fortunate to be richly endowed with a world-class supply of coal—a commodity that is essential to modern life. Coal is the world's fuel of choice for electricity, accounting for 41 per cent of all generation, because it is reliable and affordable. Australia has the fourth-largest share of proven coal reserves in the world with 110 years of black coal and 510 years of brown coal. It benefits all Australians through its contribution to exports, wages, investment and tax revenue. It is Australia's comparative advantage in coal together with other mineral and energy resources, including iron ore, that has enabled Australians to sustain the longest period of continuous economic growth in the nation's history.


The Australian coal industry employs about 50,000 people directly and also provides indirect employment for around 150,000 Australians mainly in regional locations across Australia. Australia's coal economy represents 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product or almost $60 billion. Australia's coal industry makes a significant contribution to national, state and local economies through taxes, royalties and other charges.


Coal underpins Australia's reliable and historically affordable electricity supply. Low-cost, reliable energy has been the cornerstone of Australia's economic growth and high living standards for several decades. Black and brown coal comprise Australia's principal energy source, providing 75 per cent of our electricity.


There is no solution to global baseload power generation that does not feature a major role for coal. One only need look at the International Energy Agency for some support for that proposition. Coal is very important to baseload generation, and all suggestions that coal will not play a central role in the future are not supported by the International Energy Agency.


Even under the International Energy Agency's new policy scenario, which assumes all government promises on funding renewables and building nuclear power plants are implemented, coal consumption increases by around 17 per cent through to 2035, and there is little change in the global energy mix. Coal remains about 25 per cent or higher of primary energy demand—as it was in 1980 and has been for the past 30 years. This continues to be a 25 per cent part of the energy mix that will grow and, according to the International Energy Agency, by about 40 per cent over the next quarter century. It is important for Australia to be part of that market.


Coal fired power generation has assisted in lifting over 500 million people, principally in China, out of poverty and providing them with higher standards of living. Coal fired power generation heats homes, drives industry and makes life better for billions of people around the world. It is a critical part of Australia's portfolio of export minerals. Of course we always need to make sure that we have the right environmental approval processes in place for mining and exporting our resources, including coal. We need to make sure that those processes are transparent. 


Our coal performs an important function in the global market place. Our coal is better coal and burns cleaner, and is a highly-sought after coal. High-efficiency clean coal technology is important. Coal supports many of Australia's regional communities and very many good jobs in the mining industry.


Whilst a Commonwealth ban on returning to coal seam gas would be meaningless, since we do not have a role in approving these projects, there is an important role for the Commonwealth to play. The Commonwealth needs to be working with states to, firstly, ensure that regulation in the industry is based on rigorous science, like the science provided by Mary O'Kane and Allan Hawke, rather than knee-jerk reactions; and, secondly, developing a harmonised and best-practice framework for CSG activity.


The federal government presently has environmental responsibility only if a project or activity has the potential to impact on matters of national environmental significance as defined under the EPBC Act and the Water Act.


Australia's national environment law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, was amended in June 2013 by Labor, to provide that water resources are a matter of national environmental significance, in relation to coal seam gas and large coalmining development. This means that coal seam gas and large coalmining developments require federal assessment and approval if they are likely to have a significant impact on a water resource. Proposals that have been assessed by the Commonwealth have only been allowed to proceed after careful consideration of the potential groundwater impacts.


In terms of CSG, on the last occasion that I made a contribution, I acknowledged the concerns that we heard in the Senate inquiry into certain aspects of the Queensland government administration. It is quite true that there were many landholders and their representatives who came before that committee providing evidence about treatment that they had received at the hands of some of the mining companies. I have been on record as saying—and I will say it again today—that, on occasions, those companies have not helped themselves in some of the inconsistent treatment that they have dealt to landowners in my home state of Queensland. One does need to ensure that a proper level of consultation and proper levels of regulation exist.


Nevertheless, global energy markets are being transformed by gas from coal seams, shale and tight gas. The use of CSG as an energy source is longstanding and accounts for 33 per cent of the eastern states' domestic gas production. For example, 95 per cent of gas used in Queensland comes from CSG. CSG powers a number of domestic electric generation projects throughout Queensland, including the Origin Energy operated Darling Downs Power Station and the Braemar 2 Power Station.


The policy challenge for state governments is twofold: to ensure the appropriate compensation of landholders for the access and use of their land, and to ensure that coal seam gas is exploited on behalf of their citizens, unlocking an important transition fuel, providing a source of employment and export income and generating a long-term revenue source through royalties and rents.


Coal seam gas exploration represents an immense opportunity for Australia, particularly regional Australia. LNG projects in Queensland's CSG-to-LNG industry are worth more than $70 billion and are responsible for almost 30,000 jobs. The policy challenge for the Commonwealth is to ensure more gas production and the best possible environmental protection. 


This industry has created good, sustainable jobs, particularly in regional communities, boosted the economy at both the state and federal level and will deliver billions in government revenue. It will lift Australia's export income and provide state and Commonwealth governments with a significant source of revenue. As a cleaner alternative to coal fired power, LNG is an essential part of the global solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provides many jobs and opportunities in regional Australia.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-03-19,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  The contributions that we have heard from the two previous senators, representing Labor and the coalition, show how enormously out of touch they are with what is happening in Australia today. There is an enormous shift in public understanding and public opinion about how we should look after our farming land, how we should protect our environment, how we should deliver our energy and where we can create jobs. The depth of misunderstanding and misrepresentation that we have heard from the two previous speakers is really breathtaking and once again underlines why this motion is so important. Yet again we are going to see Labor, Liberal and the Nationals voting together in a very backward way on such an important issue.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  It's called a democratic majority.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I acknowledge yet again Senator O'Sullivan from Queensland is here making his interjections in a way that really reinforces how out of touch he is.


Much of this motion is about the situation in New South Wales, which, along with Queensland, is to the forefront of this coal rush that is potentially set to destroy so many areas. It is worth remembering why people are so angry with the Baird Liberal-National government. This is a government which is coming forward with some shocking coal projects. While it was the former Labor government that weakened the planning process, with support from the then coalition opposition, and approved many of the exploration licences for the mines and coal seam gas projects I will deal with, it is now the Baird government that is allowing these mines to go ahead. 


It is the Baird government that approved the Shenhua Watermark mine on the Liverpool Plains and the Maules Creek coalmines. Then there is the Wallarah 2 coalmine, where they broke a very clear election promise from 2011, when then Premier Barry O'Farrell had his photo taken, along with a whole number of colleagues, illustrating his opposition to the Wallarah 2 coalmine. But then they broke that promise and gave that mine approval. That one is to proceed. Then there is the Warkworth coalmine, a real monster. This is where Rio Tinto is in action. If it is allowed to go ahead, it will destroy the township of Bulga, but the government have come up with their crazy plan of wanting to move that township. 


Everything you look at when it comes to coalmine approvals from the Baird government shows what a damaging track they are on. On top of that, we have the Narrabri Gas Project and fracking just 700 metres from homes in the beautiful Gloucester region. The government are moving so fast because they are under pressure from coal seam gas companies and coalmining companies that want approval very quickly. They can see the world is turning its back on these dangerous fossil fuels. They want to get in quickly before the price of these fossil fuels drops even further.


I said in my opening remarks how out of touch Labor, Liberal and Nationals MPs are. This has been shown in communities that have been impacted by these forms of mining, particularly around the Tamworth-Liverpool Plains area. A poll taken by Lock the Gate Alliance earlier this year showed that 87 per cent of respondents were concerned about the risks of coal seam gas mining, 83 per cent said landholders should have the right to say no to mining and 66 per cent were opposed any coalmines on the Liverpool Plains. Strong opposition is growing around the country. People are understanding what is going on here.


I was fortunate to have the mining portfolio for the Greens when I was in the New South Wales parliament. It was hard going on this issue in the early 2000s. Understandably, people were only just starting to be informed. Awareness was only just starting to build that there were other ways to deliver our energy and other ways to ensure we could have manufacturing based on clean methods. Continuing concern was demonstrated about a week ago, again in the Liverpool Plains area—and it is very relevant to this debate—where more than 700 people came together from 87 communities in the north-west to declare a 'gasfield-free' area. These 87 communities stretched across north-west New South Wales, covering three million hectares—from Tamworth up to Gunnedah, right up to the Queensland border and then west of Walgett. It is very impressive that so many people came together: Indigenous people, farmers, people from Queensland and people from far-flung areas are coming together to demonstrate their deep concern. Why was it done so close to Liverpool Plains? The real worry now is that this China Shenhua mine could go ahead, posing a risk to incredibly rich farming land. If you have not been there, you really should go. I have spent a lot of time in western New South Wales, but the richness of this soil was such a pleasure to see. The productivity of this land is really exceptional, with, in some areas, 40 per cent higher productivity than the average across the country.


One of the farmers who spoke at this gathering was Andrew Pursehouse. His farm would be surrounded by the Chinese owned Shenhua coalmine if were to go ahead. He spoke in ways that everybody should hear. He spelt it out, saying that had been a member of the National Party and that he had voted for the National Party, for Mr Anderson, in the 2011 state election. He said that this time he would be voting for the Independent candidate, Peter Draper. These are his words:


The Nationals are asleep at the wheel and not prepared to stand up against their Liberal colleagues to represent their constituents.


Those words ring loud around this chamber, because that is what we see all the time. Australia would be such a healthier democracy if the Nationals had the courage to break ranks with their Liberal colleagues and to stand up in this place for what they try and make out to farmers and their constituents in rural areas. The inconsistency is massive. There is another wonderful quote here from Mr Andrew Pursehouse, when he says:


As a farmer, we're not against mining, it's just in the wrong spot. You just don't put a toilet in the middle of your best farming country.


So what is happening on the Liverpool Plains? The pressure is really on. BHP Billiton is looking to mine just 10 kilometres from the Shenhua mine. If it goes ahead, they would look to take out 500 million tonnes of coal. Santos has gas exploration across the whole of the Liverpool Plains flood plain. That is such a massive area. China Shenhua has its exploration across 190 square kilometres of this prime agricultural land and the ridges where the valuable water sources feed into.


Just last week I was at Tambar Springs, also on the Liverpool Plains. I have been there many times, listening to the farmers and hearing about their concerns, which are extensive. The pressure that these people are under, when they just want to get on and do their job in this wonderful area—really, you should just not sacrifice productive farming land. Farming land, under no circumstances, should be mined or developed on. Where the world is now, we cannot afford that. It was a very informative trip. When I talked to people during my days there, the issue of ICAC came up again. My colleague Senator Christine Milne spoke in great detail in a very important contribution on this issue. I would again like to share with senators a very important finding of the ICAC report Reducing the opportunities and incentives for corruption in the state's management of coal resources. While this is referring to what happened under the former Labor government, it should be seen as a warning bell for what is happening now. The report stated:




In preparing this report, the question facing the Commission was not simply how the state
'
s policy and regulatory framework could 
allow coal Els—





exploration
 licences—





of great value to be corruptly provided to favoured recipients, but how it could have been so easy to do so. It is inconceivable that in any other portfolio area of government such value could be corruptly transferred from the state to favoured individuals with such relative ease.





There it is—
'
how it could have been so easy to do so
'
. We are talking about corruption on a grand scale here. How was it so easy? My concern, shared by many of the people that I meet when I work in western New South Wales, is that that continues.




Because it is so hard to find out what is going on now, some of the recent history in relation to the Liverpool Plains is very relevant. It was back in the mid-2000s when the now disgraced, and found to be corrupt, former mining minister Ian Macdonald was riding high in the then Labor government. How he pulled this off, we still do not know. He comes up with this: getting huge payouts for exploration licences from coal companies. Remember, we are just talking about exploration here. Accordingly, I remember Ian Macdonald so often answering my questions that I would ask in the New South Wales upper house: 
'
It
'
s just exploration; there
'
s no guarantee that they will be granted full rights to mine; we
'
ve got a robust process.
'

He would always be making those grand statements. But what he did was get huge amounts of money, hundreds of millions of dollars out of BHP Billiton and out of China Shenhua just for exploring. My office found at the time that the highest fee for an exploration licence prior to what Mr Macdonald pulled off had been $10 million. But here we had BHP Billiton paying $125 million for an exploration licence at Caroona on the Liverpool Plains, and China Shenhua paying $300 million. That certainly suggested why Mr Macdonald got away with so much—because he found this way to pull in big money for the then New South Wales Labor government.


But what was the deal done to achieve that? These companies did not give so much money—and we found out that China Shenhua actually handed over more money—without there being some arrangements. What we found was that China Shenhua also guaranteed they would invest $170 million for transport infrastructure and an additional $200 million if the mining lease was eventually granted. That is a huge amount of money when supposedly China Shenhua was not guaranteed that it was going to get a coalmine.


What you saw then was how China Shenhua conducts itself once the exploration starts. It really made a fuss of the planning process that we have in New South Wales for coal mining. Remember the planning process that we have was signed off by the joint vote of Liberal, Labor and Nationals solidly voting time and time again to weaken the laws around mining and planning in New South Wales.


Why I say it is a farce is because so quickly was China Shenhua out there taking action that to any casual observer, particularly the people of the Liverpool Plains—every time I am there, these are the stories they relate—China Shenhua was absolutely confident that they had it in the bag, that exploration was just the first stage of full-scale approval. China Shenhua was buying up huge amounts of prime agricultural land, buying up water licences. As we know, China Shenhua is well known for operating its own railways, ports and power plants. I am not sure where the money is coming from.


Again it was told to me, and I saw some of it when I was there recently, that so much of this upgrade of infrastructure around Gunnedah and those railway lines is proceeding. The Greens are great backers of public transport. But if money has already been put in by China Shenhua, it again raises real concerns: Why are they pushing ahead in putting in hundreds of million dollars when they have not got final approval for the mine?


We then need to look at Mr Macdonald's record. What was agreed to when all this money was handed over? He made five work related trips to China: one in 2005, one in 2007 and three between January 2008 and July 2009. There are very few details about what happened at that time. Local member Barnaby Joyce is regularly out there talking up his commitment to this area. But what was the agreement after making all those trips?


The local talk is that there were agreements around fast tracking the process, that they would be free to buy up farmland, free to buy water licences. If push comes to shove and they really get locked down, where they will be able to mine is on the ridges surrounding this beautiful flood plain of rich agricultural land. There are so many unanswered questions that we should get to the bottom of.


I do congratulate former lower House member, Tony Windsor, for the work that he has done in this area. What we see coming into this New South Wales state election is that clearly the Baird government have been under pressure because it looked like a decision could be made on China Shenhua literally on the eve of the election. What did the federal environment minister, Mr Hunt, do? He stepped in with the statement that he was going to stop the clock on the project and that they would use the water trigger there.


Tony Windsor set out some very clear questions that this government should answer on how it is conducting this water trigger. One of the big ones, something that the Greens call for regularly and that the community groups are calling for, is that when you start examining the impact of a mine in an area, you need to look at the cumulative impacts and clearly that is essential on the Liverpool Plains. In my opening remarks, I talked about the pressure this area is under from Santos, from BHP Billiton, from China Shenhua. You cannot just look at one mine. So is that part of how they are conducting themselves?


Mr Windsor also asked what exactly is Mr Hunt asking the independent expert scientific committee to review? Considering that under the water trigger, the significance of an action has to be considered with other developments past, present and the foreseeable future, will they be looking at the cumulative impacts? These things need to go hand-in-hand together. Another question Mr Windsor asked was: will the IESC carry out the bioregional assessment of the impact of the proposed mine on the Namoi catchment as originally discussed? Those questions are on the public record and this government should be answering them.


I also want to pay tribute to my colleague in the New South Wales state parliament, Jeremy Buckingham, who has revealed some interesting developments with Labor just recently where they did actually return $2,200 of money given to the Labor Party to Santos. But what has not been returned is $90,000 given to federal Labor. As Mr Buckingham has pointed out, what a contradiction. He has called on that money to be returned, and I know that some of the locals are saying that this is money that should be put to good use.


We are talking about massive donations here. Since 1998 the Labor Party has received about $4 million in donations from the resource and energy sector and the Liberal and National parties have received about $9.5 million from the resource sector. These figures are from the past 15 years. Santos alone has donated $1.3 million and AGL over half a million dollars. And in 2013-14, donations from mining companies to the federal coalition increased by 350 per cent on the previous year.


That was in an election year, but it is significant that such a huge jump occurred. It goes to the point that Senator Christine Milne made: what is the link here between the companies giving the money and the political party that gains office, and how do they weaken the laws to make it easier for these companies to make a profit? This motion should be supported; it goes to the very heart of the type of Australia that we need to build—free of corruption and with clean energy, plentiful jobs and clean manufacturing.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-03-19,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (17:45):  It is a great honour to stand up in unity with so many other senators in this chamber to condemn the economic lunacy of the Greens. These guys are economic lunatics when it comes to this issue. It is not about the Liverpool Plains, this motion; this motion says clearly that the Greens party:


… calls on all parties contesting the New South Wales state election to commit to a ban on coal and coal seam gas mining.


To ban coal mining in New South Wales! That would bankrupt the state of New South Wales and it would bankrupt this country, but the Greens do not care because they know nothing about economics.


You know that you should not believe anything they say on this issue, because this is a case where you should not do as they do; just do as they say. The Greens, I am sure, like the rest of us, get planes to come here. I am sure I have seen Greens senators turn up to this place in cars—in cars! And I do not think that they are solar-panel-powered cars! I do not think that we have those in the COMCAR fleet.


Today we heard in question time that the Greens referred to a road being invested in in Victoria, in Melbourne, as a 'polluting' road. I did not realise that roads could pollute, but apparently they can pollute. Everything pollutes, according to the Greens. So, every time we are on a road we pollute. Why do the Greens actually get in a car and come to this place? Why do they use cars to come to this place, Senator Nash?




Senator Nash:
  That's right!




Senator CANAVAN:
  I do not quite understand it. If they are polluting when doing that, why do they not come here by some other means?


Now, I realise that we do not necessarily have the facilities or infrastructure in this place to provide for alternative modes of transport for the Greens. For example, I have never seen—and maybe Senator O'Sullivan can correct me, because I know he is a keen horseman—hitching posts at the front of the Senate chamber. So maybe the Greens would like to ride their horses into the chamber one morning—instead of getting into their cars, they would love to ride their horses. But we do not have any hitching posts. I am sure this corner of the chamber, the Nationals—and I have not taken this to our party room—would support a motion for some hitching posts to be installed at the front of the Senate chamber so that we can all ride our horses to the Senate and we do not have to rely on the evil fossil fuels that we all do today.


The Greens do want to take us back to the dark ages. They do not believe in modern society—at least, they talk about not believing in modern society. They are happy to live with the benefits of it, but they do not believe in steel, because that is made from coal; they do not believe in cars, because they are powered by petrol; and they do not believe in modern agriculture, because modern agriculture is actually powered by fossil fuels. I will get to that as well.


The other thing that is interesting about this motion is that it actually calls for us to ban coal mining. I remember during the last federal election campaign that the Greens had all these spending proposals. They wanted to build a fast rail from Brisbane to Melbourne—that is about $100 billion—and they wanted to introduce free dental care—that is another few billion dollars. All their promises added up to hundreds of billions of dollars. And when they were asked—as, of course, they would be by a forensic media—'How are you going to pay for all of those commitments? How are you going to pay for all of those promises?' do you know what they said? Their stock standard response was, 'We're going to put in place a mining tax. We are going to put in a mining tax to fund the fast rail from Brisbane to Melbourne. We are going to put in a mining tax to fund all these multibillion dollar promises.'


I do not know how a mining tax works when you do not have a coal-mining industry. How is that going to raise any money, if they want to ban the coal-mining industry but they are going to put on a mining tax to fund all their promises? It does not add up! Something is not quite right there. If you believe you are going to fund everything from a mining tax then you must believe that you want to continue some form of mining which is going to make money to pay the tax.


The Greens always want to talk about the future, because they know that they can confuse people about the future. The future, of course, is undetermined, so they talk about what we will have in the future. I have heard Senator Rhiannon, who just contributed to this debate, say before that we could be 100 per cent renewable by 2020 in Sydney. One hundred per cent renewable! I do not know what we are going to do when the sun does not shine or the wind does not blow, but we can be 100 per cent renewable. But you cannot argue about the past. The past is the fact of the matter and you cannot argue about what has happened in the last 30 years across the globe. And in the last 30 years across the globe, we have used 40 per cent more oil than in 1980—so 35 years, actually; we have used 107 per cent more coal—we have more than doubled our use of coal in the global economy; and we have used 131 per cent more natural gas. Those are all fossil fuels and all fantastic technologies that have pulled—as Senator Ketter said before, and I fully support his comments—hundreds of millions of people out of poverty across our globe.


There are still hundreds of millions of people without access to electricity—not any electricity; not dearer electricity, or cheaper electricity or some electricity—no electricity. There are about 300 million people in India who do not have access to any electricity. In Central Queensland we had a tropical cyclone go through recently—through Yeppoon and Rockhampton. Many of us were without power for a week or more. My house was out of power for six days. I tell you what: people understood what it was like not to have electricity. People understood that we have probably become a bit soft these days—after six days people were at their wits end in not having air conditioning, in not being able to refrigerate food easily or even in not being able to cook food at all if they did not have gas or some other source of energy.


People understood that actually they did not want to go back to the dark ages. It is actually a fantastic thing that people have access to cheap electricity to warm their homes for their families or to cool them in hotter areas. That is a great thing; it is a great advancement for human beings all around the world, and the only way we maintain that is through access to cheap and affordable electricity which, right now, means fossil fuels. You cannot get away from the fact that if you want to have access to cheap, permanent, consistent electricity, across 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, you need to use fossil fuels. It is a basic scientific fact right now. I say, 'Let's listen to the science and support those industries that provide those great benefits to the whole globe.'


It is not just about access to cheaper electricity for people to turn on their lights and their air-conditioners and power their cars; it is actually also to have food as well. The Greens love to talk about how the black soil plains look fantastic and it is fantastic to see a wheat crop growing when you drive past it on your way back to Sydney, but they never actually understand how this stuff works, how it is grown and how people actually turned what is a barren, sometimes treed area of land into something that produces food for millions of people around the world. We produce enough food to feed 60 million people around the globe. How do we do that? We do that by converting energy into food. That is all farmers do. They take energy that is in the soil, in the ground and in organic matter and turn that into products that human beings can eat, whether that is through a cow that can eat grass and turn that into the protein or whether it is nitrogen being turned into a wheat crop. It is all farmers do.


This takes a lot of hard work, because when you look at modern food production—the fact that we can feed a lot of people around the world very easily today, many more than we could hundred years ago—a lot of energy goes into it. There was a study done in the United States—I have never been able to find one for Australian cropping—where someone showed that it takes actually 100 kilograms of oil equivalent to produce just one tonne of wheat. That is taking into account all of the fertiliser, tractors, diesel that is used and electricity to irrigate a hectare of land. It is 100 kilograms of oil equivalent of power. That is their metric. We tend to use the actual metric rather than imperial measures. If you convert that to our measures, it is four gigajoules of power for one tonne of wheat.


What does that mean in cost terms? Urea is just basically taking nitrogen out of the air, which is all around us; more than 70 per cent of the air around us today is nitrogen. Nitrogen is compressed through the basic technology into urea, which can be used—as it is now in a physical form of nitrogen—to replenish land and to then grow crops, grass or whatever you want to grow. It costs about $5 to $10 a gigajoule to convert nitrogen into urea. The diesel used for tractors, if you convert petrol prices to gigajoule terms, is about $30 per gigajoule. Irrigation, which often uses diesel powered or sometimes networked electricity, is about $60 a gigajoule.


All up, when you add all of those things together and their relative uses in the production of a wheat crop, it costs around $80 a tonne in energy inputs for one tonne of wheat. Eighty dollars a tonne is what our wheat is made up of. The cereal we eat costs about $80 a tonne to produce. I just checked the actual wheat price itself before I came in here and it is about US$250 a tonne, which is a little bit more in Australian-dollar terms these days. Still, somewhere around a third or a quarter to a third of the price of wheat—the final value of wheat after it leaves the farm—is embodied in energy. If we do not have access to cheap energy, we will not have access to cheap food and we will not be able to feed people.


All of these farmers that the Greens pretend to represent will not be able to make a profit because we will be producing wheat at a much higher cost. We will not be able to sell at the world price, because we export most of our wheat, and they will be out of a job. They will be out of a job, they will be off their farm and they will not be able to employ all the people they do when they produce food for our nation. But the Greens think that it will all be okay because we will not use natural gas to make urea any more, we will not use diesel to power our tractors and we will use wind and solar for everything. We will use wind and solar for everything we do!


The Greens always like to present wind as some form of virgin, absolutely pure and clean form of energy. But when you drive past a wind turbine next time, just think about how much steel has to be made and how much concrete has to be manufactured to make a wind turbine. What makes steel? It is coking coal and iron ore. In this motion, the Greens want to ban coalmining. You will not be able to make steel anymore. If we ban coalmining, there will be no more steel and there will be no more wind turbines. Even if you did allow some steel production still to occur in some developing country somewhere, each megawatt of wind power produced takes around 460 tonnes of steel. Each megawatt of wind power takes around 870 cubic metres of concrete as well as an input into the production of that megawatt of power.


Let's compare that to natural gas: natural gas takes 27 cubic metres of concrete and 3.3 tonnes of steel. Wind is 460 tonnes of steel per megawatt; natural gas is 3.3 tonnes of steel. Wind is 870 cubic metres of concrete; natural gas is 27 cubic metres of concrete. Which one is more environmentally friendly? Which one will ultimately use less resources and make less of an environmental impact on our manufacturing processes and our mining processes as well, which are needed to make steel?


Under the Greens' policy and the Labor Party's policy at the moment, they want us to get to a renewable energy target which is basically unachievable. We need around another 3,860 megawatts of wind to be installed by 2020 to do it. That will take, on those sums that I read out before, 1.8 million tonnes of steel. That is enough steel to build 35 aircraft carriers. We would be using the same amount of steel before 2020 in wind turbines as to actually manufacture 35 aircraft carriers. I think I know which one of those options would be of more use to Australia. The Greens do not care about all the facts in this debate. That is because they are on an emotional campaign to touch into people's dreams of having not to rely on dirty mining or the unfortunate things we have to do, but still maintain our standard of living—which is an absolute impossibility.


We have heard all of this before in regional Australia. I want to finish by quoting from a letter to The Land today, which points out that around 30 years ago the Greens ran a campaign in exactly the same area we talking about—the Liverpool Plains in Gunnedah—to ban the use of crop dusting and aerial spraying for cotton and other crops. They wanted to ban that. This letter from Geoff Swain at Carroll rightfully points out that: 'Some people have very short memories. Do they not recall that a former state government and the Greens, with the tacit approval of the then independent member for Tamworth, combined to lock up the Pilliga.' That is a forest up there. He said, 'Have they forgotten the devastation caused to the timber industry? How about the native vegetation laws, which have impacted so heavily on farmers in New South Wales?'


That is exactly right, because the Greens in this debate do not care about the people who rely on the mining sector to provide their jobs, people who rely on the timber sector to provide jobs and people who would not have a lot of other options otherwise. They only care about their votes in the inner city, which are mainly voters who rely on massive amounts of fossil fuels to power their lifestyles and continue their comfortable livelihoods.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I think it is really critical and important to note when the parliamentary committee system is doing extremely good work. I would direct senators' attention to the message from the minister where he would like to note that 'the government welcomes the recommendations of the committee'. The committee report highlights that, when implemented and delivered successfully, the NDIS will deliver economic benefits. The report also acknowledges that it is a significant, complex reform. Critically, we have a series of recommendations from the joint committee which have been agreed to, or agreed to in principle or agreed to in consultation with the stakeholders. I think that where good work has been done by all parties, it should be noted on the public record, because too much of the effort in this place is divisive, so to speak.


Having attended the trial sites in my capacity as deputy chair of this committee, and coming from a background of almost complete ignorance about the disability sector, one could not help but be totally impressed by the witnesses that came forward to explain their experience with the NDIS and with planners, and to explain the circumstances in which they have found themselves. The evidence we heard, both in public hearings and in camera, would move most people to tears. The absolute empowerment of people with disability to choose when they can have their carer provide the critical services they need has been truly gratifying for all members of the committee. 


I believe the committee has taken a completely bipartisan approach. We will always quibble around the edges, but every member of the committee is working incredibly hard. We heard from many stakeholders and participants. There has been criticism from participants, from not-for-profits; it is a really significant reform, and it is a hugely challenging endeavour. If we can continue in the vein that we have been, where the minister has responded, as I said, to either agree with the recommendations of the committee, to agree in principle with the recommendations of the committee or to agree on the proviso there be consultation with jurisdictions, then it is a very, very good outcome.


I look forward to a continued bipartisan and cooperative approach being taken, because this is such a critical reform for this country. It is empowering so many people who have tremendous disability of body but who have no disability in spirit. They are an incredibly empowering group of people to come into contact with, and they really do change the way you think. Particularly in my case, having had no experience in this sector, they changed the way I think and how I look at disability. These people just want a go. They want to be able to empower themselves in getting services. They have aspirations which are normal and accepted in the rest of the community. This endeavour is seeking to give life to those aspirations. I seek leave to continue my remarks, and hopefully I can continue reporting in the same way on the great work of this committee.


Leave granted; debate adjourned. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Gallacher. I omitted to say earlier, that, as is the usual practice, documents that are not raised or preserved will be discharged from the Notice Paper. I gather there are no objections to that happening in relation to the documents on page 9.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:01):  I rise this evening to reflect on tropical cyclone Olwyn, which struck in Western Australia's Pilbara and Gascoyne regions last Friday, and has inflicted major damage on many local communities within the federal electorate of Durack. There are many localities that have felt the force of tropical cyclone Olwyn's fury, including Exmouth, Denham, Shark Bay and Coral Bay. But perhaps the most significantly affected area has been the community in and around the town of Carnarvon, where the local horticulture industry has been devastated by the cyclone. It seems doubly cruel because, after numerous seasonal setbacks over recent years, local crop growers finally seemed assured of a good season. Cyclone Olwyn has now dashed those hopes, entirely destroying the region's banana plantations, flattening grape and other fruit and vegetable crops, and placing further economic strain on a region that has already experienced its share of hardships in that respect.


I was pleased that the federal and WA governments have worked closely together this week to provide the appropriate forms of assistance to those who have and continue to suffer the full force of the cyclone's impact. This includes assistance provided through the jointly funded Commonwealth state Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. This program provides help in the form of food supplies, clothing and accommodation to families in need of these essential items, as well as for repairs to homes and replacement of household contents. The program also provides further assistance in the form of interest rate subsidies for producers and small businesses affected by the cyclone, and freight subsidies for producers to help meet the cost of transporting livestock and equipment to non-affected areas. It also provides financial assistance to local government authorities as they go about the difficult work of repairing damaged public infrastructure and general clean-up operations.


It is a task that will be significant, with the damage to crops and to local infrastructure estimated to be north of $100 million. At this point, it is appropriate that I acknowledge the President of the Shire Carnarvon, Karl Brandenburg, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with on previous occasions and who has been absolutely steadfast this week in highlighting the cyclone's impact on his community and in advocating for the need for support. In many ways, his no-nonsense approach and clear focus this week personifies the whole community's determination to recover from its effects, as Carnarvon has done on so many occasions in the past. Mr Brandenburg can be confident of the full support he has from both myself and the federal member for Durack, Melissa Price.


Understandably, there has been a significant level of media coverage of the cyclone's after effects this week. I know my colleague Melissa Price was in Carnarvon at the weekend to see firsthand the damage and offer her own and the government's support to the local community. There have also been ministers from the WA state government on the ground to lend their support, and I know the state Treasurer, Dr Mike Nahan, with whom I met earlier today, is planning to visit tomorrow.


The physical clean-up is one thing, and will be difficult enough in itself. But as we know from experience with other natural disasters, it is the economic and the psychological scars that can often take longer to heal. As I mentioned earlier, many growers were looking forward to a bumper season. That is now off the cards. And quite apart from the obvious economic effects of that, there is a more personal sense of loss. Local growers have experienced bushfires, floods, drought, a locust plague and now a cyclone over just a few years. The sense of 'Will it ever end?' is strong amongst many in the local community.


In that respect, I am pleased that the federal government's Disaster Recovery Allowance program has been made available to those affected by the cyclone and counselling services provided as part of that which will be incredibly important over the coming weeks. Having spoken to many Liberals in the Carnarvon community, I know that this was high on their list of community needs. Yet, in reading some of the media coverage and the personal stories that have been shared by local residents over the past few days, what has struck me most is their resilience. No-one is saying: 'It's all too hard. I'm packing up. I'm leaving.' There is a determination amongst growers and amongst people living across the region not to let circumstances defeat them. This determination is something that I am sure all senators will join me in expressing their admiration for. I am also sure senators will join me in assuring the people in Carnarvon and surrounding districts across the Pilbara and the Gascoyne who have felt the impact of cyclone Olwyn that they have our full support.
