Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (09:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The government remains staunchly committed to improving protections for members of registered organisations by implementing the comprehensive plan to enhance the governance and accountability of registered organisations. To be very clear, this bill enacts a coalition policy that was first released in April 2012—more than two years ago.


This is why we are reintroducing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill that was voted down by the Labor Party and the Greens in the Senate a month ago. By voting against the legislation, they have demonstrated a refusal to support greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. They have voted against improved protection for union members and have thereby given the green light to more exploitation of honest union members by dishonest union officials. They have also voted against a clearer and simpler reporting framework that would assist both unions and employer associations to comply with the framework. 


The absolute need for this legislation almost goes without saying—the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs have been in the media on an almost daily basis and the wider community is strongly in favour of these reforms.


Until this parliament acts, Australia will not have a sufficiently robust system to ensure that the sort of corruption that was revealed during the numerous scandals can be uncovered and eradicated before it becomes systemic as it did in the infamous HSU case. It is simply no longer tenable to argue that the present system is adequate to deal with or discourage this kind of behaviour.


Unions and employer associations play a critical role in the workplace relations system and the economy more broadly, and their members invest a great deal of trust in them. The community expectation is that these registered organisations will operate to the highest of standards. These organisations are given special legislated rights. With rights come responsibilities.


The government believes that the majority of registered organisations do the right thing and in many cases maintain higher standards than those that are currently required. However, the investigations into the Health Services Union and the allegations that are coming to light through the royal commission illustrate that, unfortunately, financial impropriety can and does occur under the current governance regime and indeed that there is a rotten underbelly in some of these organisations. Let's be absolutely clear—loopholes have been identified and they need to be closed.


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill will provide the certainty and high standards of operation that members of registered organisations and the broader community rightfully expect. 


The bill introduces a suite of legislative measures designed to see governance of registered organisations lifted to a consistently high standard across the board. A more robust compliance regime will deter wrongdoing and promote first-class governance of registered organisations. 


Members of unions and the community not only want a strong regulatory regime but also want swift action taken when standards are breached. In order to do this, it is necessary to have a robust regulator with appropriate powers and resources, together with meaningful sanctions that can be applied when wrongdoing is revealed.


To improve oversight of registered organisations, the bill will establish the Registered Organisations Commission, a dedicated independent watchdog with enhanced investigation and information-gathering powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations. The new commission will have the necessary independence and the powers that it needs to regulate registered organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently.


The commission will have stronger investigation and information-gathering powers than those that currently apply. These will be modelled on those available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The commission will have the power to commence legal proceedings and refer possible criminal offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions or law enforcement agencies.


The commission will also educate, assist and advise registered organisations and their members in relation to the new obligations and ensure members are aware of their rights.


The commission will be established within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. While located within this office, the commissioner will have independence in the exercise of the relevant functions and powers under the law, and the authority to direct staff in relation to the performance of those functions. A special financial account will also be established for the commission to ensure financial independence, and the commissioner will have responsibility for day-to-day management of the account. The special account cannot be used, as has been suggested by some parties, to raise revenue through collection of moneys related to penalties applied to registered organisations and their officers.


The commission will be required to report to the Minister for Employment annually on its activities, and that report will be tabled in the parliament. The commissioner will appear at Senate estimates. The activities of the commission will also be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability.


The bill also provides for information sharing between the Fair Work Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission to the extent that is required for both organisations to do their job effectively and efficiently. This is required as several administrative tasks relating to registered organisations will continue to be the responsibility of the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission.


Transitional arrangements have been included in the bill to ensure any ongoing matters being dealt with by the Fair Work Commission relating to registered organisations can be transferred to the Registered Organisations Commission. 


This bill will also strengthen existing financial transparency obligations for registered organisations and officers. It is entirely appropriate to expect a high standard of financial reporting from our registered organisations, given the trust members place in their unions and employer associations to operate honestly and to use the funds derived from their membership fees to represent their interests rather than for any ulterior purposes. Registered organisations have substantial economic, legal and political influence. It is clearly inconsistent with community expectations for such organisations to operate to lower standards than those that apply to corporations or other comparable bodies. 


Mr Thomson, Mr Williamson and the unfolding allegations arising out of the royal commission have shown us that the existing regulation does not sufficiently protect members' interests. Unfortunately, there will always be less scrupulous individuals who will seek to take advantage of their positions when standards of accountability and the risk of getting caught are too low. In the face of this kind of behaviour, a strong message needs to be sent to discourage wrongdoing by officers and to rebuild the confidence of members and the community. These measures, however, will have little impact if the penalties for wrongdoing are not high enough to act as a deterrent. 


Currently, registered organisations and officers do not face the same consequences as companies and directors for wrongdoing. That is why the government is introducing higher civil penalties and a range of criminal penalties for organisations and officials who are found by courts of law to have done the wrong thing. These penalties are consistent with those faced by companies and directors who break the law. In relation to civil penalty breaches, the maximum penalty for serious contraventions will be $204,000 for an individual or $1,020,000 for a body corporate. This will apply to serious contraventions. What will constitute a serious contravention is defined in the bill. Other breaches will face a maximum civil penalty of $17,000 for an individual or $85,000 for a body corporate. By way of comparison, the current maximum penalties for even the worst misbehaviour are only $10,200 for individuals. 


Let me be very clear, it is the government's expectation that the highest of penalties will be rarely handed out but it is important that the courts have the ability to hand down strong penalties should the crime deserve it. We know that the courts have had an issue with the current framework with Federal Court Judge Anthony North making quite unprecedented comments last year, saying:


The penalties [under the current Act] are rather beneficially low…beneficial to wrongdoers.


This bill will also give the Federal Court the power to disqualify an officer from holding office where a civil penalty provision has been contravened and the court is satisfied that disqualification is justified. 


Criminal penalties are being introduced for serious breaches of officers' duties as well as offences in relation to the conduct of investigations under the Registered Organisations Act. The maximum penalties in these areas are $340,000 or five years imprisonment or both and again will be handed down by a court which will use its discretion.


Broadly, these offences relate to officers and employees of registered organisations who fail to exercise their powers or discharge duties in good faith and for a proper purpose. They also apply where an officer uses their position to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or uses information gained while an officer or an employee to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else.


Some registered organisations have indicated concern that the new penalties will mean that they will have difficulty persuading people to take on official responsibilities. The government certainly does not agree. The only people who have anything to fear are those who do the wrong thing. Officers who are operating within the law, which is the overwhelming majority of them, will have no reason to fear taking on official responsibilities. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that the unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing member confidence in registered organisations as a whole. There should be no difference between the penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholders' funds and a registered organisations boss who misuses members' money.


I recognise the broad community consensus for the government's amendments, including from one of Australia's most prominent union bosses, Mr Paul Howes, the outgoing head of the Australian Workers Union, who told the ABC on 26 November 2012:


I actually believe there is a higher responsibility for us as guardians of workers' money to protect that money and to act diligently and honestly. The reality is I do not have any issue with increasing the level of requirements and penalties on trade unions for breaching basic ethics like misappropriation of funds.


Anyone in this place who has regard for the best interests of members of registered organisations and the protection of their hard-earned contributions will support this bill. The refusal of the Labor Party and the Greens to support the bill as introduced in November 2013 is delaying the government's attempts to protect honest union members.


The government believes the bill sets an appropriately high standard for the governance and regulation of registered organisations. It responds to the legitimate concerns of members of registered organisations and the community as a result of the shocking behaviour of certain Health Services Union officials and allegations arising out of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Only those officers who do the wrong thing have anything to lose from these changes. Members of registered organisations and the community have everything to gain. I commend the bill to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-19,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (13:34):  It is difficult to recall a government with as poor an environmental record as the Abbott government. Last night the World Heritage Committee rebuked the Prime Minister's environmental measures and gave the government one year to improve its management of the Great Barrier Reef before reconsidering whether to have it listed as in danger. The Great Barrier Reef is an asset for all Australians, but it is being treated with abandon by this government—a government that is walking away from the hard science on climate change in favour of the lunatic fringe.


There are members of this government who do not believe that the planet is warming, who believe that climate change is a great hoax of the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and NASA. Members of the government share the view of this weathervane Prime Minister that climate change is, as he put it, 'absolute crap'. The Prime Minister has held many views on many issues. He has famously flipped his view on paid parental leave, once saying he would only support it over his dead body and now casting it as his signature move. He said there would be no cuts to the pension, health or education and has now backflipped on that. As the member for Wentworth has noted, he has held every possible position on climate change. The time for cheap talk on climate change must be over. We need hard science and good economics to guide decisions.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I can confirm that pensions will go up every six months under this government. They will go up every six months under this government. This government has absolutely delivered on its commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. We have absolutely delivered on our commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. It is true that we have not continued with a national partnership agreement on pensioner concessions, but pensioner concessions are overwhelmingly the preserve of the states. Less than 10 per cent of the value of pensioner concessions was provided by the Commonwealth, and, given that in this budget the Commonwealth is providing the states with some $9 billion more, we thought that this was a small price for the states to pay toward the task of budget repair.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence on my left.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am pleased to say that, so far, every single state has undertaken to continue to maintain the value of pensioner concessions.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:05):  I am delighted to get the last question of the day, and I am sure my colleagues will be very pleased as well that we are getting an opportunity to talk about higher education. The government's reforms to higher education spread opportunity to many more Australian students and will change the contribution that taxpayers and students make—



Dr Chalmers interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Rankin is warned.




Mr PYNE:
  from the current sixty-forty arrangements to fifty-fifty, which we think is a fair and reasonable contribution for students to make. I would like to read a letter I received from Graeme Mitchell, a graduate of the University of Western Sydney. It very much encapsulates exactly what the government is trying to achieve through our higher education reforms: 'My father died in my second-last year at high school. I lost all interest in education and bombed out. My then deputy principal told me and several colleagues we were dills and would never amount to much. I had to get a job to help support my family. My dad's death, my deputy principal's expressed opinion of me and the dead-end job I was obliged to take did nothing for my self-worth. I drifted from one dead-end job to another. In my 40s I became aware of HECS and applied for uni entry as a mature-age student, not thinking for a moment that I would make it, but I did. I graduated second in my course, in the top one per cent of all faculties, and won several outstanding-student awards. My academic achievement gave my self-worth an enormous boost. My degree got me a much better job and income, and I had the satisfaction of paying something back to the society that had supported me through uni. My HECS contribution was a pittance compared to my post-degree income.'


Graeme writes: 'My advice to uni students is to accept the generous contribution taxpayers make to your education and not look at HECS as a government imposed tax but look at the satisfaction—



Mr Snowdon interjecting—



Ms Owens interjecting—



Dr Chalmers interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The members for Lingiari and Parramatta will desist, and the member for Rankin has been warned.




Mr PYNE:
  of having personally paid for some of it themselves.' Who could disagree with that? Who could disagree with Graeme Mitchell's stated remarks? He understands the transformative impact of higher education. Rather than whinge, moan and complain about being asked to contribute to his own higher education, he pulled himself up from the bootstraps, got himself the higher education qualifications he needed and massively increased his income and his self-worth.


The government is trying to reform higher education so that tens of thousands more Graeme Mitchells around Australia in places like Western Sydney in the member for Lindsay's electorate get the opportunity to do exactly what Graeme Mitchell did. Rather than caterwauling, interrupting and showing the crassness that the Labor Party exhibits, they should be thanking people like Graeme Mitchell because he is one of the salt-of-the-earth Australians that we want to hold up as heroes.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:12):  We just heard a personal explanation from the member for Dawson. I say to the member for Dawson: it will take more than that to save you in your electorate following the bringing down of this horrendous budget. It will take more than your opposition to that terrible PPL scheme to save you in Dawson. I hope constituents in Dawson are listening to this debate this afternoon because I have no doubt that, at the conclusion of this debate, my colleagues and I will have convinced them and left them in no doubt that this is a bad budget for rural and regional Australia. While there is a lot of competition in measuring which is the biggest broken promise in this budget, I suspect many of them will come to the conclusion that the increased fuel taxes in this budget will go down as the worst broken promise of all. I hope that the constituents of the member for Dawson are listening. I hope that the constituents of the member for Eden-Monaro are listening. I hope the constituents of the members for New England, Page, Capricornia, Braddon, Lyne and Parkes are listening. They are all members who represent rural and regional Australia who I know fear going back to their electorates again this weekend because of their incapacity to sell this terrible budget to their constituents.


It is Thursday afternoon and I know everyone is pretty tired and, indeed, they are probably tiring of budget debate, so I thought I would keep everyone alert this afternoon by starting with a quiz. I have a quiz for members this afternoon and I invite all members on both sides of the chamber to participate. I have some questions this afternoon. The first is about people who have embarrassed themselves in politics. The second is about political parties which have embarrassed themselves in politics and then I have three questions on mathematics—three maths questions just to keep people alert.


The first question is about people embarrassing themselves in politics. I am going to share a quote with the chamber and then I am going to ask people who this quote is from. I am going to give people hints because, as I said, I know we are all a bit tired on Thursday afternoon. So I am going to give people hints. This is a person who has actually served in this place and, in fact, remains in this place. The person says this of fuel taxes: 'Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside the capital cities. It is a tax on farming in the distant parts of our nation. It is a tax on living and setting up a business in a country town.'


Now, who do members think might have said that in this place?



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Was it the member for Parkes? Do I hear the member for Parkes?



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  No? Was it the member for Richmond? It might have been the member for Richmond—it sounds like something she might say. Was it the member for Bendigo? It could have been something she would say, but no. That quote comes from someone on that side of the chamber. That quote comes from none other than the Deputy Prime Minister of this country!


That was a question about people embarrassing themselves in this place. Now, what about political parties embarrassing themselves in this place? The question is: which party would take the prize for ultimate embarrassment in this parliament? Would it be the Liberal Party? Would be the Liberal Party for bringing down such an embarrassing budget? It is a pretty hot contest, once again, but no, I think—




Mr Neumann:
  It's the Nationals!




Mr FITZGIBBON:
   The member for Blair has it! It is the National Party! I remind members of the play in the lead-up to this budget, when we were going to lose the diesel fuel rebate. This is the straw man the coalition likes to put up, 'We've got a plan. We've got to put petrol taxes up, despite our election promises. But what are we going to do about the National Party? They won't be happy about it because they know it impacts adversely disproportionately on country Australia. I know! I know what we'll do. We'll feign the revocation of the diesel fuel rebate and they'll get themselves all worked up about that. Then, on election night, we'll say, ""No, we're not revoking the diesel fuel rebate,"" and they'll all breathe a sigh of relief. But they won't work out until the next morning what has happened with petrol taxes!'


That's what went on in this place only a couple of months ago, and the National Party takes the prize for the most embarrassing moment for a party in this parliament.


We move to mathematics, and I make this point very deliberately because it helps people understand what is happening with fuel taxes in this country, and it helps us to understand what the difference is between excise in petrol now compared to the days prior to the GST.


I ask members this question: if petrol were at 70c at the bowser and you take 7c off because John Howard, when he was Prime Minister, took 7c off excise—I say '7c' but I think he took 6.7c off, so we will say 7c to keep it easy—so that the GST would not necessarily increase the price of the GST. So if you take 70c and subtract 7c off the excise and then you put 10 per cent on, what do you get? You get roughly the same price.


But what about when fuel is $1.50 a litre? When you get to $1.50 a litre and you take 7c off you end up with a fuel price of about $1.57 a litre. Even John Howard understood that you cannot put a tax on a tax. He did not anticipate, of course, that oil prices would accelerate and that the 7c reduction would go nowhere near compensating motorists for the GST.


Now, if John Howard had left the excise indexation in place fuel excise would not be 38c today, it would be 50c. So that tells you what the now Prime Minister's decision is going to do to fuel prices in another 10 years. So this is not just a decision that impacts today, this is a compounding decision—something that is going to increase exponentially petrol prices over a period of time.


As the Deputy Prime Minister himself has pointed out, this is a decision that falls disproportionately adversely on rural and regional Australia, because we travel longer distances. The Treasurer goes from North Sydney into the city for his meetings, just across the bridge. In rural and regional Australia we drive hundreds of kilometres on a daily basis. Sometimes we drive 100 kilometres just to go to the supermarket. This is not something understood by those who live in our capital cities. And it is about time those members who I mentioned earlier, those who purport to represent their rural and regional electorates, stood up to this mob—stood up to this government and explained how these things fall disproportionately on rural and regional Australia.


I will leave others to go through the many other budget issues that adversely affect us in the bush in particular. They go to the GP tax, changes to the universities and changes for the unemployed who, themselves, have to travel long distances to apply for a job and who have to travel long distances to get to a TAFE course or any sort of a training course—if, indeed, in rural and regional Australia they can get one all. That is another disadvantage faced by those living in the bush.


I want to turn to one very specific broken promise before I close on the budget, because the Minister for Agriculture is with this. I put these questions to him in the parliament last night and he refused to answer them so I am going to give him another chance today.


When he donned the Akubra back in February and wandered out into drought-affected Australia he got all the newspaper reports he was looking for. He and the Prime Minister were on the 6 o'clock news, and in the lead-up to that drought tour the drought was in the news on a daily basis. We could not turn on our televisions in the morning for the Today show or for Sunrise without them talking about drought. The Daily Telegraph in New South Wales was running a drought donation scheme. Everyone was talking about drought. But the moment the Prime Minister and the agriculture minister went out to announce their package it all stopped. It was a beautiful political circuit-breaker for them.


But guess what? The drought has not ended for those struggling in rural and regional Australia. I was outside Emerald just last week, meeting with some of these people who are very disappointed in this mob on the other side. I ask the minister again: is the $80 million I was referring to still available to assist drought affected farmers? You have taken $40 million out of Labor's scheme. You will not deliver $40 million under your scheme this year because you have not delivered one cent to farming families. I want you, Minister, to guarantee here today that the $80 million—the $40 million you took from the old scheme and the $40 million you will not spend this financial year in the current scheme—will remain available to farmers in the coming financial year.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2014-06-19,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:22):  What we have, obviously, is a shadow minister for agriculture who cannot get a question up during question time, so they have relegated him to matters of public importance.


Last night I went to the Midwinter Ball, and I have to say there was a comedian there who did not really hit the high notes at all. So he went away, dressed up as the Queen and came back, and it was not much better. Today he has come back and dressed up as the member for Hunter, and he's about as bad as he was last night! I will give you a tip: if you are going to be a comedian, you have got to be funny.


But he did raise a range of things. The issue today is a less-than-1c excise which was initially introduced by the Labor Party under Hawke. What the Labor Party are proposing—unless you want to tell us this is not the truth—is on 1 July to introduce a 6.85c-a-litre increase in the price of diesel. That is still your position, isn't it?



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  He has gone quiet all of a sudden. He's gone from being a comedian to a Trappist monk! Silence is golden! So here we have the tactics of the Labor Party on full display. They have moved a motion about a less-than-1c increase in the price of fuel, yet they stand behind a 6.85c increase on diesel. It just goes to show you how bizarre they are.


Today we had the representation of the things that are done—like a quiz show. We can have another quiz show. Who were the clowns who came up with an idea on the back of a coaster that they would build themselves a new telephone company which was going to cost us approximately $100 billion at the end? Who was that? Who could that possibly have been? Who could be that bizarre that they would come up with the biggest capital infrastructure project in the life of our nation, bigger than the Snowy Mountains scheme, and do it apparently because Senator Conroy was trying to track down the Prime Minister—your old mate, Mr Rudd—got on the plane, said, 'I just have to talk to him quickly,' and, by the time he got off the plane had stitched Australia up for the biggest capital infrastructure project in our nation's history without a cost-benefit analysis. Do you know how good that game was? I was looking at its books at the Senate estimates. I remember going through it. They spent more on airfares for their staff than they actually earned. So there is something for the quiz. Who put that up?


Who came up with the idea that they would stick fluffy stuff in the ceiling for the rats and the mice to sleep on and then, after they set fire to approximately 200 houses and, unfortunately, four people were killed, they would spend another billion dollars trying to get it out? Who did that? Who could that possibly have been? Was it you? Did you do that? You are looking at me. I think it was you. I think you know who did it. It's the Trappist monk! And yesterday, when we were in the other chamber—I would have left that conversation behind—he wanted to blow it up. He's a violent Trappist monk! If he's not burning it down, he's blowing it up! You in reality are a lot funnier than you as a comedian.


We go through what the Labor Party have done for regional Australia. Who brought in tree clearing laws? Who decided to take a private asset and put it in the hands of the government? That was you. That was your party. Who was the party that divested people in New South Wales of their coal assets back in 1983? Who did that? It was you. Who took the nation to about $330 billion in current debt? When we handed over to you we actually had money in the bank. The world owed us money. By the time you handed back we were around $300 billion in debt. Who did that? You did.


When we try to do something that is a small improvement in regional Australia—we go to move a ministerial office out of Sydney and into Armidale—who complains about it? They do. They like it in Brisbane, they like it in Sydney but they just do not like it out in the country. When you are doing an observation of the chamber and looking for people in regional seats, how many have you got, mate?


How is this for an idea for regional Australia? Their biggest item with the word 'regional' in front of it was a ring road at Perth—the regional town of Perth! Who could have done that? It is a mere village! It's a hamlet! Who could do that?


We asked in estimates. We said, 'It looks like in this regional fund under the Labor Party it means everywhere.' Mr Crean said, 'That's right; it's everywhere.' So we said, 'Could you have a regional fund that would upgrade the Opera House?' and they went, 'Possibly.' That is the sort of regional delivery you get with the Labor Party.


And still they have a carbon tax. They said to the Australian people that they would get rid of the carbon tax. They would terminate the carbon tax. That was the word, wasn't it—'terminate'?




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Yes. It is still our policy.




Mr JOYCE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, did you hear that? It is still his policy to terminate the carbon tax. The trouble is, it might be your policy to terminate the carbon tax, but it is not your colleagues' policy to terminate the carbon tax. They are over in the Senate. You can do something for our nation right now. If you are listening to this over on the other side—they actually do have a telephone on their desk and they can listen to this—I can assure you that the member for Hunter said that it is still their policy to terminate the carbon tax. If you are listening to this, move it now, get rid of it. The member for Hunter is vastly more amusing when he is trying to be serious than he is when he is trying to be amusing.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  You've got two minutes to answer the question.




Mr JOYCE:
  We will get onto the drought. On 4 March we made the interim farm family payment available. In fact, 1,403 people have got access to it. They get approximately $900 a fortnight or better. We have made real money available to people.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  That was always a welfare payment—what are you talking about?




Mr JOYCE:
  We completely changed the criteria for it. Last night they told us they had every state bar one signed up to the concessional farm family payment. We checked the records: they had three signed up. So they could not even get their own policy through. Who got their policy through? We had to fix it up; we had to sign it up. We got the money rolling from it. You could not do it. Who got a $320 million drought package through? We did. Who has now got it available so that QRAA can lend it out? We have. They may be lending it out right now. It is all for them.




Mr Billson:
  Who gave us the mining tax?




Mr JOYCE:
  Who gave us the mining tax? This is like Million Dollar Minute. This quiz show should lead the seven o'clock news. Who stopped the live cattle trade? You did. 


It is really quite interesting when someone appears in the chamber today and makes Mr Connelly's effort last night look like a Barnum and Bailey number. If there is going to be a friend for regional Australia, there is only one side of the chamber where they are going to find that person.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-06-19,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (15:32):  I am more than happy at some point to have an opportunity to talk about my attitude to the mining tax and why in fact it has not impacted negatively. It may have impacted negatively on the Labor Party, but it has not impacted negatively on the mining industry in Western Australia.


What we want to talk about today are all the surprises for rural Western Australia, for all of rural Australia, that were contained in the budget. Mr Abbott promised over and over again that his government would be a government of no surprises. People would know exactly what was going to confront them. But rural Australia had a lot of very nasty surprises. The member for Hunter spoke about the very nasty surprise of the fuel tax indexation. But I want to talk a bit about the financial assistance grants, the FAGs, and how over $900 million in cuts to these grants has disproportionately affected rural Australia and indeed remote rural Australia. If we look at the analysis of the regions that are most affected, we see that the very small rural and remote shires rely on the FAGs for around 36 per cent of their income; small rural and remote shires for 22 per cent; and the others between 20 per cent and 36 per cent. So the small rural shires are the ones that are going to be disproportionately affected.


Just the other day I ran into the shire president of Morawa. She explained that, this year alone, her council is going to have to increase its rates by four per cent just to cover the reduction in the financial assistance grants. There are many more shires that are far more affected. In Halls Creek, Wiluna, Carnarvon, Derby and East Kimberley shires, in the member for Durack's electorate, FAGs represent in excess of 20 per cent of their budget. They will have to hit the residents with an increase. Yilgarn, Leonora and Laverton shires, in the member for O'Connor's electorate, all have a heavy reliance on FAGs. So this is going to have a major impact.


I also want to talk about the impact this is going to have on the Aboriginal communities across Australia, specifically the health services in the Western Australian Aboriginal communities. From recent hearings of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia, it is becoming very clear that the condition of our Aboriginal communities is a major constraint on development in northern Australia. We are very clear, as report after report has been, that progress cannot be made in northern Australia unless we close the gap. What is happening here? Over $500 million is coming out of Aboriginal services. 


On top of that, the GP co-payment is just going to compound the problem for Aboriginal health services in Beagle Bay, Kalgoorlie, Derby, Broome, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing and Kununurra. There is absolutely no way that these Aboriginal controlled community health services can charge the co-payment. They bulk-bill the vast majority of their services. If they waive the co-payment they will receive $5 less per visit in government rebates. That cut will directly result in them having to reduce a whole raft of services. So the co-payment alone is creating a great problem. (Time expired)

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-06-19,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:37):  It is always interesting, in a debate on regional Australia, to follow the member for Perth, which is one of those far-flung regional centres that was so disadvantaged by the last parliament that we had to spend about $14 million on their road to the airport. The member for Perth mentioned the freezing of the financial assistance grants, but she did not mention that the Roads to Recovery program is going to be doubled. For many of the regional shires she is speaking about, the net effect is actually a positive one, not a negative one.


I would like to address the comments made by one half of The Two Ronnies, my neighbour down here from the Hunter. The member for Hunter gives irony a whole new meaning. For those who are new here, we had a boundary change in 2010. There was wailing and screaming and protest from a bit of the Parkes electorate about having to leave Parkes and go into Hunter, but these things happen in a redistribution. A couple of towns from the Parkes electorate went into Hunter, one of those being Kandos, which happens to have a cement plant that had been there for 100 years. Guess what happened on the day after the election? They shut it down, taking 106 jobs and leaving generations of people unemployed. So I went up there. It was not in my electorate, but I thought that, as I had been looking after these people for a term or so, I had better go and see what was going on. The members of the union had come across from Newcastle and were explaining to the workers that losing their jobs was a good thing, because it was for a greater cause. The carbon tax was going to cool the globe and make us look good on the international stage. Kevin Rudd was going to Stockholm and we had to have something to sell, so they had lost their jobs for a greater cause. The member for Hunter did not make his way across there until some time later, and, when he got there, it was like: 'Don't mention the war; don't mention the carbon tax.' A lot of the people of Kandos are now fly-in-fly-out miners in Cobar, North Queensland and Western Australia, because the industry that sustained them—



Government members interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  Ah, my favourite rural Labor person: the member for Richmond—the one who fights so hard for the 17 per cent of her constituents who vote Green, the one who dies in a ditch for those Green votes, for those hardy rural souls from Byron Bay as they toil away over their hydroponics in the back shed. She is such a great advocate for the 17 per cent of people in her electorate who vote Green. But I do not want to be negative. 


We are talking about this budget, and what I like about this budget is that this government treats rural Australia as if it has a future. This government treats rural Australia with respect. This government does not watch a Green-inspired program on the ABC and shut down a cattle trade, decimating not only a whole industry but also a couple of states and territories.


This government respects and understands regional Australia—not only in areas such as this, but in R&D. There is real money now in research and development, because we understand that Australian farmers and Australian regional communities have a future. For those of you who may be new, we sat here for two terms with this government and heard ministers such as Burke and others talk about farmers in slow voices, because they needed to help farmers to adapt to climate change. How were they going to do that? 'Oh, we will close down the cattle industry—that'll help.' They sacrificed the aspirations of rural Australia in order to get the vote from the member for Melbourne, up here behind us, because he had such a struggling urban electorate in inner-city Melbourne that they had to pacify him.


With telecommunications, Minister Conroy actually came to Goolma—it is in the outreaches, 25 kilometres from Mudgee. In six years, despite the fact that the minister had sat in Goolma Hall with 150 very angry people, Labor did not fund even one tower. We are talking about an NBN network that delivered no services to my electorate in six years—and we still have people who cannot have a telephone. The hypocrisy! I admire the member for Hunter's attempt at humour, because it is better than his attempt at politics. (Time expired)

A government member interjecting—  




Mr MITCHELL:
  You ought to talk; you are a great one. Let's have a talk to the nothington over there who has done absolutely nothing but decimate his electorate. He and his mate from Corangamite shut down the national rural farmers health service. They shut it down—because they do not support farmers. They do not support people in regional areas. They sit there and they say they do all these things and they get the clown prince 'Jar Jar Binks' Joyce over there to come in and rant and rave, but he could not talk about the budget. The reason he could not talk about the budget is that this petrol tax, which the government increased, despite saying that they would not increase taxes, is hurting rural and regional Australians.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for McEwen. Order! 




Mr MITCHELL:
  Sit down, sugar boy! Put the paper on—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for McEwen will resume his seat. I call the member for Dawson.

  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could Jabba withdraw that reference to the agriculture minister?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Was the minister offended by the comment?




Mr Joyce:
  I cannot even understand him.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister is not offended. The member for McEwen will continue.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I know that the agriculture minister finds it hard to understand because I speak in fluent, coherent English, and that hurts him. He has no idea. 


I spoke to people in my electorate about this fuel tax and what it means. The government comes in here and tells another untruth when it says, 'It is only going to impact 40c a week.' That is a lie. The average person—



A government member interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  No, he said 'week'. Please listen to your own minister—I know it is hard and it is painful and it is shrill, but try and listen to him. Every week the average person in rural and regional areas uses at least 100 litres of fuel. They will now pay extra tax on that fuel—a tax that lot said before the election they would not have—and an increase in the GST on that tax—a tax on a tax that is built on a lie that is built on a lie. It is unfair. Because we do not have shops on every corner, hospitals in every town and access to schools and public transport, which we know this government is afraid of, the impacts are greater.


The impacts are so great that a former Liberal minister came out of her slumber. The member for Wannon would certainly know this minister who was dragged out of her slumber and said that this tax is unfair and unbelievable. Your former employer Fran Bailey, a Liberal minister in the Howard government, said how disproportionately this affects country areas. It affects country areas because they need cars to travel. Most people travel 30 or 40 kilometres to school and have to travel 60 to 70 kilometres to get jobs in regional areas.


This government before the election said that they would be a government th no surprises and no excuses and that there would be no increases in taxes, but they did every single one of those things. The foreign minister, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, said: 'It's wrong to say we are talking about increasing fuel excise. We're not doing that.' But in actual fact they did. When the Prime Minister was asked before the election whether the conditions of the budget would be an excuse for breaking promises, he said: 'Exactly right. We'll keep the commitments that we make. All the commitments we make will be carefully costed.' We found out through The Weekly Times this week that the government has not done an impact statement on the impact of this fuel tax on rural and regional Australia.




Mr Joyce:
  The Prime Minister before the election was your one, you clown!




Mr MITCHELL:
  Jar Jar, get back to the bar. The Australian Automobile Association CEO, Andrew McKellar, also called on the government to rule out any budget that would increase the fuel excise.

Mr Fitzgibbon:
  I'll be here, my friend.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Eden-Monaro has the call and the member for Hunter will desist interjecting.




Dr HENDY:
  He is sensitive about that. He is also sensitive about the fact that he has been asked by his leadership group to raise this matter of public importance. He needed a lot of face to put forward the arguments he did today. We have already heard from the member for New England the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in terms of raising the fact that rural and regional Australia would not have a better friend than the coalition government. The fact is we are fixing the budget mess that these guys created over the last six years. We left them with a budget surplus and we left them with net debt of $40 billion and they ended their six years with $123 billion in future forward deficits and then left us approaching in 10 years a $667 billion debt. That is what we faced when we came into government. Now we have to fix that.


My electorate is a rural and regional electorate. It is very dependent on small business. In the course of the last six years some 519,000 jobs in small business were lost. In a rural and regional electorate, after you consider government jobs in teaching, in the provision of police services and in hospitals for example, small business is the largest employer. If we cannot put in place policies that support small business, we are dooming rural and regional Australia to a dreadful existence. That is what happened over the last six years.


In Eurobodalla Shire, one of the major shires in my electorate, the unemployment rate is over seven per cent. That is what we inherited. We have to fix that problem, so we are repairing the budget. That was one of the key policies that we put to the Australian population at the election and it is one of the key reasons we were actually elected in a landslide in the 2013 election. This budget, however, is not just about contributing; it is also about building Australia. The budget contains the biggest infrastructure project in the history of Australia. We have put forward a policy that includes $50 billion of expenditure on roads and other infrastructure and my electorate of Eden-Monaro is getting a down payment on that. 


Only last Friday the then Acting Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, visited Queanbeyan in my electorate and announced a $50 million road project for the Queanbeyan bypass. This is a vital piece of infrastructure. It is not just about road safety in the Queanbeyan district; it is about an economic development project that the Queanbeyan City Council has regarded as its top priority for years now, which was denied by the former member for Eden-Monaro, whom I defeated in the election. He would not support that road project. I think it is actually one of the reasons that he lost the electorate in the election. A matter of weeks after the federal budget was released, we were able to announce that we would put forward $50 million: $25 million from the New South Wales government and $25 million from the Commonwealth government. We were also able to announce a number of black spot programs worth some $622,000 in the Eurobodalla shire, in the Bega Valley shire and also in Queanbeyan. These are the down payments for the changes that we announced in the budget. It is a fact that the coalition is looking after Eden-Monaro, and I am very proud of this budget.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (15:52):  After the contribution by the member for Eden-Monaro, it is easy to understand why the Minister for Agriculture just said that Eden-Monaro is at the top of his hit list. I can say one thing to this House—




Mr Joyce:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not think the agriculture minister said that, because I am the agriculture minister and I didn't say it. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I call the member for Bendigo. I think it was a wrong reference. 




Ms CHESTERS:
  I withdraw that comment. But I will say that it will be very hard for the coalition to maintain and hold the seat of Eden-Monaro going forward because this government's budget is hurting rural and regional Australians. This new petrol tax and this unfair budget is hurting rural Australians, not just people in the area of Eden-Monaro but also people in regional Victoria, including in my own electorate of Bendigo. 


The fuel tax increase is another hit on regional Australians. This tax, which was frozen by the then Prime Minister, John Howard, in 2001, is now going to go up twice a year every single year. How did this come about? The Nationals were claiming a great big victory in the lead-up to the budget: 'Don't worry, bush. We've got it under control. There'll be no touches to the diesel excise—no touches.' What they did not see coming around the corner was an increase in the petrol tax—and, if they had, then maybe they would have had a voice on it, because this tax hurts the bush. Petrol going up hurts the bush. 


What the government have not acknowledged and probably one of the reasons why they have not done their research on this particular area is that petrol prices are even higher in the bush. The further you go out from the city the more petrol goes up. Even in an electorate like Bendigo, you can find on one particular Saturday four or five different petrol prices, depending on where you are. In Bendigo, one day in Woodend it is $1.65 and, on the very same day, it is a $1.50 up the road. Already people who are further out are paying more, and what this tax does is compound that and they will pay even more. The fact is that people living in the country have further to go. 


You just have to compare some of the electorates around the country to really understand why the city based Liberals in this government do not understand what is going on in the bush and why they did not think it would be a problem. In my own electorate, it is 136 kilometres from Elmore to Macedon. Let's take the member for Wannon's electorate: it is 251 kilometres from Warrnambool to Dunolly. In the member for Mallee's electorate, it is 380 kilometres from Mildura to Halls Gap. These are big distances that people have to drive. Let's compare that to the Prime Minister's electorate, which is only 12 kilometres wide; compare it to the Treasurer's electorate, which is 10 kilometres wide. When you live in the city, you do not have far to drive; but when you live in the country, you do. So every increase in the petrol tax increases the price of petrol that people in the country have to pay.


This tax is compounded by other measures in this budget. As we have heard, local councils have been hit hard by their grants being frozen. In my own electorate, the councils have added up that it is about $1.8 million collectively over the life of this government. In health, we have seen massive funding cuts in regional communities that may force some of our regional hospitals to close or to amalgamate. In Bendigo, it is a cut of $25.8 million over the next five years to its hospital. When you look at schools, universities and other higher education institutions, there are, again, big funding cuts. This will hit regional universities really hard. Students may not enrol. For students who have to travel mostly by car, because we do not have decent public transport, there will be extra costs. This government has cut funding to volunteer organisations. Volunteers say that one of the biggest costs associated with the work that they do is the travel—driving in their own cars. Regional communities are held up and kept strong by the work of their volunteers. 


What compounds the pain of the other cuts in this budget is the fact that the fuel tax is going up. So there is less money in a school budget and then they have to pay more for their petrol. There is less money in the hospitals and then they have to pay more for their petrol. That is the problem with this government: their budget is hurting regional and rural Australia and this petrol tax— (Time expired)

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (15:58):  I must say the way that the member for Hunter led with his chin in this MPI reminded me of the CS Lewis quote:


Answers to leading questions under torture naturally tell us nothing about the beliefs of the accused; but they are good evidence for the beliefs of the accusers.


We are seeing real evidence of this here. Members may have missed the Guardian article which appeared recently titled: 


Labor plans 'country caucus' to tap regional voters alienated by budget


Federal move would ensure rural impact of every major policy is taken into account, believes Joel Fitzgibbon


It goes on:


Federal Labor is preparing to establish a “country caucus” that would meet separately before the main caucus and could use its numbers to ensure policy takes regional and rural Australia into account.


Given the member for Perth followed the member for Hunter in this debate, I was wondering where and in what room would this caucus occur?


This article goes on, and it gives some hope to the member for Hunter:


On Tuesday night the New South Wales Right faction endorsed the New South Wales farmer, firefighter and leading rural advocate, Vivien Thomson, in Labor's No 3 winnable spot in the Senate ticket for the next federal election.


If the member for Hunter can hold onto his seat in the redistribution, all is not lost for him. He may have another person to join his caucus. I was thrilled for the member for Hunter when I read that. The article continues:


Her endorsement, led by the NSW general secretary, Jamie Clements, was seen as part of the move to diversify Labor's appeal in rural Australia.


By bringing another member into this place from rural Australia, they are going to diversify Labor's appeal. I can follow that. It goes on:


Joel Fitzgibbon, as agricultural spokesman and member for the regional seat of Hunter, is the architect of the country caucus idea.


Hence we have this MPI today. The article continues:


He said while the rural group was a 'work in progress', he hoped it would eventually review the regional impact of every major piece of Labor policy and generate ideas to benefit the bush.


'We are currently looking at ways we might engage on rural and regional Australia more formally and better as a caucus', he told Guardian Australia.


I wish him all the best in that, because for one person doing that for the whole of Australia it is going to be an enormous task. Mr Fitzgibbon went on:


We hope to get country members—


himself and I think this newly preselected New South Wales candidate for the Senate—


and like minds together to become a clearing house for policy; generating ideas and when necessary using our collective weight to ensure policy takes into account regional and rural Australians.


What collective weight the member for Hunter is going to throw behind this! The article continues:


Fitzgibbon has just completed a drought tour and in an unusual move for Labor, he ran a 'matter of public importance' on the effect of the budget on rural and regional Australia.


What we have seen here is the second unusual move by Labor with an MPI on regional and rural Australia. What an absolute joke. They all should be ashamed of themselves. They are starting, in the year 2014, a rural and regional caucus and they are in here telling us who should stand up for regional and rural Australia. This is a shocker. (Time expired)

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:03):  I am pleased to be speaking on this MPI, which is about the government hurting rural and regional Australia with its new petrol tax and unfair budget. I will actually be referring to that in my speech today. In regional areas it is the National Party that is driving this cruel and unfair budget, particularly through the petrol tax. In my area, on the North Coast of New South Wales, we call this the National Party petrol tax. It will be one of the many legacies of the National Party for a very long time to come in rural and regional Australia. Every time people fill up, they will be saying thanks to the Nats for the petrol tax. This tax will go up twice a year in line with inflation from August this year. This tax increase is a broken promise, and indeed the whole budget was a budget of broken promises. These broken promises will hurt pensioners, families and seniors, with all this array of cruel cuts and unfair increases in the cost of living. The people of regional and rural Australia have every right to feel totally betrayed by this budget of twisted priorities and many broken promises. There are so many of them, including the $80 billion cuts to hospitals and schools, the unfair doctor tax, pension cuts, education cuts, deregulation of university fees and cuts to council assistance grants as well. 


I held a rally in my electorate last week in response to the Abbott government's cruel and unfair budget, and I want to thank those hundreds of people who attended my 'fighting for a fair go' rally last Thursday at the Tweed Heads Civic Centre. In particular, I thank those who travelled a very long distance to make their voices heard. The rally was arranged in response to the overwhelming community concern about this unfair budget and in response to the budget of broken promises. Before the election the Prime Minister and all of his candidates—in my area they were all National Party candidates—were running around saying there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, and no new taxes. All of those National Party candidates on the North Coast were saying there would be no new taxes but the fact is they were not telling the truth. This budget contained all of those things—all of those things they promised would not happen. Many of these issues were raised at the rally. 


I especially thank our guest speakers who came along. We had Walt Secord, an MLC from the New South Wales parliament and shadow minister for the North Coast and shadow minister for roads, and also Ron Goodman, Labor's candidate for Tweed in the state election. Both spoke about the unfairness of the budget. The rally heard an array of concerns that locals had. The petrol tax was one of the major issues brought up, because it is particularly unfair for those people in regional and rural areas who do have to travel so much further. The doctor tax also came up, because that will really impact on people in regional areas. Reference was also made to cuts to pensions, family payments and education. Some state issues came up as well, one of the major concerns being the increase in people's power prices that will occur due to the New South Wales Nationals' plan to sell off the poles and wires. That was a big concern—the National Party selling off those poles and wires will push up the price of electricity for people in regional New South Wales. 


People brought many signs to the rally, saying nobody voted for the petrol tax, nobody voted for extreme university fees, nobody voted for a doctor tax and nobody voted for pension cuts. The fact is that both the federal government and the New South Wales state government are out of touch with the concerns of people struggling week to week. One of the sentiments raised at the rally was that surely Australia is a better place than this; surely we are a fairer place than we see in this government's cruel and nasty and unfair budget. At the conclusion of the rally there was a resolution passed. The rally resolved that I raise in parliament the fact that the people of the North Coast reject the Liberal-National Party's unfair budget and acknowledge the fact that this budget is harmful to families, seniors and young people. The people of the North Coast condemn this unfair budget.


When we talk about National Party betrayals, the petrol tax is surely up there as one of the biggest betrayals. Another big betrayal is in relation to the Pacific Highway. I would like to point out that in this budget there was no new money at all for funding of the Pacific Highway compared to when we were in government— $7.9 billion in funding for the Pacific Highway and not one cent from them. I was very proud in my electorate to have delivered the federal funding for both the Sexton Hill upgrade and the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale Pacific Highway upgrade. There was $350 million in funding for the Sexton Hill upgrade. It has been open a couple of years now and it is fantastic. Also there was $550 million in federal funding for the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade which is going to be finished very soon—all that money delivered by the federal Labor government, nothing from the other side.


In contrast, we see the Nationals cutting services, slashing infrastructure funding and increasing taxes. At both the state and federal level the National Party are 100 per cent behind the cruel and unfair budget cuts. They are responsible for the doctor tax, they are responsible for the petrol tax, they are responsible for cutting family payments and pensions. Each member of the National Party should be deeply ashamed. They are cutting pensions of the people who have built our nation, our seniors. They are bringing in a petrol tax. They should be deeply ashamed. It is the National Party that betray the people of regional and rural Australia, and people will remember that for years to come. (Time expired)

Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (16:08):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this MPI on the impact of the budget on regional people and particularly people in my electorate. I will get onto the impact of the budget but first I want to dwell on the impact the previous government had on my electorate. The first and most devastating decision that comes to mind was the suspension of the live export trade. You have to have lived in a regional area that produces livestock to understand the impact that this had on our communities. We saw live export prices for shipping wethers fall from $120 to $35. For farmers in my electorate a 1c increase in the fuel excise pales into insignificance compared to the loss of income they suffered from that one decision. It has taken four years to recover and I applaud the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, who has instilled confidence back into the live export industry. Just recently at the Katanning saleyards we saw shipping wether prices reach $110 a tonne again for the first time since early 2012. I want to applaud the Minister for Agriculture for his efforts.


Then they introduced a carbon tax and families across my electorate suffered the increase in living costs that people in metropolitan areas suffered. But it wasn't just that. The WA government copped a $50 million bill, which also impacted on the services people in regional areas receive. The mining industry, which is currently going through downturn in my electorate, copped the loss of the 7c rebate on diesel used off-road. That included diesel used in generator sets and picked up people on stations, picked up people who own roadhouses on the Nullarbor—all extra costs for people in my electorate.


The people of my electorate want roads. That is what they need and that is what they are going to get from this government. I do not need to be lectured by the member for Bendigo about distances. I drive 650 kilometres from my home to my office in Kalgoorlie, I drive 480 kilometres from my home to my office in Esperance and I drive 180 kilometres from my home to my office in Albany. I have to tell you that the roads are well below standard. They are unsafe and the people of my community want new roads, they want upgraded roads, and this government is going to deliver a $50 billion infrastructure package which will build the roads of the 21st century. As part of that we will see an additional $320 million injected into Roads to Recovery, taking that program to over $2.1 billion over the forward estimates. This program is funding directly to local government authorities so that they can fix up the roads that they prioritise in their own areas. We have also just announced today an extra $520 million over the next three years for the road black spot program, once again a great investment by the government in saving people's lives in my electorate.


I want to finish today by talking about the diesel fuel rebate. People in my electorate very much dislike the diesel excise rebate being referred to as a subsidy. When the diesel fuel excise was introduced in 1957 it was introduced for road maintenance and building. It was deemed at the time that those people who did not use the roads—farmers, miners, fishermen and other off-road industries—would be exempt from paying that levy. That levy is critical to the economic wellbeing of my electorate and I am prepared to defend that levy. I am very pleased to say that this government also is committed to retaining the diesel fuel levy.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-06-19,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (16:13):  I rise to speak on the bills before the House and indicate to the House that the bills are designed to establish the Trade Support Loans program for Australian premises. The loans will be concessional and income contingent, with a lifetime limit of $20,000 indexed from 2017. The loans are repayable when the individual's income reaches the Higher Education Loan Program, known as HELP, repayment thresholds. The bill also provides for a 20 per cent discount to be applied to the loan incurred when an Australian apprentice has successfully completed their apprenticeship.


The bill seeks to implement an election commitment the current government made in the campaign period. It should be noted that this was the only statement and commitment made on skills at the time of the election by the then opposition. Unfortunately for apprentices what the Prime Minister did not tell them before the election was that the trade support loans would come at a cost. What the Prime Minister failed to tell apprentices was that he would axe the Tools for Your Trade program, taking $1 billion from the pockets of apprentices. This has massive implications for apprentices. Under Tools for Your Trade apprentices were provided $5,500 over the course of their apprenticeship to help with their costs. Apprentices face many significant costs, including items such as tools, uniforms, safety equipment and also travel and day-to-day expenses.


I indicate that I will be moving an amendment to the bill at the conclusion of my contribution.


My colleagues and I have been contacted by many apprentices who are angry and very upset that they have been deceived. Prior to the election, in their 'real solutions' 2013 election booklet, the Prime Minister told them that the coalition 'will provide better support for Australia's apprentices'. What he has actually done is axe the $5,500 that Labor provided to our apprentices to help them with the cost of their tools or for their training and so forth. He has replaced that payment with a debt. Apprentice electricians can no longer buy expensive voltage testing equipment and other safety equipment without taking out a loan. Apprentice chefs can no longer buy the expensive knives and other equipment they would need without taking out a loan. Apprentice plumbers can no longer buy their expensive toolkit and safety equipment without taking out a loan. Apprentice hairdressers can no longer buy their scissors, hairdryers, straighteners and curlers without taking out a loan. Apprentice mechanics cannot buy their toolkits without taking out a loan.


What was the minister's answer to this? His answer was to tell apprentices that it did not matter, because they were spending their Tools for Your Trade money on 'tattoos and mag wheels'. We have seen no evidence of this. It is a pity the minister chose to take cheap shots at apprentices. It just demonstrates how out of touch the minister is with the situation facing apprentices. After bagging the apprentices about spending these funds on tattoos and mag wheels the minister introduced the Trade Support Loans Bill and it has absolutely no restrictions on what they can spend their loans on. The minister is more concerned with taking these cheap—and I have to say unsubstantiated—shots at both us and apprentices rather than providing the support that is necessary.


Apprentices now will have no choice except to sign up for the loan, even school-based apprentices who are under 18 years of age. Because the government has left no other financial support in place, and therefore has left no other option for apprentices, Labor will not oppose the Trade Support Loans Bill, but we will move a second reading amendment. I will move at the conclusion of my contribution that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the government has failed to:


(1) advise apprentices that they would be abolishing the Tools for Your Trade program, thus leaving Trade Support Loans as the only form of assistance for the purchase of tools;


(2) adequately explain in clear language the interest rates and full liability of these loans;


(3) offer adequate protection for school based apprentices aged under 18;


(4) offer fair and reasonable transition arrangements for current apprentices;


(5) put in place adequate privacy protections for the large volumes of information that will be acquired through the Trade Support Loans Program; and


(6) offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.


The first point of our amendment goes to the dishonesty of the government in the lead-up to the election. The Prime Minister did not tell apprentices that he would be axing the Tools for Your Trade program. He did not tell them that he would be leaving them no other option but a debt. In his election statement he said, 'The coalition will provide better support for Australia's apprentices.' I would submit to the House that apprentices will be perfectly legitimately within their reason to have assumed from that they would be getting these loans as an addition, as another option available to them, to support them during their apprenticeship, and not that the better support was based on taking away a major payment that they relied on. He did not say, 'We will give you a loan, but we will take away $5,500.' This is really a mean and tricky approach to election campaigning on this issue, and it is why apprentices are angry about it, as are many employers of apprentices who have contacted us to express their anger about this decision.


The second point of our amendment goes to the importance of clear and simple information on how the loans will operate. The minister, despite repeated requests in media releases, in question time and in Senate estimates, has still failed to explain in clear language exactly how these loans will work. In the budget papers it says that apprentices will be charged a 'concessional interest rate', and the minister has been saying the loans are 'interest free' and that they are 'indexed by the CPI'. The minister is refusing to give clear and concise advice to apprentices. Firstly, the minister has accused them of not being responsible with their money, and then he refuses to give them clear details of their liability under this program. I am sure that many in the House would agree that, when extending a loan option to young people, it is very important that the information that they will be using to make their decision on needs to be clear and full and give them an accurate picture of what they are signing up for. It was also disclosed in Senate estimates that the minister had a plan to explore the outsourcing of these trade support loan debts. What this means for any apprentice is completely unclear and the question remains what exactly the minister is considering in doing this.


The third part of the amendment addresses the protection of school based apprentices—children under the age of 18. Indeed, some could be as young as 15 signing up for a school based apprenticeship. The minister has failed to explain whether children will require a parent or guardian to supervise the application and undertaking of these loans and who will be explaining the terms and conditions and ensuring school based apprentices know that they will be entering into a large debt arrangement. In Senate estimates the government admitted that it only has the 'gist of legal advice' about whether a parent will be responsible, for example, for a 16-year-old's $20,000 trade support loan. The minister needs to clarify this and ensure that parents and children are fully informed about their liability.


The ACTU in their submission to the Senate bill inquiry also outlined their concerns on this issue. Their submission states:


For example, one concern is that young apprentices starting out could find themselves under pressure to access these loans in order to pay for costs of the apprenticeship that should be borne by their employers, or to forego wage increases because a loan is available to meet their costs. The potential for abuse and misuse of the scheme is real but there is no indication of what resources, if any, will be directed towards educating and supporting apprentices in such situations, given that existing support programs have been abolished.


That, of course, refers to the fact that there was a program in place, the apprentice mentoring program, which allowed tradespeople with experience in the field to act as a mentor and adviser to the young apprentice. It could have been, for example, envisaged by the government that that role could be utilised to provide clear and independent advice and support to young people in these circumstances. But they will not be there anymore because the scheme was abolished in the budget.


The fourth part of the amendment is about apprentices who signed up and made their plans to be an apprentice under the existing Tools for Your Trade program. Many apprentices have made financial commitments based on the anticipation of continuing to receive these moneys. Without warning and without any grandfathering arrangements, the goalposts have been completely moved by a mean and tricky decision of this government.


The fifth part of the amendment is about privacy. The explanatory memorandum notes that 'a large amount of personal information will likely be acquired' through the operation of the Trade Support Loan program. The ACTU again raised some valid concerns about the collection of personal information and privacy provisions—and I quote again:


Under clause 75 of the Bill, a person only has to take an oath or affirmation to protect information they receive from apprentices. There do not appear to be any repercussions for a breach of these provisions or for failing to adhere to an oath or affirmation. By contrast, under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 the person/officer dealing with personal information has more onerous obligations to meet and the penalty is two years’ jail.


So the question remains with the proposed passage of these bills whether the minister will be putting any measures in place to ensure that an apprentice's personal information is appropriately protected.


The last part of the amendment regards the fact that it has now become apparent that the instalments of this money are going to be paid monthly in arrears. By paying apprentices monthly this will effectively be a wage supplement and will mean that apprentices will have difficulty in purchasing expensive items, such as tools, vehicles, uniforms and fees, without potentially borrowing the money commercially and repaying the loan with their monthly in arrears payments—in effect, repaying a loan with a loan.


Submissions to the Senate Economics Committee inquiry on the bill by both the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Contractors of New South Wales and Sarino Russo Apprentices welcomed the loans on the basis that apprentices would have the advantage of an income contingent loan rather than a commercial loan to buy something like a car or ute. The problem is the payment method envisaged in the actual bill would not make this possible. Apprentices should be given the opportunity to take their loans as a monthly payment or as a lump sum each year.


Sadly, this, as I have indicated, was not the only attack on apprentices. In addition to axing the Tools for Your Trade program, the minister has also axed the Australian Apprenticeship Access program—a program that provided a sort of pre-vocational entry to apprenticeships for the most disadvantaged to give them an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. They also axed the Australian apprentices mentoring program, which I have mentioned, and the Apprentice to Business Owner program, which gave some small business training to apprentices post completion of their trade to enable them to go out and operate their own small business.


So, while the government is telling our young people to earn or learn, it is in fact taking away the very support, particularly with apprenticeships, which is one of the most successful training methods we have for young people to be able to actually achieve that. If the intention of this policy is to improve retention and completion rates for apprentices, it is inexplicable that the government would at the same time be abolishing programs specifically designed to properly recruit and prepare apprentices and to offer them and their employers the advantages of a mentoring program.


This view of support for schools and training is unsurprising, given the actions that have been taken by conservative state governments, who in fact have been slashing TAFE—for example, closing campuses, cutting courses, sacking staff and increasing fees. I was however pleased to see today in New South Wales the opposition leader, John Robertson, and the shadow minister for education and training, Ryan Park, announce Labor policies to protect TAFE and to make TAFE courses more affordable and announcing that they are looking to introduce legislation immediately to block fee increases.


As I indicated, I would like to formally move the amendment in the terms given and circulated. I indicate to the House that we will not be opposing the bills, but I ask the government to very seriously consider the amendment that the opposition is putting forward to make the scheme work effectively and fairly for apprentices, those whom this legislation is intended to target. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House notes that the Government has failed to:


(1) advise apprentices that they would be abolishing the Tools for Your Trade program, thus leaving Trade Support Loans as the only form of assistance for the purchase of tools;

(4) offer fair and reasonable transition arrangements for current apprentices;


(5) put in place adequate privacy protections for the large volumes of information that will be acquired through the Trade Support Loans Program; and 


(6) has failed to offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.""

Many apprentices have made financial commitments based on the anticipation of continuing to receive these moneys. Without warning and without any grandfathering arrangements, the goalposts have been completely moved by a mean and tricky decision of this government.


The fifth part of the amendment is about privacy. The explanatory memorandum notes that 'a large amount of personal information will likely be acquired' through the operation of the Trade Support Loan program. The ACTU again raised some valid concerns about the collection of personal information and privacy provisions—and I quote again:


Under clause 75 of the Bill, a person only has to take an oath or affirmation to protect information they receive from apprentices. There do not appear to be any repercussions for a breach of these provisions or for failing to adhere to an oath or affirmation. By contrast, under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 the person/officer dealing with personal information has more onerous obligations to meet and the penalty is two years’ jail.


So the question remains with the proposed passage of these bills whether the minister will be putting any measures in place to ensure that an apprentice's personal information is appropriately protected.


The last part of the amendment regards the fact that it has now become apparent that the instalments of this money are going to be paid monthly in arrears. By paying apprentices monthly this will effectively be a wage supplement and will mean that apprentices will have difficulty in purchasing expensive items, such as tools, vehicles, uniforms and fees, without potentially borrowing the money commercially and repaying the loan with their monthly in arrears payments—in effect, repaying a loan with a loan.


Submissions to the Senate Economics Committee inquiry on the bill by both the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Contractors of New South Wales and Sarino Russo Apprentices welcomed the loans on the basis that apprentices would have the advantage of an income contingent loan rather than a commercial loan to buy something like a car or ute. The problem is the payment method envisaged in the actual bill would not make this possible. Apprentices should be given the opportunity to take their loans as a monthly payment or as a lump sum each year.


Sadly, this, as I have indicated, was not the only attack on apprentices. In addition to axing the Tools for Your Trade program, the minister has also axed the Australian Apprenticeship Access program—a program that provided a sort of pre-vocational entry to apprenticeships for the most disadvantaged to give them an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. They also axed the Australian apprentices mentoring program, which I have mentioned, and the Apprentice to Business Owner program, which gave some small business training to apprentices post completion of their trade to enable them to go out and operate their own small business.


So, while the government is telling our young people to earn or learn, it is in fact taking away the very support, particularly with apprenticeships, which is one of the most successful training methods we have for young people to be able to actually achieve that. If the intention of this policy is to improve retention and completion rates for apprentices, it is inexplicable that the government would at the same time be abolishing programs specifically designed to properly recruit and prepare apprentices and to offer them and their employers the advantages of a mentoring program.


This view of support for schools and training is unsurprising, given the actions that have been taken by conservative state governments, who in fact have been slashing TAFE—for example, closing campuses, cutting courses, sacking staff and increasing fees. I was however pleased to see today in New South Wales the opposition leader, John Robertson, and the shadow minister for education and training, Ryan Park, announce Labor policies to protect TAFE and to make TAFE courses more affordable and announcing that they are looking to introduce legislation immediately to block fee increases.


As I indicated, I would like to formally move the amendment in the terms given and circulated. I indicate to the House that we will not be opposing the bills, but I ask the government to very seriously consider the amendment that the opposition is putting forward to make the scheme work effectively and fairly for apprentices, those whom this legislation is intended to target. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House notes that the Government has failed to:


(1) advise apprentices that they would be abolishing the Tools for Your Trade program, thus leaving Trade Support Loans as the only form of assistance for the purchase of tools;


(2) adequately explain in clear language the interest rates and full liability of these loans; 


(3) offer adequate protection for school based apprentices aged between 16-18;


(4) offer fair and reasonable transition arrangements for current apprentices;


(5) put in place adequate privacy protections for the large volumes of information that will be acquired through the Trade Support Loans Program; and 


(6) has failed to offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.""

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (16:30):  I was intending to address something very different here today, but I have been so appalled and shocked by the Prime Minister's conduct today in question time that I just want to get on the record what could only be described as a massive misleading of this parliament. If we do not hear from the Prime Minister correcting the record then I hope that we will look further and go forward with a censure motion, because what the Prime Minister has done today is I think a complete betrayal of the obligations of that office.


People will be aware that today we were talking about the cut to the pensioner concessions. I think it is around $1.3 billion over the forward estimates that has been cut from the pensioner concessions. And the Prime Minister was trying to tell us, 'Well, it's not going to be a problem at all'—that this is a responsibility of the states. He goes on and says, 'I am pleased to say that, so far, every single state has undertaken to continue to maintain the value of pensioner concessions.' But perhaps I could just quote from the Western Australian parliament two days ago, when the Hon. Colin Barnett, the Premier, had this to say:


The commonwealth has decided—it is its decision—to cut its share of the funding; therefore, $25 million has gone. The Western Australian government will not replace that; that is a federal government decision.


He makes this absolutely clear, beyond doubt. On several occasions the Premier of Western Australia has said this very publicly—it has been very well publicised in Western Australia—and now we have the Prime Minister telling us and telling the pensioners of Western Australia and indeed telling the pensioners around Australia that they need not worry because the state governments have all agreed to step into the breach. It is very hard to see that this is anything other than a deliberate misleading of our parliament. And I hope we can get the Prime Minister to come back in here and correct the record, because this is very, very much a misleading of the community.


We know that in a number of other states, like New South Wales, their agreement to fill the breach has of course been for only one year. But at least that can just fall within the basic—




Ms Bird:
  It gets them past the election.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  Yes, and it can conform with the basic spin we hear from the government about this budget. But what has happened here to the pensioners of Western Australia, who tomorrow morning will be rallying against this budget and the very, very unfair way it impacts upon pensioners and retirees, will be grist to their mill: to learn that the Prime Minister has come into this place and said that every single state has agreed to maintain the value of pensioner concessions when he must know—it is inconceivable that he does not know—that the Premier of Western Australia has made it very, very clear that that $20 million is gone, dead and buried, and he has no intention of replacing that. So, who is going to cop the cut? Who is going to cop the reduction in their concessions? It is the pensioners of Western Australia. This is most unfair, and I call upon the Prime Minister to come in here and be honest and correct the record.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (09:30):  It was my pleasure this week to host the mayor, Logan Howlett and his wife, Pat, and three councillors from the City of Cockburn, Philip Eva, Steven Portelli and Yaz Mubarakai. There were here in Canberra to participate in the National General Assembly of Local Government. I know they gained a lot through their involvement in this year's NGAA program, and they brought with them their perspective and experience as representatives of an important local government in Western Australia.


I also participated in a breakfast meeting yesterday with the National Growth Areas Alliance and I am grateful to the member for Franklin, the shadow minister for regional development and local government, for organising and hosting that valuable opportunity for a number of members to hear some of the specific needs and challenges that face growing outer metropolitan communities.


The City of Cockburn in my electorate is a member of the alliance and, in addition to being one of the most significant growth areas in WA, it is also one of the fastest growing local governments in Australia. The National Growth Areas Alliance made an important budget submission this year, noting that the local governments within the alliance absorbed 35 per cent of Australia's population growth between the last two censuses, and calling on the federal government to provide a growth fund to support critical initiatives in areas like transport infrastructure and training and skills development. Investment in these areas is essential if growth areas are to function at their best, enabling their residents to participate fully in the economic and social life of our cities. The reality is we will not see the kind of coordinated and integrated growth we need, with the kind of sustainability and amenity outcomes that Australians should expect, if the development of growth areas is not carefully guided and appropriately resourced.


I have explained before the wonderful and catalytic effect of the Perth-Mandurah rail line and growth in the City of Cockburn, and credit must continue to go to the member for Perth in relation to the achievement of that visionary project during her time as minister in the West Australian Labor government. Now it is up to the current WA government to do its part and for the current federal government to overcome its inexplicable aversion to public transport. In my role as the federal representative of the people of Cockburn, I have worked hard with local government representatives to close the gap between the pace of residential development and the lagging provision of community infrastructure to match that growth and support those households and families. As part of the Labor government that took local government, city planning and public transport seriously, and knew the enormous benefit of public assets and services, I was pleased to help deliver projects like the new fire and emergency services headquarters, the new Coogee surf lifesaving club and the new Cockburn integrated health and community facilities.


I thank the mayor and councillors from the City of Cockburn for their good company this week and I encourage interested members to consider the National Growth Areas Alliance advocacy campaign, which is aptly titled 'Bring the Basics Within Reach—Jobs and Services for Growing Outer Suburbs'.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:00):  I am happy to present and speak to the Treasury portfolio expenditures and appropriations, an important part of the government's economic action strategy.


You have heard it said before, but it is important to make the point again, that we need to implement the economic action strategy to help build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. The budget actually seeks to address some of the what are now uncontested challenges that are part of the financial trajectory that the previous government left for the incoming Abbott government. We have heard the Parliamentary Budget Office make the point about how important the need is for action and timely action. We have even heard the opposition leader acknowledge that there is a task to be dealt with. We have heard other expert commentators describing the need for us to take responsible, modest but thoughtful action now so as to guard against the debt and deficit trajectory that had been left for us by the previous government.


It is important to recognise where we are starting from. There is that joke where they talk about—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  No, no! I would reject any suggestion that Treasury is a joke! They take their work very seriously, and I am appalled to hear from the shadow Treasurer that he is having a go at the Treasury when they do great work—




Mr Bowen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is that the minister misled the House. I said the Treasurer, not the Treasury, and he well knows it.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  There is no point of order.




Mr BILLSON:
  If he could just pay the reasonable courtesy of not interjecting otherwise someone might not hear his shrill interjections clearly! I accept the clarification that the shadow Treasurer has provided—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  and I apologise if I have in any way mis-characterised his poor-mannered interjection, but that is a discussion for another day!


It is important to remember what the debt and deficit trajectory is that Labor has left for this country and for the incoming government, and how we have had to deal with those budget settings—those expenditure predictions and the debt forecasts—that see us on track, if no action is taken, to accumulate a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion.


For those who are listening, let us round that up to $700 billion—that is, seven with 11 zeroes! It is an extraordinary amount of debt and the nation has little to show for it. It recognises the profligacy and the desire to spend and spend and spend some more, not having to realise that there is a need to finance that expenditure. And where it is expenditure that is not funded by revenues from today, as reflected in the historically large series of deficits that the previous government oversaw, that then incurs expense for the nation, our country and for future generations.


I recognise that Labor may not always have appreciated the harm that it was causing. I do not think it is in anybody's wish or will to disadvantage subsequent generations by being irresponsible in decision making today. I am not suggesting that Labor was consciously aiming to create the problem that it has left for this country. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. But the lesson is clear: we have seen this before. We have seen Labor go down this pathway and leave it for an incoming coalition government to fix the mess: to make sure that we all make a contribution today to build our prospects and our opportunities for the future—to deliver the great promise of our country, and that is opportunity, prospects for a better life and a better quality of life for subsequent generations.


It is now recognised that if action is not taken we are diminishing that prospect and those promises for subsequent generations. So I am pleased to be here to communicate once again not only the case for action but the thoughtfulness in the particular measures that are being presented to this parliament and to the Australian public. As I travel around the country, I am constantly reminded of the call from the citizenry for political leaders that take a longer term view, that speak frankly about the circumstances and canvass the options before our nation, that the parliament does think about building our capacity for the future and is making important decisions today that might not be easy but are crucial to our longer term prospects. That is what the nation and its citizens ask of me, and I am sure that they do of you too, sir. This budget does all of those things. It is not without its challenges to communicate the importance of some of these measures, but it is crucial that we get an understanding across to the Australian public that if we want those better prospects for the future this budget, now the Economic Action Strategy, is to be implemented.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (10:05):  I have a series of questions for the minister. I take the minister to Budget Paper No. 2, page 203, and the changes to pension indexation. Could the minister confirm a saving of $449 million over five years by cutting the indexation rate of the pension and other equivalent payments, for example, the single parent payments? Could the minister provide any further information as to the breakdown of those savings? How much is from the age pension and how much is from carers in particular, and is there any other information the minister may choose to share with the chamber? 


Can the minister indicate to the chamber separately what modelling the government has undertaken on the impact of these changes on individual pensioners? Can the minister confirm a figure by which the government estimates the average pensioner would have been worse off had these changes not been implemented? Particularly, can the minister confirm that if these changes had been implemented, for example, for the past four years, an average age pensioner might be $1,500 a year worse off? Has the government undertaken that analysis and does the minister have the view that that analysis might inform the impact on the average pensioner of these changes going forward?

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2014-06-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:06):  The budget paper outlines the broad impact of the adjustment to the indexation measure to see it adjusted to the kind of indexation Labor introduced for the family payments arrangement. In no respect, in no way and with no reasonable characterisation is it a cut to anything. What it reflects is an ongoing commitment for a twice-yearly adjustment to our pension rates to give confidence and certainty for those who are reliant upon that income support that it will increase with the cost of living to maintain its buying power into the future. What is crucial about this budget is that it seeks to recognise the importance of the safety net, of the social security system and of the range of programs aimed to properly support the vulnerable, those who have already made their contribution to the economy and those who have particular needs for which we as a generous society should be providing. So in the budget it characterises what the adjustment in the rate of increase will mean in an aggregate sense. 


To carry out the analysis that the shadow Treasurer is speaking about, one would need to include all of the ins and outs. I think that the shadow minister would agree that in terms of the average savings to households from the abolition of the carbon tax—something Labor says that it is in favour of terminating but when it comes to this parliament it chooses not to carry through those statements in public—we know that it is on average a $550 benefit. We also know that if Labor continues to obstruct the abolition of the carbon tax, the rate of the carbon tax will actually increase at from 1 July. 


So what we have done with this measure is not cut pensions. We have adjusted the rate at which the pension will continue to increase twice annually. We have also left in place the so-called compensation that was available when the carbon tax was implemented. That compensation, important in its terms of an increase to these fortnightly payments, remains. Our ambition is not only to take the carbon tax out and therefore reduce those cost-of-living pressures on households of all types, but also to leave the so-called compensation in place. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Order! Sorry, Minister. You cannot just wander around the chamber like that. You should come through the right doors and go to your right seating area. This is not your chamber.




Mr BILLSON:
  So that is our strategy: take those cost-of-living pressures off households, maintain the buying power of the pensions through an ongoing twice-yearly indexation, change the rate at which it increases and therefore ensure that the very benefits that are important to the vulnerable and to those that have already made their contribution to our nation are in fact not vulnerable themselves because of our inability to finance them into the future. 


In summary, I think those relying on the payments that are addressed on page 203 of Budget Paper No. 2 can be confident that their interests have been reflected. The net impact of the adjustment in the rate of increase of those pensions is captured in that table. To delve into a household by household analysis beyond what has already been published would involve a lot of analysis of other measures in the budget that are designed to improve the situation of households, take pressure off the costs of living and help build that strong, safe and secure economy and nation that we are working to achieve.

Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:10):  Eden-Monaro is a rural electorate and it depends heavily on small business as an employer in the region. In fact, in regional Australia, after you go past schools and government agencies providing services in rural towns, it is the private sector in terms of the small business community that is the principal employer. We have recently come into government. We have unemployment problems across the Eden-Monaro region. For example, in the Eurobodalla Shire we have an unemployment rate that is above seven per cent, which is way above the national average. Indeed, part of that problem is people employed by small businesses have lost their jobs. We are seeing that across regional towns in the Eurobodalla, Bega Valley, Bombala, Cooma-Monaro and Palerang shires in particular.


Minister, I understand that across the nation some 519,000 jobs were lost in small business over the last six years, which is a very distressing fact. The government is putting in place an economic action strategy that I understand will help secure some one million jobs in the next five years and potentially two million jobs in the next 10 years. Part of that will be the abolition of the carbon tax. I was in Cooma last week and visited a florist. When people talk about the carbon tax they do not often think about florists, but they were very significantly hit by the carbon tax because refrigeration is a very important part of the work of a florist. They were urging me to ensure that the carbon tax was abolished in this term of parliament.


I want to understand your comments with respect to the carbon tax abolition and the importance that has for small business right across the Australian nation. The other thing I want you to potentially make some remarks on is the significant review of competition policy that has been announced by the government and is being funded in the current budget. Can you give us an explanation of the progress of that competition review? Indeed, I also note in the Treasury portfolio that funding will be there also for changes to the franchising code of conduct, which is another very important thing for a number of small businesses in my electorate. Minister, I pitch you those questions and I look forward to the answers.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:13):  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his ongoing interest and commitment to small businesses and family enterprises that are the engine room of our economy. I joined the member at a small business forum in Batemans Bay. It was fabulously well attended. The message was clear: 'We understand the need for the Economic Action Strategy, so get on with it.' 'Get on with it' was the clear message that was coming through, as people were looking for a predictable, stable and dependable economic setting and conduct by the Commonwealth government. They want stability, predictability and certainty in the environment in which they are making decisions to mortgage their house, to take risk, to employ and to grow and develop their business. This is what, I am pleased to say, our economic action strategy in the budget seeks to deliver. We are keen not to have that strategy impeded. That is why getting the carbon tax through is so crucial to ensuring that that improved economic environment is available for our creators of wealth and opportunity, the small business people.


The member talked about the 519,000 jobs in small business—an awfully large number—that were lost under the previous Labor government. They seem not to want to talk about or recognise that. Maybe it is because they might not be union jobs or they are not all in one location. This represents a real hit to the wealth creators, those courageous men and women who mortgage their house and sometimes place their sanity and personal wellbeing at risk as they toil in a difficult economic climate to create a livelihood for themselves, for others and for their community. 


We are seeking to arrest that decline in small business employment. It accounted for 53 per cent of the private-sector workforce when the Howard government left office. But after Labor was recently tossed out, and a change was called for Australian small business men and women, it is down to 42 per cent of the private-sector workforce. Those are the circumstances we have inherited. The clear message from my travels around the country and in my own community is, 'Please, no more of the same.' The last thing they want from an incoming government is more of what they had under Labor.


In the budget there are a range of measures. The member for Eden-Monaro, who is very alert and attuned to these issues, went to the issue of the carbon tax. The carbon tax hurts and punishes small business in a very particular and pernicious way. With all the carve-outs and hush money—the compensation that was made available by the previous government to abate the harm and the hurt of the carbon tax—small business got no direct compensation. In this chamber, they were told to 'suck it up or pass it on'—I think that was the term used. There was not a moment of appreciation from the previous Labor government of just how difficult the economic climate was, of how hard it is to simply pass on costs in a marketplace where we need to be world class, where there are cost-conscious consumers, where we need to build confidence, build spending power, remove cost-of-living pressures and reduce the costs of doing business.


The member for Eden-Monaro also touched on florists, which is a very good example. The carbon tax plays its evil impact through the florists. Those opposite think florists do not need to worry about the carbon tax. But florists have refrigeration costs. Who can forget R404 gas, which, because of its CO2 equivalence, went up in price by some 400 per cent? Small businesses have shown me fridges that they used to operate that needed to be repaired. Because of the cost impact of the carbon tax, they choose not to repair those fridges. And then there are energy costs—the costs of keeping the lights on. You see this right across the economy—and it compounds. Labor said they did not want a carbon tax. They promised they would not implement it—but they did. And now they want to terminate it—but they will not. This tax just builds and builds all the way through the supply chain. In regional communities such as Eden-Monaro, if Labor had their way, the carbon tax would be extended to heavy road transport. 


As a legacy of Labor, the carbon tax is currently legislated to go up again on 1 July. My advice would be to speak with your local small businesses, as I do, and remind them that we are doing our utmost to get rid of the carbon tax, to energise enterprise in this economy and to get rid of those headwinds and burdens that are slowing the growth and potential of small business. Our work is to turn around the harm of six years of Labor. We are keeping at that. We can say to our constituents: 'We know what our plan is and we want to get on with it. Labor are not only the cause of the harm but are now standing in the road of the remedies as well.'

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (10:18):  I refer the minister to his previous non-answer, in which he failed to answer any of the questions I asked. I put it to him again: does the government have modelling on the impact of the change of the indexation on pensioners? The minister referred to the 'evil' carbon tax and other matters, but that is not what the question refers to. My question simply refers to the change in the indexation of the age pension and other pension payments. Budget Paper No. 2, at page 203, indicates savings of $449 million over the next five years by changing the way of indexing the pension. Let me put this to the minister very clearly and in a very straightforward fashion: can the minister confirm that this is $449 million that pensioners will not be receiving, that will be cut from their income?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:19):  I can happily again run through the numbers that are there on the page—the numbers identifying what the change in the rate of increase in pensions means in budget terms. We have been through that. 


The former Treasurer is so proud of his work that his ALP website does not even mention he was the former Treasurer. It is quite bizarre. It talks about 'non-this' and 'non-that'. He seems to have been a non-Treasurer, according to his own published material. Putting the Labor Party website—and the non-ness we are seeing from Labor—to one side, the adjustments in the rate of increase, the twice annual rate of increase, to those pension payments are clearly there on page 203 of  Budget Paper No. 2. The numbers are there. 


The shadow Treasurer then went on to talk about what the household impact was and I quite reasonably pointed to there being other influences on the net household impact that Labor wants to ignore. The Labor way is to look at important issues and the strategy for our nation through a straw. All they want to look at is the little microspot at the end of the straw. They do not want to take into account the other changes, the other measures, the action we are taking to remove cost-of-living pressures by repealing Labor's pernicious carbon tax—which is going up again on 1 July.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  They joke about it over here. They have not taken a moment to analyse the impact of the carbon tax on households across Australia—not to mention the impact on the small business community, whom they have loaded up with this burden. It is lead in the saddlebag and an impediment to the prospects of small businesses, preventing them from growing employment and economic opportunities in this country. They are not the slightest bit interested in that. They come in here wanting to talk about a part of the budget that addresses a section of our community that has been frightened by the Labor Party's shrill exaggerations and negativity, by what I think has been a very one-sided critique from Labor. They have not sought to look at the other budget measures aimed at improving and enhancing the security and situation of those the Labor Party is talking about. 


If the shadow Treasurer wants to talk about impacts, we should talk about all of the impacts. That is what my answer was about—that is about being honest and frank with people. That is the contrast between this budget and the fiction and fudged numbers we saw with Labor's budgets. They promised these rivers of revenue, not realising that the nominal growth rate was not inextricably linked to a growth in company tax. 


I remember, as we travelled around Western Australia, hearing from small businesses about how difficult the economy was under Labor, about how many of them were trading in a profitless environment. All they had to do was show an interest in what was going on in the economy and Labor, when in government, would have known their budget was fiction. They would have known simply by listening to people who have a lot of skin in the game—people with mortgaged houses and people who spend every waking moment thinking about their enterprise. 


This budget is truthful, it is dependable, the figures are robust, and the growth trajectories and some of the key assumptions have—unlike anything Labor has done—been consistent through two economic statements in a row. This is the difference between this budget and the ones that Labor introduced. The numbers are dependable and reliable. What the shadow Treasurer did not want to talk about was important measures to support those who are on income support, measures to optimise their future opportunities, measures aimed at helping them get back into work and improve their own circumstances. These include incentives such as the Restart program, fabulously important for unemployed people over the age of 50.



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  He is heckling again. He thinks politics is a footy game and that it helps if you heckle loudly. But it does not strengthen your arguments. You can keep doing it, but it does not strengthen your arguments. 


Coming back to those mature age job seekers who have been out of work for some time, there is a $10,000 incentive through the Restart program. It says to employers, particularly small business employers, 'If you are thinking about recruiting one more person, recognise the experience, the wisdom, the workplace know-how and the capacity of mature age people.' Here is an incentive for those mature age people to get back into the economy, to be able to make an economic contribution if they are in a position to do so. There are a range of very positive measures in this budget. I commend those measures. What I am hearing as I travel around Australia is that people are hungry for the facts. When you give them the facts that are in the budget, they recognise the need for action. They understand that we are all making a contribution and they are encouraging us to continue to think about the future and prepare for it.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (10:24):  I would like to thank the Minister for Small Business for his wonderful advocacy for the small business sector during his term in the portfolio, both in opposition and now in government. It is interesting to reflect that for six years of the previous government, and now in our current term in government, we have had the same person in this portfolio. I think the previous government had six ministers. It has provided the small to medium business sector with consistent representation and a consistent voice. This is a very important segment of our economy. As touched on earlier, six years ago it employed some 53 per cent of the workforce and it is now down to 43 per cent. But more importantly, in my electorate of Forde it employs a very large proportion of our workforce. There are small to medium businesses in construction, manufacturing and retail, and we have some 7½ thousand of those small businesses.


The minister was recently at one of our chamber breakfasts, which was greatly appreciated. One telling thing at that breakfast was when those businesses were asked if they would employ another person if red tape, regulation, the carbon tax and other imposts from the previous government were taken away and they almost unanimously said yes. We took 23 terrific policies to the election that we are now rolling out. Minister, this is a great opportunity for you to inform the House about how the initiatives outlined in our election policies and commitments are going to strengthen small businesses, not only in my electorate of Forde but also in the nation more generally.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:27):  I thank the member for Forde for not only his insightful contribution but also his chairmanship of our small business policy committee. He has been a champion of small business right throughout his life. Here is a member of the coalition whose entire life, privately in a professional capacity and publicly, has been an agent of support, encouragement, counsel and assistance for the small business men and women of our country. I commend him for his lifetime of service to this important sector.


Now in public office that work continues. It was the contribution of the member for Forde, the member for Eden-Monaro and the three amigos from Tasmania that helped shape the comprehensive small business policy that we took to the last election. In comparison Labor promised more of the same, and we know that was the last thing that the small business community wanted. This budget actually energises and resources the implementation of a vast number of those election commitments. We have said to the Australian public and to those small business men and women who risk so much and who show great courage to create opportunities for themselves and for others and livelihoods in their communities, your interests are too big and too important to ignore. It was a cry that we heard from the chamber movement, an understandable reflection of the revolving door of previous ministers with the name 'small business' often tacked to a long list of other things. We do not take it that way. My primary focus every day is on small business.


I am pleased that the Prime Minister has understood the importance of the small business community. The small business portfolio is not only included in cabinet and not distracted by a shopping list of other responsibilities but now embraced in the economic policy powerhouse of the Commonwealth—that is, the Treasury. So many of the policy settings that are shaped in Treasury create that entrepreneurial ecosystem that we talked about earlier that helps people decide whether they employ, invest, recruit and expand. Many of those measures are shaped within Treasury. I am pleased to join with Joe Hockey as a cabinet minister in that portfolio.


We understand the importance of the abolition of the carbon tax. There are billions of dollars of impost on our small business men and women. For those who are competing for opportunities here against importers, or who are seeking to grow their markets in overseas countries as exporters, this acts as a reverse tariff. It is lead in the saddlebag. I mentioned in the House our Socceroos last night taking on an extraordinary Dutch team—and your divided loyalties must have been troubling last night—but imagine if our team, in their Nike soccer boots, had five or six kilograms of lead in each of their boots and to keep up with some of those svelte and handsome Dutchman, like yourself, Sir, in the World Cup competition. We know that would be unfair. So we know that that is unfair in sport as it is in life. It is in our economy as well. That is why we want to abolish the carbon tax.

  Clearly the crowd is enthusiastic! Are they chanting for more?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Randall
):  No, we will have order in here!




Mr BILLSON:
  You touched on the red tape reduction initiative—a billion dollars of red tape reduction, not just for the life of the government but each year. What a real discipline and challenge that is. Why? Because Labor thought what all small businesses wanted to do each day was wake up in the morning and wonder what the government wanted them to do for it next—what compliance or regulatory impost could they turn their minds to! It seemed to be what Labor thought small businesses had front of mind, when they really wanted to grow their businesses. That is a crucial area of our work.


We have particular measures to fix the ACCC. We heard from the chairperson what a 'diabolical'—they were his words—financial position they were in. The shadow Treasurer, who once had responsibility for the ACCC, seemed completely disinterested, happy to have them technically insolvent before Christmas last year and on track to run out of cash in March. How on earth does that build confidence for consumers and small business?


We are implementing our commitment for unfair contract terms protections, extending that to small business transactions, whom, like individual consumers—



An opposition member interjecting—  




Mr BILLSON:
  'How's it going?' Why? Because there is no interest. We have not heard a peep from Labor about that. Implementing the franchising reforms; making sure our procurement changes give small business a chance; implementing the drought support package, crucial for small businesses operating in farming communities; our Paid Parental Leave scheme, what a great measure to give small businesses the same opportunity to recruit that government and the big corporates have; the Emissions Reduction Fund, a chance for small businesses to participate in that; the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, a role with tools and teeth. There are so many opportunities. We are implementing our policies. I just wish Labor would get out of the road.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:32):  We can only be glad that this show is appearing all this week and next. I want to ask a number of questions of the minister at the table. First, the budget provides hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to multinationals by delaying the reforms to the Offshore Banking Unit, $180 million; and deferring the start date of the legislative elements to improve tax compliance through third-party reporting and data-matching, $113 million. Minister, why has the government given $1.1 billion back to multinationals while ripping money away from pensioners and low-income Australians? 


Secondly, does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's comments that the reintroduction of indexation of the fuel excise will 'act like a carbon tax'? Given the comments of the Prime Minister in the United States that the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation will act like a carbon tax, has Treasury conducted any modelling of the impact of fuel excise indexation on Australia's carbon emissions and, if not, why not? 


Since the minister has not only told us that if we abolish the carbon price we will win the World Cup but also that it is evil, I wonder if he might tell us what adjective he would best use to describe the indexation of fuel excise, which, as the Prime Minister has said, acts like a carbon tax. Would it be 'immoral', 'wicked', 'unholy', 'sinful', 'ignoble', 'base', 'dishonourable', 'villainous', 'nefarious', 'sinister', 'vicious', 'malicious', 'demonic', 'devilish', 'diabolical', 'fiendish', or maybe simply 'black hearted'? And, Minister, why do the cuts to research and development tax incentive commence on 1 July 2014 when the reduction in the company tax rate, which it is purported to offset, does not commence until 1 July 2015?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:34):  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. Wasn't it a surprise—he did not ask about co-payments! He's got form on that, hasn't he? Higher education co-payments—he has form on that as well. There are so many things he is not able to talk about. And that is probably why we got a professorial thesaurus articulation to fill out some of the time! There are so many areas of this budget where the member for Fraser simply cannot go. He has form. If he was being principled in his articulations at that time, you would have thought he would be one of the strongest advocates for many of the measures in this budget. But he chose not to talk about those things for which he has form. He chose to talk about some other changes.


He talked about the fuel indexation changes. In fact, I have just introduced legislation into the House to reintroduce fuel indexation in precisely the form introduced by the Hawke Labor government. But what is different about our approach is that we have implemented that measure to ensure that we can fund the nation's biggest infrastructure program. Going back to my earlier point: in my community and as I travel around the country, I consistently hear the call for a longer term view. They would like to see more of the resources that come to the Commonwealth being put into building our capacity and opportunity for the future, not going into consumption. They are concerned that we are borrowing $1 billion a month to finance what is essentially consumption expenditure. That $1 billion a month would be set to go up to $2.8 billion a month if Labor's policy settings were put in place. Yet they were not seeing the investment in our productive capacity as a nation. So we have introduced this measure to go some way towards funding $26 billion of road infrastructure projects, to build that infrastructure and productive capability for the 21st century economy. 


Why is it important? In Melbourne, we want to see the East West Link constructed. Labor have been all over the shop. I was going to say they have been talking out each side of the pie hole, but I thought that might have been taken as a slight against the Leader of the Opposition. They have been all over the place. I am not sure if they are for it or against it. But the communities that I represent know they are for it. That is because infrastructure like the East West Link has the capacity not only to support commuters but also to support commerce. It will support commerce in the direct construction phase and then in the ability of our economy to function through these infrastructure arteries—an important development—and the indexation that goes with it. What I am seeing and hearing is a call for that kind of infrastructure investment. But people also want to know that the funding of it can be sustained. That is why we have moved to reactivate the very indexation measure that Labor introduced. It will be interesting to see where they go with that. 


The question then went to the carbon tax. I am not sure whether the member for Fraser is aware of it—he may have been writing a book or something at the time—but, under his team, the carbon tax is set to increase again from 1 July and, under Labor's policy articulation, it was to be extended to heavy road transport. If he followed this and did the analysis that he claims he does on some of his work in a professorial mode, he would know that the indexation of fuel excise has no net effect at all on off-road uses or on heavy transport for vehicles over 4½ tonnes. Why? Because they are offset; it does not amount to a tax that cascades, builds and grows through the economy. So his analysis that this is somehow the same as the carbon tax is patently wrong. In those productive areas of the economy—for off-road uses of the fuels that are covered by the fuel tax and excise regime and for on-road heavy vehicle uses—there is no impact. There is a net improvement because we have simplified the way in which those transactions of excise are calculated—they are rebated and there are road transport charges—so it was not down to the three decimal points that those opposite would love. The member for Fraser might love a third decimal point, but we think one decimal point is perfectly adequate. So those analogies are simply not relevant. 


If the member for Fraser is concerned about cost impacts on our economy and on households, then the honourable, thoughtful and analytical thing to do is get behind the abolition of the carbon tax. That is what he promised his citizens: that he was going to terminate the tax. No, Labor is running a protection racket for its carbon tax; it is set to go up from 1 July and, if their policy musings are to be believed, they want to extend it to heavy road transport as well.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (10:39):  I declare an interest first of all. Up until very recently my wife was a small business owner. She has relinquished herself of that nevertheless quite profitable burden and is now seeking an alternative business. I would like to follow up on a question that I asked the minister in question time the other day. It was in respect of the nearly 8,000 small businesses in my electorate of Lyons. I was replaying the question there because it was an excellent answer from the minister. In the question I did compliment the government on the fact that we now have the Minister for Small Business in cabinet. That is a really important initiative. It was a commitment that we went to the election with.


We made a number of commitments in the lead-up to the election. I would like the minister to reflect on those and then answer some of my specific questions. In relation to paid parental leave, can the minister contextualise the productivity benefits that flow to small business being able to compete with the Public Service and big business on a level playing field and how that initiative is a piece of economic policy as opposed to a welfare measure? 


My other specific question relates to one of the commitments we gave—and the minister has already commented on this, and I appreciate that—about a root and branch review of the competition policy in this country. That commitment was part of our 10-point plan to support small business that we took to the election in September. We said we would commit to a review of the competition framework to ensure the Australian law and policy settings promote a vibrant, competitive market in the economy and ensure small business is given a fair go. My question relates specifically to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which relates to the misuse of power. I note the comment you made before with respect to funding. Was it an issue of funding under the previous administration that removed the capacity of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act to be used in the way that I think those who designed the act always intended it to be? 


Those are my two specific questions. If I have an opportunity later on, I will probably have more.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:42):  I thank the member for Lyons. There are 7,800 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Lyons was reflecting on a question he asked in the House. There are a couple things I would like to add to that. It has been some 200 days since anyone from Labor has asked me a question. Is small business of such little interest to Labor that they do not think it is worthy? I do not know how many questions we would have had over that sitting period, but it must be in the hundreds. It seems quite extraordinary. It is very instructive that, amongst those hundreds of questions since about mid-November, there has not been one question from Labor about anything to do with small business. That is quite extraordinary. 


In contrast to that the member for Lyons asked a very good question. If I can draw from my earlier comments, some measures I have already touched upon—and I will not spend too much time on them again: the abolition of the carbon tax is crucial, the red tape reduction measure is very significant and having small business considerations front and centre in the big decisions and all the analytical work of Treasury is crucial as part of that proper recognition and respect that small business people need. 


The member for Lyons is absolutely right: the Paid Parental Leave scheme is a very important measure at so many levels. It is about ensuring that those people eligible for the coalition's Paid Parental Leave scheme can have their wage replacement set as the level for those payments. Why? I get feedback all the time from my own community and as I travel that if a family wishes to both pursue their economic objectives, through jobs, careers and engagement in the economy, and have a family it can be very difficult indeed. For many households two incomes are actually needed to meet the mortgage costs and the ongoing expenses of that household. And at a time when a family may have a newborn—a micro-human to care for—those costs just do not dramatically and miraculously overnight default back to some minimum wage level. They do not do that; those cost structures are still there. They need to meet the mortgage costs; they are still there. Those living expenses continue.


Yet, we see far more generous paid parental leave schemes in government, in the public sector, than any small business employer could ever dream of offering. We see this in major corporates as well, so it seemed to be right and appropriate for some contributors to the economy to have access to that kind of benefit. But Labor wants to obstruct a very positive measure to see that same kind of support available to the people operating in our small businesses and family enterprises. Where is the justice in that? Where is the honour? Where is the principle? Where is the consistency, that some working in big corporates and the public sector can get a benefit that Labor wants to deny to those people who are operating in the small business economy?


It is simply unjust to take that inequitable position, and that is why we have moved to implement a scheme that is perfect for small business: available to their workplaces and to those who are juggling the tasks of economic goals for themselves and their families, and also raising that family. For the first time, small businesses will be able to operate on a level playing field with the public sector and large businesses when it comes to offering those employment benefits to be able attract and recruit the very best people for their businesses.


It is about equity. It is about participation; encouraging people to see that there is a pathway to juggling those crucial dual objectives of economic wellbeing and prospects for a family. It is also being funded in a way that is fair and just. We took to the last election a 1½ per cent reduction in the company tax rate. Now, I know that only one-third of small businesses are actually structured as companies so for that 800,000 that is some promise of an encouragement and an incentive to grow and to be profitable in the future.


But this is not funded by the small companies. This is funded by the most profitable companies, which will not have that 1½ per cent company tax cut reduction within the window we have announced as a policy. This is really important; it is a measure that is funded in a sustainable way and it is a measure that is available to small business.


I would love to talk about the root-and-branch review, but there is so much to talk about! The root-and-branch review is something that Labor would not go near. They are happy to snarl and snigger and carry on about the problems but do nothing about it. Why? Because they only talk to big business and big unions, and this is about giving efficient businesses, big and small, a fair go, and I hope that I get the chance to speak further— Time expired)

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (10:47):  Actually, in answer to a question that the minister asked: we have asked lots and lots of questions on small business, and related to small business. We have just asked people who might be able to give us an answer! That is the only difference.


But there is no doubt that the budget is having an immediate impact on the Australian economy and hence small business in Australia. The latest Westpac index of consumer confidence, in fact, shows the results of surveys taken after the Abbott government's budget; it fell sharply by 6.8 per cent in May. Perhaps the minister would like to explain why that is the case, since they are supposed to be the doyens of all knowledge and assistance for small business. Perhaps he could also explain why almost 60 per cent of the respondents in the Westpac survey said that the budget would make it tougher on family finances in the next 12 months and hence make it tough on small business as well?


The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence survey showed that following the Abbott government's budget, consumer confidence had fallen 14 per cent since April. That is the fastest rate since the financial crisis. Now, that is pretty telling. And weekend reports from property analysts show sharp falls are being felt in the economy, with house prices in Australia's capital cities falling for the first time in 12 months. The RP Data index suggests that there is a strong correlation between consumer confidence levels and housing market activity, again, as a result of the very bad and chaotic budget of the Abbott government. So consumer confidence is falling—that is confirmed. And it is not Labor saying that, that is independent analysis.


Meanwhile, the Minister for Small Business makes massive cuts in the budget—directly cuts funding for small business. He cuts funding for skills and training programs which, as the minister would know himself, are one of the big issues for small business. That comes up in every survey and every time you talk to small business. They want funding for skills and training programs. The minister cuts what small business needs the most. He also has cut billions from tax benefits directly for small business and then tries to blame somebody else. If his cuts then have an effect on jobs, he tries to find somebody else to blame. It could not possibly be all the cuts that this minister and the Abbott government have made. When is the government actually going to take some responsibility rather than just look pious?


There are approximately 2.1 million small businesses in Australia employing roughly five million Australians. There are figures we all know, but these are figures that very few understand—perhaps even this minister knows the data but just does not understand what it means. On Labor's watch, we were quite happy to acknowledge the data and the circumstances. I felt proud that we created the conditions for small business to grow—because in fact, that is exactly what happened—based on estimates of employment by business size and the changes in the number of people employed between 2007 and 2013. I think the minister is slightly aware of this. Maybe he should try to explain this, because I am using the same dataset he likes to use. 


Perhaps he could try to explain why large business—they are business too—grew from around 2.6 million to 3.4 million under Labor's watch. Just an explanation: how is that possible? That is 757,000 additional people, 757,000 additional jobs, which is an annual percentage increase of 4.3 per cent. Once he tries to explain that, he might perhaps try to explain further how medium and small businesses grew from around 1.9 million up to 2.7 million. That is an increase of additional people, real people, new jobs, real jobs—822,000. 


Then he could probably try to explain this—and this is the figure he likes the most; the one he likes to quote. But he does not quite tell people this: non-employing business saw an annual change over that period, a transfer, albeit small. It is only 1.8 per cent over a six-year period. That is quite small. But it is the figure that the minister likes to quote, the 519,000 jobs. But, funnily enough, it is only in the non-employing small business. Where did those so-called jobs—because if they are not employing anyone you are assuming it is just the person who is the business, non-employing as the data shows—go? They went to medium and small business. Isn't that what it should always be about? Isn't that what we all want? Don't we want non-employing business to employ someone? Don't we want them to get out of that category and move up to the next category and grow? Because that is what Labor did: grow jobs and business.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:52):  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I am happy to help him with his understanding of the figures. I know there is probably not really any authoritative voice amongst his colleagues who could explain these figures to him. But I am happy to do that, because I am always happy to provide good service wherever I am able to. 


He talked about the changing employment numbers and sought to extract certain elements of that ABS table that did not suit his argument. It is quite simple. If you carve out bits that are unhelpful, you will probably get a different answer to the ones that reasonably depict the livelihoods that are available within small businesses employing 19 and under people. That is what the ABS data says. That ABS data, including all those that fall within the small business category, will be microbusiness, home based businesses, all important businesses, and it includes self-employment and non-employing businesses. There is nothing wrong with that. We think there is nothing wrong with people who choose their own pathway to achieve a livelihood. We know Labor has a different view. That is why you have seen this coordinated attack on independent contractors and self-employed people. 


Again, this is borne out by the question today. He does not even want to talk about non-employing businesses. A non-employing business is still a livelihood, and a livelihood matters. A livelihood in a small business matters, even if it is not employing somebody and is a sole operator. We do not need to be reminded by Labor how indifferent they are to those courageous men and women who mortgage their houses, who take risks to create opportunities for themselves. You just brush them away as if they do not count. A non-employing small business matters. 


There were a stack more of them before you guys got into office. There are so many fewer of them now. We are still seeing a recovery—which is needed—now that you have gone, because there is now confidence that the government are on the side of small-business men and women, that we are an ally, that we are an advocate. We are not an adversary like you guys were. Five hundred and nineteen thousand jobs were lost in small business. That is 519,000 livelihoods. If you want to carve them off and say that because they are not employing somebody they do not count, shame on you. Shame on you! Do not come into this place masquerading as if you care when you have such a disdain for people who are running their own business but happen not to be employing anybody.


We want to see them grow. We want to see them prosper. We want to see them thrive. And that is why we have the comprehensive policy package to deliver that outcome. That is what we have. That is what we are working for. That is what is different about the coalition, the Liberal-National parties. Labor say: 'If you're self-employed or you're a small business and you don't employ anybody, you don't matter. We'll just take you off the data. We'll just not even think about you, and we'll concoct another piece of fiction like the budgets to try and argue a narrow, hollow, self-serving case'—which ignores the very interests of people who deserved a whole lot more respect from Labor when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government were in office. If they have learnt nothing, we just saw evidence of it today. They have still learnt nothing. Show a bit of respect for those people who mortgage their houses.


The member did not care to talk about the extra 200,000 people who were added to the unemployment lists under Labor. He chose not to talk about those. He chose not to go to the insolvency numbers that are there. He chose not to go to business formation numbers. He chose to cherry-pick some of the consumer surveys that are out there and the confidence surveys—where the message coming back to me time and time again is that people are less troubled by the facts of the budget when the facts are shared with them. What some of those sentiment indexes are reflecting is the shrill, over-the-top, scaremongering of Labor, who, through their actions and their dishonesty, are ripping out of people's livelihoods and their plans for the future the confidence and optimism that we are focused, every day, on building for them so that we have a strong and prosperous economy, so that people can be safe and secure about their future prospects, so that those small businesses not employing—so disdained by Labor—might choose to become an employing small business.


That is why we have made changes in the area of Fair Work, to provide some guidance and support tools for that non-employing small business to encourage them and assist them to make that decision about a new recruitment. There is a direct helpline in to Fair Work. It is not like Labor's, where you used to disclose the facts of your case and they reserved the right to prosecute you.


These are some of the practical measures that are part of our comprehensive plan to restore the jobs lost in the small-business economy under Labor, to rebuild confidence and optimism about the prospects into the future. I say to every small business, every family enterprise, even those that are non-employing and disdained by Labor: you all matter. You are valued and respected by the coalition. You are the engine room of the economy. We know that Labor took a cylinder or two out of the engine. We want to get that performance back because it is crucial to our future prospects.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:58):  I would like to address some issues to the Minister for Small Business and thank him for recently visiting the electorate of Swan on two occasions to talk to small businesses and a business incubation group down in Kensington. I know that the member for Oxley was also in Swan not long ago representing that Labor were actually interested in businesses. As someone who has been in small business since 1981 and has been through the period of both Labor and Liberal governments, I know that Labor are no friend of small business—never have been, never will be. They just do not get it. They stand up there all time saying, 'We're the friends of small business.' What an absolute joke.


In the 30 years I have been in business, it has been very plain to anyone in small business. No-one I know in the small business association stands up and says: 'Give us a Labor government. We want a Labor government for small business.' Who says that? The Labor Party says it. The unions say it. But it is certainly not said by businesses. Businesses do not say, 'We want a Labor government,' I can tell you. We only need to look at the royal commission. That gives you a perfect example of how unions and the Labor Party treat small businesses. That is all the stuff that is coming out now. They had Western Australia. I know there were times in Western Australia in the construction industry, where my background is, where many small businesses paid thousands and thousands of dollars to unions and to ALP fronts—even training fronts. That is coming out now, isn't it?


I heard the member for Oxley mention training programs. There is one in Welshpool that for years has been taking money from small businesses. If you go there, there are no training programs, but they are still getting the money. They are still being paid by the small business people, who are blackmailed or put into situations where they are supposed to be paying for non-existent training programs. I know that small business has enormous compliance costs as well, so I will ask the minister—since we are running out of time—what real changes are being made by the coalition to assist small business?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (11:00):  The measures being implemented by the Abbott government are so comprehensive that I will not have time to run through them all. But I am happy to go through many of the elements that are important to the member for Swan. He talked about skills training. Of course, there is the Industry Skills Fund, which is designed to provide particular support to meet the training needs of small businesses. We have the Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Fund, which is another important measure tailored and targeted for smaller enterprises, to help them bring their ideas to market and to collaborate with researchers. There are so many good measures.


We are continuing our advisory service program. There are no cuts to that funding, in an important effort to better target those so that we get the help we need. There is also the issue of engagement with technology. We know how it can be for small businesses to be a part of the technology world to access new markets and opportunities. There is also support for exporters—a better targeting of the Export Market Development Grants facility. We are making sure that EFIC, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, has its systems geared to the needs of small business.


There are so many things building possibilities, capacity and opportunities through the small business community. That is why we need to pass this budget. We need to fix the budget to strengthen the economy and to build a strong and prosperous economy that provides livelihoods and opportunities for a safe and secure future that supports small business and that re-energises enterprise. That is why I am thrilled to commend these budget measures to you.


The other measures that are available include improving small business access to contracts. One thing that Labor did was spend money like there was no tomorrow, but they did not actually give small business a fighting chance to win that work. Other important measures include the unfair contracts provisions and implementing franchising reforms—something that Labor would not touch. It was like kryptonite. They would not go near it until—what?—five minutes from the election, when all of a sudden they got interested. We are actually doing the work that is needed. I commend these budget measures and urge this parliament to get behind the implementation of our economic action strategy.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the minister. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio be agreed to.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:03):  It is a great pleasure to join my colleague, the member for Aston—the unnaturally handsome, member for Aston—and to follow the unnaturally talented member for Dunkley in what was a very persuasive and powerful defence of the changes that he has undertaken in his Small Business and Treasury portfolio.


We are here today not to defend a very good budget but to inform you about why the budget that has just been announced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is in the best interests of the Australian people. This budget does two things. This budget, first and foremost, pays back Labor's debt—$667 billion of Labor's debt. That was the legacy of those opposite to the Australian people. Through measures in this budget, over the next 10 years we will reduce expenditure by nearly $300 billion.


The member for Rankin should know this, because he was part of a government that led to a record increase in government spending. We want to be part of a government that is much more responsible when it comes to budgetary measures. So we will save the Australian taxpayer up to $16 billion a year in the interest bill alone as a result of these measures—up to $16 billion a year. That is as much as a WestConnex project. That is as much as an East West Link. It is as much as an NDIS. It is as much as Gonski. That is just the interest bill we will save as a result of measures in this budget.


The second thing we will do as a result of this budget measures is lay a foundation for more jobs, higher growth and increased productivity. When it comes to those measures, first and foremost, there has been a record government expenditure on infrastructure: some $50 billion in new funding for infrastructure, which will in turn lead to up to $125 billion in state, private sector and federal government expenditure. This includes putting money on the table to incentivise the states to recycle their infrastructure. This is a record amount of government spending.


The third thing we will do is invest record amounts in education and innovation. The Medical Research Future Fund will be—and is already becoming, in terms of its ambitious proposal—the envy of the world: some $20 billion in funding for medical research, an area of natural expertise in Australia. We want to deregulate our university sector, a critical area, so that we can enable our universities to become the best in the world. We can do that by deregulation. We are giving apprentices, for the first time, significant government support just as if they were going to university. That is what we are doing in this budget in terms of education and innovation.


The fourth thing we are doing to boost growth, jobs and productivity is enhancing workforce participation. We are enhancing workforce participation by saying to people who are over the age of 50 and who have been on welfare for more than six months: we will give your employer up to $10,000 as an incentive to take you on board so that you no longer have to be on welfare. When it comes to women in the workforce, we want to encourage them to stay in the workforce after they have had children; a paid parental leave scheme is an important component of that. Australia is below other countries in the world when it comes to the number of women participating in our workforce. They are coming out of our universities in higher numbers than men but they are not represented in our workforce in the same numbers. Then, of course, there is our earn and learn strategy which is so important—because under the government of those opposite, under the Labor government, youth unemployment went to record levels. We are trying to break that nexus between welfare dependency and unemployment. What we are saying is: if you are a young person you must go out and find a job. We will help you do that. We will also give you training.


This is a vitally important budget. In my areas of deregulation and the G20; cutting red tape and consolidating the number of bodies, we are making great headway. I commend the measures in this budget to the House.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:08):  While most of the country were up late last night watching the State of Origin and then the soccer, and while some people were at a charity ball here in this building, the parliamentary secretary was in front of the mirror practising his audition. He was up all night practising his audition for Senator Sinodinos' shadow ministry job. I wish you well with that, Parliamentary Secretary. Hopefully, for him, that competition is not judged on facts because there was a whole bunch of stuff the parliamentary secretary just said which was patently false. I will not go through all of it—it would take me hours to go through all of the factual errors in what he just said; but let me pick up a couple.


If the government was fair dinkum about participation, for example, they would not be attacking the childcare system. If they were fair dinkum about this so-called budget emergency they would not have doubled the deficit when they came into government. If they were serious about budget repair they would not be spending $21 billion on a scheme that gives the wealthiest mothers in the country the most money that they least need. There were all kinds of things in there, but I want to focus on the Federation as part of this portfolio.


I have a couple of questions that I would like the parliamentary secretary to deal with. Firstly: they make a big deal in their budget documents about a functioning Federation and reform; they have a white paper coming and all the rest of it. It is very curious that they would abolish the COAG Reform Council. It is very curious that, when premiers right around the country are calling for a meeting to discuss the cuts to payments to states, there has been no meeting scheduled. I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary what is the plan for engaging with the premiers and state treasurers who are so critical of the budget. That is the first set of things I would like him to elaborate on. And then there are the cuts to the COAG Reform Council.


I also very specifically would like him to refer to page 7 of their own budget overview document—and I am happy to provide a copy if the parliamentary secretary would like it. I would like him to confirm that my eyes are not deceiving me and that it says: 


In this Budget the Government is adopting sensible indexation arrangements for schools from 2018, and hospitals from 2017-18, and removing funding guarantees for public hospitals. These measures will achieve cumulative savings of over $80 billion by 2024‑25.


Every day in question time the Prime Minister denies this bit I have helpfully highlighted it in green for the benefit of the House. It says that there is $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals. I would like the parliamentary secretary very specifically to confirm that that is indeed the government's budget document and that that number is indeed true.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:10):  It is a great pleasure to respond to the member for Rankin. Firstly, it is not only us who are telling the Australian people that we have to reduce spending; it is groups like the IMF, who said of 17 leading economies in the world Australia has the fastest rate of spending, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and the independent Commission of Audit, who said that we are on a trajectory of spending that we cannot continue. That is why we have had to take measures in this budget. 


I am very happy to tell the member for Rankin that when it comes to the COAG Reform Council we are saving $8.3 million over the forward estimates. It might be news to the member for Rankin that the state that he comes from—Queensland—is also going to benefit, because the states are going to save just over $10 million—




Dr Chalmers:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. I do apologise for interrupting. I would like to table the government's own budget document that says that there has been $80 billion in cuts.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  There is no point of order.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Rankin might like to learn that his own state of Queensland is going to be one of the states that are going to save—and this is a cumulative amount—over $10 million from getting rid of the COAG Reform Council. You need to know that the sunny state of Queensland is also going to be a beneficiary of the COAG Reform Council not continuing and the Commonwealth is going to save over $8 million.


The member for Rankin does raise an important point about this government's commitment to funding hospitals and schools. Yes, it is true that some of the state premiers and the chief ministers were not that happy after the budget, but would you believe that, if you look at Treasury's papers, over the coming decade increased expenditure from the Commonwealth to the states is going to be tens of billions of dollars—nearly $60 billion of increased money over the decade. That is money from the Commonwealth to the states for things like hospitals and schools. In fact, hospital funding and school funding are going up between 37 and 40 per cent.



An honourable member:  It is not going up.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  It is. Spending is going up over the next four years and the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that in the chamber. If you look at the government's funding commitments for hospitals and schools, it is going up year upon year upon year—40 per cent and 37 per cent for schools and hospitals. The member for Rankin is very brave because he has raised the issue of school funding. What has been the most topical issue when it comes to school funding? It has been Gonski. How much more have we put in?




Mr Tudge:
  $1.2 billion.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  $1.2 billion, thank you, Member for Aston. An extra $1.2 billion that they ripped from the children of Queensland and Western Australia. We, under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, have found that money from the taxpayers of Australia to go where they never were spending that money.


I am very proud of the fact that in this budget we are not only putting down the foundation for increased growth and jobs and productivity, we are not only paying back Labor's debt by finding spending cuts, but we are also increasing support for hospitals and for schools by the significant numbers of 37 and 40 per cent respectively.




Ms Chesters:
  That was a printing error!




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Unlike the member for Bendigo, those members opposite do not take the fiscal responsibilities of the Commonwealth seriously. These members on this side of the House take our responsibilities very seriously when it comes to the budget. We are very proud of this document and we are very proud of the increased funding for schools and for hospitals.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (11:15):  How interesting to hear the member for Rankin talk about schools funding. In my state of Tasmania, government funding for state schools over the next five years goes up by 46 per cent. I do not know how we can translate that increase in funding as being a cut, as the member for Rankin tries to do. I know he is very fond of figures. I think he used to influence the abacus in the member for Swan's office over the last six years.




Dr Chalmers:
  Proudly!




Mr NIKOLIC:
  He says, 'Proudly'! I do not how you can be proud of $191 billion of achieved deficits. How can you be proud of $123 billion of forecast deficits, which would have resulted in 16 years of deficits in this country? How can he be proud of $667 billion of gross debt, and right now borrowing $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on the debt? If, like the member for Franklin, his abacus continued to borrow into the future, in 10 years time that would be $3 billion of borrowings every month to pay the interest on our debt.


Be that as it may, and the revisionist history that the member for Rankin tries to engage in—my serious question to the parliamentary secretary—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr NIKOLIC:
  Thank you. My question to the parliamentary secretary goes to the proliferation of bureaucratic structures and regulation under the former Labor government over the last six years. Despite promising to limit regulatory impacts—and I think Mr Rudd had a promise of 'one on, one off' when it came to regulation; in their cabinet submissions, every department was going to have a regulatory impact statement—somehow, we managed to end up with 21,000 new pieces of legislation and regulation. That is 21,000—so much for another promise to the Australian people that was not met by those opposite over the last six years. The people in my electorate have conveyed that as being a little bit like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Would the member for Bass resume his seat. While robust debate is encouraged, it is at that the point that I can barely hear the member for Bass. I am going to ask every member present to please allow the members to speak uninterrupted.




Mr NIKOLIC:
  The people in my electorate described it as something like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra tinkering and adjusting but, in essence, interfering with their daily lives. Businesses and community groups felt that pressure, that pressure of 21,000 pieces of regulation, every day. Where the proponents for projects were confronted with an environmental issue, they felt the full wrath of all three levels of government, including the government in Canberra when it came to OH&S and environmental problems and a whole range of other issues. Unions and green groups, not surprisingly, had all this disproportionate influence in Canberra. Regrettably, in Tasmania we had the double whammy of Labor-Greens government in Hobart as well.


I know people often talk about business power, and I know the member for Rankin and those opposite engage in the politics of envy and division. But the greatest power of business is the power to invest or disinvest. What stops them from investing are those obstacles and those roadblocks. What we are doing as a government is eliminating some of those obstacles and roadblocks. I am the Tasmanian representative on the parliamentary secretary's deregulation committee, which has done some extraordinarily good work, and I was a proud member of the first repeal day. I hope there are many more to roll back some of the injudicious regulation that came out of those opposite. We sent a powerful message about our government's commitment when it comes to easing that burden of legislation and regulation. Those were the obstacles to investment I was referring to earlier. In that context, I ask the parliamentary secretary: what more does this budget foreshadow when it comes to deregulation and getting rid of the proliferation of the many hundreds of government bodies and rent seekers out there that grew during the last six years? Are there even more savings to be made in this regard in the future?

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:19):  I thank the member for Bass for that very entertaining and realistic assessment of the legacy that those opposite left us when it came to regulation. He is right. They left us 21,000 additional regulations. He referred to regulatory impact statements. Those opposite promised that there would be regulatory impact statements for major legislative initiatives. Would the members opposite believe that, when it came to the carbon tax, the mining tax, changes to the Fair Work Act, the NBN and the Future of Financial Advice, each of those legislative initiatives was exempt from a regulatory impact statement process? Those opposite have no idea as to the true impact and cost on stakeholders of those thousands of new regulations that they introduced by way of the heavy hand of government. 


We want to be very different from that. We have already had our first repeal day, where we were successful in getting rid of more than 10,000 additional regulations and redundant pieces of legislation. The savings to the Australian taxpayer and to industry is more than $700 million. We are not finished. I thank the members for Bass Hindmarsh, Deakin, Wright, Aston and Herbert for their incredibly hard work in putting ideas on the table for cutting red and green tape across the economy. One of the real areas in which we have been successful has been environmental approvals. The Minister for the Environment has given approval for more than $500 billion worth of projects in the just less than nine months that we have been in office, and we have moved to one-stop shop environmental approvals.


The member for Bass asked an important question about the consolidation of agencies in this budget. I am very pleased to report that, as a result of measures in this budget, hundreds of millions of dollars will be saved to the taxpayer by unwinding the layer upon layer of bureaucracy that currently exists. In fact, the Commission of Audit found that the Commonwealth government had about 1,000 statutory and non-statutory bodies within its remit. What we have said is we are going to get rid of some of these bodies. Let me tell you the names of some of these bodies we are going get rid of. We are going to get rid of the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula. We are going to get rid of the Social Inclusion Board and the High Speed Rail Advisory Group. The process is well underway for merging AusAID with the Department of Foreign Affairs. Of course, when we are providing support for good governance, health, education and infrastructure in our region, it needs to be linked with our diplomats. It is just a common-sense idea where we will save a huge amount of money. We are merging the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service into the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The functions of Health Workforce Australia, General Practice Education and Training Ltd and the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will go into the Department of Health. The back office functions for the National Archives, the National Gallery, the National Museum, the National Library and the National Portrait Gallery are all going to be merged because that brings savings to the taxpayer.


I can go on. We are merging five civilian merit review tribunals into a single organisation—so the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Classification Review Board, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will come together—not to mention the very busy privatisation agenda that we have currently underway with Medibank Private, and we have announced scoping studies into the sale of Defence Housing Australia, the Royal Australian Mint, Australian Hearing and the registry function of ASIC. It is very important to understand what the government should be doing and what the private sector should be doing and having a proper delineation of responsibilities so in the end we can provide better service to the taxpayer at less cost.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:25):  Thank you for giving me the call, Madam Deputy Speaker. I need to ask which you prefer to be called: Deputy Speaker or Madam Deputy Speaker?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  I am happy with either, but thank you.




Ms RYAN:
  Good. I just want everyone to note that it is worth asking a woman what she wants occasionally, because I want to talk today about the Office for Women and the adverse impacts this budget has on women. I am glad to be here and I am glad to hear that list of advisory bodies and experts that those opposite think they do not need to listen to anymore. One of the things I want to talk about is the notion that, if you cannot slash an advisory body or get rid of an expert, then you can always just ignore it, like we are ignoring the Office for Women. 


Tony Abbott's budget of broken promises makes savage cuts to pensions. We have been there. We know the list of cuts is long: hospitals, family payments, superannuation, education and services. All of these cuts will have a deep impact on women. For example, a single parent on the parenting payment, the majority of whom are women, will have their budgets hit by more than $3,400 a year. Industry Super Australia has stated: 


The repeal of the LISC—


the low income super contribution—


will be particularly damaging to the retirement savings of women who constitute an estimated two-thirds of those eligible. Staggeringly, the abolition of the LISC will negatively impact on the retirement savings of almost one in two women.


In the aftermath of the budget, we have seen an unprecedented and dishonest attack on Australia's carers, the majority of whom are women. There are no changes to carers as a result of the budget, the Prime Minister said in question time on 16 June. This is wrong. The budget cuts the carers payment, with indexation to be reduced to CPI. This will impact on carers, the majority of whom are women. And, with women accounting for 60 per cent of GP visits, the GP tax will have a deep impact on their access to health care. As the costs mount for families, tough decisions will be made on seeking help for those families.


I went to the website of the Office for Women and I found there that the Office for Women exists:


… to ensure a whole-of-government approach is given to providing better economic and social outcomes for women.


That is what the website says. Then I went to the 'Economic Empowerment and Opportunity' part of the site, and it said:


The Australian Government is working to improve women's economic empowerment.


   …   …   …


Women's economic empowerment is central to a strong economy and region. For example, closing the workforce participation gap between women and men could boost gross domestic product by up to 13%.


During Senate estimates, on 27 May, it was confirmed that the Office for Women, in your department of PM&C, provided advice on all relevant measures leading up to the budget. Ms McDevitt said:


For all the budget measures, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provides advice, and, since the Office for Women is located within the department, the Office for Women has provided advice on relevant measures leading up to the budget, which could include consulting with other agencies and providing internal advice that would feed into the whole-of-department advice on budget measures.


My question in this area is: why was advice from the Prime Minister's own department ignored in the formulation of the budget? It has been the practice, for over 30 years, for federal governments to produce a women's budget statement as one element of the official budget papers. We heard a few minutes ago lots of statements, pointing the finger across the chamber about previous budgets—not the budget of 2014, which is the budget we are all here to talk about. That has been in place for 30 years in the official budget papers, but in 2014 it is not included.



My question is, given the PM is the Minister for Women and the Office for Women is in PM&C, who made the decision to cut this statement? Was the Office for Women consulted on this specific decision? Given the impact on women of this budget, why was this decision made? And I will go further, with another question. To me, as a woman, it is really concerning that this government has a mirror looking backwards. I am looking forward to doing my ironing again. I wonder if you can answer that.(Time expired)

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:30):  The member for Aston is right. That was a very poorly phrased question, full of inaccuracies and mistakes. I am very proud that, in this budget, the Prime Minister has ensured that funding for women's programs has continued strongly.


The hypocrisy of those opposite in talking about support for women's programs or about helping women in the workforce is exposed by the fact that they have unleashed a partisan attack on our Paid Parental Leave scheme. The Paid Parental Leave scheme is fundamental to ensuring that more women stay in the workforce after having children so that we continue to—



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! 




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Off the record or on the record, I am an extremely strong supporter of the Paid Parental Leave scheme because I believe it boosts workforce participation. The member for Rankin is showing great ignorance because he probably does not know that the Grattan Institute put out a report on the numbers of women who are in the Australian workforce compared to the number of men. Those numbers are 67 per cent of women, compared with 78 per cent of men. Of those 67 per cent of women in the workforce, how many do you think are working full time? Only 55 per cent. But when you look at the number of men who are working full time, it is 85 per cent. One of the key things we need to do in this budget to support working women is institute a paid parental leave scheme and I am a big supporter of the Prime Minister's scheme.


You ask me, in addition to the Paid Parental Leave scheme—in addition to providing more affordable and accessible child care and funding for women's safety—what else are we doing in this budget for women? I am very happy to tell those opposite. Firstly, the National Women's Alliances program has received funding of almost $4.8 million for six alliances over the three years to 2016, up from just $3.6 million over the previous three years. Funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children remains unchanged in this budget and that funding is $104 million over the forward estimates. This includes money for Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, 1800 RESPECT, DvaleRT—domestic violence response training delivered nationally by Lifeline—and the personal safety survey and—



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Those on my left have asked their question. They will listen to the answer from the parliamentary secretary.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Other women's leadership and development strategy funding that we have continued to support over 2013-14 includes funding for the National Women's Alliances, the sport leadership grants, the Every Girl program and the like.


There are many examples in this budget of how this government has shown its continued strong support—indeed, its increased support—for women's programs, particularly for women at risk. I am very proud that in this budget we have continued funding these important areas and we will continue to speak out in favour of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. It will be, in addition to childcare improvements—we have a Productivity Commission review into child care—a way of improving the lot of Australia's working women.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:34):  I was going to put this in halves, but I am happy for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg to take this on notice. I do have a question for Parliamentary Secretary Tudge as well. In relation to the red tape reduction, is there a possibility that we will make this a COAG process? The work we have done on red tape and green tape reduction has been fantastic. It is a great start. The commitment to keep going is important. I see the member for Wright is here. His previous occupation was a truck driver. Most of his red tape costs would have been state government costs. My big concern here is the possibility of cost shifting or responsibility shifting to the states. If we save $1 billion then the states put on $500 million of red tape, we would still be $500 million better off but the states would have jumped in. I would like to see if you are going to follow that through.


My second question for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg is on the tender process. I will give an example. The Flinders Shire Council had a nine-kilometre stretch of road that they costed at $9 million. Because it was over the threshold it had to go to national tender. It was picked up by a national supplier and the cost was $27 million. They flew in their team, equipment and camp and did the work and nothing went through the local community. Is it possible that we can look at something in relation to the tender process to ensure that the money that is expended by the Commonwealth in regional and regional communities does stay there and we give more flexibility to local councils in that area?


I represent the seat of Herbert, which includes Palm Island. We have a number of Indigenous organisations. I have a real issue when it comes to the running of some of these Indigenous organisations. Lack of accountability and poor governance have meant massive losses of funds. People have been shifted out of these organisations. Information on what we believe were fraud matters has been provided to the police. It is very hard for the police to prove fraud. Is there an instrument in ORIC—and will the parliamentary secretary take it upon himself to have a look at the rules of ORIC—that is similar to ASIC's rule that someone is no longer fit and proper to run an organisation, so we can make sure that the governance to the community is better off?


Additionally, would the parliamentary secretary be able to advise me about the opportunities to work and get a decent job. I know he is very passionate in this regard. Palm Island is 2½ hours on the ferry, so the 90-minute rule no longer applies. If someone is moving to Palm Island, there is no onus on them to look for a job. The difference between being on benefits and working can quite often be a disincentive to them getting a job. Can the parliamentary secretary give me some information in relation to what he is thinking about this and what the government is thinking in this space?

The member for Herbert is absolutely right: this is not just a whole-of-government approach to deregulation at the federal level but also very much involving the states. The Prime Minister has said that deregulation will become a standing item on the agenda at COAG, which will be used as the primary body for driving reform at the federal and state levels.


At the last COAG meeting in the first week of May they all discussed deregulation in relation to a number of areas. Those areas included housing and commercial building construction; road freight; food and dairy manufacturing and fish processing; tourism business licensing—which will be very important in your electorate of Herbert, particularly around Townsville; rules as they relate to cafes and restaurants; and gas and resources exploration. They have divided up these areas among the various states for them to take responsibility for doing a deep dive in the particular area and bringing forward ideas where there is federal-state overlap in regulation. 


We are very determined that, to be successful on the deregulation front, we not only get changes done at the federal level but drive changes at the state level so that, as the member for Herbert mentioned, the states do not just introduce new regulations to make up for the federal government's reduction in regulations. You need to understand that we are extremely focused on this. A number of states like Victoria have a red tape commissioner and they are driving changes. I have met with Deb Frecklington, the assistant minister for finance with responsibility for deregulation in Queensland, your home state. We are driving this agenda forward together. As the member for Herbert rightly mentioned, in the area of environmental approvals we were able to get MOUs signed with every state and territory. Those opposite would like to know that the Labor state of South Australia and the ACT also signed on to these MOUs and Greg Hunt has been moving forward to get full agreements, particularly with Queensland and New South Wales, in a speedy fashion. So we are moving at a state and a federal level on the deregulation agenda.


The member for Herbert also raised the very important issue of trying to create jobs at a local level through the tendering process. The member for Herbert may be interested to know that one area we have been looking at relates to the federal safety commission because the federal safety commissioner requires, under the legislation, that builders be particularly accredited. What can happen is if Defence Housing is building in remote areas, as it often does, it would want to source builders from the local area, but those local builders may not have the accreditation needed to get that job because going through that accreditation process requires extra costs on their part. That is another example of where those opposite have no understanding of the true impact on job creation at the local level of extra layers of bureaucracy and red tape. So I have met the head of Defence Housing and we are looking at this issue of the federal safety commissioner. Hopefully I will be able to report to the member for Herbert that there has been some progress on this issue. Like him, all my colleagues on this side of the House understand that we need to create jobs in the regions, we need to free up the councils, we need to free up the local builders and we need to ensure that they can get a personal dividend out of our red tape reduction efforts.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:43):  We have seen a fair bit of rhetoric this morning, as we always do in sessions of this kind, and a bit of cut and thrust. That is all well and good, but I seek the indulgence of the parliamentary secretary to ask a question of earnest importance, and that is a question dealing with the incidence of men's violence against women in our community. I ask him to take this question from me as one man asking another man about an important issue that all men should be speaking out about in our community. Questions that go to the prioritisation of funding are inherently political, but I emphasise I am not asking partisan questions as I do not doubt the intent of those opposite to curb the growth of men's violence against women in our community and, in fact, to drive the rate of violence down.


My questions relate to two areas of funding and the Office for Women. I am seeking guidance from the parliamentary secretary about whether the Office for Women provided advice to the government on how this year's budget would impact on services provided to women in danger of family violence, in particular in the area of community legal centres. We have seen $1.6 million cut in the budget from the women's leadership and development strategy, which includes the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, but also $15 million from legal aid and millions from community legal centres.


In Melbourne's west, in my electorate, more than 50 per cent of the work of community legal centres is advising women in danger of family of violence. For the benefit of people who have not engaged with these groups, this kind of advice includes their rights in the legal system, protection and their rights to intervention orders to ensure their safety. It is also advice about what to expect if they make the decision to leave their home, in terms of their financial security, the obligation of the government to them and the obligation of their partners to support them. Also, there has been a 35 per cent increase in demand for community legal centre advice in this space in my electorate.


MYEFO contained cuts of $3.6 million from the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services, $9.6 million from community legal centres and $6.5 million from legal aid. Did the Office for Women provide advice to the government about the impact of those cuts on women in these situations? Also, did they take into account that the rising rates of domestic violence increase demand for these services in the community? If they did provide advice, I would ask what the recommendations of that advice were and whether it was acted on by the government?


The second area I would like to ask about is the impact of cuts to Medicare Locals funding contained in this year's budget, and the impact this has on family violence services. Family violence was a priority area for the Medicare Local in my community. As I said, family violence is an extraordinarily serious and growing problem in my community. These cuts will have substantial impact on the ability of Medicare Local-funded programs to continue in our community.


I should emphasise that these are not cuts to the Medicare Local institutions, these are cuts to the funding of programs being implemented by Medicare Locals. Again, I ask whether the Office for Women provided advice on these decisions and about the impact of these decisions on women in these situations? I ask whether the cumulative impact of these cuts to programs that assist GPs in providing advice to women and identifying women in these situations, combined with cuts to community legal centres, who are providing advice to women in these situations, were taken into account in the budget process?

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:47):  I thank the honourable member opposite for those questions about a very important topic. Like him, I hail from the state of Victoria, which has been rocked by tragedy in recent times, particularly as it relates to violence against women. The Jill Meagher case is the most prominent example of what is clearly unacceptable behaviour.


As I said earlier, this budget continues to strongly support funding programs to prevent violence against women. On the issue of the Office for Women and the advice that they are able to provide: that is done within the context of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They are able to provide advice on all relevant measures in this budget. We take our advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.


On the particular measures that we are committed to in this budget: as I said earlier, the funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children remains unchanged. The funding for this plan is $104 million over the forward estimates and the budget continues funding for the Australian National Research Organisation For Women's Safety and the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, as well as a number of other measures including 1800Respect, the nationally funded counselling support line for women experiencing sexual assault and/or domestic violence; DV-aleRT, Domestic Violence Response Training delivered nationally by Lifeline; the Personal Safety Survey; and the National Community Attitudes Survey to Violence Against Women. The second action plan, which will include our commitment and that of the states and the territories to ongoing action, will be released mid this year.


The member opposite asked me about community legal centres and funding for those. We continue to believe that funding going forward needs to be structured in a way which does take into account the most vulnerable in our community including women at risk. We have extended the base funding under the national partnership agreement on legal assistance services by one year until 30 June 2015. Ongoing future legal assistance will be the subject of consideration, and the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into access to justice arrangements and the recent review of the national partnerships agreement will also inform future decisions going forward. 


In relation to Medicare Locals, the member opposite will be aware that we have increased funding for health in this budget right across the board. In fact, funding for hospitals has increased by nearly 40 per cent over the coming years. There are a lot of fallacies contained in the arguments put by those opposite. We have put more money into education than they ever did—including $1.2 billion for the Gonski proposals—and we have continued to promote funding for hospitals and front-line patient services.


I am very proud of this budget because it pays back debt, it boosts jobs growth and productivity, and it continues to provide financial support, assistance and services for those most in need.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:51):  I firstly make the observation that this is the very first time in Australian political history that we are discussing the Indigenous Affairs budget as part of the consideration of the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. That is because Prime Minister Abbott is now the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs. It is the first time in Australian political history that that has been done, and he has done so because he saw the importance of this area and wanted to oversee the entire portfolio area himself. The questions that will come up now will also come up when we are discussing the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. I think that is worth reflecting upon.


I will not in my opening remarks go through the specific measures which are outlined in the budget. They are tabled for the members here to see. What I would like to do, though, is inform members as to the overall approach that we are taking in the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, the rationale for that approach, and, through that, how the budget is actually delivering on that approach. We have a great many challenges in this nation—and the member for Kooyong outlined some of the budgetary challenges which we are facing—but the greatest challenge in Australia remains the plight of Indigenous people. We ask all members to ensure that this is high on our political agenda at all times—and with the Prime Minister taking on the portfolio it hopefully will remain high on the political agenda at all times.


Our overall approach can be summarised by saying that we have three core priorities in the Indigenous area, and they sit on a bed of governance reforms. Those priorities are to get kids to school, to get the adults into work and to ensure that there are safe communities. And then there are a series of governance reforms which underpin that, and on the side we have the constitutional recognition process underway. I will touch on each of those three priorities briefly, as well as the governance changes. First of all, why those priorities—why education, employment and community? In part, it is because of the upstream factors. If kids are at school, if the adults are in work and you have reasonable order in a community, then the other things tend to take care of themselves. People's mental health is better and people's physical health is better. If people are in work and kids are in school, then child protection tends to be better. If there is a safe community, then you do not need as many activities overall in terms of policing and other such activities. So it is a firm focus on the things which we think absolutely matter for the overall functioning of any society, frankly, not just the Indigenous community. 


But when you look at those three areas, there are significant problems at present. Take school attendance, for example. The school attendance rate across Australia for Indigenous is about 10 percentage points lower than for the non-Indigenous. But that hides what is occurring in the remote areas where there is sometimes what I would consider a catastrophic Indigenous attendance rate. In remote Northern Territory, for example, only about 25 per cent of students attend 80 per cent of the time. If you are attending less than 80 per cent of the time, you are effectively not learning. There are only about 25 per cent of students, therefore, that I would consider learning by virtue of attending school for a sufficient amount of time.


When you look at employment, the employment gap is about 30 percentage points. The overall employment rate for non-Indigenous people is about 75 per cent and about 25 per cent for Indigenous per cent, and gap has in fact got wider over the last five years rather than smaller. When you look at community safety, the stats across the board are poorer in Indigenous communities than in non-Indigenous communities. So we do need to have a dedicated focus on those three areas, and this budget consolidates programs to ensure that we can have that focus.


It also has important governance reforms, primarily, by amalgamating 150 programs into five broad ones and ensuring that we can have much more localised and nuanced decisions made at a local level where Indigenous people can be more empowered.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:56):  I assume the parliamentary secretary is aware of a functions role and responsibility for the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, having worked closely with the council. Mr Warren Mundine is the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council which provides advice to and works with the government to implement Indigenous policy. When it comes to the council, I would like the parliamentary secretary to outline the budgeted remuneration levels of each member of the council. How much is Mr Mundine being paid? What are the levels of remuneration and the details of that remuneration, and those for his deputy chair and, of course, each member of the council? Could the parliamentary secretary outline the total cost to the budget of the operation of the Indigenous Advisory Council for the 2014-15 financial year as well as across the forward estimates? 


The Indigenous Advisory Council is responsible for the provision of Indigenous policy to the government. Did the council support the $534.4 million cut to Indigenous programs in the budget? Can the parliamentary secretary advise how and when the council was consulted about the budget measures in the 2014-15 budget round? How many times did the council meet before the budget and with which members of the government? Was the council consulted and did the council provide advice on all the budget measures? If not, can the parliamentary secretary explain why not? 


Can the parliamentary secretary advise the chamber how often the Indigenous Advisory Council meets? Is every member present at every meeting? What are the quorum requirements for the council? Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that Mr Mundine has met with the members of the government on behalf of the Indigenous Advisory Council? When was the last time the council met and when will they meet next? 


As the appointed remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council, Mr Mundine is reported in the media as having announced a second round of cuts in Indigenous affairs program in the order of $600 million. Mr Mundine announced as the head of the Indigenous Advisory Council that he is meeting with the Treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann to cut an additional $600 million from the Indigenous affairs budget. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm whether the $600 million in cuts mentioned by Mr Mundine is in the forward estimates? Did Mr Mundine meet with the Treasurer and finance minister before or after the budget was handed down? Who within the government authorised the new funding cuts? Does the government agree with and stand by the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council about the second wave of cuts? Are you working on or have you got more cuts in the forward estimates? Given the current level of $534 million is not able to be achieved through administrative efficiencies, is it being called from programs and where is the next round of cuts coming from? Why are further cuts being discussed within the government when the full impact of the current round of cuts is not yet known?


I want to quote from Mr Mundine on the ABC World Today program on 5 June 2014:


We did some modelling on repair and maintenance of housing and there's no doubt from the modelling that we got back that you can save 24 per cent … on the repair and maintenance of housing, and you can save from 5, 10 per cent in other areas.


I would like the parliamentary secretary to talk about the modelling. What is the modelling Mr Mundine has referred to, why was it undertaken and what else did it reveal? Will he reveal the modelling? What was the scope of the modelling and has the modelling been authorised? If so, by what authority has the work been undertaken? Or is Mr Mundine effectively operating as the unelected minister for Indigenous affairs?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:00):  I believe there were probably about 60 questions in his four minutes there, and in my allotted time I would have to allocate only five seconds per question to answer every single one. Can I say at the outset that—



An opposition member:  Take them on notice.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The more interjections, the fewer answers you will get. Move on.




Mr TUDGE:
  I outlined in my opening remarks some of the significant issues which confront Indigenous Australia. I talked about the appalling attendance rates, where only a quarter of remote Indigenous students in the Northern Territory are attending at a rate which would even make it possible for them to advance and to learn at a reasonable level. I referred to the fact that the Indigenous employment rate is 30 per cent below the non-Indigenous employment rate, and the gap is actually widening. I could have gone on to mention all sorts of other statistics in relation to how Indigenous people are tracking against non-Indigenous people.


I frankly find it surprising that, despite all of those issues, the first 60 questions from the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs are almost entirely centred on Warren Mundine and what he is getting paid, what he is doing, which meetings he is having. I know Warren Mundine was a former president of the Australian Labor Party, and the fact that he is now chairing the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council should not cloud the types of decisions, questions and advocacy which the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs engages in in this chamber and indeed in his role. I would encourage him to focus on the big picture, to focus on the issues which are facing Aboriginal people today and the issues which are faced in this budget, rather than being entirely focused on the activities of Warren Mundine.


I will say, though, about the chair of our Indigenous advisory council and indeed the Indigenous advisory council more broadly that it is an outstanding advisory council. Members would be aware of who the chair is—Mr Mundine—and his activities over decades now, advocating on behalf of Aboriginal people. They would be aware of the other members of the Indigenous advisory council: Ngiare Brown; Mr Peever, the former CEO of Rio Tinto; and Gail Kelly. We have other very substantial Indigenous leaders who are providing advice to the Prime Minister and to the government as a whole.


Their role is an advisory role. Their terms of reference and their role is outlined on the website. Mr Neumann can look at that website and understand that. He can understand when they are meeting. The Indigenous advisory council puts out a communique after each meeting, and so he can understand what their function and what their role is, but it is an advisory role. At the end of the day, decisions are made by the government and we accept responsibility for those decisions, but of course we consult with the Indigenous advisory council before making those decisions.


In relation to the overall cost of running the Indigenous advisory council, I understand that those questions were asked in the Senate estimates process. I have been informed that that information will be provided through the Senate estimates process in due course. Of course, it will be a very small amount compared to the overall $4.8 billion which this government is investing in Indigenous specific programs over the next four years—$4.8 billion. I would suspect that the costs of the operation of the Indigenous advisory council will be a very, very small fraction of that $4.8 billion. That information, in detail, will be provided to the Senate and will therefore be publicly accessible to Mr Neumann, who has been asking these 60 questions in his four minutes.


In relation to the overall budget, I outlined some of those measures in my opening statement. Yes, we have made some savings but we are still investing $4.8 billion over the forward estimates. And we have consolidated 150 programs into five. When you do that you can eliminate red tape and duplications and you can make administrative savings. That is exactly the intent of our budget. Our intention is to provide greater focus on the core areas of employment, school attendance and community safety and, of course, it is to provide efficiencies where we can do so.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (12:05):  Let us hope I can now lower the tone in the chamber.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms PRICE:
  Thank you. Maybe I will improve it; maybe I will lower it, but let's hope I can get some attention. My question is to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and it relates to how the Abbott government is working to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance rates. But first I would like to provide some context to this, particularly with respect to my electorate of Durack.


As the parliamentary secretary and I know, to get ahead in life children and young adults need to build a strong foundation through our education system. To achieve this, however, we must first get children and young adults to school. The Durack electorate has the third highest proportion of Indigenous students. So, ensuring the education gap is significantly reduced in the short term, and rates of attendance are equal in the long term, is a key priority of mine. 


Unfortunately, in Durack Indigenous students attending school is not the norm; it is the rarity. Often this is due to dysfunction in students' home lives. Lack of structure and discipline leads to a high prevalence of truancy. In Fitzroy, Derby and Wiluna, in particular, a significantly higher level of truancy has already been identified by this government and the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, which highlights non-attendance cycles in schools. This authority identified that the average annual attendance rates of students attending Fitzroy Valley District High School between 2008 and 2013 was only 62 per cent. This rate was marginally better at the Derby District High School, with 69 per cent, and there was 65 per cent attendance at the Wiluna Remote Community School. 


What these schools have in common is that they are all remote and have large Indigenous populations, which are often transient. However, this non-attendance cycle was also identified at the Carnarvon Community College—a school which is located in a much higher regional hub—which had an attendance rate of 68 per cent in 2012. I am also saddened that the Roebourne District High School in the Pilbara region had one of the worst attendance rates in the country, of 53 per cent in the same year. This government and the wider Australian community have an expectation that every child has access to, and attends, school every day. But we need to work collaboratively to achieve this. 


Now, I do have some good news. Despite these concerning statistics, I am pleased to say that in Broome, which is a key regional centre in Durack, with a high number of Indigenous students, there are many success stories in the education sphere. I have previously acknowledged the success of the Broome Senior High School and its principal Saeed Amin and his staff, whose hard work and dedication, saw this school become the WA School of the Year in the year 2012. In the same year, the school had a 100 per cent success rate for university offers for those students who were studying university courses. 


Another success story is the local TAFE in the Kimberley, which is called the Kimberley Training Institute or KTI. KTI is the leading vocational education and training provider in the Kimberley region, which runs courses out of Broome and Kununurra. It aims to provide the skills and knowledge students need to enhance their employment opportunities. The fantastic work of KTI was recognised last year, when it received two major accolades at the WA training awards. Visual arts lecturer Jacky Cheng was awarded Best Trainer in Western Australia, while the KTI was awarded Best Large Training Provider. I commend all staff and students for this significant achievement.


It is therefore clear that all students in Durack, no matter their age, race or social status, have the ability to access high-quality education through our schools and service providers. We just need to get these kids to school. This leads me to my question: can the parliamentary secretary please outline the government's approach for improving Indigenous attendance rates at schools across Australia and, in particular, in regional and remote areas?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:10):  I thank the member for Durack for this question on what is a critical area. I commend her for her commitments to her constituency and her electorate, but more broadly to Aboriginal people across Australia. I know she has a very passionate commitment in wanting to see the advancement of Aboriginal people and wanting to see the gap closed in this country. I commend her for that.


The question she raises is a critically important one. It concerns school attendance and education attainment. As I said at the outset, this is our top priority in the Indigenous affairs portfolio and, therefore, one of the top priorities for the government is to lift the school attendance rate. If children are not at school then, by definition, they are not going to be learning. If they are not learning at school, it is so much harder to get employment afterwards and it is likely to lead to a life of welfare. It starts with school attendance. At the moment the school attendance rates, particularly in remote areas, as the member for Durack outlined, are sometimes at catastrophic levels. In some schools, the attendance rate is as low as 37 per cent. If you actually looked at what I think is the most important measure in this area, that of how many kids are attending at least 80 per cent of the time, that figure is even smaller. It is a very significant problem. We do not underestimate the challenge which we have to support schools, to support the Indigenous leaders and to support children to be able to go to school and to learn.


To date, the most important measure that we have introduced to tackle school attendance, particularly in remote areas, is the Remote School Attendance Strategy. In simple terms, that means providing employment opportunities for local, quality people to act as attendance officers. In the mornings they go around, knock on the doors, encourage the families to get their young son or daughter onto the minibus to take them to school, ensure that they are at school during the day and encourage those children to get home safely at the end of the day. This has been rolled out now in 73 schools, 12 of which are in Western Australia. Most of these are in the member for Durack's electorate.


Forty of those schools have had these school student attendance officers introduced in term 1. A further 33 were introduced in term 2. I can report that so far it has had some substantial results and substantial improvements. For example, in some places in the Northern Territory, the number of children in these schools where we have the attendance officers in place is now up 17 per cent on last year. A quarter of all schools in the stage 1 phase have had student attendance rate increases of between 15 and 25 percentage points. It is extraordinary that any school can have that type of increase at all, but it actually shows that in a quarter of the schools we are having tremendous results from these student attendance officers working with the local communities and working with families to get their children to school. Three quarters of the schools have had improvements in their student attendance rates.


This is not easy. A quarter of the schools still have not seen much improvement and there are a number of reasons for that. We constantly get advice from the student attendance officers as to what is going on in those schools and what can be done next to try to improve the student attendance rates. The member for Durack identified some of the issues which they have to tackle—whether it is parties going on at night or alcohol or substance abuse, including by the students themselves and that makes it so much more difficult. There are mobility issues, in that the students are more mobile than non-Indigenous students and may be in a different community at a particular time. All these create challenges, but we are determined to continue the roll-out of the Remote Students Attendance Strategy to monitor it closely, to work with the local leaders in those communities—because, at the end of the day, it has to be done with those local leaders—and to ensure that student attendance rates lift. If we cannot get student attendance rates higher, students will not be learning and if they are not learning then their prospects for employment are so much more difficult.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:15):  The sum of $534.4 million has been ripped away from Indigenous programs in the government's budget. To make the situation is made worse, the government has provided no details or information. There is a single table on page 185 of Budget Paper No. 2. There is no detail, no explanation, no idea. Weeks later and the government has still been unable to explain the cuts, and service providers, their staff and clients will have to wait six to 12 months in limbo. I trust the parliamentary secretary takes note and that he is more enlightened than the Minister for Indigenous Affairs who claimed in Senate estimates on 30 May 2014 that $½ billion in cuts was merely an efficiency dividend. It was exposed as a feeble and false claim, when the minister's own department was forced to admit during estimates that the money was, in fact, direct cuts to programs. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm one was or the other that these are not efficiency dividends; these are programmatic cuts? If it is, however, an efficiency dividend, can the parliamentary secretary explain why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are subject to an efficiency dividend of 4.5 per cent, which is much higher than the 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend that this government has applied across departments, agencies and portfolios? What evidence is the parliamentary secretary able to produce to justify the minister's claim that the money is not being taken away from frontline services, as he claimed to David Speers in the Sky News Agenda program on 28 May.


This week the Prisoner Throughcare Program, funded through the NATSIL in New South Wales and the ACT, had its program funding cut by $½ million a year. Workers were told two weeks out that they would lose their jobs. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how this is not a frontline service? Can the parliamentary secretary explain why the government has cut funding for successful programs which help combat recidivism, when Indigenous incarceration rates are much worse than ever before? And the trend is going up. A total of $160 million has been cut from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs. Could the minister explain in detail which services are being cut? Could the minister detail what the assumed impact of the Medicare co-payment measure will be on budgets of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health services? What services will need to be cut if these health services are expected to absorb the costs of the co-payment? Who does the minister or the parliamentary secretary believe could absorb the co-payment for other services directed by the medical practitioner for the patient? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that if the co-payment—described as 'a demand reduction measure' by the Prime Minister—is not absorbed by the health services that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will choose not to get treatment? What are the estimates of the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will take this option? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that this is an impairment to Closing the Gap and to addressing chronic disease? 


Does the parliamentary secretary consider the COAG Reform Council, which was abolished in the budget, as unnecessary red tape? The council reports independently on progress on Closing the Gap and the National Partnership Agreements. The budget papers suggest that it may become the responsibility of PM&C to report on themselves now that the COAG Reform Council has been axed. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm what or who will be the independent mechanism for monitoring and reporting on inter-governmental action to close the gap? Will these reports be publicly available? Or will this be simply a continuation of the alarming trend in the diminution of transparency and accountability of the government?

Overall, the questions that he had concerned a few points, so let me touch on those few points. The most substantial points which the member for Blair asked about were the savings decisions made in the budget.


There is $4.8 billion worth of Indigenous-specific programs for which appropriations are made in this budget over four years. There was a 4.5 per cent savings being made there. That is on the public record and the member for Blair has outlined that. How has that come about and why is this occurring? In part, every portfolio has had to make savings. My friend the member for Kooyong outlined the rationale for that. The public finances were a mess. We are spending $1 billion a month just on the interest payments on the Labor government debt and that is forecast to grow to $3 billion per month, so decisions had to be made across the board to make savings.


In the Indigenous portfolio, what had been occurring over the years was a proliferation of programs, increasing and increasing.




Mr Snowdon:
  Talk about the health funds.




Mr TUDGE:
  From the federal perspective—




Mr Snowdon:
  Talk about the health funds.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Whiteley
):  Order! I warn the member!




Mr TUDGE:
  There were 150 federal programs which were funded. If you went to any particular location you would likely find a similar number at the state level. What that has meant is a proliferation of individual activities and programs at a localised level, sometimes creating a whirlwind of activity of programs but very little progress being made. The Auditor-General looked this at the end of last year and did a case study on the community of Wilcannia. It is a typical community, predominantly Indigenous. He found that in this community of 474 Indigenous people there were 102 funded activities from 18 different agencies and a further 17 activities proposed. So in that place alone there was more than one program per five individuals. 


If you listen to the member for Blair and, indeed, the opposition leader you would think that that is not enough, that we now need one program for one individual, possibly even more. We do not believe that is the case. In fact, what we have suggested through this budget process is that we need to sharpen the focus around a few core areas—school attendance, employment, community safety—and we have to streamline the activity so that as much as possible, from the Commonwealth's perspective, there is a single interface into a community rather than 15 or 30 or 50 interfaces into a community. So this budget does that. The first decision we made in order to facilitate that was to bring the programs from eight different departments into one department, the most important department: the Prime Minister's department. The second decision was to amalgamate 150 separate federal programs into five broad flexible programs. The third decision was that we will be devolving power to the local level so that a local empowered SES officer can negotiate with Indigenous community leaders over what is required in those communities against some of the national priorities which we have.


The effect of this will be to stop having that proliferation of activities of 100 programs in a community of 500 and instead have focused programs with empowered local leaders who can negotiate with a single Commonwealth officer over what is required in those communities. Of course in the process of doing that efficiencies can be made—of course they can because there is an overlap in activities. For example, the Smith Family has 10 individual contracts across Australia. Why do we need 10 contracts there instead of only one or two which could cover all activities? There are things which, frankly, are not working, and those things can be brought to a halt. As we go through these programs over the forward estimates, we will be stopping, evaluating initiatives, funding the ones which are working and halting the ones which are not.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (12:25):  I rise to ask a question of the parliament secretary related to funding, but I will give some background first. It was interesting to listen to the member for Blair asking questions of the parliamentary secretary. His focus was all about money. We know how well they handle money. They are not worried about the outcomes. They are not worried about the health outcomes for Indigenous people. They are not worried about that at all. It is all about money for them. They were never any good at it. 


You focused on education, and you talked about safer communities and effects on the ground. I was up at Alice Springs recently for the Indigenous round of the AFL. Sport and Indigenous people go together hand in hand. One of the outcomes that have been achieved up there—it has not been done by money; it has been work done on the ground—was the introduction of police outside liquor stores during the day. That has resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in violence and a 50 per cent reduction in hospital visits. That is an actual positive outcome. They are the sorts of things that they want on the ground. All you guys worry about is throwing money at it—just wasting it. You do not worry about where it is going.



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Whiteley
):  Order! I ask the member for Lingiari to withdraw that comment.




Mr Snowdon:
  Which one?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You know the one.




Mr IRONS:
  All of them !




Mr Snowdon:
  For you, absolutely.




Mr IRONS:
  As I said before, the importance of sport in Indigenous affairs is well known around Australia. In particular, I would like to discuss the Clontarf football academies. Clontarf is in my electorate of Swan. The Clontarf Foundation was born there, with Gerard Neesham. We all know what he did with the Sydney Swans, Swan Districts and East Fremantle. Now, with the success of his academies, he has this most effective program to encourage Indigenous students to participate in school and sport at the same time. 


I know from my time playing AFL, and being involved with quite a few Indigenous players at East Perth over the years, the importance of it to them and how holistic it is with their total outcomes in life, particularly with some of the junior development programs that are run at the Perth Football Club, where I have been the director for junior development and am currently the patron. Those programs are run hand in hand with the Clontarf academies, encouraging Indigenous participation, particularly from the lower SES areas in my electorate, like Belmont, Lynward, Langford and those types of areas. They are currently looking at a proposal with the West Coast Eagles to have a program which involves developing people socially, holistically, and getting them back not only into sport but into school.


The Clontarf Foundation is responsible for those academies. It was established in 2000, for 25 boys in Waterford, in my electorate. That used to be a place for people from broken homes or orphanages. A gentleman I brought here many years ago said he escaped from there in the 1930s, along with 25 other boys, but they were eventually caught and sent off to other institutions. It was a good story. But Clontarf now have over 55 academies around Australia, with 2,900 students. The aim is to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, leadership and employment prospects of young Aboriginal students. 


You have already highlighted how much of a focus you are putting on that area. The Clontarf program works by using the existing passion that Indigenous boys have for football to attract the boys to school and keep them there. In order for them to remain in the academy, the students must consistently endeavour to attend school regularly, apply themselves to the study of appropriate courses and embrace the academy's requirements for behaviour and self-discipline. Additionally, full-time locally based Clontarf staff mentor and counsel students on a range of behavioural, lifestyle issues to complement the education provided by schools and the AFL aspect provided by the academies.


In the short time you have left, could you outline what funding has been allocated to programs that encourage Indigenous participation in education in the budget, particularly with regard to programs in my electorate of Swan?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:29):  I thank the member for Swan for his question, for his ongoing advocacy for Aboriginal people in his electorate and across Australia, and for his particular commitment to the Clontarf Foundation and the 55 academies which they run across Australia.  The member for Swan emphasised that, if money were the answer to Indigenous disadvantage, we would have solved it by now; there would not be disadvantage. We have had an 80 per cent increase, in real terms, in funding to Indigenous-specific programs over the last 10 years, but many of the indicators have not closed. The Productivity Commission found that we are spending about $44,000 per Indigenous individual on specific programs, and in remote communities it would probably be double that amount. It is clearly not just about money; it is about how the money is invested, how that money is allocated on the ground and what the focus is. And our focus is squarely on those three areas which I identified.


I am pleased to inform the member for Swan that the budget allocated a further $13.4 million to the Clontarf Foundation over the next four years. That will mean that an additional 3,000 boys will get an opportunity to participate in academies across Australia, and that will see almost a doubling of the operation of the Clontarf academies. We are doing this because Clontarf works. Earlier the member for Blair asked, 'What's going on with the budget?' Well, we are backing things which work. The Clontarf Academy is exactly one of those things which we want to back—with an additional $13.4 million.


Last Friday I visited the Bairnsdale Clontarf academy with the member for Gippsland. It was interesting speaking to a few of the graduates from the Bairnsdale academy. I recall one young fellow in particular. When he was 13 or 14 years old, he was effectively dropping out of school. He was attending school on maybe one day per week. He was reflecting that that was going to be his pathway. He was about to exit the school system entirely when he was 13 years old. But, because of the Clontarf academy which had just begun in Bairnsdale, he rejoined school and started attending regularly—in fact, 90 per cent of the time. He then went on and completed several more years of schooling and was assisted by the Clontarf academy into a job at the local Target store in Bairnsdale; he actually had a management role in the back office at Target. He is an outstanding young individual who otherwise would have been off the rails and probably would have been causing a bit of havoc in the community of Bairnsdale. But now he has an important job in the community. It would not surprise me if one day he is running that entire Target store—if he has not got a bigger role within the Wesfarmers Group—because he is a very impressive young man.


We met a number of other young men with very similar stories whose lives were literally transformed because of the work of the Clontarf academy. As the member for Swan knows, the Clontarf Foundation was started in Western Australia at the Clontarf school in the year 2000 by Gerard Neesham, who was the inaugural Dockers coach. I commend his commitment of over 14 years to this process. He and his staff have made a tremendous difference to thousands of boys, and, with this funding, we will hopefully support the work of the Clontarf Foundation to make a tremendous difference to another 3,000 boys over the four years ahead. There will be opportunities for schools to work with the Clontarf Foundation to make bids to provide academies in their electorate.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2014-06-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:00):  I am happy to present and speak to the Treasury portfolio expenditures and appropriations, an important part of the government's economic action strategy.


You have heard it said before, but it is important to make the point again, that we need to implement the economic action strategy to help build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. The budget actually seeks to address some of the what are now uncontested challenges that are part of the financial trajectory that the previous government left for the incoming Abbott government. We have heard the Parliamentary Budget Office make the point about how important the need is for action and timely action. We have even heard the opposition leader acknowledge that there is a task to be dealt with. We have heard other expert commentators describing the need for us to take responsible, modest but thoughtful action now so as to guard against the debt and deficit trajectory that had been left for us by the previous government.


It is important to recognise where we are starting from. There is that joke where they talk about—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  No, no! I would reject any suggestion that Treasury is a joke! They take their work very seriously, and I am appalled to hear from the shadow Treasurer that he is having a go at the Treasury when they do great work—




Mr Bowen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is that the minister misled the House. I said the Treasurer, not the Treasury, and he well knows it.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  There is no point of order.




Mr BILLSON:
  If he could just pay the reasonable courtesy of not interjecting otherwise someone might not hear his shrill interjections clearly! I accept the clarification that the shadow Treasurer has provided—



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  and I apologise if I have in any way mis-characterised his poor-mannered interjection, but that is a discussion for another day!


It is important to remember what the debt and deficit trajectory is that Labor has left for this country and for the incoming government, and how we have had to deal with those budget settings—those expenditure predictions and the debt forecasts—that see us on track, if no action is taken, to accumulate a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion.


For those who are listening, let us round that up to $700 billion—that is, seven with 11 zeroes! It is an extraordinary amount of debt and the nation has little to show for it. It recognises the profligacy and the desire to spend and spend and spend some more, not having to realise that there is a need to finance that expenditure. And where it is expenditure that is not funded by revenues from today, as reflected in the historically large series of deficits that the previous government oversaw, that then incurs expense for the nation, our country and for future generations.


I recognise that Labor may not always have appreciated the harm that it was causing. I do not think it is in anybody's wish or will to disadvantage subsequent generations by being irresponsible in decision making today. I am not suggesting that Labor was consciously aiming to create the problem that it has left for this country. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. But the lesson is clear: we have seen this before. We have seen Labor go down this pathway and leave it for an incoming coalition government to fix the mess: to make sure that we all make a contribution today to build our prospects and our opportunities for the future—to deliver the great promise of our country, and that is opportunity, prospects for a better life and a better quality of life for subsequent generations.


It is now recognised that if action is not taken we are diminishing that prospect and those promises for subsequent generations. So I am pleased to be here to communicate once again not only the case for action but the thoughtfulness in the particular measures that are being presented to this parliament and to the Australian public. As I travel around the country, I am constantly reminded of the call from the citizenry for political leaders that take a longer term view, that speak frankly about the circumstances and canvass the options before our nation, that the parliament does think about building our capacity for the future and is making important decisions today that might not be easy but are crucial to our longer term prospects. That is what the nation and its citizens ask of me, and I am sure that they do of you too, sir. This budget does all of those things. It is not without its challenges to communicate the importance of some of these measures, but it is crucial that we get an understanding across to the Australian public that if we want those better prospects for the future this budget, now the Economic Action Strategy, is to be implemented.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (10:05):  I have a series of questions for the minister. I take the minister to Budget Paper No. 2, page 203, and the changes to pension indexation. Could the minister confirm a saving of $449 million over five years by cutting the indexation rate of the pension and other equivalent payments, for example, the single parent payments? Could the minister provide any further information as to the breakdown of those savings? How much is from the age pension and how much is from carers in particular, and is there any other information the minister may choose to share with the chamber? 


Can the minister indicate to the chamber separately what modelling the government has undertaken on the impact of these changes on individual pensioners? Can the minister confirm a figure by which the government estimates the average pensioner would have been worse off had these changes not been implemented? Particularly, can the minister confirm that if these changes had been implemented, for example, for the past four years, an average age pensioner might be $1,500 a year worse off? Has the government undertaken that analysis and does the minister have the view that that analysis might inform the impact on the average pensioner of these changes going forward?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,BILLS,18,2,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2014-06-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:06):  The budget paper outlines the broad impact of the adjustment to the indexation measure to see it adjusted to the kind of indexation Labor introduced for the family payments arrangement. In no respect, in no way and with no reasonable characterisation is it a cut to anything. What it reflects is an ongoing commitment for a twice-yearly adjustment to our pension rates to give confidence and certainty for those who are reliant upon that income support that it will increase with the cost of living to maintain its buying power into the future. What is crucial about this budget is that it seeks to recognise the importance of the safety net, of the social security system and of the range of programs aimed to properly support the vulnerable, those who have already made their contribution to the economy and those who have particular needs for which we as a generous society should be providing. So in the budget it characterises what the adjustment in the rate of increase will mean in an aggregate sense. 


To carry out the analysis that the shadow Treasurer is speaking about, one would need to include all of the ins and outs. I think that the shadow minister would agree that in terms of the average savings to households from the abolition of the carbon tax—something Labor says that it is in favour of terminating but when it comes to this parliament it chooses not to carry through those statements in public—we know that it is on average a $550 benefit. We also know that if Labor continues to obstruct the abolition of the carbon tax, the rate of the carbon tax will actually increase at from 1 July. 


So what we have done with this measure is not cut pensions. We have adjusted the rate at which the pension will continue to increase twice annually. We have also left in place the so-called compensation that was available when the carbon tax was implemented. That compensation, important in its terms of an increase to these fortnightly payments, remains. Our ambition is not only to take the carbon tax out and therefore reduce those cost-of-living pressures on households of all types, but also to leave the so-called compensation in place. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Order! Sorry, Minister. You cannot just wander around the chamber like that. You should come through the right doors and go to your right seating area. This is not your chamber.




Mr BILLSON:
  So that is our strategy: take those cost-of-living pressures off households, maintain the buying power of the pensions through an ongoing twice-yearly indexation, change the rate at which it increases and therefore ensure that the very benefits that are important to the vulnerable and to those that have already made their contribution to our nation are in fact not vulnerable themselves because of our inability to finance them into the future. 


In summary, I think those relying on the payments that are addressed on page 203 of Budget Paper No. 2 can be confident that their interests have been reflected. The net impact of the adjustment in the rate of increase of those pensions is captured in that table. To delve into a household by household analysis beyond what has already been published would involve a lot of analysis of other measures in the budget that are designed to improve the situation of households, take pressure off the costs of living and help build that strong, safe and secure economy and nation that we are working to achieve.

Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:10):  Eden-Monaro is a rural electorate and it depends heavily on small business as an employer in the region. In fact, in regional Australia, after you go past schools and government agencies providing services in rural towns, it is the private sector in terms of the small business community that is the principal employer. We have recently come into government. We have unemployment problems across the Eden-Monaro region. For example, in the Eurobodalla Shire we have an unemployment rate that is above seven per cent, which is way above the national average. Indeed, part of that problem is people employed by small businesses have lost their jobs. We are seeing that across regional towns in the Eurobodalla, Bega Valley, Bombala, Cooma-Monaro and Palerang shires in particular.


Minister, I understand that across the nation some 519,000 jobs were lost in small business over the last six years, which is a very distressing fact. The government is putting in place an economic action strategy that I understand will help secure some one million jobs in the next five years and potentially two million jobs in the next 10 years. Part of that will be the abolition of the carbon tax. I was in Cooma last week and visited a florist. When people talk about the carbon tax they do not often think about florists, but they were very significantly hit by the carbon tax because refrigeration is a very important part of the work of a florist. They were urging me to ensure that the carbon tax was abolished in this term of parliament.


I want to understand your comments with respect to the carbon tax abolition and the importance that has for small business right across the Australian nation. The other thing I want you to potentially make some remarks on is the significant review of competition policy that has been announced by the government and is being funded in the current budget. Can you give us an explanation of the progress of that competition review? Indeed, I also note in the Treasury portfolio that funding will be there also for changes to the franchising code of conduct, which is another very important thing for a number of small businesses in my electorate. Minister, I pitch you those questions and I look forward to the answers.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:13):  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his ongoing interest and commitment to small businesses and family enterprises that are the engine room of our economy. I joined the member at a small business forum in Batemans Bay. It was fabulously well attended. The message was clear: 'We understand the need for the Economic Action Strategy, so get on with it.' 'Get on with it' was the clear message that was coming through, as people were looking for a predictable, stable and dependable economic setting and conduct by the Commonwealth government. They want stability, predictability and certainty in the environment in which they are making decisions to mortgage their house, to take risk, to employ and to grow and develop their business. This is what, I am pleased to say, our economic action strategy in the budget seeks to deliver. We are keen not to have that strategy impeded. That is why getting the carbon tax through is so crucial to ensuring that that improved economic environment is available for our creators of wealth and opportunity, the small business people.


The member talked about the 519,000 jobs in small business—an awfully large number—that were lost under the previous Labor government. They seem not to want to talk about or recognise that. Maybe it is because they might not be union jobs or they are not all in one location. This represents a real hit to the wealth creators, those courageous men and women who mortgage their house and sometimes place their sanity and personal wellbeing at risk as they toil in a difficult economic climate to create a livelihood for themselves, for others and for their community. 


We are seeking to arrest that decline in small business employment. It accounted for 53 per cent of the private-sector workforce when the Howard government left office. But after Labor was recently tossed out, and a change was called for Australian small business men and women, it is down to 42 per cent of the private-sector workforce. Those are the circumstances we have inherited. The clear message from my travels around the country and in my own community is, 'Please, no more of the same.' The last thing they want from an incoming government is more of what they had under Labor.


In the budget there are a range of measures. The member for Eden-Monaro, who is very alert and attuned to these issues, went to the issue of the carbon tax. The carbon tax hurts and punishes small business in a very particular and pernicious way. With all the carve-outs and hush money—the compensation that was made available by the previous government to abate the harm and the hurt of the carbon tax—small business got no direct compensation. In this chamber, they were told to 'suck it up or pass it on'—I think that was the term used. There was not a moment of appreciation from the previous Labor government of just how difficult the economic climate was, of how hard it is to simply pass on costs in a marketplace where we need to be world class, where there are cost-conscious consumers, where we need to build confidence, build spending power, remove cost-of-living pressures and reduce the costs of doing business.


The member for Eden-Monaro also touched on florists, which is a very good example. The carbon tax plays its evil impact through the florists. Those opposite think florists do not need to worry about the carbon tax. But florists have refrigeration costs. Who can forget R404 gas, which, because of its CO2 equivalence, went up in price by some 400 per cent? Small businesses have shown me fridges that they used to operate that needed to be repaired. Because of the cost impact of the carbon tax, they choose not to repair those fridges. And then there are energy costs—the costs of keeping the lights on. You see this right across the economy—and it compounds. Labor said they did not want a carbon tax. They promised they would not implement it—but they did. And now they want to terminate it—but they will not. This tax just builds and builds all the way through the supply chain. In regional communities such as Eden-Monaro, if Labor had their way, the carbon tax would be extended to heavy road transport. 


As a legacy of Labor, the carbon tax is currently legislated to go up again on 1 July. My advice would be to speak with your local small businesses, as I do, and remind them that we are doing our utmost to get rid of the carbon tax, to energise enterprise in this economy and to get rid of those headwinds and burdens that are slowing the growth and potential of small business. Our work is to turn around the harm of six years of Labor. We are keeping at that. We can say to our constituents: 'We know what our plan is and we want to get on with it. Labor are not only the cause of the harm but are now standing in the road of the remedies as well.'

I put it to him again: does the government have modelling on the impact of the change of the indexation on pensioners? The minister referred to the 'evil' carbon tax and other matters, but that is not what the question refers to. My question simply refers to the change in the indexation of the age pension and other pension payments. Budget Paper No. 2, at page 203, indicates savings of $449 million over the next five years by changing the way of indexing the pension. Let me put this to the minister very clearly and in a very straightforward fashion: can the minister confirm that this is $449 million that pensioners will not be receiving, that will be cut from their income?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:19):  I can happily again run through the numbers that are there on the page—the numbers identifying what the change in the rate of increase in pensions means in budget terms. We have been through that. 


The former Treasurer is so proud of his work that his ALP website does not even mention he was the former Treasurer. It is quite bizarre. It talks about 'non-this' and 'non-that'. He seems to have been a non-Treasurer, according to his own published material. Putting the Labor Party website—and the non-ness we are seeing from Labor—to one side, the adjustments in the rate of increase, the twice annual rate of increase, to those pension payments are clearly there on page 203 of  Budget Paper No. 2. The numbers are there. 


The shadow Treasurer then went on to talk about what the household impact was and I quite reasonably pointed to there being other influences on the net household impact that Labor wants to ignore. The Labor way is to look at important issues and the strategy for our nation through a straw. All they want to look at is the little microspot at the end of the straw. They do not want to take into account the other changes, the other measures, the action we are taking to remove cost-of-living pressures by repealing Labor's pernicious carbon tax—which is going up again on 1 July.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  They joke about it over here. They have not taken a moment to analyse the impact of the carbon tax on households across Australia—not to mention the impact on the small business community, whom they have loaded up with this burden. It is lead in the saddlebag and an impediment to the prospects of small businesses, preventing them from growing employment and economic opportunities in this country. They are not the slightest bit interested in that. They come in here wanting to talk about a part of the budget that addresses a section of our community that has been frightened by the Labor Party's shrill exaggerations and negativity, by what I think has been a very one-sided critique from Labor. They have not sought to look at the other budget measures aimed at improving and enhancing the security and situation of those the Labor Party is talking about. 


If the shadow Treasurer wants to talk about impacts, we should talk about all of the impacts. That is what my answer was about—that is about being honest and frank with people. That is the contrast between this budget and the fiction and fudged numbers we saw with Labor's budgets. They promised these rivers of revenue, not realising that the nominal growth rate was not inextricably linked to a growth in company tax. 


I remember, as we travelled around Western Australia, hearing from small businesses about how difficult the economy was under Labor, about how many of them were trading in a profitless environment. All they had to do was show an interest in what was going on in the economy and Labor, when in government, would have known their budget was fiction. They would have known simply by listening to people who have a lot of skin in the game—people with mortgaged houses and people who spend every waking moment thinking about their enterprise. 


This budget is truthful, it is dependable, the figures are robust, and the growth trajectories and some of the key assumptions have—unlike anything Labor has done—been consistent through two economic statements in a row. This is the difference between this budget and the ones that Labor introduced. The numbers are dependable and reliable. What the shadow Treasurer did not want to talk about was important measures to support those who are on income support, measures to optimise their future opportunities, measures aimed at helping them get back into work and improve their own circumstances. These include incentives such as the Restart program, fabulously important for unemployed people over the age of 50.



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  He is heckling again. He thinks politics is a footy game and that it helps if you heckle loudly. But it does not strengthen your arguments. You can keep doing it, but it does not strengthen your arguments. 


Coming back to those mature age job seekers who have been out of work for some time, there is a $10,000 incentive through the Restart program. It says to employers, particularly small business employers, 'If you are thinking about recruiting one more person, recognise the experience, the wisdom, the workplace know-how and the capacity of mature age people.' Here is an incentive for those mature age people to get back into the economy, to be able to make an economic contribution if they are in a position to do so. There are a range of very positive measures in this budget. I commend those measures. What I am hearing as I travel around Australia is that people are hungry for the facts. When you give them the facts that are in the budget, they recognise the need for action. They understand that we are all making a contribution and they are encouraging us to continue to think about the future and prepare for it.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (10:24):  I would like to thank the Minister for Small Business for his wonderful advocacy for the small business sector during his term in the portfolio, both in opposition and now in government. It is interesting to reflect that for six years of the previous government, and now in our current term in government, we have had the same person in this portfolio. I think the previous government had six ministers. It has provided the small to medium business sector with consistent representation and a consistent voice. This is a very important segment of our economy. As touched on earlier, six years ago it employed some 53 per cent of the workforce and it is now down to 43 per cent. But more importantly, in my electorate of Forde it employs a very large proportion of our workforce. There are small to medium businesses in construction, manufacturing and retail, and we have some 7½ thousand of those small businesses.


The minister was recently at one of our chamber breakfasts, which was greatly appreciated. One telling thing at that breakfast was when those businesses were asked if they would employ another person if red tape, regulation, the carbon tax and other imposts from the previous government were taken away and they almost unanimously said yes. We took 23 terrific policies to the election that we are now rolling out. Minister, this is a great opportunity for you to inform the House about how the initiatives outlined in our election policies and commitments are going to strengthen small businesses, not only in my electorate of Forde but also in the nation more generally.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:27):  I thank the member for Forde for not only his insightful contribution but also his chairmanship of our small business policy committee. He has been a champion of small business right throughout his life. Here is a member of the coalition whose entire life, privately in a professional capacity and publicly, has been an agent of support, encouragement, counsel and assistance for the small business men and women of our country. I commend him for his lifetime of service to this important sector.


Now in public office that work continues. It was the contribution of the member for Forde, the member for Eden-Monaro and the three amigos from Tasmania that helped shape the comprehensive small business policy that we took to the last election. In comparison Labor promised more of the same, and we know that was the last thing that the small business community wanted. This budget actually energises and resources the implementation of a vast number of those election commitments. We have said to the Australian public and to those small business men and women who risk so much and who show great courage to create opportunities for themselves and for others and livelihoods in their communities, your interests are too big and too important to ignore. It was a cry that we heard from the chamber movement, an understandable reflection of the revolving door of previous ministers with the name 'small business' often tacked to a long list of other things. We do not take it that way. My primary focus every day is on small business.


I am pleased that the Prime Minister has understood the importance of the small business community. The small business portfolio is not only included in cabinet and not distracted by a shopping list of other responsibilities but now embraced in the economic policy powerhouse of the Commonwealth—that is, the Treasury. So many of the policy settings that are shaped in Treasury create that entrepreneurial ecosystem that we talked about earlier that helps people decide whether they employ, invest, recruit and expand. Many of those measures are shaped within Treasury. I am pleased to join with Joe Hockey as a cabinet minister in that portfolio.


We understand the importance of the abolition of the carbon tax. There are billions of dollars of impost on our small business men and women. For those who are competing for opportunities here against importers, or who are seeking to grow their markets in overseas countries as exporters, this acts as a reverse tariff. It is lead in the saddlebag. I mentioned in the House our Socceroos last night taking on an extraordinary Dutch team—and your divided loyalties must have been troubling last night—but imagine if our team, in their Nike soccer boots, had five or six kilograms of lead in each of their boots and to keep up with some of those svelte and handsome Dutchman, like yourself, Sir, in the World Cup competition. We know that would be unfair. So we know that that is unfair in sport as it is in life. It is in our economy as well. That is why we want to abolish the carbon tax.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Randall
):  No, we will have order in here!




Mr BILLSON:
  You touched on the red tape reduction initiative—a billion dollars of red tape reduction, not just for the life of the government but each year. What a real discipline and challenge that is. Why? Because Labor thought what all small businesses wanted to do each day was wake up in the morning and wonder what the government wanted them to do for it next—what compliance or regulatory impost could they turn their minds to! It seemed to be what Labor thought small businesses had front of mind, when they really wanted to grow their businesses. That is a crucial area of our work.


We have particular measures to fix the ACCC. We heard from the chairperson what a 'diabolical'—they were his words—financial position they were in. The shadow Treasurer, who once had responsibility for the ACCC, seemed completely disinterested, happy to have them technically insolvent before Christmas last year and on track to run out of cash in March. How on earth does that build confidence for consumers and small business?


We are implementing our commitment for unfair contract terms protections, extending that to small business transactions, whom, like individual consumers—



An opposition member interjecting—  




Mr BILLSON:
  'How's it going?' Why? Because there is no interest. We have not heard a peep from Labor about that. Implementing the franchising reforms; making sure our procurement changes give small business a chance; implementing the drought support package, crucial for small businesses operating in farming communities; our Paid Parental Leave scheme, what a great measure to give small businesses the same opportunity to recruit that government and the big corporates have; the Emissions Reduction Fund, a chance for small businesses to participate in that; the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, a role with tools and teeth. There are so many opportunities. We are implementing our policies. I just wish Labor would get out of the road.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:32):  We can only be glad that this show is appearing all this week and next. I want to ask a number of questions of the minister at the table. First, the budget provides hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to multinationals by delaying the reforms to the Offshore Banking Unit, $180 million; and deferring the start date of the legislative elements to improve tax compliance through third-party reporting and data-matching, $113 million. Minister, why has the government given $1.1 billion back to multinationals while ripping money away from pensioners and low-income Australians? 


Secondly, does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's comments that the reintroduction of indexation of the fuel excise will 'act like a carbon tax'? Given the comments of the Prime Minister in the United States that the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation will act like a carbon tax, has Treasury conducted any modelling of the impact of fuel excise indexation on Australia's carbon emissions and, if not, why not? 


Since the minister has not only told us that if we abolish the carbon price we will win the World Cup but also that it is evil, I wonder if he might tell us what adjective he would best use to describe the indexation of fuel excise, which, as the Prime Minister has said, acts like a carbon tax. Would it be 'immoral', 'wicked', 'unholy', 'sinful', 'ignoble', 'base', 'dishonourable', 'villainous', 'nefarious', 'sinister', 'vicious', 'malicious', 'demonic', 'devilish', 'diabolical', 'fiendish', or maybe simply 'black hearted'? And, Minister, why do the cuts to research and development tax incentive commence on 1 July 2014 when the reduction in the company tax rate, which it is purported to offset, does not commence until 1 July 2015?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:34):  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. Wasn't it a surprise—he did not ask about co-payments! He's got form on that, hasn't he? Higher education co-payments—he has form on that as well. There are so many things he is not able to talk about. And that is probably why we got a professorial thesaurus articulation to fill out some of the time! There are so many areas of this budget where the member for Fraser simply cannot go. He has form. If he was being principled in his articulations at that time, you would have thought he would be one of the strongest advocates for many of the measures in this budget. But he chose not to talk about those things for which he has form. He chose to talk about some other changes.


He talked about the fuel indexation changes. In fact, I have just introduced legislation into the House to reintroduce fuel indexation in precisely the form introduced by the Hawke Labor government. But what is different about our approach is that we have implemented that measure to ensure that we can fund the nation's biggest infrastructure program. Going back to my earlier point: in my community and as I travel around the country, I consistently hear the call for a longer term view. They would like to see more of the resources that come to the Commonwealth being put into building our capacity and opportunity for the future, not going into consumption. They are concerned that we are borrowing $1 billion a month to finance what is essentially consumption expenditure. That $1 billion a month would be set to go up to $2.8 billion a month if Labor's policy settings were put in place. Yet they were not seeing the investment in our productive capacity as a nation. So we have introduced this measure to go some way towards funding $26 billion of road infrastructure projects, to build that infrastructure and productive capability for the 21st century economy. 


Why is it important? In Melbourne, we want to see the East West Link constructed. Labor have been all over the shop. I was going to say they have been talking out each side of the pie hole, but I thought that might have been taken as a slight against the Leader of the Opposition. They have been all over the place. I am not sure if they are for it or against it. But the communities that I represent know they are for it. That is because infrastructure like the East West Link has the capacity not only to support commuters but also to support commerce. It will support commerce in the direct construction phase and then in the ability of our economy to function through these infrastructure arteries—an important development—and the indexation that goes with it. What I am seeing and hearing is a call for that kind of infrastructure investment. But people also want to know that the funding of it can be sustained. That is why we have moved to reactivate the very indexation measure that Labor introduced. It will be interesting to see where they go with that. 


The question then went to the carbon tax. I am not sure whether the member for Fraser is aware of it—he may have been writing a book or something at the time—but, under his team, the carbon tax is set to increase again from 1 July and, under Labor's policy articulation, it was to be extended to heavy road transport. If he followed this and did the analysis that he claims he does on some of his work in a professorial mode, he would know that the indexation of fuel excise has no net effect at all on off-road uses or on heavy transport for vehicles over 4½ tonnes. Why? Because they are offset; it does not amount to a tax that cascades, builds and grows through the economy. So his analysis that this is somehow the same as the carbon tax is patently wrong. In those productive areas of the economy—for off-road uses of the fuels that are covered by the fuel tax and excise regime and for on-road heavy vehicle uses—there is no impact. There is a net improvement because we have simplified the way in which those transactions of excise are calculated—they are rebated and there are road transport charges—so it was not down to the three decimal points that those opposite would love. The member for Fraser might love a third decimal point, but we think one decimal point is perfectly adequate. So those analogies are simply not relevant. 


If the member for Fraser is concerned about cost impacts on our economy and on households, then the honourable, thoughtful and analytical thing to do is get behind the abolition of the carbon tax. That is what he promised his citizens: that he was going to terminate the tax. No, Labor is running a protection racket for its carbon tax; it is set to go up from 1 July and, if their policy musings are to be believed, they want to extend it to heavy road transport as well.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (10:39):  I declare an interest first of all. Up until very recently my wife was a small business owner. She has relinquished herself of that nevertheless quite profitable burden and is now seeking an alternative business. I would like to follow up on a question that I asked the minister in question time the other day. It was in respect of the nearly 8,000 small businesses in my electorate of Lyons. I was replaying the question there because it was an excellent answer from the minister. In the question I did compliment the government on the fact that we now have the Minister for Small Business in cabinet. That is a really important initiative. It was a commitment that we went to the election with.


We made a number of commitments in the lead-up to the election. I would like the minister to reflect on those and then answer some of my specific questions. In relation to paid parental leave, can the minister contextualise the productivity benefits that flow to small business being able to compete with the Public Service and big business on a level playing field and how that initiative is a piece of economic policy as opposed to a welfare measure? 


My other specific question relates to one of the commitments we gave—and the minister has already commented on this, and I appreciate that—about a root and branch review of the competition policy in this country. That commitment was part of our 10-point plan to support small business that we took to the election in September. We said we would commit to a review of the competition framework to ensure the Australian law and policy settings promote a vibrant, competitive market in the economy and ensure small business is given a fair go. My question relates specifically to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which relates to the misuse of power. I note the comment you made before with respect to funding. Was it an issue of funding under the previous administration that removed the capacity of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act to be used in the way that I think those who designed the act always intended it to be? 


Those are my two specific questions. If I have an opportunity later on, I will probably have more.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:42):  I thank the member for Lyons. There are 7,800 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Lyons was reflecting on a question he asked in the House. There are a couple things I would like to add to that. It has been some 200 days since anyone from Labor has asked me a question. Is small business of such little interest to Labor that they do not think it is worthy? I do not know how many questions we would have had over that sitting period, but it must be in the hundreds. It seems quite extraordinary. It is very instructive that, amongst those hundreds of questions since about mid-November, there has not been one question from Labor about anything to do with small business. That is quite extraordinary. 


In contrast to that the member for Lyons asked a very good question. If I can draw from my earlier comments, some measures I have already touched upon—and I will not spend too much time on them again: the abolition of the carbon tax is crucial, the red tape reduction measure is very significant and having small business considerations front and centre in the big decisions and all the analytical work of Treasury is crucial as part of that proper recognition and respect that small business people need. 


The member for Lyons is absolutely right: the Paid Parental Leave scheme is a very important measure at so many levels. It is about ensuring that those people eligible for the coalition's Paid Parental Leave scheme can have their wage replacement set as the level for those payments. Why? I get feedback all the time from my own community and as I travel that if a family wishes to both pursue their economic objectives, through jobs, careers and engagement in the economy, and have a family it can be very difficult indeed. For many households two incomes are actually needed to meet the mortgage costs and the ongoing expenses of that household. And at a time when a family may have a newborn—a micro-human to care for—those costs just do not dramatically and miraculously overnight default back to some minimum wage level. They do not do that; those cost structures are still there. They need to meet the mortgage costs; they are still there. Those living expenses continue.


Yet, we see far more generous paid parental leave schemes in government, in the public sector, than any small business employer could ever dream of offering. We see this in major corporates as well, so it seemed to be right and appropriate for some contributors to the economy to have access to that kind of benefit. But Labor wants to obstruct a very positive measure to see that same kind of support available to the people operating in our small businesses and family enterprises. Where is the justice in that? Where is the honour? Where is the principle? Where is the consistency, that some working in big corporates and the public sector can get a benefit that Labor wants to deny to those people who are operating in the small business economy?


It is simply unjust to take that inequitable position, and that is why we have moved to implement a scheme that is perfect for small business: available to their workplaces and to those who are juggling the tasks of economic goals for themselves and their families, and also raising that family. For the first time, small businesses will be able to operate on a level playing field with the public sector and large businesses when it comes to offering those employment benefits to be able attract and recruit the very best people for their businesses.


It is about equity. It is about participation; encouraging people to see that there is a pathway to juggling those crucial dual objectives of economic wellbeing and prospects for a family. It is also being funded in a way that is fair and just. We took to the last election a 1½ per cent reduction in the company tax rate. Now, I know that only one-third of small businesses are actually structured as companies so for that 800,000 that is some promise of an encouragement and an incentive to grow and to be profitable in the future.


But this is not funded by the small companies. This is funded by the most profitable companies, which will not have that 1½ per cent company tax cut reduction within the window we have announced as a policy. This is really important; it is a measure that is funded in a sustainable way and it is a measure that is available to small business.


I would love to talk about the root-and-branch review, but there is so much to talk about! The root-and-branch review is something that Labor would not go near. They are happy to snarl and snigger and carry on about the problems but do nothing about it. Why? Because they only talk to big business and big unions, and this is about giving efficient businesses, big and small, a fair go, and I hope that I get the chance to speak further— Time expired)

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (10:47):  Actually, in answer to a question that the minister asked: we have asked lots and lots of questions on small business, and related to small business. We have just asked people who might be able to give us an answer! That is the only difference.


But there is no doubt that the budget is having an immediate impact on the Australian economy and hence small business in Australia. The latest Westpac index of consumer confidence, in fact, shows the results of surveys taken after the Abbott government's budget; it fell sharply by 6.8 per cent in May. Perhaps the minister would like to explain why that is the case, since they are supposed to be the doyens of all knowledge and assistance for small business. Perhaps he could also explain why almost 60 per cent of the respondents in the Westpac survey said that the budget would make it tougher on family finances in the next 12 months and hence make it tough on small business as well?


The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence survey showed that following the Abbott government's budget, consumer confidence had fallen 14 per cent since April. That is the fastest rate since the financial crisis. Now, that is pretty telling. And weekend reports from property analysts show sharp falls are being felt in the economy, with house prices in Australia's capital cities falling for the first time in 12 months. The RP Data index suggests that there is a strong correlation between consumer confidence levels and housing market activity, again, as a result of the very bad and chaotic budget of the Abbott government. So consumer confidence is falling—that is confirmed. And it is not Labor saying that, that is independent analysis.


Meanwhile, the Minister for Small Business makes massive cuts in the budget—directly cuts funding for small business. He cuts funding for skills and training programs which, as the minister would know himself, are one of the big issues for small business. That comes up in every survey and every time you talk to small business. They want funding for skills and training programs. The minister cuts what small business needs the most. He also has cut billions from tax benefits directly for small business and then tries to blame somebody else. If his cuts then have an effect on jobs, he tries to find somebody else to blame. It could not possibly be all the cuts that this minister and the Abbott government have made. When is the government actually going to take some responsibility rather than just look pious?


There are approximately 2.1 million small businesses in Australia employing roughly five million Australians. There are figures we all know, but these are figures that very few understand—perhaps even this minister knows the data but just does not understand what it means. On Labor's watch, we were quite happy to acknowledge the data and the circumstances. I felt proud that we created the conditions for small business to grow—because in fact, that is exactly what happened—based on estimates of employment by business size and the changes in the number of people employed between 2007 and 2013. I think the minister is slightly aware of this. Maybe he should try to explain this, because I am using the same dataset he likes to use. 


Perhaps he could try to explain why large business—they are business too—grew from around 2.6 million to 3.4 million under Labor's watch. Just an explanation: how is that possible? That is 757,000 additional people, 757,000 additional jobs, which is an annual percentage increase of 4.3 per cent. Once he tries to explain that, he might perhaps try to explain further how medium and small businesses grew from around 1.9 million up to 2.7 million. That is an increase of additional people, real people, new jobs, real jobs—822,000. 


Then he could probably try to explain this—and this is the figure he likes the most; the one he likes to quote. But he does not quite tell people this: non-employing business saw an annual change over that period, a transfer, albeit small. It is only 1.8 per cent over a six-year period. That is quite small. But it is the figure that the minister likes to quote, the 519,000 jobs. But, funnily enough, it is only in the non-employing small business. Where did those so-called jobs—because if they are not employing anyone you are assuming it is just the person who is the business, non-employing as the data shows—go? They went to medium and small business. Isn't that what it should always be about? Isn't that what we all want? Don't we want non-employing business to employ someone? Don't we want them to get out of that category and move up to the next category and grow? Because that is what Labor did: grow jobs and business.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (10:52):  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I am happy to help him with his understanding of the figures. I know there is probably not really any authoritative voice amongst his colleagues who could explain these figures to him. But I am happy to do that, because I am always happy to provide good service wherever I am able to. 


He talked about the changing employment numbers and sought to extract certain elements of that ABS table that did not suit his argument. It is quite simple. If you carve out bits that are unhelpful, you will probably get a different answer to the ones that reasonably depict the livelihoods that are available within small businesses employing 19 and under people. That is what the ABS data says. That ABS data, including all those that fall within the small business category, will be microbusiness, home based businesses, all important businesses, and it includes self-employment and non-employing businesses. There is nothing wrong with that. We think there is nothing wrong with people who choose their own pathway to achieve a livelihood. We know Labor has a different view. That is why you have seen this coordinated attack on independent contractors and self-employed people. 


Again, this is borne out by the question today. He does not even want to talk about non-employing businesses. A non-employing business is still a livelihood, and a livelihood matters. A livelihood in a small business matters, even if it is not employing somebody and is a sole operator. We do not need to be reminded by Labor how indifferent they are to those courageous men and women who mortgage their houses, who take risks to create opportunities for themselves. You just brush them away as if they do not count. A non-employing small business matters. 


There were a stack more of them before you guys got into office. There are so many fewer of them now. We are still seeing a recovery—which is needed—now that you have gone, because there is now confidence that the government are on the side of small-business men and women, that we are an ally, that we are an advocate. We are not an adversary like you guys were. Five hundred and nineteen thousand jobs were lost in small business. That is 519,000 livelihoods. If you want to carve them off and say that because they are not employing somebody they do not count, shame on you. Shame on you! Do not come into this place masquerading as if you care when you have such a disdain for people who are running their own business but happen not to be employing anybody.


We want to see them grow. We want to see them prosper. We want to see them thrive. And that is why we have the comprehensive policy package to deliver that outcome. That is what we have. That is what we are working for. That is what is different about the coalition, the Liberal-National parties. Labor say: 'If you're self-employed or you're a small business and you don't employ anybody, you don't matter. We'll just take you off the data. We'll just not even think about you, and we'll concoct another piece of fiction like the budgets to try and argue a narrow, hollow, self-serving case'—which ignores the very interests of people who deserved a whole lot more respect from Labor when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government were in office. If they have learnt nothing, we just saw evidence of it today. They have still learnt nothing. Show a bit of respect for those people who mortgage their houses.


The member did not care to talk about the extra 200,000 people who were added to the unemployment lists under Labor. He chose not to talk about those. He chose not to go to the insolvency numbers that are there. He chose not to go to business formation numbers. He chose to cherry-pick some of the consumer surveys that are out there and the confidence surveys—where the message coming back to me time and time again is that people are less troubled by the facts of the budget when the facts are shared with them. What some of those sentiment indexes are reflecting is the shrill, over-the-top, scaremongering of Labor, who, through their actions and their dishonesty, are ripping out of people's livelihoods and their plans for the future the confidence and optimism that we are focused, every day, on building for them so that we have a strong and prosperous economy, so that people can be safe and secure about their future prospects, so that those small businesses not employing—so disdained by Labor—might choose to become an employing small business.


That is why we have made changes in the area of Fair Work, to provide some guidance and support tools for that non-employing small business to encourage them and assist them to make that decision about a new recruitment. There is a direct helpline in to Fair Work. It is not like Labor's, where you used to disclose the facts of your case and they reserved the right to prosecute you.


These are some of the practical measures that are part of our comprehensive plan to restore the jobs lost in the small-business economy under Labor, to rebuild confidence and optimism about the prospects into the future. I say to every small business, every family enterprise, even those that are non-employing and disdained by Labor: you all matter. You are valued and respected by the coalition. You are the engine room of the economy. We know that Labor took a cylinder or two out of the engine. We want to get that performance back because it is crucial to our future prospects.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:58):  I would like to address some issues to the Minister for Small Business and thank him for recently visiting the electorate of Swan on two occasions to talk to small businesses and a business incubation group down in Kensington. I know that the member for Oxley was also in Swan not long ago representing that Labor were actually interested in businesses. As someone who has been in small business since 1981 and has been through the period of both Labor and Liberal governments, I know that Labor are no friend of small business—never have been, never will be. They just do not get it. They stand up there all time saying, 'We're the friends of small business.' What an absolute joke.


In the 30 years I have been in business, it has been very plain to anyone in small business. No-one I know in the small business association stands up and says: 'Give us a Labor government. We want a Labor government for small business.' Who says that? The Labor Party says it. The unions say it. But it is certainly not said by businesses. Businesses do not say, 'We want a Labor government,' I can tell you. We only need to look at the royal commission. That gives you a perfect example of how unions and the Labor Party treat small businesses. That is all the stuff that is coming out now. They had Western Australia. I know there were times in Western Australia in the construction industry, where my background is, where many small businesses paid thousands and thousands of dollars to unions and to ALP fronts—even training fronts. That is coming out now, isn't it?


I heard the member for Oxley mention training programs. There is one in Welshpool that for years has been taking money from small businesses. If you go there, there are no training programs, but they are still getting the money. They are still being paid by the small business people, who are blackmailed or put into situations where they are supposed to be paying for non-existent training programs. I know that small business has enormous compliance costs as well, so I will ask the minister—since we are running out of time—what real changes are being made by the coalition to assist small business?

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (11:00):  The measures being implemented by the Abbott government are so comprehensive that I will not have time to run through them all. But I am happy to go through many of the elements that are important to the member for Swan. He talked about skills training. Of course, there is the Industry Skills Fund, which is designed to provide particular support to meet the training needs of small businesses. We have the Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Fund, which is another important measure tailored and targeted for smaller enterprises, to help them bring their ideas to market and to collaborate with researchers. There are so many good measures.


We are continuing our advisory service program. There are no cuts to that funding, in an important effort to better target those so that we get the help we need. There is also the issue of engagement with technology. We know how it can be for small businesses to be a part of the technology world to access new markets and opportunities. There is also support for exporters—a better targeting of the Export Market Development Grants facility. We are making sure that EFIC, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, has its systems geared to the needs of small business.


There are so many things building possibilities, capacity and opportunities through the small business community. That is why we need to pass this budget. We need to fix the budget to strengthen the economy and to build a strong and prosperous economy that provides livelihoods and opportunities for a safe and secure future that supports small business and that re-energises enterprise. That is why I am thrilled to commend these budget measures to you.


The other measures that are available include improving small business access to contracts. One thing that Labor did was spend money like there was no tomorrow, but they did not actually give small business a fighting chance to win that work. Other important measures include the unfair contracts provisions and implementing franchising reforms—something that Labor would not touch. It was like kryptonite. They would not go near it until—what?—five minutes from the election, when all of a sudden they got interested. We are actually doing the work that is needed. I commend these budget measures and urge this parliament to get behind the implementation of our economic action strategy.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the minister. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio be agreed to.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:03):  It is a great pleasure to join my colleague, the member for Aston—the unnaturally handsome, member for Aston—and to follow the unnaturally talented member for Dunkley in what was a very persuasive and powerful defence of the changes that he has undertaken in his Small Business and Treasury portfolio.


We are here today not to defend a very good budget but to inform you about why the budget that has just been announced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is in the best interests of the Australian people. This budget does two things. This budget, first and foremost, pays back Labor's debt—$667 billion of Labor's debt. That was the legacy of those opposite to the Australian people. Through measures in this budget, over the next 10 years we will reduce expenditure by nearly $300 billion.


The member for Rankin should know this, because he was part of a government that led to a record increase in government spending. We want to be part of a government that is much more responsible when it comes to budgetary measures. So we will save the Australian taxpayer up to $16 billion a year in the interest bill alone as a result of these measures—up to $16 billion a year. That is as much as a WestConnex project. That is as much as an East West Link. It is as much as an NDIS. It is as much as Gonski. That is just the interest bill we will save as a result of measures in this budget.


The second thing we will do as a result of this budget measures is lay a foundation for more jobs, higher growth and increased productivity. When it comes to those measures, first and foremost, there has been a record government expenditure on infrastructure: some $50 billion in new funding for infrastructure, which will in turn lead to up to $125 billion in state, private sector and federal government expenditure. This includes putting money on the table to incentivise the states to recycle their infrastructure. This is a record amount of government spending.


The third thing we will do is invest record amounts in education and innovation. The Medical Research Future Fund will be—and is already becoming, in terms of its ambitious proposal—the envy of the world: some $20 billion in funding for medical research, an area of natural expertise in Australia. We want to deregulate our university sector, a critical area, so that we can enable our universities to become the best in the world. We can do that by deregulation. We are giving apprentices, for the first time, significant government support just as if they were going to university. That is what we are doing in this budget in terms of education and innovation.


The fourth thing we are doing to boost growth, jobs and productivity is enhancing workforce participation. We are enhancing workforce participation by saying to people who are over the age of 50 and who have been on welfare for more than six months: we will give your employer up to $10,000 as an incentive to take you on board so that you no longer have to be on welfare. When it comes to women in the workforce, we want to encourage them to stay in the workforce after they have had children; a paid parental leave scheme is an important component of that. Australia is below other countries in the world when it comes to the number of women participating in our workforce. They are coming out of our universities in higher numbers than men but they are not represented in our workforce in the same numbers. Then, of course, there is our earn and learn strategy which is so important—because under the government of those opposite, under the Labor government, youth unemployment went to record levels. We are trying to break that nexus between welfare dependency and unemployment. What we are saying is: if you are a young person you must go out and find a job. We will help you do that. We will also give you training.


This is a vitally important budget. In my areas of deregulation and the G20; cutting red tape and consolidating the number of bodies, we are making great headway. I commend the measures in this budget to the House.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:08):  While most of the country were up late last night watching the State of Origin and then the soccer, and while some people were at a charity ball here in this building, the parliamentary secretary was in front of the mirror practising his audition. He was up all night practising his audition for Senator Sinodinos' shadow ministry job. I wish you well with that, Parliamentary Secretary. Hopefully, for him, that competition is not judged on facts because there was a whole bunch of stuff the parliamentary secretary just said which was patently false. I will not go through all of it—it would take me hours to go through all of the factual errors in what he just said; but let me pick up a couple.


If the government was fair dinkum about participation, for example, they would not be attacking the childcare system. If they were fair dinkum about this so-called budget emergency they would not have doubled the deficit when they came into government. If they were serious about budget repair they would not be spending $21 billion on a scheme that gives the wealthiest mothers in the country the most money that they least need. There were all kinds of things in there, but I want to focus on the Federation as part of this portfolio.


I have a couple of questions that I would like the parliamentary secretary to deal with. Firstly: they make a big deal in their budget documents about a functioning Federation and reform; they have a white paper coming and all the rest of it. It is very curious that they would abolish the COAG Reform Council. It is very curious that, when premiers right around the country are calling for a meeting to discuss the cuts to payments to states, there has been no meeting scheduled. I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary what is the plan for engaging with the premiers and state treasurers who are so critical of the budget. That is the first set of things I would like him to elaborate on. And then there are the cuts to the COAG Reform Council.


I also very specifically would like him to refer to page 7 of their own budget overview document—and I am happy to provide a copy if the parliamentary secretary would like it. I would like him to confirm that my eyes are not deceiving me and that it says: 


In this Budget the Government is adopting sensible indexation arrangements for schools from 2018, and hospitals from 2017-18, and removing funding guarantees for public hospitals. These measures will achieve cumulative savings of over $80 billion by 2024‑25.


Every day in question time the Prime Minister denies this bit I have helpfully highlighted it in green for the benefit of the House. It says that there is $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals. I would like the parliamentary secretary very specifically to confirm that that is indeed the government's budget document and that that number is indeed true.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:10):  It is a great pleasure to respond to the member for Rankin. Firstly, it is not only us who are telling the Australian people that we have to reduce spending; it is groups like the IMF, who said of 17 leading economies in the world Australia has the fastest rate of spending, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and the independent Commission of Audit, who said that we are on a trajectory of spending that we cannot continue. That is why we have had to take measures in this budget. 


I am very happy to tell the member for Rankin that when it comes to the COAG Reform Council we are saving $8.3 million over the forward estimates. It might be news to the member for Rankin that the state that he comes from—Queensland—is also going to benefit, because the states are going to save just over $10 million—




Dr Chalmers:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. I do apologise for interrupting. I would like to table the government's own budget document that says that there has been $80 billion in cuts.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  There is no point of order.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Rankin might like to learn that his own state of Queensland is going to be one of the states that are going to save—and this is a cumulative amount—over $10 million from getting rid of the COAG Reform Council. You need to know that the sunny state of Queensland is also going to be a beneficiary of the COAG Reform Council not continuing and the Commonwealth is going to save over $8 million.


The member for Rankin does raise an important point about this government's commitment to funding hospitals and schools. Yes, it is true that some of the state premiers and the chief ministers were not that happy after the budget, but would you believe that, if you look at Treasury's papers, over the coming decade increased expenditure from the Commonwealth to the states is going to be tens of billions of dollars—nearly $60 billion of increased money over the decade. That is money from the Commonwealth to the states for things like hospitals and schools. In fact, hospital funding and school funding are going up between 37 and 40 per cent.



An honourable member:  It is not going up.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  It is. Spending is going up over the next four years and the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that in the chamber. If you look at the government's funding commitments for hospitals and schools, it is going up year upon year upon year—40 per cent and 37 per cent for schools and hospitals. The member for Rankin is very brave because he has raised the issue of school funding. What has been the most topical issue when it comes to school funding? It has been Gonski. How much more have we put in?




Mr Tudge:
  $1.2 billion.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  $1.2 billion, thank you, Member for Aston. An extra $1.2 billion that they ripped from the children of Queensland and Western Australia. We, under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, have found that money from the taxpayers of Australia to go where they never were spending that money.


I am very proud of the fact that in this budget we are not only putting down the foundation for increased growth and jobs and productivity, we are not only paying back Labor's debt by finding spending cuts, but we are also increasing support for hospitals and for schools by the significant numbers of 37 and 40 per cent respectively.




Ms Chesters:
  That was a printing error!




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Unlike the member for Bendigo, those members opposite do not take the fiscal responsibilities of the Commonwealth seriously. These members on this side of the House take our responsibilities very seriously when it comes to the budget. We are very proud of this document and we are very proud of the increased funding for schools and for hospitals.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (11:15):  How interesting to hear the member for Rankin talk about schools funding. In my state of Tasmania, government funding for state schools over the next five years goes up by 46 per cent. I do not know how we can translate that increase in funding as being a cut, as the member for Rankin tries to do. I know he is very fond of figures. I think he used to influence the abacus in the member for Swan's office over the last six years.




Dr Chalmers:
  Proudly!




Mr NIKOLIC:
  He says, 'Proudly'! I do not how you can be proud of $191 billion of achieved deficits. How can you be proud of $123 billion of forecast deficits, which would have resulted in 16 years of deficits in this country? How can he be proud of $667 billion of gross debt, and right now borrowing $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on the debt? If, like the member for Franklin, his abacus continued to borrow into the future, in 10 years time that would be $3 billion of borrowings every month to pay the interest on our debt.


Be that as it may, and the revisionist history that the member for Rankin tries to engage in—my serious question to the parliamentary secretary—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr NIKOLIC:
  Thank you. My question to the parliamentary secretary goes to the proliferation of bureaucratic structures and regulation under the former Labor government over the last six years. Despite promising to limit regulatory impacts—and I think Mr Rudd had a promise of 'one on, one off' when it came to regulation; in their cabinet submissions, every department was going to have a regulatory impact statement—somehow, we managed to end up with 21,000 new pieces of legislation and regulation. That is 21,000—so much for another promise to the Australian people that was not met by those opposite over the last six years. The people in my electorate have conveyed that as being a little bit like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Would the member for Bass resume his seat. While robust debate is encouraged, it is at that the point that I can barely hear the member for Bass. I am going to ask every member present to please allow the members to speak uninterrupted.




Mr NIKOLIC:
  The people in my electorate described it as something like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra tinkering and adjusting but, in essence, interfering with their daily lives. Businesses and community groups felt that pressure, that pressure of 21,000 pieces of regulation, every day. Where the proponents for projects were confronted with an environmental issue, they felt the full wrath of all three levels of government, including the government in Canberra when it came to OH&S and environmental problems and a whole range of other issues. Unions and green groups, not surprisingly, had all this disproportionate influence in Canberra. Regrettably, in Tasmania we had the double whammy of Labor-Greens government in Hobart as well.


I know people often talk about business power, and I know the member for Rankin and those opposite engage in the politics of envy and division. But the greatest power of business is the power to invest or disinvest. What stops them from investing are those obstacles and those roadblocks. What we are doing as a government is eliminating some of those obstacles and roadblocks. I am the Tasmanian representative on the parliamentary secretary's deregulation committee, which has done some extraordinarily good work, and I was a proud member of the first repeal day. I hope there are many more to roll back some of the injudicious regulation that came out of those opposite. We sent a powerful message about our government's commitment when it comes to easing that burden of legislation and regulation. Those were the obstacles to investment I was referring to earlier. In that context, I ask the parliamentary secretary: what more does this budget foreshadow when it comes to deregulation and getting rid of the proliferation of the many hundreds of government bodies and rent seekers out there that grew during the last six years? Are there even more savings to be made in this regard in the future?

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:19):  I thank the member for Bass for that very entertaining and realistic assessment of the legacy that those opposite left us when it came to regulation. He is right. They left us 21,000 additional regulations. He referred to regulatory impact statements. Those opposite promised that there would be regulatory impact statements for major legislative initiatives. Would the members opposite believe that, when it came to the carbon tax, the mining tax, changes to the Fair Work Act, the NBN and the Future of Financial Advice, each of those legislative initiatives was exempt from a regulatory impact statement process? Those opposite have no idea as to the true impact and cost on stakeholders of those thousands of new regulations that they introduced by way of the heavy hand of government. 


We want to be very different from that. We have already had our first repeal day, where we were successful in getting rid of more than 10,000 additional regulations and redundant pieces of legislation. The savings to the Australian taxpayer and to industry is more than $700 million. We are not finished. I thank the members for Bass Hindmarsh, Deakin, Wright, Aston and Herbert for their incredibly hard work in putting ideas on the table for cutting red and green tape across the economy. One of the real areas in which we have been successful has been environmental approvals. The Minister for the Environment has given approval for more than $500 billion worth of projects in the just less than nine months that we have been in office, and we have moved to one-stop shop environmental approvals.


The member for Bass asked an important question about the consolidation of agencies in this budget. I am very pleased to report that, as a result of measures in this budget, hundreds of millions of dollars will be saved to the taxpayer by unwinding the layer upon layer of bureaucracy that currently exists. In fact, the Commission of Audit found that the Commonwealth government had about 1,000 statutory and non-statutory bodies within its remit. What we have said is we are going to get rid of some of these bodies. Let me tell you the names of some of these bodies we are going get rid of. We are going to get rid of the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula. We are going to get rid of the Social Inclusion Board and the High Speed Rail Advisory Group. The process is well underway for merging AusAID with the Department of Foreign Affairs. Of course, when we are providing support for good governance, health, education and infrastructure in our region, it needs to be linked with our diplomats. It is just a common-sense idea where we will save a huge amount of money. We are merging the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service into the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The functions of Health Workforce Australia, General Practice Education and Training Ltd and the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will go into the Department of Health. The back office functions for the National Archives, the National Gallery, the National Museum, the National Library and the National Portrait Gallery are all going to be merged because that brings savings to the taxpayer.


I can go on. We are merging five civilian merit review tribunals into a single organisation—so the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Classification Review Board, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will come together—not to mention the very busy privatisation agenda that we have currently underway with Medibank Private, and we have announced scoping studies into the sale of Defence Housing Australia, the Royal Australian Mint, Australian Hearing and the registry function of ASIC. It is very important to understand what the government should be doing and what the private sector should be doing and having a proper delineation of responsibilities so in the end we can provide better service to the taxpayer at less cost.

 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:25):  Thank you for giving me the call, Madam Deputy Speaker. I need to ask which you prefer to be called: Deputy Speaker or Madam Deputy Speaker?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  I am happy with either, but thank you.




Ms RYAN:
  Good. I just want everyone to note that it is worth asking a woman what she wants occasionally, because I want to talk today about the Office for Women and the adverse impacts this budget has on women. I am glad to be here and I am glad to hear that list of advisory bodies and experts that those opposite think they do not need to listen to anymore. One of the things I want to talk about is the notion that, if you cannot slash an advisory body or get rid of an expert, then you can always just ignore it, like we are ignoring the Office for Women. 


Tony Abbott's budget of broken promises makes savage cuts to pensions. We have been there. We know the list of cuts is long: hospitals, family payments, superannuation, education and services. All of these cuts will have a deep impact on women. For example, a single parent on the parenting payment, the majority of whom are women, will have their budgets hit by more than $3,400 a year. Industry Super Australia has stated: 


The repeal of the LISC—


the low income super contribution—


will be particularly damaging to the retirement savings of women who constitute an estimated two-thirds of those eligible. Staggeringly, the abolition of the LISC will negatively impact on the retirement savings of almost one in two women.


In the aftermath of the budget, we have seen an unprecedented and dishonest attack on Australia's carers, the majority of whom are women. There are no changes to carers as a result of the budget, the Prime Minister said in question time on 16 June. This is wrong. The budget cuts the carers payment, with indexation to be reduced to CPI. This will impact on carers, the majority of whom are women. And, with women accounting for 60 per cent of GP visits, the GP tax will have a deep impact on their access to health care. As the costs mount for families, tough decisions will be made on seeking help for those families.


I went to the website of the Office for Women and I found there that the Office for Women exists:


… to ensure a whole-of-government approach is given to providing better economic and social outcomes for women.


That is what the website says. Then I went to the 'Economic Empowerment and Opportunity' part of the site, and it said:


The Australian Government is working to improve women's economic empowerment.


   …   …   …


Women's economic empowerment is central to a strong economy and region. For example, closing the workforce participation gap between women and men could boost gross domestic product by up to 13%.


During Senate estimates, on 27 May, it was confirmed that the Office for Women, in your department of PM&C, provided advice on all relevant measures leading up to the budget. Ms McDevitt said:


For all the budget measures, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provides advice, and, since the Office for Women is located within the department, the Office for Women has provided advice on relevant measures leading up to the budget, which could include consulting with other agencies and providing internal advice that would feed into the whole-of-department advice on budget measures.


My question in this area is: why was advice from the Prime Minister's own department ignored in the formulation of the budget? It has been the practice, for over 30 years, for federal governments to produce a women's budget statement as one element of the official budget papers. We heard a few minutes ago lots of statements, pointing the finger across the chamber about previous budgets—not the budget of 2014, which is the budget we are all here to talk about. That has been in place for 30 years in the official budget papers, but in 2014 it is not included.



My question is, given the PM is the Minister for Women and the Office for Women is in PM&C, who made the decision to cut this statement? Was the Office for Women consulted on this specific decision? Given the impact on women of this budget, why was this decision made? And I will go further, with another question. To me, as a woman, it is really concerning that this government has a mirror looking backwards. I am looking forward to doing my ironing again. I wonder if you can answer that.(Time expired)

 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:30):  The member for Aston is right. That was a very poorly phrased question, full of inaccuracies and mistakes. I am very proud that, in this budget, the Prime Minister has ensured that funding for women's programs has continued strongly.


The hypocrisy of those opposite in talking about support for women's programs or about helping women in the workforce is exposed by the fact that they have unleashed a partisan attack on our Paid Parental Leave scheme. The Paid Parental Leave scheme is fundamental to ensuring that more women stay in the workforce after having children so that we continue to—



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! 




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Off the record or on the record, I am an extremely strong supporter of the Paid Parental Leave scheme because I believe it boosts workforce participation. The member for Rankin is showing great ignorance because he probably does not know that the Grattan Institute put out a report on the numbers of women who are in the Australian workforce compared to the number of men. Those numbers are 67 per cent of women, compared with 78 per cent of men. Of those 67 per cent of women in the workforce, how many do you think are working full time? Only 55 per cent. But when you look at the number of men who are working full time, it is 85 per cent. One of the key things we need to do in this budget to support working women is institute a paid parental leave scheme and I am a big supporter of the Prime Minister's scheme.


You ask me, in addition to the Paid Parental Leave scheme—in addition to providing more affordable and accessible child care and funding for women's safety—what else are we doing in this budget for women? I am very happy to tell those opposite. Firstly, the National Women's Alliances program has received funding of almost $4.8 million for six alliances over the three years to 2016, up from just $3.6 million over the previous three years. Funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children remains unchanged in this budget and that funding is $104 million over the forward estimates. This includes money for Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, 1800 RESPECT, DvaleRT—domestic violence response training delivered nationally by Lifeline—and the personal safety survey and—

Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Other women's leadership and development strategy funding that we have continued to support over 2013-14 includes funding for the National Women's Alliances, the sport leadership grants, the Every Girl program and the like.


There are many examples in this budget of how this government has shown its continued strong support—indeed, its increased support—for women's programs, particularly for women at risk. I am very proud that in this budget we have continued funding these important areas and we will continue to speak out in favour of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. It will be, in addition to childcare improvements—we have a Productivity Commission review into child care—a way of improving the lot of Australia's working women.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:34):  I was going to put this in halves, but I am happy for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg to take this on notice. I do have a question for Parliamentary Secretary Tudge as well. In relation to the red tape reduction, is there a possibility that we will make this a COAG process? The work we have done on red tape and green tape reduction has been fantastic. It is a great start. The commitment to keep going is important. I see the member for Wright is here. His previous occupation was a truck driver. Most of his red tape costs would have been state government costs. My big concern here is the possibility of cost shifting or responsibility shifting to the states. If we save $1 billion then the states put on $500 million of red tape, we would still be $500 million better off but the states would have jumped in. I would like to see if you are going to follow that through.


My second question for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg is on the tender process. I will give an example. The Flinders Shire Council had a nine-kilometre stretch of road that they costed at $9 million. Because it was over the threshold it had to go to national tender. It was picked up by a national supplier and the cost was $27 million. They flew in their team, equipment and camp and did the work and nothing went through the local community. Is it possible that we can look at something in relation to the tender process to ensure that the money that is expended by the Commonwealth in regional and regional communities does stay there and we give more flexibility to local councils in that area?


I represent the seat of Herbert, which includes Palm Island. We have a number of Indigenous organisations. I have a real issue when it comes to the running of some of these Indigenous organisations. Lack of accountability and poor governance have meant massive losses of funds. People have been shifted out of these organisations. Information on what we believe were fraud matters has been provided to the police. It is very hard for the police to prove fraud. Is there an instrument in ORIC—and will the parliamentary secretary take it upon himself to have a look at the rules of ORIC—that is similar to ASIC's rule that someone is no longer fit and proper to run an organisation, so we can make sure that the governance to the community is better off?


Additionally, would the parliamentary secretary be able to advise me about the opportunities to work and get a decent job. I know he is very passionate in this regard. Palm Island is 2½ hours on the ferry, so the 90-minute rule no longer applies. If someone is moving to Palm Island, there is no onus on them to look for a job. The difference between being on benefits and working can quite often be a disincentive to them getting a job. Can the parliamentary secretary give me some information in relation to what he is thinking about this and what the government is thinking in this space?

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:38):  I thank the member for Herbert for those important questions. I will leave the questions in the Indigenous space to my colleague the member for Aston. The member for Herbert is absolutely right: this is not just a whole-of-government approach to deregulation at the federal level but also very much involving the states. The Prime Minister has said that deregulation will become a standing item on the agenda at COAG, which will be used as the primary body for driving reform at the federal and state levels.


At the last COAG meeting in the first week of May they all discussed deregulation in relation to a number of areas. Those areas included housing and commercial building construction; road freight; food and dairy manufacturing and fish processing; tourism business licensing—which will be very important in your electorate of Herbert, particularly around Townsville; rules as they relate to cafes and restaurants; and gas and resources exploration. They have divided up these areas among the various states for them to take responsibility for doing a deep dive in the particular area and bringing forward ideas where there is federal-state overlap in regulation. 


We are very determined that, to be successful on the deregulation front, we not only get changes done at the federal level but drive changes at the state level so that, as the member for Herbert mentioned, the states do not just introduce new regulations to make up for the federal government's reduction in regulations. You need to understand that we are extremely focused on this. A number of states like Victoria have a red tape commissioner and they are driving changes. I have met with Deb Frecklington, the assistant minister for finance with responsibility for deregulation in Queensland, your home state. We are driving this agenda forward together. As the member for Herbert rightly mentioned, in the area of environmental approvals we were able to get MOUs signed with every state and territory. Those opposite would like to know that the Labor state of South Australia and the ACT also signed on to these MOUs and Greg Hunt has been moving forward to get full agreements, particularly with Queensland and New South Wales, in a speedy fashion. So we are moving at a state and a federal level on the deregulation agenda.


The member for Herbert also raised the very important issue of trying to create jobs at a local level through the tendering process. The member for Herbert may be interested to know that one area we have been looking at relates to the federal safety commission because the federal safety commissioner requires, under the legislation, that builders be particularly accredited. What can happen is if Defence Housing is building in remote areas, as it often does, it would want to source builders from the local area, but those local builders may not have the accreditation needed to get that job because going through that accreditation process requires extra costs on their part. That is another example of where those opposite have no understanding of the true impact on job creation at the local level of extra layers of bureaucracy and red tape. So I have met the head of Defence Housing and we are looking at this issue of the federal safety commissioner. Hopefully I will be able to report to the member for Herbert that there has been some progress on this issue. Like him, all my colleagues on this side of the House understand that we need to create jobs in the regions, we need to free up the councils, we need to free up the local builders and we need to ensure that they can get a personal dividend out of our red tape reduction efforts.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:43):  We have seen a fair bit of rhetoric this morning, as we always do in sessions of this kind, and a bit of cut and thrust. That is all well and good, but I seek the indulgence of the parliamentary secretary to ask a question of earnest importance, and that is a question dealing with the incidence of men's violence against women in our community. I ask him to take this question from me as one man asking another man about an important issue that all men should be speaking out about in our community. Questions that go to the prioritisation of funding are inherently political, but I emphasise I am not asking partisan questions as I do not doubt the intent of those opposite to curb the growth of men's violence against women in our community and, in fact, to drive the rate of violence down.


My questions relate to two areas of funding and the Office for Women. I am seeking guidance from the parliamentary secretary about whether the Office for Women provided advice to the government on how this year's budget would impact on services provided to women in danger of family violence, in particular in the area of community legal centres. We have seen $1.6 million cut in the budget from the women's leadership and development strategy, which includes the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, but also $15 million from legal aid and millions from community legal centres.


In Melbourne's west, in my electorate, more than 50 per cent of the work of community legal centres is advising women in danger of family of violence. For the benefit of people who have not engaged with these groups, this kind of advice includes their rights in the legal system, protection and their rights to intervention orders to ensure their safety. It is also advice about what to expect if they make the decision to leave their home, in terms of their financial security, the obligation of the government to them and the obligation of their partners to support them. Also, there has been a 35 per cent increase in demand for community legal centre advice in this space in my electorate.


MYEFO contained cuts of $3.6 million from the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services, $9.6 million from community legal centres and $6.5 million from legal aid. Did the Office for Women provide advice to the government about the impact of those cuts on women in these situations? Also, did they take into account that the rising rates of domestic violence increase demand for these services in the community? If they did provide advice, I would ask what the recommendations of that advice were and whether it was acted on by the government?


The second area I would like to ask about is the impact of cuts to Medicare Locals funding contained in this year's budget, and the impact this has on family violence services. Family violence was a priority area for the Medicare Local in my community. As I said, family violence is an extraordinarily serious and growing problem in my community. These cuts will have substantial impact on the ability of Medicare Local-funded programs to continue in our community.


I should emphasise that these are not cuts to the Medicare Local institutions, these are cuts to the funding of programs being implemented by Medicare Locals. Again, I ask whether the Office for Women provided advice on these decisions and about the impact of these decisions on women in these situations? I ask whether the cumulative impact of these cuts to programs that assist GPs in providing advice to women and identifying women in these situations, combined with cuts to community legal centres, who are providing advice to women in these situations, were taken into account in the budget process?

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:47):  I thank the honourable member opposite for those questions about a very important topic. Like him, I hail from the state of Victoria, which has been rocked by tragedy in recent times, particularly as it relates to violence against women. The Jill Meagher case is the most prominent example of what is clearly unacceptable behaviour.


As I said earlier, this budget continues to strongly support funding programs to prevent violence against women. On the issue of the Office for Women and the advice that they are able to provide: that is done within the context of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They are able to provide advice on all relevant measures in this budget. We take our advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.


On the particular measures that we are committed to in this budget: as I said earlier, the funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children remains unchanged. The funding for this plan is $104 million over the forward estimates and the budget continues funding for the Australian National Research Organisation For Women's Safety and the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, as well as a number of other measures including 1800Respect, the nationally funded counselling support line for women experiencing sexual assault and/or domestic violence; DV-aleRT, Domestic Violence Response Training delivered nationally by Lifeline; the Personal Safety Survey; and the National Community Attitudes Survey to Violence Against Women. The second action plan, which will include our commitment and that of the states and the territories to ongoing action, will be released mid this year.


The member opposite asked me about community legal centres and funding for those. We continue to believe that funding going forward needs to be structured in a way which does take into account the most vulnerable in our community including women at risk. We have extended the base funding under the national partnership agreement on legal assistance services by one year until 30 June 2015. Ongoing future legal assistance will be the subject of consideration, and the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into access to justice arrangements and the recent review of the national partnerships agreement will also inform future decisions going forward. 


In relation to Medicare Locals, the member opposite will be aware that we have increased funding for health in this budget right across the board. In fact, funding for hospitals has increased by nearly 40 per cent over the coming years. There are a lot of fallacies contained in the arguments put by those opposite. We have put more money into education than they ever did—including $1.2 billion for the Gonski proposals—and we have continued to promote funding for hospitals and front-line patient services.


I am very proud of this budget because it pays back debt, it boosts jobs growth and productivity, and it continues to provide financial support, assistance and services for those most in need.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2014-06-19,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:51):  I firstly make the observation that this is the very first time in Australian political history that we are discussing the Indigenous Affairs budget as part of the consideration of the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. That is because Prime Minister Abbott is now the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs. It is the first time in Australian political history that that has been done, and he has done so because he saw the importance of this area and wanted to oversee the entire portfolio area himself. The questions that will come up now will also come up when we are discussing the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. I think that is worth reflecting upon.


I will not in my opening remarks go through the specific measures which are outlined in the budget. They are tabled for the members here to see. What I would like to do, though, is inform members as to the overall approach that we are taking in the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, the rationale for that approach, and, through that, how the budget is actually delivering on that approach. We have a great many challenges in this nation—and the member for Kooyong outlined some of the budgetary challenges which we are facing—but the greatest challenge in Australia remains the plight of Indigenous people. We ask all members to ensure that this is high on our political agenda at all times—and with the Prime Minister taking on the portfolio it hopefully will remain high on the political agenda at all times.


Our overall approach can be summarised by saying that we have three core priorities in the Indigenous area, and they sit on a bed of governance reforms. Those priorities are to get kids to school, to get the adults into work and to ensure that there are safe communities. And then there are a series of governance reforms which underpin that, and on the side we have the constitutional recognition process underway. I will touch on each of those three priorities briefly, as well as the governance changes. First of all, why those priorities—why education, employment and community? In part, it is because of the upstream factors. If kids are at school, if the adults are in work and you have reasonable order in a community, then the other things tend to take care of themselves. People's mental health is better and people's physical health is better. If people are in work and kids are in school, then child protection tends to be better. If there is a safe community, then you do not need as many activities overall in terms of policing and other such activities. So it is a firm focus on the things which we think absolutely matter for the overall functioning of any society, frankly, not just the Indigenous community. 


But when you look at those three areas, there are significant problems at present. Take school attendance, for example. The school attendance rate across Australia for Indigenous is about 10 percentage points lower than for the non-Indigenous. But that hides what is occurring in the remote areas where there is sometimes what I would consider a catastrophic Indigenous attendance rate. In remote Northern Territory, for example, only about 25 per cent of students attend 80 per cent of the time. If you are attending less than 80 per cent of the time, you are effectively not learning. There are only about 25 per cent of students, therefore, that I would consider learning by virtue of attending school for a sufficient amount of time.


When you look at employment, the employment gap is about 30 percentage points. The overall employment rate for non-Indigenous people is about 75 per cent and about 25 per cent for Indigenous per cent, and gap has in fact got wider over the last five years rather than smaller. When you look at community safety, the stats across the board are poorer in Indigenous communities than in non-Indigenous communities. So we do need to have a dedicated focus on those three areas, and this budget consolidates programs to ensure that we can have that focus.


It also has important governance reforms, primarily, by amalgamating 150 programs into five broad ones and ensuring that we can have much more localised and nuanced decisions made at a local level where Indigenous people can be more empowered.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:56):  I assume the parliamentary secretary is aware of a functions role and responsibility for the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, having worked closely with the council. Mr Warren Mundine is the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council which provides advice to and works with the government to implement Indigenous policy. When it comes to the council, I would like the parliamentary secretary to outline the budgeted remuneration levels of each member of the council. How much is Mr Mundine being paid? What are the levels of remuneration and the details of that remuneration, and those for his deputy chair and, of course, each member of the council? Could the parliamentary secretary outline the total cost to the budget of the operation of the Indigenous Advisory Council for the 2014-15 financial year as well as across the forward estimates? 


The Indigenous Advisory Council is responsible for the provision of Indigenous policy to the government. Did the council support the $534.4 million cut to Indigenous programs in the budget? Can the parliamentary secretary advise how and when the council was consulted about the budget measures in the 2014-15 budget round? How many times did the council meet before the budget and with which members of the government? Was the council consulted and did the council provide advice on all the budget measures? If not, can the parliamentary secretary explain why not? 


Can the parliamentary secretary advise the chamber how often the Indigenous Advisory Council meets? Is every member present at every meeting? What are the quorum requirements for the council? Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that Mr Mundine has met with the members of the government on behalf of the Indigenous Advisory Council? When was the last time the council met and when will they meet next? 


As the appointed remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council, Mr Mundine is reported in the media as having announced a second round of cuts in Indigenous affairs program in the order of $600 million. Mr Mundine announced as the head of the Indigenous Advisory Council that he is meeting with the Treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann to cut an additional $600 million from the Indigenous affairs budget. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm whether the $600 million in cuts mentioned by Mr Mundine is in the forward estimates? Did Mr Mundine meet with the Treasurer and finance minister before or after the budget was handed down? Who within the government authorised the new funding cuts? Does the government agree with and stand by the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council about the second wave of cuts? Are you working on or have you got more cuts in the forward estimates? Given the current level of $534 million is not able to be achieved through administrative efficiencies, is it being called from programs and where is the next round of cuts coming from? Why are further cuts being discussed within the government when the full impact of the current round of cuts is not yet known?


I want to quote from Mr Mundine on the ABC World Today program on 5 June 2014:


We did some modelling on repair and maintenance of housing and there's no doubt from the modelling that we got back that you can save 24 per cent … on the repair and maintenance of housing, and you can save from 5, 10 per cent in other areas.


I would like the parliamentary secretary to talk about the modelling. What is the modelling Mr Mundine has referred to, why was it undertaken and what else did it reveal? Will he reveal the modelling? What was the scope of the modelling and has the modelling been authorised? If so, by what authority has the work been undertaken? Or is Mr Mundine effectively operating as the unelected minister for Indigenous affairs?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:00):  I believe there were probably about 60 questions in his four minutes there, and in my allotted time I would have to allocate only five seconds per question to answer every single one. Can I say at the outset that—



An opposition member:  Take them on notice.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The more interjections, the fewer answers you will get. Move on.




Mr TUDGE:
  I outlined in my opening remarks some of the significant issues which confront Indigenous Australia. I talked about the appalling attendance rates, where only a quarter of remote Indigenous students in the Northern Territory are attending at a rate which would even make it possible for them to advance and to learn at a reasonable level. I referred to the fact that the Indigenous employment rate is 30 per cent below the non-Indigenous employment rate, and the gap is actually widening. I could have gone on to mention all sorts of other statistics in relation to how Indigenous people are tracking against non-Indigenous people.


I frankly find it surprising that, despite all of those issues, the first 60 questions from the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs are almost entirely centred on Warren Mundine and what he is getting paid, what he is doing, which meetings he is having. I know Warren Mundine was a former president of the Australian Labor Party, and the fact that he is now chairing the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council should not cloud the types of decisions, questions and advocacy which the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs engages in in this chamber and indeed in his role. I would encourage him to focus on the big picture, to focus on the issues which are facing Aboriginal people today and the issues which are faced in this budget, rather than being entirely focused on the activities of Warren Mundine.


I will say, though, about the chair of our Indigenous advisory council and indeed the Indigenous advisory council more broadly that it is an outstanding advisory council. Members would be aware of who the chair is—Mr Mundine—and his activities over decades now, advocating on behalf of Aboriginal people. They would be aware of the other members of the Indigenous advisory council: Ngiare Brown; Mr Peever, the former CEO of Rio Tinto; and Gail Kelly. We have other very substantial Indigenous leaders who are providing advice to the Prime Minister and to the government as a whole.


Their role is an advisory role. Their terms of reference and their role is outlined on the website. Mr Neumann can look at that website and understand that. He can understand when they are meeting. The Indigenous advisory council puts out a communique after each meeting, and so he can understand what their function and what their role is, but it is an advisory role. At the end of the day, decisions are made by the government and we accept responsibility for those decisions, but of course we consult with the Indigenous advisory council before making those decisions.


In relation to the overall cost of running the Indigenous advisory council, I understand that those questions were asked in the Senate estimates process. I have been informed that that information will be provided through the Senate estimates process in due course. Of course, it will be a very small amount compared to the overall $4.8 billion which this government is investing in Indigenous specific programs over the next four years—$4.8 billion. I would suspect that the costs of the operation of the Indigenous advisory council will be a very, very small fraction of that $4.8 billion. That information, in detail, will be provided to the Senate and will therefore be publicly accessible to Mr Neumann, who has been asking these 60 questions in his four minutes.


In relation to the overall budget, I outlined some of those measures in my opening statement. Yes, we have made some savings but we are still investing $4.8 billion over the forward estimates. And we have consolidated 150 programs into five. When you do that you can eliminate red tape and duplications and you can make administrative savings. That is exactly the intent of our budget. Our intention is to provide greater focus on the core areas of employment, school attendance and community safety and, of course, it is to provide efficiencies where we can do so.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (12:05):  Let us hope I can now lower the tone in the chamber.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms PRICE:
  Thank you. Maybe I will improve it; maybe I will lower it, but let's hope I can get some attention. My question is to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and it relates to how the Abbott government is working to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance rates. But first I would like to provide some context to this, particularly with respect to my electorate of Durack.


As the parliamentary secretary and I know, to get ahead in life children and young adults need to build a strong foundation through our education system. To achieve this, however, we must first get children and young adults to school. The Durack electorate has the third highest proportion of Indigenous students. So, ensuring the education gap is significantly reduced in the short term, and rates of attendance are equal in the long term, is a key priority of mine. 


Unfortunately, in Durack Indigenous students attending school is not the norm; it is the rarity. Often this is due to dysfunction in students' home lives. Lack of structure and discipline leads to a high prevalence of truancy. In Fitzroy, Derby and Wiluna, in particular, a significantly higher level of truancy has already been identified by this government and the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, which highlights non-attendance cycles in schools. This authority identified that the average annual attendance rates of students attending Fitzroy Valley District High School between 2008 and 2013 was only 62 per cent. This rate was marginally better at the Derby District High School, with 69 per cent, and there was 65 per cent attendance at the Wiluna Remote Community School. 


What these schools have in common is that they are all remote and have large Indigenous populations, which are often transient. However, this non-attendance cycle was also identified at the Carnarvon Community College—a school which is located in a much higher regional hub—which had an attendance rate of 68 per cent in 2012. I am also saddened that the Roebourne District High School in the Pilbara region had one of the worst attendance rates in the country, of 53 per cent in the same year. This government and the wider Australian community have an expectation that every child has access to, and attends, school every day. But we need to work collaboratively to achieve this. 


Now, I do have some good news. Despite these concerning statistics, I am pleased to say that in Broome, which is a key regional centre in Durack, with a high number of Indigenous students, there are many success stories in the education sphere. I have previously acknowledged the success of the Broome Senior High School and its principal Saeed Amin and his staff, whose hard work and dedication, saw this school become the WA School of the Year in the year 2012. In the same year, the school had a 100 per cent success rate for university offers for those students who were studying university courses. 


Another success story is the local TAFE in the Kimberley, which is called the Kimberley Training Institute or KTI. KTI is the leading vocational education and training provider in the Kimberley region, which runs courses out of Broome and Kununurra. It aims to provide the skills and knowledge students need to enhance their employment opportunities. The fantastic work of KTI was recognised last year, when it received two major accolades at the WA training awards. Visual arts lecturer Jacky Cheng was awarded Best Trainer in Western Australia, while the KTI was awarded Best Large Training Provider. I commend all staff and students for this significant achievement.


It is therefore clear that all students in Durack, no matter their age, race or social status, have the ability to access high-quality education through our schools and service providers. We just need to get these kids to school. This leads me to my question: can the parliamentary secretary please outline the government's approach for improving Indigenous attendance rates at schools across Australia and, in particular, in regional and remote areas?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:10):  I thank the member for Durack for this question on what is a critical area. I commend her for her commitments to her constituency and her electorate, but more broadly to Aboriginal people across Australia. I know she has a very passionate commitment in wanting to see the advancement of Aboriginal people and wanting to see the gap closed in this country. I commend her for that.


The question she raises is a critically important one. It concerns school attendance and education attainment. As I said at the outset, this is our top priority in the Indigenous affairs portfolio and, therefore, one of the top priorities for the government is to lift the school attendance rate. If children are not at school then, by definition, they are not going to be learning. If they are not learning at school, it is so much harder to get employment afterwards and it is likely to lead to a life of welfare. It starts with school attendance. At the moment the school attendance rates, particularly in remote areas, as the member for Durack outlined, are sometimes at catastrophic levels. In some schools, the attendance rate is as low as 37 per cent. If you actually looked at what I think is the most important measure in this area, that of how many kids are attending at least 80 per cent of the time, that figure is even smaller. It is a very significant problem. We do not underestimate the challenge which we have to support schools, to support the Indigenous leaders and to support children to be able to go to school and to learn.


To date, the most important measure that we have introduced to tackle school attendance, particularly in remote areas, is the Remote School Attendance Strategy. In simple terms, that means providing employment opportunities for local, quality people to act as attendance officers. In the mornings they go around, knock on the doors, encourage the families to get their young son or daughter onto the minibus to take them to school, ensure that they are at school during the day and encourage those children to get home safely at the end of the day. This has been rolled out now in 73 schools, 12 of which are in Western Australia. Most of these are in the member for Durack's electorate.


Forty of those schools have had these school student attendance officers introduced in term 1. A further 33 were introduced in term 2. I can report that so far it has had some substantial results and substantial improvements. For example, in some places in the Northern Territory, the number of children in these schools where we have the attendance officers in place is now up 17 per cent on last year. A quarter of all schools in the stage 1 phase have had student attendance rate increases of between 15 and 25 percentage points. It is extraordinary that any school can have that type of increase at all, but it actually shows that in a quarter of the schools we are having tremendous results from these student attendance officers working with the local communities and working with families to get their children to school. Three quarters of the schools have had improvements in their student attendance rates.


This is not easy. A quarter of the schools still have not seen much improvement and there are a number of reasons for that. We constantly get advice from the student attendance officers as to what is going on in those schools and what can be done next to try to improve the student attendance rates. The member for Durack identified some of the issues which they have to tackle—whether it is parties going on at night or alcohol or substance abuse, including by the students themselves and that makes it so much more difficult. There are mobility issues, in that the students are more mobile than non-Indigenous students and may be in a different community at a particular time. All these create challenges, but we are determined to continue the roll-out of the Remote Students Attendance Strategy to monitor it closely, to work with the local leaders in those communities—because, at the end of the day, it has to be done with those local leaders—and to ensure that student attendance rates lift. If we cannot get student attendance rates higher, students will not be learning and if they are not learning then their prospects for employment are so much more difficult.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:15):  The sum of $534.4 million has been ripped away from Indigenous programs in the government's budget. To make the situation is made worse, the government has provided no details or information. There is a single table on page 185 of Budget Paper No. 2. There is no detail, no explanation, no idea. Weeks later and the government has still been unable to explain the cuts, and service providers, their staff and clients will have to wait six to 12 months in limbo. I trust the parliamentary secretary takes note and that he is more enlightened than the Minister for Indigenous Affairs who claimed in Senate estimates on 30 May 2014 that $½ billion in cuts was merely an efficiency dividend. It was exposed as a feeble and false claim, when the minister's own department was forced to admit during estimates that the money was, in fact, direct cuts to programs. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm one was or the other that these are not efficiency dividends; these are programmatic cuts? If it is, however, an efficiency dividend, can the parliamentary secretary explain why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are subject to an efficiency dividend of 4.5 per cent, which is much higher than the 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend that this government has applied across departments, agencies and portfolios? What evidence is the parliamentary secretary able to produce to justify the minister's claim that the money is not being taken away from frontline services, as he claimed to David Speers in the Sky News Agenda program on 28 May.


This week the Prisoner Throughcare Program, funded through the NATSIL in New South Wales and the ACT, had its program funding cut by $½ million a year. Workers were told two weeks out that they would lose their jobs. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how this is not a frontline service? Can the parliamentary secretary explain why the government has cut funding for successful programs which help combat recidivism, when Indigenous incarceration rates are much worse than ever before? And the trend is going up. A total of $160 million has been cut from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs. Could the minister explain in detail which services are being cut? Could the minister detail what the assumed impact of the Medicare co-payment measure will be on budgets of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health services? What services will need to be cut if these health services are expected to absorb the costs of the co-payment? Who does the minister or the parliamentary secretary believe could absorb the co-payment for other services directed by the medical practitioner for the patient? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that if the co-payment—described as 'a demand reduction measure' by the Prime Minister—is not absorbed by the health services that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will choose not to get treatment? What are the estimates of the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will take this option? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that this is an impairment to Closing the Gap and to addressing chronic disease? 


Does the parliamentary secretary consider the COAG Reform Council, which was abolished in the budget, as unnecessary red tape? The council reports independently on progress on Closing the Gap and the National Partnership Agreements. The budget papers suggest that it may become the responsibility of PM&C to report on themselves now that the COAG Reform Council has been axed. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm what or who will be the independent mechanism for monitoring and reporting on inter-governmental action to close the gap? Will these reports be publicly available? Or will this be simply a continuation of the alarming trend in the diminution of transparency and accountability of the government?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:19):  I commend the member for Blair, who has got it down to 40 questions per session, rather than 60, which means that I probably have about 7½ seconds per question rather than the five seconds I had in the previous session. Overall, the questions that he had concerned a few points, so let me touch on those few points. The most substantial points which the member for Blair asked about were the savings decisions made in the budget.


There is $4.8 billion worth of Indigenous-specific programs for which appropriations are made in this budget over four years. There was a 4.5 per cent savings being made there. That is on the public record and the member for Blair has outlined that. How has that come about and why is this occurring? In part, every portfolio has had to make savings. My friend the member for Kooyong outlined the rationale for that. The public finances were a mess. We are spending $1 billion a month just on the interest payments on the Labor government debt and that is forecast to grow to $3 billion per month, so decisions had to be made across the board to make savings.


In the Indigenous portfolio, what had been occurring over the years was a proliferation of programs, increasing and increasing.

  From the federal perspective—




Mr Snowdon:
  Talk about the health funds.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Whiteley
):  Order! I warn the member!




Mr TUDGE:
  There were 150 federal programs which were funded. If you went to any particular location you would likely find a similar number at the state level. What that has meant is a proliferation of individual activities and programs at a localised level, sometimes creating a whirlwind of activity of programs but very little progress being made. The Auditor-General looked this at the end of last year and did a case study on the community of Wilcannia. It is a typical community, predominantly Indigenous. He found that in this community of 474 Indigenous people there were 102 funded activities from 18 different agencies and a further 17 activities proposed. So in that place alone there was more than one program per five individuals. 


If you listen to the member for Blair and, indeed, the opposition leader you would think that that is not enough, that we now need one program for one individual, possibly even more. We do not believe that is the case. In fact, what we have suggested through this budget process is that we need to sharpen the focus around a few core areas—school attendance, employment, community safety—and we have to streamline the activity so that as much as possible, from the Commonwealth's perspective, there is a single interface into a community rather than 15 or 30 or 50 interfaces into a community. So this budget does that. The first decision we made in order to facilitate that was to bring the programs from eight different departments into one department, the most important department: the Prime Minister's department. The second decision was to amalgamate 150 separate federal programs into five broad flexible programs. The third decision was that we will be devolving power to the local level so that a local empowered SES officer can negotiate with Indigenous community leaders over what is required in those communities against some of the national priorities which we have.


The effect of this will be to stop having that proliferation of activities of 100 programs in a community of 500 and instead have focused programs with empowered local leaders who can negotiate with a single Commonwealth officer over what is required in those communities. Of course in the process of doing that efficiencies can be made—of course they can because there is an overlap in activities. For example, the Smith Family has 10 individual contracts across Australia. Why do we need 10 contracts there instead of only one or two which could cover all activities? There are things which, frankly, are not working, and those things can be brought to a halt. As we go through these programs over the forward estimates, we will be stopping, evaluating initiatives, funding the ones which are working and halting the ones which are not.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (12:25):  I rise to ask a question of the parliament secretary related to funding, but I will give some background first. It was interesting to listen to the member for Blair asking questions of the parliamentary secretary. His focus was all about money. We know how well they handle money. They are not worried about the outcomes. They are not worried about the health outcomes for Indigenous people. They are not worried about that at all. It is all about money for them. They were never any good at it. 


You focused on education, and you talked about safer communities and effects on the ground. I was up at Alice Springs recently for the Indigenous round of the AFL. Sport and Indigenous people go together hand in hand. One of the outcomes that have been achieved up there—it has not been done by money; it has been work done on the ground—was the introduction of police outside liquor stores during the day. That has resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in violence and a 50 per cent reduction in hospital visits. That is an actual positive outcome. They are the sorts of things that they want on the ground. All you guys worry about is throwing money at it—just wasting it. You do not worry about where it is going.



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Whiteley
):  Order! I ask the member for Lingiari to withdraw that comment.




Mr Snowdon:
  Which one?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You know the one.




Mr IRONS:
  All of them !




Mr Snowdon:
  For you, absolutely.




Mr IRONS:
  As I said before, the importance of sport in Indigenous affairs is well known around Australia. In particular, I would like to discuss the Clontarf football academies. Clontarf is in my electorate of Swan. The Clontarf Foundation was born there, with Gerard Neesham. We all know what he did with the Sydney Swans, Swan Districts and East Fremantle. Now, with the success of his academies, he has this most effective program to encourage Indigenous students to participate in school and sport at the same time. 


I know from my time playing AFL, and being involved with quite a few Indigenous players at East Perth over the years, the importance of it to them and how holistic it is with their total outcomes in life, particularly with some of the junior development programs that are run at the Perth Football Club, where I have been the director for junior development and am currently the patron. Those programs are run hand in hand with the Clontarf academies, encouraging Indigenous participation, particularly from the lower SES areas in my electorate, like Belmont, Lynward, Langford and those types of areas. They are currently looking at a proposal with the West Coast Eagles to have a program which involves developing people socially, holistically, and getting them back not only into sport but into school.


The Clontarf Foundation is responsible for those academies. It was established in 2000, for 25 boys in Waterford, in my electorate. That used to be a place for people from broken homes or orphanages. A gentleman I brought here many years ago said he escaped from there in the 1930s, along with 25 other boys, but they were eventually caught and sent off to other institutions. It was a good story. But Clontarf now have over 55 academies around Australia, with 2,900 students. The aim is to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, leadership and employment prospects of young Aboriginal students. 


You have already highlighted how much of a focus you are putting on that area. The Clontarf program works by using the existing passion that Indigenous boys have for football to attract the boys to school and keep them there. In order for them to remain in the academy, the students must consistently endeavour to attend school regularly, apply themselves to the study of appropriate courses and embrace the academy's requirements for behaviour and self-discipline. Additionally, full-time locally based Clontarf staff mentor and counsel students on a range of behavioural, lifestyle issues to complement the education provided by schools and the AFL aspect provided by the academies.


In the short time you have left, could you outline what funding has been allocated to programs that encourage Indigenous participation in education in the budget, particularly with regard to programs in my electorate of Swan?

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:29):  I thank the member for Swan for his question, for his ongoing advocacy for Aboriginal people in his electorate and across Australia, and for his particular commitment to the Clontarf Foundation and the 55 academies which they run across Australia.  The member for Swan emphasised that, if money were the answer to Indigenous disadvantage, we would have solved it by now; there would not be disadvantage. We have had an 80 per cent increase, in real terms, in funding to Indigenous-specific programs over the last 10 years, but many of the indicators have not closed. The Productivity Commission found that we are spending about $44,000 per Indigenous individual on specific programs, and in remote communities it would probably be double that amount. It is clearly not just about money; it is about how the money is invested, how that money is allocated on the ground and what the focus is. And our focus is squarely on those three areas which I identified.


I am pleased to inform the member for Swan that the budget allocated a further $13.4 million to the Clontarf Foundation over the next four years. That will mean that an additional 3,000 boys will get an opportunity to participate in academies across Australia, and that will see almost a doubling of the operation of the Clontarf academies. We are doing this because Clontarf works. Earlier the member for Blair asked, 'What's going on with the budget?' Well, we are backing things which work. The Clontarf Academy is exactly one of those things which we want to back—with an additional $13.4 million.


Last Friday I visited the Bairnsdale Clontarf academy with the member for Gippsland. It was interesting speaking to a few of the graduates from the Bairnsdale academy. I recall one young fellow in particular. When he was 13 or 14 years old, he was effectively dropping out of school. He was attending school on maybe one day per week. He was reflecting that that was going to be his pathway. He was about to exit the school system entirely when he was 13 years old. But, because of the Clontarf academy which had just begun in Bairnsdale, he rejoined school and started attending regularly—in fact, 90 per cent of the time. He then went on and completed several more years of schooling and was assisted by the Clontarf academy into a job at the local Target store in Bairnsdale; he actually had a management role in the back office at Target. He is an outstanding young individual who otherwise would have been off the rails and probably would have been causing a bit of havoc in the community of Bairnsdale. But now he has an important job in the community. It would not surprise me if one day he is running that entire Target store—if he has not got a bigger role within the Wesfarmers Group—because he is a very impressive young man.


We met a number of other young men with very similar stories whose lives were literally transformed because of the work of the Clontarf academy. As the member for Swan knows, the Clontarf Foundation was started in Western Australia at the Clontarf school in the year 2000 by Gerard Neesham, who was the inaugural Dockers coach. I commend his commitment of over 14 years to this process. He and his staff have made a tremendous difference to thousands of boys, and, with this funding, we will hopefully support the work of the Clontarf Foundation to make a tremendous difference to another 3,000 boys over the four years ahead. There will be opportunities for schools to work with the Clontarf Foundation to make bids to provide academies in their electorate.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:43):  I welcome the visitors from the Good Samaritan Catholic College in my electorate, the school captains Brian Kane and Carla Donoso together with teachers Mick Bell and Mary Sayadi. 


Last week, together with Neighbourhood Watch Australasia and Fairfield City Council, I hosted a family violence forum in Cabramatta. The forum served to launch a diagrammatic brochure produced by Neighbourhood Watch Australasia as part of their push in terms of the family violence campaign particularly directed at the multicultural communities of the country. The campaign titled Community Safety is Everyone's Responsibility aims to send a strong message that family violence is a community issue and one that should not be and cannot be ignored. The brochures target ethnic communities who may be challenged in terms of language by visually communicating a strong message against family violence aimed at the victims, perpetrators and the community at large.


Ingrid Stonhill, Chief Executive Officer of Neighbourhood Watch Australasia, who was also present at the forum, was accompanied by Neighbourhood Watch representatives Margaret Pearson and Clare McGrath from the ACT. I would like to thank Ingrid and, in particular, Pat Leary, President of Neighbourhood Watch Australasia, for taking part in this initiative, for taking a very strong leading role and for focusing this campaign clearly on family violence in multicultural communities.


Being the most multicultural community in Australia is something my electorate and I are truly proud of. We revel in the colour, the vibrancy and the cultural diversity that that provides. There are, however, challenges posed by, in particular, language and cultural barriers. That is why it is critical to clearly communicate the information associated with legal processes and community expectations in areas with a high level of migrants, particularly in relation to this issue of family violence itself. Empowering the interaction between the police, victims and perpetrators is another crucial tool in the fight against domestic violence.


Domestic violence represents a large proportion of the work of our local police. New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Murdoch was also in attendance with a number of police officers, and they gave their full support to this initiative. In my local area, over 50 per cent of all assaults reported to the police are domestic violence related. I am told by Assistant Commissioner Murdoch that almost half of all homicide cases also involve domestic violence. One woman in Australia dies every week from domestic violence. Last year in New South Wales, 24 women were killed as a result of domestic violence and, regrettably, that included one young mother of three in Miller in my electorate. This is not surprising considering the statistic that one in three women is likely to become a victim of violence in her lifetime, while one in five is likely to experience sexual violence. Also in attendance were representatives from the Liverpool and Fairfield migrant resource centres as well as Bonnie Women's Refuge Ltd. These organisations play a key role in distributing the information associated with this campaign.


Family violence is a serious issue for the community and law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. It should be on the top of our national agenda, not just when we come together to commemorate White Ribbon Day, but constantly. Domestic violence is truly a horrific social problem. It has an immense and continuing impact not only on victims but also on Australian society as a whole. The message being communicated through these brochures at last week's forum is that it is vital for the functioning of our community and for future generations that we address the issue of domestic and family violence. This is an essential message and it is one that we do need to get out: domestic violence is not a private issue. We need the community to take a stand and to declare that enough is enough. We also need men to pledge never to commit, excuse or be silent about domestic violence.


I commend Neighbourhood Watch Australasia for their hard work to make sure that the message reaches those who might otherwise miss out on this vital information and for creating safer communities for all Australians.
