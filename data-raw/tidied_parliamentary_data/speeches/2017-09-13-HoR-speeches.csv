1 MS T. M. BUTLER: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the:


(a) last three years have seen an unprecedented global coral bleaching event which has had a devastating impact on many coral reefs ecosystems around the world, including our own Great Barrier Reef (GBR); and


(b) World Heritage Committee:


(i) met in early July in Poland and expressed its 'utmost concern' regarding the 'serious impacts from coral bleaching that have affected World Heritage properties'; and


(ii) noted that the most widely reported impacts were on the GBR and called on all States Parties to undertake 'the most ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement';


(2) recognises that:


(a) the World Heritage Centre released the first global scientific assessment of the impact of climate change on World Heritage coral reefs;


(b) the assessment found that it is a well established conclusion of international peer reviewed literature that limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre‑industrial levels provides a chance of retaining coral-dominated communities for many reef locations around the globe;


(c) the assessment also found that the GBR will start to experience severe coral bleaching twice per decade by 2035, a mere 18 years away; and


(d) this frequency of bleaching will not allow coral reefs to recover, putting the survival of the GBR in danger along with the 64,000 jobs that are dependent on it;


(3) calls on the Government to:


(a) urgently adopt a clean energy target that is fully consistent with Australia's obligations within the World Heritage Convention to protect the outstanding universal value of the GBR World Heritage area; and

(2) welcomes the funding allocated to all successful projects under Rounds One and Two of the SCP, including the Caloundra Woodworking Club's grant of $15,000 to enable the construction of an extension to their building and the grant of $8,700 to Caloundra Surf Club which enabled the purchase of an inflatable rescue boat;

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The bill provides for a broad package of measures which will strengthen the laws that safeguard children in Australia from sexual abuse.


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 complements recently legislated measures that stop convicted child sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit criminal acts of abuse against children.


The bill addresses all aspects of child sex offending. It targets inadequacies in the criminal justice system that result in outcomes that do not sufficiently punish, deter and rehabilitate offenders. It also introduces new offences directed at the use of the internet for the sexual abuse of children.




Strengthening the criminal framework throughout the offence cycle



The government is increasingly concerned about the manifestly inadequate sentences which do not sufficiently reflect the harm suffered by victims of child sex abuse or protect the community from the risk of future harm. Such sentences do not recognise that these crimes increase the demand for child abuse material.


Since 2012, less than two-thirds of Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment on conviction. This is a staggering 269 child sex offenders convicted of a Commonwealth crime released directly back into the community over the past five years. Of those who were imprisoned, the most common sentence length was 18 months and the most common non-parole period was six months. That is clearly too short.




Mandatory Minimum Sentencing



This bill introduces mandatory sentencing for specified offences to address the disparity between the seriousness of child sex offending and the lenient sentences handed down by the courts. Mandatory minimum sentences will apply to the child sex offences that attract the highest penalties and to reoffenders who have previously been convicted of separate child sex offences.


The introduction of mandatory sentencing complements a new presumption in favour of cumulative sentences for multiple child sex offences. This will ensure that the sentences imposed adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending that has occurred. 




Ensuring adequate sentencing



To strengthen the sentencing regime even further, the bill increases penalties for particular child sex offences:


1. introduces a presumption of actual imprisonment to reduce the imposition of wholly suspended sentences for child sex offenders,


2. ensures that all sex offenders, upon release from custody, are adequately supervised and subject to appropriate rehabilitative conditions,


3. overhauls the sentencing factors for all federal offenders,


4. prevents courts from discounting sentences on the basis of good character, where this has been used to facilitate the crime and


5. emphasises the importance of access to rehabilitation and treatment when sentencing child sex offenders.




Bail



The bill inserts a presumption against bail for offenders who commit serious child sex offences. The presumption recognises that such persons pose an unacceptable risk to the community and to their victims.




Post release options



The bill introduces a requirement for the courts to set treatment and supervision conditions for all child sex offenders upon sentencing to prevent such offenders from being released without supervision and appropriate treatment conditions.


This bill also introduces community safety as the primary consideration when deciding whether a federal offender's parole should be revoked, to ensure the protection of the community.


The bill will also ensure that once an offender's parole has been revoked they will serve a period of time in custody.




Criminalising emerging forms of child sexual abuse



The bill also introduces two new measures to target emerging forms of sexual offending. 


The first measure criminalises the provision of services like websites that provide access to child abuse material online. These services facilitate and encourage offending by a large, sometimes global audience and promote the production of new child abuse material.


The second measure criminalises the transmission of communications to 'groom' any person, such as parents or carers, with the aim of procuring a child for sexual activity.




Protecting vulnerable persons




The government remains committed to strengthening the protections afforded to child and other vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. This bill improves justice outcomes by limiting the retraumatisation of vulnerable witnesses by removing barriers to the admission of pre-recorded video evidence and ensuring that they are not subject to cross-examination at committal and other preliminary hearings, thus allowing them to put their best evidence forward at trial.




Aggravating factors for child sex offences



The government is deeply disturbed by the emerging trend where offenders inflict severe violence on children alongside sexual abuse. To ensure that this conduct is appropriately punished, the bill will criminalise activities that aggravate particular types of sexual offending such as subjecting a child to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or causing the death of the child.


This bill also introduces new aggravating factors that a court must take into account when sentencing an offender for a relevant offence. These would apply if the victim was under the age of 10 at the time of the offending and if multiple people were involved in the offending.


These measures send a clear message—this government will not tolerate such appalling and disgusting acts committed against children.




Conclusion



The bill contains the most comprehensive and significant Commonwealth child sex offender reforms since the introduction of the Criminal Code in 1995.


The bill is consistent with a number of recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in its recently released Criminal Justice Report.


The bill signifies this government's commitment to addressing child sex offences that occur both domestically and overseas and ensuring that the Australian community is protected from these heinous crimes.


These new measures send a strong message to child sex offenders that such abhorrent crimes will not be tolerated and, if they are committed, they will serve appropriate sentences for the horrendous things that they have done.


Debate adjourned.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (13:30):  Connie Johnson: a fearless, warm, generous, courageous woman, who, in the face of tremendous adversity, was an inspiration to people right across Australia. Connie inspired us to be aware of our bodies. Connie inspired us to be aware of any changes to our bodies. Her message to women in Australia—right across Australia—was simple: 'Don't fall into the booby trap. Be breast aware.' So, if there's one thing that we can take from her tragic passing, so young, is the fact that we've got to carry on this message. We have to carry on this message to not fall into the booby trap and to be breast aware. Australians, check your breasts regularly, and tell every single woman you know to do the same.


Connie took the fight to cancer and set up the Love Your Sister foundation with the help of her brother, Sam. The foundation has raised $5½ million for cancer research. And, during this journey, she became a world record holder through her Big Heart Project. She inspired the Canberra community to donate, and raised over $2 million for cancer research by making the biggest heart from 5c pieces.


Connie's legacy was recently honoured by the Governor-General when he presented her with the Medal of the Order of Australia. We have to keep Connie's legacy alive. I encourage everyone to donate to the Love Your Sister charity. Vale, Connie Johnson. You were such a shining light, and you will be sorely, sorely missed by all Australians.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  My question is to the Prime Minister. On Monday, the Prime Minister was asked if power prices were higher or lower since this government came to office and refused to answer. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister was asked about the average Sydney household paying $1,000 more since this government came to power and refused to answer. So Prime Minister, just answer: how much have power bills increased since the Liberals came to office?

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I'm glad to get a question on energy prices from the Leader of the Opposition. One thing we do know is that they doubled under the previous Labor government. One thing we do know is that they have increased substantially in very recent times because of the increase in the price of gas, and we know that that was because of a shortage in gas on the east coast because of a policy failure by the Labor Party, to which the member for Port Adelaide has, albeit belatedly, confessed.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  He has. Absolution will be delayed, however—he shouldn't hold his breath for that. He needs a bit more penance. We also know that there has been an increase in the price of electricity in New South Wales in recent times because of the closure of Hazelwood and because that created a large gap in dispatchable energy across the electricity market. That resulted in an increase in excess of $50 a megawatt hour in New South Wales alone.


What we're doing is ensuring that everything we can do brings those prices down. This is what we've done. Firstly, we've gone to the retailers and said, 'You've got to get in touch with your customers and tell them if they're on the wrong plan,' and, do you know, thousands of people are now—




Mr Burke:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order, on direct relevance. The question is: how much have they gone up?



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. As he knows from my previous rulings—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. As the Manager of Opposition Business knows from my previous rulings, I give even extra latitude when the preamble is about 90 per cent of the question. The Prime Minister is in order.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Thank you, Mr Speaker. We have taken steps to ensure that those people get a discount and we know that many have, indeed many journalists have. They have written about it with pleasure and approval in their columns recently—hundreds of dollars. There is no compassion for the Press Gallery on that side of the House, no compassion for their household bills and no compassion for the blackout bills they will have to pay for if they don't get action on energy prices. We are bringing down gas prices already.


In terms of dispatchable energy, we are taking practical steps with AGL on Liddell. One obvious option to avoid it creating a big gap is to keep that power station running for longer, so we are exploring that with the company. In the longer term, we are building the biggest renewable power system in the country's history since Snowy 1. Snowy Hydro 2.0, which will make renewables reliable, is derided by the Labor Party as a stunt. They have no policies and no plan. The only thing that we know Australians will have to pay for is the blackout bill.

Mr VASTA
 (Bonner) (14:15):  My question is to the Treasurer.

Why is this important for jobs in my electorate? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches?

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (14:15):  I thank the member for Bonner for his question. A key part of the Prime Minister's plan to put downward pressure on rising electricity prices is to have a durable investment framework that will encourage investment in new sources of energy supply, but also to ensure that we have base-load energy supply to support the growth of our economy, to ensure that businesses don't shut down, as they had to do in South Australia because of the failed energy policies and experiments that are the policy of the federal Labor Party. That is the way that Australians can get more hours; when their businesses stay open. That is the way Australians can get jobs; when the businesses they work for can stay open. Our policy is designed to put downward pressure on electricity prices in order to do that. 


It is very important when you land on an investment framework that you ensure that you embrace all of the potential energy sources available to you, that you have an all-of-the-above approach, that you ensure you are taking advantage of the traditional advantages that we have as a country with our traditional sources, such as coal, but also to ensure that we are taking advantage of the renewable energy resources as well. The Labor Party is standing in the way of us achieving that type of durable investment framework, because they are imposing a coal veto on Australia. They are putting a coal veto on an investment framework that can secure base-load energy support for Australia. They announced it before the last election. In their policy released in April before the last election, they said they would introduce a framework to kick-start the closure of Australia's coal-fired power plants. That was the plan. That was the design. That was the intention.


The member for Shortland, the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson—the whole crew—signed up to a plan to shut down coal-fired power stations in this country. In fact, they went further. They said they would retire them. They said they would retire Australia's existing coal-fired generation. They had the policies to back that up, because they had a 45 per cent emissions reduction policy, which is twice what the government's is. The cost to jobs and the cost to wages and the cost to the economy would follow from that. They would be responsible for that. On top of that, they have a 50 per cent renewable energy target that the shadow Treasurer cannot even explain, let alone own up to when asked about it. 


No-one who works in the coal industry or in traditional power generation should be in any doubt that this Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party are on their side. They are not on their side. They can count on this side of the House. As we have seen at Whyalla and in Portland, this government, the Turnbull government, stands up for jobs in those industries, while those opposite have a policy to shut them down. They are cheering on the closure of Hazelwood and they are cheering on AGL as they close down Liddell. (Time expired)

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (14:22):  My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. In a letter enclosing the interim investigation into New South Wales water management, Ken Matthews stated: 


… compliance and enforcement arrangements in NSW have been ineffectual and require significant and urgent improvement.


He stated that 'individual cases of alleged noncompliance have remained unresolved for far too long' and that 'a systemic fix is required'. Given Ken Matthews' findings and water theft allegations in at least two states, do you now agree we need an urgent judicial inquiry into the implementation of the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan?

Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:23):  I thank the honourable member for her question and note that the Ken Matthews inquiry which she refers to, which has been diligently carried out, was actually instigated by the coalition in New South Wales. It was instigated by Niall Blair. What we had in that inquiry was three qualified ICAC investigators, people with experience in ICAC, and the information that they have brought forward is now available if further prosecutions need to occur. That goes on the back of Hanlon referring himself to ICAC, and I note there have been discussions that he certainly has questions to answer there. On top of that, of course, we had the independent inquiry by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority which is currently underway, and we also have an auditor's inquiry as well as a Senate inquiry. ICAC is well and truly capable of sending people to jail, as we've seen with a couple of members who were formerly in the New South Wales Labor Party, now residing at Her Majesty's pleasure in respective institutions around town. We never, ever condone water theft. We don't condone any form of theft, and we certainly don't condone water theft. In pursuit of this we will make sure that, if any of these allegations stack up, they will be pursued to the full extent of the law.


What I can say also, and it is important, is that at this point they remain allegations. I am also aware of other issues that have been brought forward with regard to defamation cases, so we have to be very careful that we differentiate between allegations and proof.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:13):  It was four years ago last week that the Liberal Party made a memorable promise to the Australian people. On a whim, it would appear, the Leader of the Liberal Party then said that there would be 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions' and 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS' under a Liberal government that might be elected in 2013, and, within only a few months, each and every one of those promises was smashed in the 2014 budget.


But Australians also remember another solemn promise made by the Liberal Party in the lead-in to that election in 2013, and that was that Australian households would be $550 better off in their energy prices if a Liberal government were elected in 2013. And this, perhaps unlike the other promise, was not a whim at the end of an election campaign. This was a promise that the member for Warringah repeated day in, day out, as he angrily marched up and down the country railing against climate and energy policy. Well now, into the fifth year of this government, Australians also know that that was a lie as well. Far from being $550 better off under this government, the average Sydney household is almost $1,000 worse off just in its electricity bills since 2013—$1,000 worse off. That is a $1,500 gap every year. Indeed, it's likely to be a gap that grows next year.


The Prime Minister, in question time just now, sought to deny the AER data. When I tried to table the data to show the government what we were relying on in those figures, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House denied me the ability to do that. So what I will do is read into the transcript the AER data that The Australian newspaper published on their front page on 10 July 2017. It said:


The regulator data shows the average Sydney household has been hit with annual electricity bill rises of 11.6, 11.7, 10.6, 10 and 10.8 per cent since June 2013 …


Cumulatively, that is a 75 per cent increase in power bills since 2013, when this government was elected. An average household power bill is $935 up, not $550 down, from 2013. Businesses also haven't been spared from this. Businesses have been talking to members on both sides of the House, I'm sure, about the power contract negotiations they're now subject to that are seeing power prices go up by as much as 100 per cent for businesses across Australia under this government.


This government's stunning failure has also seen closures of seven old coal-fired power stations across the system. That amounts to a loss of 4,000 megawatts of power, which is equivalent to six million households, or every household in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne combined. Old coal-fired power stations close. We on this side of the House recognise that reality. The problem, though, is that there is no additional supply being built. The Prime Minister talked about 2½ thousand megawatts of gas-fired generation being added to the system in the last decade. That was all under us. Not a single new gas-fired generator has been added under this government. In a shocking indictment of this government's failure on energy policy, the AEMO reports last week warned that—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr BUTLER:
  That was opened well before you were there. The AEMO reports last week warn that two-thirds of our nation are now at risk of blackout—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! The Minister for the Environment and Energy will remain silent.




Mr BUTLER:
  Two-thirds of our nation is at risk of blackout in coming summers because while these stations have closed under this government's watch, nothing has been built to replace that generation, and we are short.


It is not just skyrocketing power prices and the risk of blackouts that have emerged under this government; every other indicator of energy policy has been a stunning failure on this government's watch. Pollution is up and gas prices are up—and this Prime Minister won't pull the trigger, as my colleague the member for Blaxland has been saying time and time again over the course of this week. In the renewable energy industry, a massive jobs driver around the world, one in three jobs, according to the ABS, has been lost since this government came to power, while jobs in that industry around the world have skyrocketed by 45 per cent.


As Australians open up their power bills with skyrocketing prices, and as they contemplate the risk of blackouts across two-thirds of the nation in coming summers, they understand who is to blame for this mess: this Prime Minister; his predecessor, the member for Warringah; and the minister for energy. We know why. It is because, as in so many other areas of policy, this government had a plan to dismantle and destroy policy but put nothing in its place. For more than four years this country has been without an energy policy.


If only we had a plan. If only there was a blueprint somewhere to get us out of the deep energy crisis this government has plunged the nation into. Of course, we do have a plan—it's a report that this government commissioned from the Chief Scientist of Australia, Alan Finkel. It's a blueprint that, if implemented, will deliver more renewable energy, more gas-fired power, more batteries and storage, more reliability into the system and, most importantly of all, lower prices for Australian households and businesses. It's a blueprint that has been endorsed by the states and territories and endorsed by industry.


This morning, we read an article in Fairfax—'Turnbull retreats on clean energy'—that it's not going to be backed by this government. A report commissioned by this government, from its own Chief Scientist, is not going to be backed by this weak Prime Minister. I think it was pointed out in question time that one MP from that side of the House said to Fairfax:


… if we were going to do Finkel's [clean energy target], it would be done already.


And you have to wonder why? There's a deep crisis. There's a clear blueprint that the government itself commissioned. There's strong consensus behind it. There's an opposition willing to engage with it. Well, we know the answer; it has a familiar ring to it. We saw it in The Australian newspaper in an article headed, 'Tony Abbott fuels push from backbench against clean energy target'. In it, the member for Warringah very helpfully outlines his alternative energy policy, which is the heart of the problem here—that is, the coalition's focus is not on reliable power, the coalition's focus is not on affordable power, the coalition is obsessed with this fantasy that Australia's energy future lies in building new coal-fired power stations. That is the plan that the member for Warringah is forcing on this government. We know it is a fantasy. We know from the lending industry, from the banks and from equity investors that there is not going to be a new coal-fired power station built in this country.


Everyone knows that the AEMO report that was released last week on dispatchable power was commissioned by the coalition in the hope that it would recommend new coal-fired power stations as a solution to their energy crisis, but, of course, it didn't do that. It is time for this Prime Minister to stop indulging the fantasy that the member for Warringah drives: that the future of Australia's energy is in new coal-fired power stations.


The future of Australia's energy sector was outlined by the Chief Scientist in a blueprint commissioned by this government. It's more renewable energy. It's more gas-fired generation. It's more batteries and other storage systems. It's more reliability in the system and the lower prices for consumers, businesses, and households that that will deliver. This Prime Minister is weak in refusing to argue against and resist the push by the member for Warringah to take us back to the 20th century. His decision to play politics, the personal abuse, the name-calling, the misleading statements about clear data from their own regulators about what has happened to power prices under this government's watch—it means one thing: Australians will continue to suffer higher prices and they'll continue to suffer the risk of blackouts across summers in New South Wales, in Victoria and in South Australia, across the system, representing two-thirds of the nation's population. If this government doesn't stand up to the member for Warringah and endorse the blueprint delivered by the Chief Scientist, Australian households and businesses will hold this government to account.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (15:23):  Well, we know that the Labor Party—the party of blackouts and the party of a doubling of electricity prices the last time they were in office—have now sought to repeat the mistakes of their brethren in the Labor states of Victoria and South Australia. They seek to take this energy horror show national. That is what the Labor Party want to do with their 45 per cent emissions reduction target, which will cost the Australian economy billions of dollars in lost productivity, lost economic growth, job destruction and investment lost. That will be the legacy of that policy. Combine that with the reckless 50 per cent renewable energy target, which they said to the Australian people that they would legislate but that they are now seeking to walk away from. Also combine that with their policies to adopt, right across the board, emissions reduction without understanding its true consequence and impact on jobs, investment and growth.


On this side of the House we have been making positive inroads into the energy question. We have ensured that we are providing more domestic gas for users across the country. We've already seen announcements by Origin and Santos that more gas will be made available to the domestic market. We have also seen significant reforms that we've undertaken in the gas pipelines to ensure that there's more competition, more transparency and, ultimately, lower prices. And with transportation of gas being up to 15 per cent of the gas bill and the electricity bill, this can be quite a significant component of reducing power prices. We've taken action with the networks, the poles-and-wire companies that make up the 50 per cent of the household power bill. When Labor was in office, they saw a massive rise in the gold-plating of the networks but they did nothing. They stood still; they sat on their hands. It's the coalition who said we're going to abolish the limited merits review process and put through this House legislation which, now in the Senate, the Labor Party is seeking to push off to committee. Labor didn't do anything when they were in office to rein in the power of the network companies. Indeed, when they were in office we saw a regulator rate of return of around 10 per cent. That has fallen to just above six per cent today, which is worth hundreds of dollars to an Australian consumer. 


We on this side have been doing work with the retailers. The retail component of the bill is significant. We've seen high margins, particularly in states like Victoria. We've asked the ACCC to look into that market and to look at the operations of the particular retailers around the country. But the concessions that we're able to win from the retailers are going to be very significant in getting lower prices because, again, the Labor Party did absolutely nothing.


The member for Bendigo has sold out the blue-collar workers in her electorate. The member for Bendigo has nothing to say about electricity prices. The member for Bendigo does nothing to improve the household power bills. If she did, she would speak out in favour of the Turnbull government's efforts to ensure that more information, better information, more transparent information is made available to households by their energy retailers. The fact that 50 per cent of Australian households have not changed retailers or contracts in the last five years despite benefits or gains or savings of more than $1,000 being available to them is quite significant. That is why we've taken action.


As the Prime Minister has indicated, a key part of the energy story, as we transition from more synchronous generation to less synchronous generation, as we move from a system where lots of people are on the grid to more people being off the grid, is having storage in place for wind and for solar in particular. The Labor Party didn't put in place any preparations for the necessary storage. Whether it's the pumped hydro schemes that you see around the country or indeed around the world, which are so vital in providing storage for renewable power, or battery storage, we saw nothing from those opposite. It's only the coalition that has put storage at the top of the policy agenda. And we've started to see big investments underway—whether it's through the Kidston pumped hydro facility that is being looked at in Queensland, whether it's the one in Cultana in South Australia or whether it's Snowy Hydro 2.0.


You have a premier in South Australia, Jay Weatherill, whose only energy policy is to spend $110 million on diesel generators, take more coal-fired power from Victoria and then also invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a gas-fired power generator. But then the big daddy of them all was to have a battery from a bit of Hollywood and a few doughnuts on sale. He thought a battery could solve—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Yes, he had doughnuts at the launch. He thought that some doughnuts, some Hollywood, some Elon Musk and a big battery would be the answer for South Australia's energy woes! But that battery can keep South Australia going for as much as five minutes. That is what the storage answer from the Labor Party is whereas we are investing in Snowy Hydro 2.0, which can add up to 350,000 megawatt hours of storage. That compares to the 129 megawatt hours you get from Elon Musk's battery and some doughnuts and some Hollywood in South Australia.


So the coalition has taken steps around networks, steps around retailers, steps around storage, steps around gas and we are going to see a much more stable energy system. We quickly accepted the 49 Finkel recommendations to ensure that large generators give a minimum of three years notice before they can close—not to mention the requirement that, from now on, wind and solar provide their own levels of storage, which previously wasn't the case. They're just some of the recommendations that we accepted from the Finkel review which will make a difference to the stability of the system.


The Prime Minister was concerned that, with the predicted closure of Liddell in 2022, there would be a supply shortfall in the market. That's why we asked the Australian Energy Market Operator to give us a report into the level of dispatchable power we need in the system, and they indicated that, were Liddell to close in 2022, there would be a 1,000-megawatt shortage of supply. What did the member for Port Adelaide say? He said that this is not a problem. He even challenged the premise of the Australian Energy Market Operator's own findings. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? The Leader of the Opposition said: 'This is a distraction. This is the wrong priority. This is an issue for down the track.' An issue for down the track? This is an issue for today.


That is why the coalition is taking steps, reaching out to AGL and asking them to consider keeping Liddell open for an additional five years or selling it to another party. That is what the AGL board will consider. But the reality is that the Labor Party turned their back on the Australian Energy Market Operator and have turned their back on the recognition that when they were in office they ignored the warnings from the Australian Energy Market Operator and from their own energy white paper about the need to ensure sufficient gas supplies in the domestic market and not to export all their gas overseas.


So we're taking actions across a number of fronts, but the Labor Party is in denial, because that is the party that has seen, in Victoria and in South Australia, a heightened risk of blackouts. My colleagues the member for Chisholm and the member for Deakin would be interested to know that, according to this AEMO report, the state with the highest risk of blackout coming to the end of this year and the state that AEMO is most concerned about is Victoria, where there is a 43 per cent risk of load shedding or supply shortfalls. The member for McMillan would be interested to know that in his own state the Daniel Andrews Labor government has closed down Hazelwood, has restricted gas, has put in a renewable-energy-only target and is doing nothing to ensure the affordability and reliability of the system. The member for Port Adelaide should be ashamed to associate himself with that failed, big experiment in South Australia, from a tired old Labor government, nearly 16 years old. The Labor Party is the party of higher prices and a less stable power system.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (15:33):  What a tired charade of a speech from the minister! Even he didn't have the energy to completely utter the myths and untruths they perpetuate. I feel like saying to them, 'Could someone get him an energy drink.' He looked like he was about to collapse halfway through it, and that's because his heart really isn't in it, because this is about position No. 8 for him and this government on energy policy. The truth is they're in their fifth year of government and have managed to completely mismanage energy policy over that entire time. And why have they done that? Because they don't believe in anything except for the petty pursuit of electoral power. Ultimately it's my constituents and the constituents of everyone on this side of the House who pay the price for this mismanagement.


The government have made massive mistakes in energy policy. The first one was that they abolished the emissions trading scheme. By abolishing the emissions trading scheme, they destroyed certainty in the market and destroyed the price signal that was bringing in gas-fired power, which was always going to be the complement to renewable energy. All the modelling for all the legislation that they voted for at given points—the Prime Minister certainly did; he seemed to forget about it in question time, but he voted for it—assumed that gas-fired power would complement renewable energy coming into the market. But they abolished the emissions trading scheme. They dillydallied around the Renewable Energy Target, but eventually they decided to keep it. That meant that more renewable energy came into the market. At the same time, they destroyed investment certainty for dispatchable power, and that's why we're in our current situation.


In their four years of government, we saw seven coal-fired power stations close down. And three of them were in states with Liberal governments. So you can't blame Labor for it. You perpetuate this blame game, but closures of coal-fired power stations occurred under Liberal state governments—seven coal-fired power stations with a total combined capacity of 4,000 megawatts. AEMO has pointed out that we've lost 5,000 megawatts of base-load power over the last decade—and 4,000 of the 5,000 megawatts have come under this government. So they can do their blame game, but the truth is they have been mismanaging power policy since September 2013. 


And what have we seen now? They're walking away from the clean energy target. The minister and the Prime Minister don't have the ticker to take it to their party room. And what's the result of all this? We've seen a 75 per cent increase in power prices in Sydney. That is, on average, a $1,000 hit to consumers in our largest city. And that's for people doing it tough, that's for mums and dads on really tight incomes—when wages growth is actually negative, a $1,000 hit to power prices. We've seen a third of renewable energy jobs go. At the same time, renewable energy jobs have gone ahead in leaps and bounds everywhere else—2.5 million clean technology jobs in the United States alone—and we've lost a third of ours.


Why have we done this? Why has this occurred? Because we've got a spineless Prime Minister bereft of any ticker. And there's probably only one person who's more ashamed of the Prime Minister than the people on this side, and that's 'Leather Jacket Malcolm', the member for Wentworth, the man who went on Q&A with his leather jacket, the man who crossed the floor to vote for the CPRS—although he forgot about it today. He's probably more ashamed of his behaviour than even the Labor members of parliament. He wouldn't recognise the man he is now. He is a man who has junked every belief to stay in power, a man who has junked every intellectual belief in the market to stay in power. And it's just not doing him any good. We've seen 19 Newspolls in a row. There are 11 more to go. If he repeats the bluster we saw in question time, they're coming soon. 


I've got a message to the Prime Minister and the government. If you're going to be Abbott-light, if you're just going to ape the member for Warringah, there's no point. At least that guy believed in something. He believed in the wrong things, but he believed in what he said. We get three-word slogans from the current Prime Minister. We get the blame game. We get a continuation of the chaos in the energy sector, a continuation of electricity bills $1,000 higher. We get more power stations closing down, more uncertainty and more pressure on our consumers and our households who are doing it tough. Shame on you, government.

"Crewther, Chris, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (15:38):  I rise to oppose the hypocrisy of this motion by the opposition and to, in particular, support the coalition's policy, as well as the Minister for the Environment and Energy's statements before. We need to ensure energy stability, reliability and affordability by our traditional power sources while enabling investment in renewable energy, battery storage and new technologies. We must ensure the lights stay on, and the prices stay low for Australian households and businesses, including in Dunkley.


Ours is a technology-neutral and non-ideological approach. So what are we doing? And what is the opposition's previous track record on this, as well as alternative policies? Firstly, on what we are doing, business as usual is not an option. In July, the COAG Energy Council agreed to immediately act on 49 of the 50 recommendations of Finkel's independent review, which will help drive down prices. This includes a new generator reliability obligation requiring intermittent sources of generation, such as solar, to provide an appropriate level of backup. It also includes energy security obligations to provide the necessary support services to intermittent sources of generation; a new requirement for large generations as well, to give a minimum three years' notice before closing; and, in particular, it calls on states and territories such as Victoria to accept the Chief Scientist's recommendation to adopt a science-based approach to new gas supply and to end their arbitrary bans and moratoria.


On base-load power: the Australian Energy Market Operator's dispatchability report confirms that the accelerated withdrawal of base-load power, as pushed by those opposite, creates major risks. Base-load power is what anchors our electricity system. Government will exaggerate work around this strategic reserve, which will beef up how AEMO currently contracts for reserve generation to manage summer peaks. The Prime Minister has also started discussions with AGL on keeping Liddell operating longer, which is important for families and businesses in terms of affordability. Indeed, we are also working with ARENA on multiple pumped hydro projects in multiple states, and developing Snowy Hydro 2.0, which will increase the generation of the scheme by 50 per cent and add 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy to the National Energy Market. That is enough to power 500,000 homes.


On energy affordability: too many families are not on the best power deals. Fifty per cent of households have not moved retailers or contracts in the past five years, even though savings are potentially significant. So the Prime Minister has secured agreement from retailers on immediate measures, which will be backed up by law, to put families and businesses first. This includes contacting all the customers who are now on expired discounts and telling them how they can save and requiring companies to report to the government and the ACCC on what they are doing to get families onto a better deal, as well as requiring companies to inform customers when their discount benefits end and ensuring that families and individuals on hardship payments will not lose benefits for late payments. Retailers will also contact another one million customers on standing offers, which are normally the most expensive rates.


The Turnbull government will also legislate to remove the ability of networks to appeal the merits of decisions by the Australian Energy Regulator, removing the ability of regulated energy network companies to game the system at the expense of consumers. This reform is critical, given that network costs make up a large proportion of household bills.


On gas: we have finalised tough new regulations in the gas sector to give Australian customers priority access to gas supplies before gas is exported. And we are calling, as I said before, on states and territories to drop their mindless bans on gas exploration and so forth.


At the same time, we are also renewing and investing in our renewable energy market. For example, Australia's emissions per capita and per unit of GDP are currently at their lowest level in 27 years, and Australia is on track to beat its 2020 target of five per cent below 2000 levels by 224 million tonnes. This is better than the 755 million tonnes by which Labor was estimating to fall short in 2012.



So, what's Labor's alternative? They're pushing a dangerous mix of policies that will hit energy security and affordability: a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030; a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030; an emissions intensity scheme; Labor's climate action plan, forcing the closure of coal-fired power plants; and no energy security plan. Labor's track record, whether it be on the carbon tax or other measures, shows their hypocrisy around this issue, and I call on them to take proper action, like we are doing. (Time expired)

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (15:43):  Colleagues, who said this?:


I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.


That was the old Malcolm Turnbull, the bloke that used to get around in the leather jacket—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kingsford Smith will refer to members by their titles.




Mr THISTLETHWAITE:
  The old Prime Minister, who used to get around on Q&A in his leather jacket, talking about climate change and effective policy on energy.


Who said this: 'Abbott's climate change policy is BS'? Now, of course, I'm using an acronym there for the last word in the title of this particular article that appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald on 7 December 2009. That, of course, was the old Prime Minister, who was speaking then of the member for Warringah when he was the Prime Minister, and the climate change and energy policy that this government had. The member for Wentworth, as he was at the time, said that he would:


… tell a few home truths about the farce that the Coalition's policy, or lack of policy, on climate change has descended into.


He then went on to describe in quite colourful language the member for Warringah's—as the then Prime Minister—climate change policy and what a complete joke it was. Once again, that was the old member for Wentworth. He's now adopted, holus-bolus, the policy that he once described as complete BS. Those were the days when the member for Wentworth had principles and believed in something. He was the bloke who actually crossed the floor to vote for Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme when he believed in taking action on climate change.


That was, of course, before he was elected to the leadership of the Liberal Party and before he did that dodgy backroom deal with the right wing of his party and the National Party, a deal, by the way, that he refuses to release publicly—so much for transparency. He sold out his beliefs and sold out the future of all our kids through refusing to take real action on climate change. 'Turncoat' Turnbull, the ultimate sellout, not only adopted Tony Abbott's view of climate change and energy policy but now actively advocates for it as his policy. He once described it as BS.


Australians are asking: what happened to the old member for Wentworth? What a disappointment he is—some might say a fizzer. The Australian people are suffering because this bloke sold out his principles on climate change and energy policy. I'm talking about people in my electorate—for instance, the pensioner who now can't afford to switch on their heater at night to warm themselves because of energy prices; the family struggling to pay their bill and having to enter into a repayment plan with their energy retailer because they simply can't afford the increase in the cost of their electricity; and the small business that has to go out of business because they can't afford to pay their energy bills anymore. In fact, in the city that I live in, the average energy bill has risen by $1,000 since this government came to office. All of this is because this government is in chaos and cannot make a decision about energy policy to guarantee investor certainty and bring on additional supply.


There are two basic reasons why Australians are facing a massive increase in their energy prices. One is that Liberal governments privatised the network. They privatised the poles and wires and the generators in New South Wales and Victoria and South Australia. Governments don't own them anymore, so they can't force these private companies to bring on additional supply. And guess what? Those companies are not investing in new supply because they know that the federal government have made a shambles of energy policy, are chaotic and can't make a decision. They can't make a decision on a clean energy target. The government actually asked Professor Alan Finkel, the Chief Scientist, to advise them on what they should do on energy policy. He issued a report, and the Prime Minister and the energy minister went away and then said, 'No, we can't adopt that. That's far too revolutionary for our party. Our party will never agree with a clean energy target. Go away and rewrite your report.' So Professor Finkel did. He went away and rewrote it, at significant cost to the taxpayer. He watered it down. And guess what? They still can't make a decision on it. They still won't make a decision on a clean energy target, and because of that all Australians are paying through the nose through their energy costs going up. It's an absolute disgrace. Because this government can't make a decision, Australians are paying for it.


Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to table an article from The Sydney Morning Herald on 7 December 2009, 'Abbott's climate change policy is BS', by Malcolm Turnbull.


Leave granted.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2017-09-13,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (15:48):  I'm glad we're discussing energy and energy policy today because it will further shine a light on the extent to which those members opposite have turned their backs on coalminers, on the mining industry and on blue-collar jobs. The extent to which they've done that is quite breathtaking. They've cut them loose, and they've cut them loose in the name of transitioning to a new economy. That's what they call it, but what it really means is they're cutting those workers loose and they're all going to lose their jobs. That's what they're on about on that side of the House. They are betraying the very people who built the Labor Party: the workers in the blue-collar jobs and the miners. They are the people that they are betraying. The reason that they're doing it is pretty clear: they're terrified of the inner-city Greens. They're trying to out-green the Greens in the inner cities in Melbourne, in Sydney and in Brisbane. That's what they're trying to do. It's breathtaking, but it's also disappointing.


I grew up in the Hunter Valley and I know those coalmining communities up there pretty well. I grew up with them. I did. Whenever you played sport out in the coalfields you knew you were in for a tough day at the office. They were cold, hard playing fields; they were tough competitors out there. But I tell you what, they're resilient people out there. They're tough competitors, but they're resilient and good communities. They don't deserve what's happening to them. They don't deserve to be cut loose. They don't deserve the betrayal, the abject betrayal, which is going on at the moment, from those opposite. They have been betrayed. All of those coalfields communities in the Hunter have been betrayed. They've essentially been told that they're all going to lose their jobs and that coalmining is finished—it's just a matter of time.


Let's have a look at the Calare electorate and the coal and power jobs that those opposite want to cut loose. Let's have a look at Mudgee. In Mudgee, we've got about 2,500 people working directly in the coal industry. There are probably another 500 or so working indirectly in the coal industry. That's about 3,000 people in the Mudgee area alone. When I've had an issue with the coal industry before, I've called them out. We saved the drip on the Goulburn River just near Ulan. We got that resolved.


What they want to do is to cut the whole industry loose. That's what they're doing. Look at what's happening over in Lithgow, where you've got the Mount Piper Power Station and the Springvale mine. Those two operations together probably have over 600 jobs at stake. Those on that side of the House want to end coal-fired power generation. That's what they want to do, and it's scary. Look at a community like Lithgow. Coal was instrumental in building Lithgow. So many people from the Lithgow community and the coalmining community have supported the Labor Party over the years only to be betrayed by it now. It's unbelievable and breathtaking at the same time. Mount Piper Power Station needs to remain open. It supplies the equivalent of 15 per cent of the electricity supply of New South Wales. There are many people, including me, who would like to see Mount Piper expanded, but not those opposite. 


We still have outstanding legal issues regarding the Springvale mine. I don't deign to provide any comment on the Springvale situation, but I hope all relevant parties are able to work to find a resolution to all outstanding issues over there, because under Labor Mount Piper would close. That's what would happen. The Mount Piper Power Station would close under a Labor government. It's terrifying for those communities who've always supported Labor through the years. 


I would say to Labor, the Greens and representatives of Lithgow City Council: 'Don't stand with the Greens when their roadshows roll into Lithgow. Don't stand with them and tell those power workers and coal workers that their futures mean nothing and that they won't have jobs.' I would say that to the councillors of Lithgow: 'Tell the coalmining community of Lithgow and the people of Lithgow that you think the coal industry has a future. Tell them where you stand.' All Lithgow city councillors should tell everyone where they stand: 'Don't stand with the Greens. Don't have photo ops with them in local newspapers. Don't tell them that we have to end coal and that we're aware we have to move on.' 


These things are happening now. Their allies are doing it now in Lithgow when the Greens' roadshows roll into Lithgow. They need to stop it. Don't have a bet each way. Don't be like Labor and have a bet each way and sell your constituents out. On the one hand they say, 'Oh, yes, we support coal,' but on the other hand they're working, doing everything in their power, to end coalmining and coal-powered generation in this state and in this country.

Ms HUSAR:
  Deputy Speaker, this is outrageous. I haven't even gone past the first page of my speech notes because of the constant interjections. But, as I was saying, the weather station that records the temperature in the Western Sydney area is located next to the lake system, which is obviously going to record the temperature at a much lower rate than anywhere else. We've got the heat island effect out there. Anybody who lives in Glenmore Park, Jordan Springs or the new development of Thornton will know that it is up to three degrees hotter than anywhere else in Western Sydney. 


When we talk about an energy crisis, you can appreciate how hot it gets and how much we are relying on power to cool our homes and also swimming pools so that people can actually cool down. But what gets Western Sydney residents very hot is this incompetent government's energy crisis. Day after day we come in here looking for answers from those opposite, and all they can do is blame us. Well, I've got some news for them: they are in government; they've had the opportunity to fix it. To continue to come in here and blame Labor for something that may or may not have taken place four or five years ago is their incompetence on display on a grand scale. 


They've let this problem fester and get to the point where it is now. The time has come though; summer is now on our doorstep. It is 35 degrees today in Western Sydney. It's the 13th day of spring and it's already 35 degrees. The rise of blackouts this summer will be higher than ever before and the residents of Western Sydney have had enough. They've had to swallow the lies and the nasty policies from those opposite and promises of electricity prices going down by $550. They're not idiots. They're not stupid. They know that their prices have gone up and are up to $1,000 higher. And this government has taken away the energy supplements paid to people who can least afford it. This is an outrage, an absolute blight on a government that will leave no track record other than destruction. Take that, Calare! It's a disgrace.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (15:59):  The gall of the member for Port Adelaide—to come into this place and want to talk about energy when he is the person who has admitted that the Labor Party knowingly allowed gas producers to export gas without providing for gas to be provided to the domestic market in a way that would keep prices under control—is extraordinary. When David Speers asked the member for Port Adelaide whether or not Labor received warnings when in government about the impact of their gas policy, which would enable the LNG suppliers to basically export pretty much all of the gas and not provide very much at all to Australia, he said yes—'Everyone knew there was going to be an impact on prices.' And yet the member for Port Adelaide, and all of his colleagues on the other side of the chamber, let that happen. What that has required is for this government to step in and go through the process of placing controls on the export of LNG, because all of the modelling says that the biggest factor that has been driving up wholesale prices of gas and, therefore, of electricity in the last twelve months is the excessive export of LNG. The member for Port Adelaide is the one who has admitted that the Labor Party was responsible for that, and that they were warned about that and they did it anyway. So it is quite extraordinary. You would think he would be so sheepish as to not want to draw attention to this extraordinary policy failure, but, nonetheless, he has.


The Labor Party's policies in this area have one consistent theme, and that is: higher prices. Not controlling LNG exports—what does that mean? Higher prices. A 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030, which will wreak havoc on baseload power in this country and force the mass closure of existing baseload power facilities—what does that mean? Higher prices. That's what the member for Port Adelaide and the Labor Party want—a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. And they are so unashamed about this that, when they talk about coal-fired power stations, they don't talk about them closing down over time, as part of an orderly process; they say they want to 'kickstart' the closure of coal-fired power stations. What does that mean? That means a loss of jobs in those communities, like the Hunter in New South Wales, and again it means less supply and higher prices. That is the member for Port Adelaide's policy. A 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030? Again, that will mean less base-load power, and less base-load power means higher prices. We saw it with the Hazelwood closure. We've seen it with the excessive export of LNG. Their policy over there is to have more and more of that, which means higher and higher prices.


We've seen the practical reality—the canary in the coalmine, so to speak—in South Australia, where 1.7 million people were out of power because of the extraordinary and crazy renewable energy policies of the South Australian government. We saw prices up by 50 per cent for business customers after the closure of the Northern power station, and the member for Port Adelaide called that a 'hiccup'. Do you think that's a hiccup, Deputy Speaker Coulton? Well, if you are one of those small businesses in South Australia that are employing locals and your power price goes up by 50 per cent, that's not a hiccup—that's a disaster. All of these Labor policies mean higher prices.


In contrast, we have a clear agenda of reducing power prices: abolishing the limited merits review, so that the poles and wires companies can't game the system as they have in recent years, which has led to $6½ billion of additional costs for consumers; requiring the retailers to proactively get in touch with their customers to tell them about better deals and requiring the ACCC to follow up to ensure that the retailers actually do that, because people can save hundreds and hundreds of dollars just by working to get a better deal; and, importantly, moving to put in place export controls on gas, to fix up the mess created by the member for Port Adelaide and those opposite, which is already having a meaningful impact on reducing the wholesale price of gas that gets bid into the National Electricity Market. That is a very positive thing for reducing the pressure on household energy bills.


So, over there, you have a litany of previous failures and you have a series of new policies which will make things far, far worse. On this side of the House, you have practical steps being taken right now to reduce energy prices. Those opposite should be ashamed of their energy policies.

Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (16:04):  This government's paralysis on energy policy is astounding. While their members take to the airwaves decrying the state of our energy sector, power bills continue to rise while they do nothing because they're too busy arguing amongst themselves. Meanwhile, people in my electorate continue to face increasing power bills, which have continued to rise in the five years since this government was elected. On top of that, my most vulnerable constituents are losing access to the clean energy supplement. This means that, while power bills continue to increase, pensioners are losing the financial support to help them afford it. That double hit will put even more financial strain on the people who need it least. All the while, this government continues to focus on itself, deciding that a moment of crisis would be a great time to discuss the future of a 50-year-old coal-fired power station. If there isn't a policy supporting the plan, or any buyers interested in investing, it is impossible to think that a responsible government would keep such a plant operational. The mere fact is that the technology in these plants is so old they can't generate at optimum levels any longer without significant investment. 


AGL is looking to the future, and that is exactly what this government should do. Focusing on one ageing plant does nothing to solve the immediate problems we face in solving systemic policy failures in the energy sector. If anything, even with this one issue, the government has somehow managed to make its approach to energy policy even less clear. What hope do we have of resolving this situation when they can't even agree to implement the recommendations of a review conducted with the express purpose of guaranteeing energy security and reliability? Instead of creating certainty, they've placed the energy sector inside a policy vacuum. This lack of direction and indecision has created a situation where energy companies have not invested due to uncertainty, starving the sector of vital investment. We are now entering summer with the Australian Energy Market Operator warning of deep-seated problems with our national electricity grid creating a scenario where many households will face blackouts and reliability issues. Given that the government made so much noise about how they were going to take action on power bills and create a more robust energy sector, people have the right to feel betrayed when the generation capacity available in our network now is 4,000 megawatts less than when this government took office, and nothing has been done to fix it. 


It's extraordinary arrogance for those opposite to pretend they have anything to be proud of. Through their inaction and carelessness over the past four years, we have now reached a critical point and they seem content to continue to do nothing. Households in my electorate and across the country will continue to hurt under this absence of clarity of policy, particularly the continued prevarication around implementing a clean energy target, a measure that has been endorsed by key business figures and experts from the energy and finance sector as well as consumer groups. 


While the government continues to avoid its job on making a decision, the market won't invest. Companies like AGL have real responsibilities to their shareholders, their board and AEMO. They have real governance requirements, and their businesses have decisions to make. Four years of policy paralysis has seen wholesale power prices double, reliability of electricity supply fall, and carbon pollution rise by 1.5 per cent in just the last quarter. Getting CEOs of power companies in for a chat about power prices and having them write to their customers to tell them about discounts that might be available on their bills is not a substitute for an energy policy As the wholesale price of power has doubled in the last four years, a small discount is not making any real difference to the lives of people in my electorate. Power bills are still more than $1,000 more than they were, and that is pretty hard to find when wages have stagnated and everything else is rising. 


The evidence and the experience from around the world is clear: in order to ensure dispatchable power and reliability, we need to create policy certainty. We need to have bipartisan support. With policy certainty, businesses will invest, banks will finance and jobs will grow. Planning and market certainty will ensure that there are enough different types of generation options to provide for a reliable, safe and cheaper electricity grid. This is what the people of my electorate expect of their government. Stop pointscoring and actually govern.

Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (16:09):  The negligence and inconsistency from the Labor-Greens alliance on the issue of energy is nothing short of appalling. Not only have they sold out the blue-collar workers across Australia but they've done the same to Australians across the country with regard to high electricity prices. We're not the coal party; we're not the anti-coal party. We're not the renewables party; we're not the anti-renewables party. We are the party that is about affordable, reliable energy.


Consistent with the Labor-Greens' appalling history in relation to energy, their approach is that important things should only be looked at, in their words, 'down the track'. When South Australians experienced their blackouts, they couldn't drive in the dark, businesses shut down and hospitals had to go on generators. The whole state was in darkness. This is what Labor governments do, particularly when they're in alliance with the Greens. Not only was the cost to businesses and thousands of South Australians terrible but it affected all aspects of life.


It goes without saying who Australians should blame for these blackout bills. You see, in business—which none of those on the other side know anything about—you actually have to deliver and get things done. That's what the Turnbull government does. We get things done. In business, sometimes you also have to clean up messes from those before you. That's what the Turnbull government is doing. We're doing what we do well: we get things done in a measured, pragmatic way. The Turnbull government is getting on with the business of keeping energy prices at affordable levels for all Australians. Unlike Labor, the government knows that Australians are concerned about the rising costs of energy and living. In particular, the government is listening and taking action on this front. Our priority is energy affordability and reliability as we meet our international targets.


The Turnbull government is delivering a comprehensive plan to put downward pressure on electricity prices for households and businesses. We've taken policy actions to deliver tangible outcomes for Australians, ensuring that the lights stay on and that prices remain low for Australian households and businesses. Unlike former farcical, idealistic Labor governments, the Turnbull government's focus is on what matters to Australians. What matters to Australians is when that electricity bill comes in. What matters to Australians is that they don't have to endure those blackout bills that our fellow South Australians had to endure under a Labor government. Our focus is affordability and reliability, not ideology.


Unlike Labor, we are heeding warnings of the energy white paper and the Energy Market Operator. The Turnbull government has taken very strong action to ensure more gas in the domestic market. We've finalised tough new regulations in the gas sector to give Australian customers priority access to gas supply before it's exported. We want to ensure that retail providers are giving Australians the best deal. This will remove the ability of regulated energy network companies to game the system at the expense of consumers, which is what they were able to do under the Labor government. The Turnbull government knows that messy regulation of the energy sector under Labor has contributed to driving up prices for many Australians. Opening up competitive markets and educating Australians on how best to choose a provider delivers low-cost, more affordable energy for Australians.


We know that Australia's emissions per capita and per unit of GDP are currently at their lowest level in 27 years and that Australia has a strong track record of meeting and beating our emissions target. The Turnbull government has introduced legislation to amend the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to allow investment in carbon capture and storage, which can reduce emissions by up to 90 per cent.


We need storage to back up our renewables. That's something that the Labor government never considered. The Turnbull government has embarked on the largest storage project ever undertaken in Australia. Snowy Hydro 2.0 will add 2,000 megawatts of energy storage for 7½ days. In short, the Turnbull government is keeping Australians connected and ensuring we have backup so that Australians aren't kept in the dark.


The Turnbull government is taking pragmatic action to ensure that Australians can access affordable and reliable energy. I know our measures will have a considerable impact in Chisholm, my electorate. In Victoria we've been feeling a pinch due to rising energy prices and egregious Labor policy. As a result of the pushing out of Hazelwood, companies AGL and EnergyAustralia increased bills by up to $135 this year. They have a vested interest in doing that. We are all feeling the rise, and the Turnbull government's priority is to ensure affordability for Australian households and businesses. Our comprehensive plan to put downward pressure on electricity prices for households and businesses is making a difference for my constituents, and I'm proud to be a member of the Turnbull government. We're keeping the lights on and we're making sure Australians can afford reliable, dependable and sustainable energy.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:16):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 466: Annual report 2016-17.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HILL:
  by leave—The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is one of parliament's oldest and most autonomous committees, with the committee empowered to initiate its own inquiries. In 2016-17 the committee sustained high-quality scrutiny of Commonwealth expenditure and public administration matters. Through 10 active inquiries, the committee examined matters contained in 18 Auditor-General reports, which is a 50 per cent increase in the number of reports reviewed compared to the previous year.


Themed inquiries are an important change, we think. We've been conducting more themed inquiries into core aspects of public administration as a feature of our activities. The themes picked up included Commonwealth procurement, Commonwealth infrastructure spending, Commonwealth grants administration and the Commonwealth performance framework. So we cluster a number of reports across agencies with similar themes and try and tease out common lessons. It's also a bit more interesting!


Submissions to the committee also increased significantly, with 111 received, compared to 56 the previous year. The committee continued its strong contribution to enhancing accountability and improving efficiency in public administration, making 17 clear recommendations to the government. Other activities throughout the year included inquiries into Defence sustainment and expenditure; the Defence major project report; considering the audit priorities of the parliament; commissioning an independent review of the Parliamentary Budget Office; and, as required by legislation, approving the appointment of the new Parliamentary Budget Officer.


In conclusion, I'd like to extend my thanks to all members of the committee for their commitment through 2016-17. As those who've served on the committee know, it's certainly not a light workload sitting on this committee. It is heavy in paperwork. As deputy chair, I look forward to maintaining the high standard of committee work over the coming year through our inquiry and oversight activities, ensuring as best we can the proper and efficient use of public resources. I commend the report to the House.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:26):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report, entitled Whistleblower protections.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr IRONS:
  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report on its inquiry into whistleblower protections. The inquiry into whistleblower protections was referred to the committee by the Senate on 30 November 2016.


There were 75 submissions received by the committee and we conducted five public hearings—one in Brisbane, one in Melbourne, and three in Canberra—to provide individuals and organisations the opportunity to provide evidence to the committee.


The committee's work on this inquiry was also greatly assisted by a substantial body of academic work over the past two decades on whistleblower protections, and I notice Professor AJ Brown is in the gallery. He did some fine work for the committee and presented on numerous occasions to the committee, and I thank him for that.


The committee used the best-practice guidelines set out in the Breaking the silence report as a systematic basis for conducting this inquiry and structuring this report.


Australian academic Professor Brown brought the report to the committee's attention and has been a leading researcher into whistleblowing. I understand Professor Brown, as I just said, is in the chamber this afternoon, so again I thank him for his work.


The committee found that effective whistleblowing protection is essential in both fostering integrity and accountability, and also deterring and exposing misconduct, fraud and corruption.


It became evident early on in our inquiry that while Australia's public sector whistleblowing laws were relatively comprehensive, they were lacking within the private sector.


The Moss review has also identified areas where public sector whistleblowing legislation would benefit from reform.


The committee heard evidence which noted gaps in our current laws, making it very difficult:


to protect whistleblowers from reprisals;


to hold those responsible for reprisals to account;


to effectively investigate alleged reprisals; and


for whistleblowers to seek redress from reprisals.


Through evidence received it became obvious there were significant inconsistencies—not only between various pieces of Commonwealth public and private sector whistleblower legislation, but also across the various pieces of legislation that apply to different parts of the private sector.


One of the committee's main recommendations is that the public sector whistleblower protection legislation remain in a separate act and all private whistleblower protection legislation be brought together within a private single act, and I'm sure the members opposite will have comments about that as well.


Subsequently, the committee has recommended that the government examine options to ensure ongoing harmony and alignment between whistleblower protections in the respective public and private sector acts.


The committee also recommended the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority to be housed as a single body or within an existing body, that can:


support whistleblowers;


assess and prioritise the treatment of whistleblowing allegations;


conduct investigations of reprisals; and


oversight of the implementation of the whistleblower regime for both the public and private sectors.


In addition to this, the committee has also made important recommendations on:


the definition of disclosable conduct;


thresholds for protection;


internal and external reporting channels;


provisions for anonymous reporting; and


protections from, and remedies and sanctions for, reprisals.


I'd like to thank all of those who have contributed to this inquiry into whistleblower protections.


Whilst the committee was unable to include specific whistleblower stories in the report to ensure protection of whistleblowers, the committee would like to acknowledge those who shared their experiences as a whistleblower with the committee to ensure we were fully informed about the sections in need of reform, and, in particular, the journeys they went through during their whistleblowing time.


I thank the committee members for their participation and contribution to this important inquiry, and, of course, to this report.


I thank: the Deputy Chair, Senator Deb O'Neill; Senator Nick Xenophon, who is a passionate advocate for whistleblower protections and a driving force behind a lot of this report. I also thank my parliamentary colleagues: the member for Forde, Senator John Williams, the member for Mackellar, the member for Griffith, the member for Burt, Senator Chris Ketter and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson.


It would also be remiss of me not to thank Hansard and Broadcasting, and also, in particular, the secretariat for the work that they did on aligning the members and also putting up with some of the issues that were raised.


Finally, to the committee secretariat—particularly Patrick Hodder and Jon Bell—who put an enormous amount of work into ensuring the committee has had the opportunity to liaise with the academics, whistleblowers and other representatives, and to ensure we were able to put forward informed recommendations to protect whistleblowers. That's what this report is about: the protection of whistleblowers against reprisals.


Without further ado, I commend the report to the House.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:32):  'Dobbers kiss robbers' was a catchcry of many school playgrounds around Australia, including mine. Unfortunately, it's this mentality that has made it so hard to detect corporate and other wrongdoing, and it needs to change if Australia is going to clean up its act and stop sliding further down the global Corruption Perceptions Index. It's essential to ensure that corporate, environmental, financial, banking and employer crime, and fraud, corruption and misconduct are stopped. It's also essential to ensure a culture of public accountability and integrity. Encouraging employees to report wrongdoing by their employer, and protecting them when they do, is an important part of preventing corruption in both the private and public sectors. Employees are uniquely placed to recognise misconduct both in the workplace and by their employers; generally, they are often the first to detect illegal behaviour. Unfortunately, all too often those employees don't want to do anything about the misconduct on their own.


For me as a new MP, and I'm sure for the Australian public, the conduct of this inquiry and the report produced by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is an example of the great work that can and does come from members and senators from across political divides working together to achieve better outcomes for our nation. To that end, I would also like to thank the great assistance given to us by the secretariat and all those who made submissions to the committee.


This consensus whistleblowers report makes significant recommendations that the government should implement to ensure whistleblowers are protected, supported, given guidance and provided with proper opportunities to raise their concerns. A key recommendation is a single piece of legislation for whistleblower protections in the private sector. This will provide clarity and ease of navigation for all. It's also important that the nature of such legislation be harmonised with the existing extensive public sector protections that should also be expanded. While this may not initially occur through a singular public and private sector piece of whistleblower protection legislation, it is my view, and that of my fellow Labor committee members, that it would be preferable if a single piece of legislation was employed to effect the other recommendations of the committee so as to ensure that provisions not only start out harmonised but remain so, as well as to ensure that unnecessary distinctions between the private and public sector are not created when it comes to whistleblowing protections.


Importantly, it is recommended that the scope of whistleblower protections be expanded to apply whenever a current or former employee, contractor or volunteer has a reasonable belief that there has been a breach of any law of the Commonwealth; any law of a state or territory by an entity covered by the Fair Work Act or relating to a constitutional corporation; or an industry code or professional standard with force of law or prescribed as having protections apply. This extended scope is vital to ensure the capacity to expose breaches of, for example, the insurance industry code, the superannuation industry code and many other voluntary industry codes that apply to the financial services sector and many others. It is therefore vitally important that, along with adopting the committee's recommendations, it is prescribed that such codes are picked up by the legislation. Additional obligations will also be placed on law enforcement agencies in their dealing with whistleblowing disclosures as well as a regime for protections when disclosures are made to the media.


Finally, after much consideration, it is the committee's unanimous view that, as well as providing adequate—and, importantly, timely—access to compensation for whistleblowers where required, it is important that they have access to part of the penalties obtained against wrongdoers where successful action against them is taken. These will be determined by a whistleblower protection authority within legislated percentages and will come from the penalties that are imposed by a court. These two recommendations will be a significant shift in Australian law, but a necessary one. This is not only to encourage greater disclosure and enforcement against corporates and financial service wrongdoing but also to incentivise firms to ensure they have appropriate and genuinely functioning internal disclosure mechanisms, and this is now the case in many jurisdictions.


I strongly encourage the government to promptly attend to implementing all of the recommendations of the committee. I commend the report to the House.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (16:36):  I seek leave to make a statement. 


Leave granted. 




Mr VAN MANEN:
  I'm pleased to rise today and speak on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-for-profit sectors, as has been tabled by the chair of the committee, the member for Swan, who is now acting in the role of Deputy Speaker. 


This inquiry was tasked with looking at a wide range of matters in the space of whistleblowing. It looked at effective ways to integrate strong whistleblower protections, at what, if any, compensation arrangements should be put in place and at how these have worked in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, it examined what measures are needed to ensure an effective access to justice for people who make or may make disclosures and then require protection as a whistleblower in the sectors I mentioned earlier. 


I believe there are two key considerations that must be made in considering the legislation around whistleblowing. Firstly, why is it so important? Secondly, how do we protect whistleblowers both when they come forward and afterwards? It was clear from many submissions and witness testimonies that whistleblowing is critical for fostering a culture of accountability, integrity and transparency. I want to make the point that it remains vital as a strong deterrent against misconduct, fraud and corruption. This was made particularly clear regarding information provided to the committee by the Australian Federal Police.


The AFP made it very clear that whistleblowers play an important role in detecting serious financial crime that is often sophisticated, well concealed or part of a culture of secrecy. Furthermore, the AFP noted that, due to the nature of such crimes, there is a very low likelihood of them being uncovered by law enforcement at all unless whistleblowers feel secure in coming forward. This is a great example of why ensuring we have a robust framework around whistleblowing is so important. The AFP said the types of matters where whistleblowers become vital players in criminal investigations include foreign bribery, serious tax crime, identity crime, corporate and government corruption and serious fraud offences. Yet, despite there being a generally positive view of whistleblowing, it was pointed out to the committee that being a whistleblower is rarely easy or glamorous and can often involve great risk both publicly and personally to the person speaking out. Perhaps inevitably, then, evidence showed current protections for whistleblowers remain not as robust as they could be. So the recommendations in the report and the legislation ultimately introduced must have practical effects in both the public and the private sector, enabling effective investigation and avenues of appeal in cases of retaliation against a whistleblower.


Whistleblowing, in my view, is an essential part of our democracy. We're well aware that free speech and the importance of protecting and even advocating it has been high on the public agenda, but Australians in any workplace or in any sector must also have the ability to speak out and governments must act to protect the capacity of those people to do so. The committee has recommended that the public sector whistleblowing protection legislation remain in one act, while the various private sector whistleblowing protection legislation be brought together in another single act but separate from the first one. It is also recommended that the government examine options for ensuring ongoing harmony between the whistleblowing protections in these respective acts. This is important because, as outlined in the hearings, a recent analysis of whistleblower protections across G20 countries found that, whilst Australia's public sector whistleblowing laws were relatively comprehensive, they were lacking in the private sector. We looked at the establishment of a whistleblowing protection authority, which would be effective in overseeing the implementation of the whistleblower regime in both the public and the private sector.


I join the committee in acknowledging the work on this inquiry that has been greatly assisted by a substantial body of academic work over the past few decades. I also acknowledge the contribution of the witnesses and the submitters who participated and the secretariat for the detailed work they have done to assist us on the committee. I also thank my colleagues on the committee and the chair. I commend this report to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:42):  by leave—This is a unanimous report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which is no mean feat when you consider that the committee has on its membership Greens, Senator Xenophon from the Nick Xenophon Team, Liberals, Nationals and Labor representatives, and, perhaps even more remarkably, both members of the House and senators. Yet, despite all of our differences, we were able to come up with a unanimous report in relation to this very significant whistleblowing inquiry.


The reason that whistleblowing protections are important is fairly obvious when you think about the individual whistleblowers. It's an incredibly dangerous thing to do. To blow the whistle on unlawful conduct or conduct that breaches your professional standards or your industry codes, particularly when you've found out about these breaches through work or through a contract that you might have with a principal, can result in anything from just a slap on the wrist, to being demoted, to losing pay, to even being sacked, to having your reputation ruined, to not being able to get a job in the same industry, to not being able to earn an income. These things are serious ramifications, and so it is important for individual whistleblowers that there be a strong regime of protection in place in order to ensure that their lives are not ruined just because they've done the right thing by disclosing wrongdoing.


Similarly, and much more importantly, in my view, the importance of having a pro-whistleblowing culture should not be disregarded when it comes to the public benefit of that culture—not just the private benefit to whistleblowers in that they get protected but the public benefit that we obtain as a nation from having wrongdoing brought to light and finding out about it so that regulators are in a position to take action. For example, corporate tax evasion harms everyone. If corporates aren't paying their taxes, then it's you and me and people in our electorates who are then turned to to pay taxes to make up the shortfall. If firms are engaging in environmental vandalism and tipping toxic chemicals into the river, that's something that harms the environment and harms everybody who enjoys it. So there is a public benefit in that wrongdoing being brought to light by people who are getting access to information about it. I think when we talk about a pro-disclosure culture or a pro-whistleblowing culture, it is the public benefit that is really motivating us as a parliament to look at what can be done to extend whistleblower protections to the private sector and the not-for-profit sector and to strengthen them in the public sector. This is a report that is really very significant, I think, in that it deals with that desire to have a pro-disclosure culture.


It's also important because it tries to grapple with the questions about why someone should blow the whistle—why someone should disclose unlawful conduct or conduct that breaches professional standards or industry codes. It's certainly the first parliamentary inquiry in which I've been able to have a discussion about Immanuel Kant with a witness. We did quite enjoy the discussion around whether people should do the right thing because they should do the right thing, or whether it would be possible to look at rewards or incentives for people to be forthcoming with information about wrongdoing. As the member for Burt said, this is a fairly significant change of approach for Australia. There are some precedents—there are some bodies that will pay rewards for information about criminal offences, for example—but to look at a possibility of incentivising people to come forward with information about wrongdoing is quite a new thing for us to have looked at. So it was really useful that we got such differing perspectives from such expert bodies and witnesses. We were so grateful to all of the submitters that took the time to make a submission to our inquiry, no matter where they stood on any of the issues they came and spoke to us about. Each of the submissions was very useful; I certainly appreciated it and I know the other members of the committee did as well.


This report does recommend the possibility of incentives or rewards being paid. If someone discloses information about wrongdoing to a regulator and they're then able to get a successful prosecution or proceeding brought against the wrongdoer, this report recommends that there should be the possibility of a reward being paid to the person who has given the information. It does not recommend the right or the entitlement to a reward, but a discretion on the part of the regulators or a whistleblower protection authority—which we have suggested establishing—to be able to pay a reward if they consider a number of things, including that the information was material to getting the good result in the proceedings, or in the prosecution, as the case may be. We were informed during the course of the inquiry by some expert witnesses from the US who had been looking at their own security bodies that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been implementing its own rewards system—though they used slightly different language there—for some time now, and they've seen very strong results in terms of increased numbers of prosecutions and success. So it is a new idea. It's something that's been kicking around for a while, but it's a new thing for a committee like ours to have considered in any detail. I think it's a very sensible recommendation to allow a bit of flexibility for the regulators to be able to make a decision to pay a reward in appropriate and limited circumstances.


I want to join with the other members of the committee in thanking all of the members of the committee for their collaborative approach. Of course, I thank you, Deputy Speaker Irons, as the chair of the committee, and the deputy chair, Senator O'Neill. I particularly wanted to thank members of the secretariat like Patrick Hodder and Jon Bell, who have been incredibly supportive and, might I also say, patient with the committee. I also want to again thank everybody else who made a contribution. There are a range of members of the secretariat whose names appear on the inside of the report, and I encourage people to have a look at those names and to be grateful for the work that has been done. Also, to the people undertaking logistical work, Hansard, the broadcasters and other people who have made this inquiry possible, I wanted to record my thanks as well.

He did some fine work for the committee and presented on numerous occasions to the committee, and I thank him for that.


The committee used the best-practice guidelines set out in the Breaking the silence report as a systematic basis for conducting this inquiry and structuring this report.


Australian academic Professor Brown brought the report to the committee's attention and has been a leading researcher into whistleblowing. I understand Professor Brown, as I just said, is in the chamber this afternoon, so again I thank him for his work.


The committee found that effective whistleblowing protection is essential in both fostering integrity and accountability, and also deterring and exposing misconduct, fraud and corruption.


It became evident early on in our inquiry that while Australia's public sector whistleblowing laws were relatively comprehensive, they were lacking within the private sector.


The Moss review has also identified areas where public sector whistleblowing legislation would benefit from reform.


The committee heard evidence which noted gaps in our current laws, making it very difficult:


to protect whistleblowers from reprisals;


to hold those responsible for reprisals to account;


to effectively investigate alleged reprisals; and


for whistleblowers to seek redress from reprisals.


Through evidence received it became obvious there were significant inconsistencies—not only between various pieces of Commonwealth public and private sector whistleblower legislation, but also across the various pieces of legislation that apply to different parts of the private sector.


One of the committee's main recommendations is that the public sector whistleblower protection legislation remain in a separate act and all private whistleblower protection legislation be brought together within a private single act, and I'm sure the members opposite will have comments about that as well.


Subsequently, the committee has recommended that the government examine options to ensure ongoing harmony and alignment between whistleblower protections in the respective public and private sector acts.


The committee also recommended the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority to be housed as a single body or within an existing body, that can:


support whistleblowers;


assess and prioritise the treatment of whistleblowing allegations;


conduct investigations of reprisals; and


oversight of the implementation of the whistleblower regime for both the public and private sectors.


In addition to this, the committee has also made important recommendations on:


the definition of disclosable conduct;


thresholds for protection;


internal and external reporting channels;


provisions for anonymous reporting; and


protections from, and remedies and sanctions for, reprisals.


I'd like to thank all of those who have contributed to this inquiry into whistleblower protections.


Whilst the committee was unable to include specific whistleblower stories in the report to ensure protection of whistleblowers, the committee would like to acknowledge those who shared their experiences as a whistleblower with the committee to ensure we were fully informed about the sections in need of reform, and, in particular, the journeys they went through during their whistleblowing time.


I thank the committee members for their participation and contribution to this important inquiry, and, of course, to this report.


I thank: the Deputy Chair, Senator Deb O'Neill; Senator Nick Xenophon, who is a passionate advocate for whistleblower protections and a driving force behind a lot of this report. I also thank my parliamentary colleagues: the member for Forde, Senator John Williams, the member for Mackellar, the member for Griffith, the member for Burt, Senator Chris Ketter and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson.


It would also be remiss of me not to thank Hansard and Broadcasting, and also, in particular, the secretariat for the work that they did on aligning the members and also putting up with some of the issues that were raised.


Finally, to the committee secretariat—particularly Patrick Hodder and Jon Bell—who put an enormous amount of work into ensuring the committee has had the opportunity to liaise with the academics, whistleblowers and other representatives, and to ensure we were able to put forward informed recommendations to protect whistleblowers. That's what this report is about: the protection of whistleblowers against reprisals.


Without further ado, I commend the report to the House.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:32):  'Dobbers kiss robbers' was a catchcry of many school playgrounds around Australia, including mine. Unfortunately, it's this mentality that has made it so hard to detect corporate and other wrongdoing, and it needs to change if Australia is going to clean up its act and stop sliding further down the global Corruption Perceptions Index. It's essential to ensure that corporate, environmental, financial, banking and employer crime, and fraud, corruption and misconduct are stopped. It's also essential to ensure a culture of public accountability and integrity. Encouraging employees to report wrongdoing by their employer, and protecting them when they do, is an important part of preventing corruption in both the private and public sectors. Employees are uniquely placed to recognise misconduct both in the workplace and by their employers; generally, they are often the first to detect illegal behaviour. Unfortunately, all too often those employees don't want to do anything about the misconduct on their own.


For me as a new MP, and I'm sure for the Australian public, the conduct of this inquiry and the report produced by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is an example of the great work that can and does come from members and senators from across political divides working together to achieve better outcomes for our nation. To that end, I would also like to thank the great assistance given to us by the secretariat and all those who made submissions to the committee.


This consensus whistleblowers report makes significant recommendations that the government should implement to ensure whistleblowers are protected, supported, given guidance and provided with proper opportunities to raise their concerns. A key recommendation is a single piece of legislation for whistleblower protections in the private sector. This will provide clarity and ease of navigation for all. It's also important that the nature of such legislation be harmonised with the existing extensive public sector protections that should also be expanded. While this may not initially occur through a singular public and private sector piece of whistleblower protection legislation, it is my view, and that of my fellow Labor committee members, that it would be preferable if a single piece of legislation was employed to effect the other recommendations of the committee so as to ensure that provisions not only start out harmonised but remain so, as well as to ensure that unnecessary distinctions between the private and public sector are not created when it comes to whistleblowing protections.


Importantly, it is recommended that the scope of whistleblower protections be expanded to apply whenever a current or former employee, contractor or volunteer has a reasonable belief that there has been a breach of any law of the Commonwealth; any law of a state or territory by an entity covered by the Fair Work Act or relating to a constitutional corporation; or an industry code or professional standard with force of law or prescribed as having protections apply. This extended scope is vital to ensure the capacity to expose breaches of, for example, the insurance industry code, the superannuation industry code and many other voluntary industry codes that apply to the financial services sector and many others. It is therefore vitally important that, along with adopting the committee's recommendations, it is prescribed that such codes are picked up by the legislation. Additional obligations will also be placed on law enforcement agencies in their dealing with whistleblowing disclosures as well as a regime for protections when disclosures are made to the media.


Finally, after much consideration, it is the committee's unanimous view that, as well as providing adequate—and, importantly, timely—access to compensation for whistleblowers where required, it is important that they have access to part of the penalties obtained against wrongdoers where successful action against them is taken. These will be determined by a whistleblower protection authority within legislated percentages and will come from the penalties that are imposed by a court. These two recommendations will be a significant shift in Australian law, but a necessary one. This is not only to encourage greater disclosure and enforcement against corporates and financial service wrongdoing but also to incentivise firms to ensure they have appropriate and genuinely functioning internal disclosure mechanisms, and this is now the case in many jurisdictions.


I strongly encourage the government to promptly attend to implementing all of the recommendations of the committee. I commend the report to the House.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (16:36):  I seek leave to make a statement. 


Leave granted. 




Mr VAN MANEN:
  I'm pleased to rise today and speak on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-for-profit sectors, as has been tabled by the chair of the committee, the member for Swan, who is now acting in the role of Deputy Speaker. 


This inquiry was tasked with looking at a wide range of matters in the space of whistleblowing. It looked at effective ways to integrate strong whistleblower protections, at what, if any, compensation arrangements should be put in place and at how these have worked in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, it examined what measures are needed to ensure an effective access to justice for people who make or may make disclosures and then require protection as a whistleblower in the sectors I mentioned earlier. 


I believe there are two key considerations that must be made in considering the legislation around whistleblowing. Firstly, why is it so important? Secondly, how do we protect whistleblowers both when they come forward and afterwards? It was clear from many submissions and witness testimonies that whistleblowing is critical for fostering a culture of accountability, integrity and transparency. I want to make the point that it remains vital as a strong deterrent against misconduct, fraud and corruption. This was made particularly clear regarding information provided to the committee by the Australian Federal Police.


The AFP made it very clear that whistleblowers play an important role in detecting serious financial crime that is often sophisticated, well concealed or part of a culture of secrecy. Furthermore, the AFP noted that, due to the nature of such crimes, there is a very low likelihood of them being uncovered by law enforcement at all unless whistleblowers feel secure in coming forward. This is a great example of why ensuring we have a robust framework around whistleblowing is so important. The AFP said the types of matters where whistleblowers become vital players in criminal investigations include foreign bribery, serious tax crime, identity crime, corporate and government corruption and serious fraud offences. Yet, despite there being a generally positive view of whistleblowing, it was pointed out to the committee that being a whistleblower is rarely easy or glamorous and can often involve great risk both publicly and personally to the person speaking out. Perhaps inevitably, then, evidence showed current protections for whistleblowers remain not as robust as they could be. So the recommendations in the report and the legislation ultimately introduced must have practical effects in both the public and the private sector, enabling effective investigation and avenues of appeal in cases of retaliation against a whistleblower.


Whistleblowing, in my view, is an essential part of our democracy. We're well aware that free speech and the importance of protecting and even advocating it has been high on the public agenda, but Australians in any workplace or in any sector must also have the ability to speak out and governments must act to protect the capacity of those people to do so. The committee has recommended that the public sector whistleblowing protection legislation remain in one act, while the various private sector whistleblowing protection legislation be brought together in another single act but separate from the first one. It is also recommended that the government examine options for ensuring ongoing harmony between the whistleblowing protections in these respective acts. This is important because, as outlined in the hearings, a recent analysis of whistleblower protections across G20 countries found that, whilst Australia's public sector whistleblowing laws were relatively comprehensive, they were lacking in the private sector. We looked at the establishment of a whistleblowing protection authority, which would be effective in overseeing the implementation of the whistleblower regime in both the public and the private sector.


I join the committee in acknowledging the work on this inquiry that has been greatly assisted by a substantial body of academic work over the past few decades. I also acknowledge the contribution of the witnesses and the submitters who participated and the secretariat for the detailed work they have done to assist us on the committee. I also thank my colleagues on the committee and the chair. I commend this report to the House.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,16,2,speech
"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:42):  by leave—This is a unanimous report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which is no mean feat when you consider that the committee has on its membership Greens, Senator Xenophon from the Nick Xenophon Team, Liberals, Nationals and Labor representatives, and, perhaps even more remarkably, both members of the House and senators. Yet, despite all of our differences, we were able to come up with a unanimous report in relation to this very significant whistleblowing inquiry.


The reason that whistleblowing protections are important is fairly obvious when you think about the individual whistleblowers. It's an incredibly dangerous thing to do. To blow the whistle on unlawful conduct or conduct that breaches your professional standards or your industry codes, particularly when you've found out about these breaches through work or through a contract that you might have with a principal, can result in anything from just a slap on the wrist, to being demoted, to losing pay, to even being sacked, to having your reputation ruined, to not being able to get a job in the same industry, to not being able to earn an income. These things are serious ramifications, and so it is important for individual whistleblowers that there be a strong regime of protection in place in order to ensure that their lives are not ruined just because they've done the right thing by disclosing wrongdoing.


Similarly, and much more importantly, in my view, the importance of having a pro-whistleblowing culture should not be disregarded when it comes to the public benefit of that culture—not just the private benefit to whistleblowers in that they get protected but the public benefit that we obtain as a nation from having wrongdoing brought to light and finding out about it so that regulators are in a position to take action. For example, corporate tax evasion harms everyone. If corporates aren't paying their taxes, then it's you and me and people in our electorates who are then turned to to pay taxes to make up the shortfall. If firms are engaging in environmental vandalism and tipping toxic chemicals into the river, that's something that harms the environment and harms everybody who enjoys it. So there is a public benefit in that wrongdoing being brought to light by people who are getting access to information about it. I think when we talk about a pro-disclosure culture or a pro-whistleblowing culture, it is the public benefit that is really motivating us as a parliament to look at what can be done to extend whistleblower protections to the private sector and the not-for-profit sector and to strengthen them in the public sector. This is a report that is really very significant, I think, in that it deals with that desire to have a pro-disclosure culture.


It's also important because it tries to grapple with the questions about why someone should blow the whistle—why someone should disclose unlawful conduct or conduct that breaches professional standards or industry codes. It's certainly the first parliamentary inquiry in which I've been able to have a discussion about Immanuel Kant with a witness. We did quite enjoy the discussion around whether people should do the right thing because they should do the right thing, or whether it would be possible to look at rewards or incentives for people to be forthcoming with information about wrongdoing. As the member for Burt said, this is a fairly significant change of approach for Australia. There are some precedents—there are some bodies that will pay rewards for information about criminal offences, for example—but to look at a possibility of incentivising people to come forward with information about wrongdoing is quite a new thing for us to have looked at. So it was really useful that we got such differing perspectives from such expert bodies and witnesses. We were so grateful to all of the submitters that took the time to make a submission to our inquiry, no matter where they stood on any of the issues they came and spoke to us about. Each of the submissions was very useful; I certainly appreciated it and I know the other members of the committee did as well.


This report does recommend the possibility of incentives or rewards being paid. If someone discloses information about wrongdoing to a regulator and they're then able to get a successful prosecution or proceeding brought against the wrongdoer, this report recommends that there should be the possibility of a reward being paid to the person who has given the information. It does not recommend the right or the entitlement to a reward, but a discretion on the part of the regulators or a whistleblower protection authority—which we have suggested establishing—to be able to pay a reward if they consider a number of things, including that the information was material to getting the good result in the proceedings, or in the prosecution, as the case may be. We were informed during the course of the inquiry by some expert witnesses from the US who had been looking at their own security bodies that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been implementing its own rewards system—though they used slightly different language there—for some time now, and they've seen very strong results in terms of increased numbers of prosecutions and success. So it is a new idea. It's something that's been kicking around for a while, but it's a new thing for a committee like ours to have considered in any detail. I think it's a very sensible recommendation to allow a bit of flexibility for the regulators to be able to make a decision to pay a reward in appropriate and limited circumstances.


I want to join with the other members of the committee in thanking all of the members of the committee for their collaborative approach. Of course, I thank you, Deputy Speaker Irons, as the chair of the committee, and the deputy chair, Senator O'Neill. I particularly wanted to thank members of the secretariat like Patrick Hodder and Jon Bell, who have been incredibly supportive and, might I also say, patient with the committee. I also want to again thank everybody else who made a contribution. There are a range of members of the secretariat whose names appear on the inside of the report, and I encourage people to have a look at those names and to be grateful for the work that has been done. Also, to the people undertaking logistical work, Hansard, the broadcasters and other people who have made this inquiry possible, I wanted to record my thanks as well.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:50):  I'm very pleased to be able to continue my remarks in opposition to this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 and in support of the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I'm struck when I think about education by the continued insistence by the minister and government members generally that money doesn't matter. Of course we know it does, and the overwhelming body of evidence is to that effect. Of course, it is not simply the money in itself but how it's used as well. Overnight, we began the debate: what is significant legislation? It is significant in as much as it would send our university sector backwards and radically constrain the life opportunities of many thousands of Australians.


I'm struck by reports from the OECD, which are extraordinarily worrying and concerning and should give government members pause for thought before persisting with this legislation. What the OECD is telling us is that Australia is ranked 30th of the 34 OECD nations in our public investment in higher education—right at the very bottom. Of course, those statistics were collated before the very significant cuts which are contained in this legislation. The context of this is really important because, while my remarks and those of my colleagues are largely focused on talking about the retrograde impact of this legislation on my constituents and young Australians in the Australian economy, our economy does not exist in isolation. That's particularly true of higher education, which makes such an enormous impact on our economy, and that is certainly so in my home town of Melbourne.


When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke on this, she expressed her concern about the decline of some Australian institutions in significant international rankings and talked through the significance of this. The OECD report is further cause for alarm in that Universities Australia said—quite rightly in my view—that it is increasing investment that is driving the rise of other universities within our region, particularly in places like mainland China. This has caused Belinda Robinson, the CEO of Universities Australia, to warn us—and she's right to warn us—that we simply can't afford to cut our investment at a time when other countries, including those in Asia, are 'turbocharging their investments'. They are turbocharging their investments and are deriving a serious return from them in boosting their human capital, ensuring that their young people have their potential fully realised and are equipped for the changing future world of work. Again, this will have a significant impact on our ability not just to boost the individual capacity of young Australians but to earn significant export income.


Now is the time to take, effectively, the opposite tack of that which the government proposes. Now is the time to back-in our universities; those fantastic hardworking people who work in them; those who are presently studying in them; and those who should continue to be studying in them into the future, particularly those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who would be, should be, first-in-family-participants in higher education. These are the people who are already being adversely affected by this government's walking away from needs based schools funding.


I say to government members: far from blithely assuming that current funding levels for universities are excessive, as an efficiency dividend would imply, we should be querying this assumption. We should be querying it because it flies in the face of the evidence and it flies in the face of the wider importance of higher education to the Australian economy, as well as to individual Australians. I was really struck by it when I was reflecting on, in this context, the contributions of government members to this debate, some of which have been quite extraordinary, not simply in their preoccupation with an imagined past. The member for Barton, who is in the chamber, will no doubt share my interest that government members seem much more interested in talking about Menzies—imagining his record in government—than setting out their vision for the future of Australia. It's telling as to the crisis of confidence that goes to the heart of this government. It's not just in energy policy; it's right across the board.


We have a Prime Minister who sought office but, having attained it, has no power and hasn't got the courage of his convictions to set forward any course for Australia. In education, the consequences of this are huge. And there is this preoccupation with the past, this reification of Menzies in defiance of the evidence and their attempt to claim Labor's record in higher education. Many of my colleagues have gone through this and rebutted it effectively.


But I think it is worth saying that it is Labor governments which have made Australian universities what they are today and have ensured that the opportunity of university education has been opened up, whether it be by the Whitlam government, the extraordinary public-policy-making efforts of John Dawkins in the Hawke and Keating governments or, of course, the massive expansion of participation in higher education that took place under the former Labor governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Those governments really opened up higher education to so many Australians. And it's amazing, I think, as a member of this place, to reflect on what would have been lost had these people not been given the opportunity by Labor's reforms—the demand-driven system, opening up higher education.


I note that there are some positive elements contained within this messy bill dressed up as reform. I will make particular mention, as many of my colleagues have done, of the HEPP Program. It is a good thing—unequivocally a good thing—that we will continue to have the opportunity to address some of the cultural barriers to higher education participation in many disadvantaged cohorts and that people will continue to be able to reach out into the community and make sure that universities are not cloistered, shut-away places for the elite. That is vital. But it is cruel that this legislative recognition, firstly, comes on the back of very significant cuts to this important program and, secondly, is held hostage to reforms that completely undo the worthy work of HEPPP.


But I think that, as well as the attitude to Labor and higher education, we see something quite revealing from the contribution of many government members with their utter preoccupation with private benefit in their attitude to the benefits of education. We see their complete failure to acknowledge the wider benefits, economic and beyond, provided to our community at large from higher education. That we have world-class doctors in Australia surely matters just as much as those doctors' individual earnings and, I'd hope, their satisfaction in carrying out their work following graduation. This was a point very effectively made in the contribution of the shadow assistant minister for universities, the member for Griffith. The narrow, rigid individualism that characterises the engagement of government members with this challenge is extraordinarily disappointing. Surely, when we look at the sorts of professions on the one hand and the skill sets and disciplines on the other that result from university graduation, there needs to be a wider reflection on the purpose of higher education beyond simply supporting an individual's capacity to earn their income.


I also want to touch on the second reading contribution of the assistant minister. She pays homage to the minister, Senator Birmingham, in talking around rather than engaging with the key issues in the legislation. She speaks of the goal of a more student-focused system and asserts—amazingly, for me—that we are all in this together. Of course, we should all be in it together when it comes to university education, but what this government is doing through this bill and its wider neglect of our education system is quite the reverse. In fact, what it's saying to young Australians thinking about pursuing a university education and to Australians working in our higher education institutions is: 'You are on your own. You are not part of our vision of Australia's future.'


In Labor, we believe, all of us, in the power of education. We believe in the importance of early learning and of schools which are funded and equipped to enable every child to fulfil his or her potential. We believe in TAFE as the cornerstone of skills development, not just post school but throughout life. And we believe in our universities, which are so important to building individuals up to their potential and in supporting our economy, particularly in Melbourne. We are optimistic on this side. We believe in young Australians. And that's what's so disappointing about this government's attitude: its failure to see that our future lies in our capacity to develop our human capital more than anything else.


And it is telling also, beyond these contributions of government members, that this legislation arrives after, I believe, 29 reviews but no consultation. When you look at this bill, it is easy to see that there hasn't been meaningful consultation. This package of so-called reforms has done something quite remarkable: it has united the higher education sector against the government and this flawed legislation. Not even the member for Sturt was able to do that. It's quite a tribute to Senator Birmingham that he has managed to do that!


On the other hand, with my colleagues, led by the member for Sydney, I have been listening to what universities say and, vitally, to students too. I'm particularly concerned about the impact on the universities that principally service the communities that make up the Scullin electorate. I'm concerned that Victoria over the forward estimates will receive $533 million less. La Trobe University, just outside the electorate, will be impacted by cuts of over $68 million, and RMIT university's Bundoora campus faces cuts of over $80 million. This will have a huge impact on the communities I'm so proud to represent.


I note the contribution of the La Trobe University Vice-Chancellor, John Dewar—someone who was a supporter of previous government reform initiatives in this agenda, so no friend of the Labor Party when it comes to this. Professor Dewar says,


We all recognise the powerful economic, intellectual and innovation benefits a university education delivers to everyone in the community.


It seems counterintuitive for the Federal Government to talk of boosting innovation and productivity, while also introducing financial hurdles to creating the very workforce that will deliver on that ambition.


For 50 years, La Trobe University has been undertaking world-class research and educating leaders and innovators from all walks of life. I am concerned that the measures could mean more students from regional Australia or low SES groups – already underrepresented in University lecture halls – being unable to attend university in the future.


This is a contribution that government members should have very serious regard to.


Look at the substantive measures in the bill: the massive cuts, the absurd fee increases, the extraordinary proposals to change the repayment threshold by reducing it to a level barely beyond minimum wage, the shabby treatment of New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, the trashing of enabling courses. There is nothing in this bill which evidences a vision for our university sector or a vision for young Australians being equipped for all the challenges of life in the 21st century, the Asian century.


I'm proud to be standing here with all of my Labor colleagues in clear, firm opposition to this legislation and in solidarity with all of our students and our future university students.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2017-09-13,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (17:03):  I'm pleased to speak to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I believe that this bill does not adequately support regional universities and their students. I will not support the bill in its current format and will be proposing amendments in the consideration in detail stage.


In my speech I will address three points. Firstly, I will outline my amendments as practical solutions to ensure that regional universities and their students are not disadvantaged. Secondly, I will recognise the central role regional universities play in driving the economic, social and cultural value of our communities. And finally, I will acknowledge the role of my community and the role of regional universities. It's not only working actively to raise these issues but coming to the table to genuinely work with me and identify solutions.


My amendments will legislate for a national regional higher education strategy and provide some financial relief to students studying in regional Australia through a HELP debt repayment. The national regional higher education strategy will ensure regional higher education is prioritised and remains a focus of future governments. It will require the minister to table the strategy in parliament in early 2018 and review and update the strategy every four years. The introduction of a regional student HELP-debt-repayment-free period will create a HELP-debt-repayment-free period for students studying at regional universities. This will provide a financial incentive to students to study in regional communities. It will encourage regional students to remain in the regions, and potentially attract students from the major cities. The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed this proposal as having only a $21.6 million cost to the headline cash payment over the forward periods to 2020-21—let me stress: only $21.6 million. It is a very small investment with an enormous return on investment for regional communities and those who live there.


As you know, our regional universities do more than educate. They are one of the largest and most visible physical, intellectual, cultural and sporting assets in our regions and cities. They are a critical player in workforce planning. They are a driver of economic growth and development. They are key employers. They innovate and they inspire. They act as major attracters to young people, and they can make the difference between economic survival and going backwards.


All regional MPs in this House know the many advantages related to living in regional Australia's towns and cities, including affordability and livability. Small cities can have the benefits of big cities without the disadvantages. They can be both highly productive and great places to live. The government knows this, too. They tell us in Regions 2030: Unlocking Opportunity:


Regional Australia is not just important to those of us who live here. The Australian economy is largely driven by its regions. Australia’s agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining industries, predominantly located in regional Australia, made up 57 per cent of the value of Australia’s merchandise exports in 2016.


Fifty seven per cent! It says:


Forty five cents in every dollar spent in Australia by international or local visitors is spent in regional areas. Most of the gas and electricity which powers city households is produced in regional Australia.


It is only logical that we should invest in Australia’s regions because Australia’s regions power Australia’s economy.


So says the government report. It continues: 


Investing in our regions pays massive dividends for our nation—strong regions are the foundation of a strong Australia.


That's from the government's own propaganda. Let me say that again: it's only logical that we should invest in Australia's regions because Australia's regions power Australia's economy.


My community knows the value of regional universities. They know that regional universities enable the best use of human capital and resources and contribute to educational opportunities, economic prospects, innovation and community capacity. The universities' teaching and learning activities, research and innovation, and services functions contribute to human capital development, regional governance and planning, community development, health and ageing care, arts, culture, sport, environmental sustainability and industry and business development. Our unis provide leadership in stimulating positive change and staff and students play active and visible roles in the community. For many regional centres, a strong university presence is intrinsic to a strong regional presence.


Large regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, have surely benefited from the presence of Charles Sturt and La Trobe universities. In the border's case, there is the added advantage of two university colleges. I would particularly like to acknowledge the role of Wodonga TAFE. Charles Sturt University, Australia's largest regional university, is the result of the formation of the Bathurst experimental farm and the Wagga Wagga experimental farm in the 1890s. In one form or another, research, innovation and education have been integral to the university's character and mission for more than a century.


My communities recognise the values of access to education, specifically tertiary education. They have consistently raised this as a priority. In the postbudget survey that my staff and I carried out in May of more than 1,000 people across the electorate, 92 per cent of respondents identified education as their top priority. They made the following points: forcing graduates to repay loans at a lower income threshold will just create a new category of poor—it's better to leave them enough money to spend, to live, to invest, to pay for housing and to have their families. So, clearly, regional universities and the ability to have money and live in your community are really important.


Marilyn Bakker told me: 'Something needs to be done to support kids for their tertiary education when they can't live at home.' Ian Jarvie said, 'Education and equitable access to all ensures diversity, access to information, better decisions and innovation.' Support for regional kids to attend universities includes regional subsidies, better and more relevant transport and more connectivity within the regional centres. Adrian Twitt tells me: 'Country students are handicapped in accessing tertiary education. There needs to be more support for such students.' So today I'm standing up for those in my electorate who have asked me to do so, to stand up for accessibility and for positive discrimination for rural and regional people, and universities. 


La Trobe and Charles Sturt universities and the Regional University Network told the Senate inquiry into education and employment that the net effect of this complex package can be summarised as government reducing the level of public investment in higher education while increasing the amount of student contributions. Students are asked to pay more for a university education that is funded less, and country students have to pay even more. The evidence provided that the bill runs counter to the importance of the sector to Australia and our regional economies. It sidesteps the critical issues of support for regionally delivered higher education, and creates disincentives for improving the participation and retention of under-represented student cohorts. 


They went on to say that the proposed bill in its current form would destabilise the foundation of Australia's world-class university system, and Australia cannot afford to risk our economic future and jeopardise the potential of our students by undermining the capacity of our higher education sector. I believe this legislation will do that. We know that regional students remain underrepresented in higher education institutions, and data shows that regional and remote students make up just 18.8 per cent of domestic undergraduate students at universities, compared to 26.4 per cent for the population as a whole. 


We know the real threat to rural communities is the declining population, particularly of our young people. The trend is to lose young people to the cities, as they leave their country homes for opportunities related to employment, education and training, and leisure in urban centres and overseas. Statistics show that they are unlikely to return in a hurry. The Regional Universities Network reports that people who study in regions largely stay in the regions. A study undertaken by the Regional Universities Network demonstrates that between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the employed recent graduates of those universities were employed in regional Australia. If they study locally, they stay locally. And herein lies the problem.


The government's proposed package will disproportionately affect low-income households. For students who are studying and working part-time, financial pressure has been shown to be a major contributor to a student's decision to drop out of or not take up higher education. Far away from family and community support, this captures regional students who go to metro areas at a disproportionate rate. And, while the independent review considers students who will look to travel to metropolitan universities, it does not support the students who elect to continue their education at a regional university. These very issues are, at best, barely adequately addressed and, at worst, ignored completely.


In closing today, I want to reflect on the words from this week's editorial in TheBorder Mail, my local paper. It supports my call for a national regional higher education strategy:


For several decades now though some of the larger regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, have benefited from a university presence. In the Border’s case, it has had the added plus of go-ahead TAFE colleges – especially in Wodonga.


Charles Sturt University has certainly long championed the enormous value for regional economies that comes from developing and providing courses that turn out graduates with a commitment to rural Australia, as well as having a significant commitment to research.


La Trobe University, which of course also has long had a Border presence, has a similar commitment.


And that is why all must be done to ensure there is no attempt to water-down these universities at a time when their commitment is to expand in order to even better serve regional areas.


In closing, I'm speaking against this legislation. I ask my colleagues opposite to stand up for rural and regional Australia—to actually do what needs to be done and support my amendments when I bring them on, to show their dedicated commitment for what we know to be true: without support, our rural universities, which underpin our whole economic development in our regions, will be at stake. It is too important to let go on a whim—as to which, let me say: the National Party opposite and the Liberal Party vote because they're told to vote. So, in closing, colleagues, can I say: will you please stand up for rural and regional Australia. Will you please do the right thing. Will you please—please—convince the government that we've got to do better by our regions.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:15):  I wish to join with my Labor colleagues on this side of the House in condemning this bill before the House tonight, the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. This bill purports to be about 'higher education support', but that, in fact, is one of the great misnomers.


Large parts of this legislation are simply wrong. If passed, this legislation would see massive cuts to universities and increased fees and debts for students, whilst also shifting the burden back onto students—who would have, as I said, bigger debts to repay much sooner. More critically, this bill will close the door of opportunity to many, many potential students. And it will disproportionately hurt regional universities like the University of Newcastle in my electorate.


Australia already has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD, and our students are already paying the sixth-highest fees. This package will only make that bad record even worse. That's why we see near-universal opposition to this legislation from the higher education sector. The peak body for the universities, Universities Australia, has said:


An overwhelming majority of Vice-Chancellors … could not recommend that the Senate crossbench pass the legislative package.


And the NTEU, the sector's union, has also opposed the bill, because of the impact of the cuts and fee hikes to students. This opposition is because these people in the sector know that this legislation is not reform. Indeed, this legislation fails to make any inroads into the really serious challenges that we face in higher education in Australia.


Instead of carving out a vision for the nation and a pathway to get there, all the government have got on offer are cuts: cuts to funding, cuts to services, cuts to infrastructure and cuts to programs. Make no mistake: if the Prime Minister persists with this plan, our universities will suffer. The quality of university education in Australia will be compromised, and students will be expected to pay more and more and more. At a time when Australia should be investing in our tertiary education sector, this bill enshrines $3.8 billion of cuts, while also increasing the debt for students, and locking tens of thousands of potential students out of higher education altogether.


In New South Wales alone, this would result in $617.8 million of cuts into vital university services. In my electorate of Newcastle, the Turnbull Liberal government's plan for higher education, if it proceeds, means that our local university, the University of Newcastle, will have its funding slashed by a staggering $63.2 million over the next four years alone, and that blows out to more than $100 million over the decade.


There can be no doubt that student learning and outcomes, university programs and university infrastructure will all suffer as a result of these savage cuts. This legislation means that Australian students will end up paying more and getting less.


Whilst cutting university funding, the Prime Minister is hitting students with higher fees and asking them to pay off those larger debts at a much quicker rate. Under this legislation, students will have to start paying back their HECS loans when they start earning just $42,000, a threshold which is only around $6,000 more than the minimum wage, instead of the current $54,869. Graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable financial stress, making opportunities for home ownership and financial security less likely. This locks in financial insecurity for young Australians at a time when they should, in fact, be setting themselves up.


There can be no doubt that this legislation hits universities based in regional and rural settings the hardest. Regional Universities Network summed it up in their submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation when they warned that:


… serious perverse consequences for RUN universities are likely to be associated with such measures. These include: further lowering the participation rate of regional students in higher education; and detrimental economic and social impact in regional Australia.


At a time when regional students are already under-represented in our universities, these outcomes are utterly unacceptable.


While there are many measures in this legislation that are wrongheaded, I particularly want to focus on just one of those measures in the time that I have left in this debate, and that is the damage being done by these proposals to the delivery of enabling education programs in Australia. The Liberal government's ill-thought-out proposal to introduce fees for enabling programs, to cap student numbers and, indeed, to look at outsourcing or privatising enabling education in Australia is a dangerous slippery slope for enabling education.


These programs are university preparation courses. These enabling programs give people who have sometimes not had opportunities to finish high school, who have had their education and life interrupted by all sorts of issues and complications along the way, an important pathway to participate in tertiary education. Indeed, they ensure that regions like the Newcastle and Hunter region have a local skill base that can capitalise on opportunities in the 21st century economy.


These courses are particularly successful in helping students from overwhelmingly disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds to get a university education. As I said, they provide the very skills that you would want every young person in our community to have, but this legislation before us tonight puts all of that under threat. This has particular significance for the University of Newcastle, because the University of Newcastle is the oldest and largest provider of enabling education in this country.


We do enabling education very well; we're very experienced at it. It is no coincidence, for example, that there are more than 1,000 Indigenous students enrolled at the University of Newcastle. It is no coincidence that we train more than half of this nation's Indigenous doctors. And that's because the University of Newcastle, for more than 30 years now, has invested heavily in enabling programs that specifically target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. We have the Yapug program, which has opened up so many opportunities for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women of Australia.


I was really very fortunate to be at a scholarship presentation ceremony at the university recently. I met this amazing woman, Michaela, who was in her second year of medicine at The University of Newcastle. She had completed the enabling program. She was a young woman whose experience of secondary education had given her very little hope or confidence that she could attend university. She was introduced to the enabling program, and is now a scholarship recipient in her second year of university. She introduced me to the other 19 Aboriginal men and women undertaking second-year medicine at the University of Newcastle. All but one of these students came through an enabling program—the very programs this legislation seeks to destroy. 'Destroy' might seem a very loaded word to some people opposite, but I warn them that putting a price barrier in front of kids who already face multiple obstacles getting their foot in the door of higher education is all it takes to stop them from making that step.


I was very fortunate last July to have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for higher education, Tanya Plibersek, visit the University of Newcastle. She spent time with students and the providers of these enabling programs. We met so many terrific students that day. One who particularly comes to mind is a young man who is now doing his master's degree, who was so ill during his high school education that he barely got beyond year 9. Nobody had any hopes for him, yet he managed to find his way to the University of Newcastle. His mother encouraged him to take part in an Open Foundation course—the very course that the government is seeking to price these kids out of, to outsource to the private sector and then cap the number of students allowed to enter. He is now enrolled in a master's program and is flying high. He is now excelling, but he is just one of—you are lucky you are seated, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons—42,000 students that the University of Newcastle have put through enabling programs in order for them to access and complete their higher education.


Any given day you step on the campus at the University of Newcastle, one in five students in the current cohort will be from an enabling program—one in five. My colleague the member for Dobell, who spoke earlier, has campuses of the University of Newcastle at Ourimbah. One in four of the students there come through enabling programs. That is because these are programs that provide access for a lot of kids who are the first in their family to ever go to university; women who have faced multiple obstacles; a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids who otherwise would be locked out; and kids who come from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. These are the very people that you would want to support in every way you could to get a quality higher education, and yet these are the people that this government seeks to block out. It is shameful.


I ask: where are all the members of the National Party right now to speak up for their constituencies? Where is the member for Cowper, who has two campuses—in Port Macquarie and in Coffs Harbour—of the University of Newcastle? Where is the member for Calare, who has a campus and the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health in Orange, run by the University of Newcastle? Where is the member for New England, the Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister? Where is he? He has two campuses: in Tamworth and Armidale. Where is the member for Lyne, who has a campus in Taree? Where is the member for Parkes, who has a campus in Moree? Why are they not here in this chamber, standing up to defend the universities that are going to educate their young men and women to help build and strengthen their regions? I am just astonished that they could not even put their name on a speaking list to justify why it is that they will come in here to vote in support of legislation that does nothing but damage to regional communities across Australia. I want to thank my colleague the member for Dobell, who, in stark contrast, stood up here defending the university and her constituents who attend the University of Newcastle's Ourimbah campus. It's a shame that the member for Robertson is not here doing likewise. She has a lot of her constituents attending the Ourimbah campus. It would be timely for these men and women, the so-called champions of regional Australia, to show their faces right now and actually be here for this debate instead of shunning it. They will be turning up when the bells ring for a division, any time soon, and they'll sit over on those benches supporting these cuts, supporting cuts to these universities that provide important catalysts in each of their regional communities.


There is no way that we can develop a quality 21st century higher education sector if all you have on the table is cuts to funding, cuts to services, cuts to infrastructure and cuts to vital programs like the enabling programs that I've spoken about tonight; programs that prepare young men and women who would otherwise have been locked out of university for the future economy and instead give them every opportunity that they rightly deserve to have quality education in Australia.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",NXT,2017-09-13,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:30):  When considering the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, we should reflect on a statement made by Prime Minister Turnbull when he assumed office as Prime Minister in September 2015. The Prime Minister said:


The Australia of the future has to be a nation that is agile, that is innovative, that is creative. We can't be defensive, we can't future-proof ourselves.


This is a national goal that I share with the Prime Minister. As technology evolves faster than it ever has before, we rely on an educated society to drive the innovation that will keep Australia placed as one of the best countries in the world to work and live in.


Universities are the cornerstone of innovation. Over the last century, Australian universities have been the catalyst for some truly remarkable inventions, creations and research that have dramatically shaped the world we live in. This includes the bionic ear, invented at the University of Melbourne, which has benefited close to 200,000 people worldwide and has led to the employment of over 2,200 people; solar conversion technology developed by the University of New South Wales; CPAP technology to treat sleep apnoea, developed by the University of Sydney, which built the company ResMed, which has over 4,000 employees and annual revenues of $1.6 billion; a cervical cancer vaccine invented by the University of Queensland which saves over 250,000 lives each year; and so many more. Indeed, I don't think we give enough recognition to the university sector for research and innovation that is changing lives and creating jobs and investment in Australia.


I realise that funding has increased considerably since the uncapping of places. The sector has experienced unprecedented growth, and this has created unintended consequences and affected other sectors such as apprenticeships. While there has been unprecedented growth in student numbers, over the last five years universities have experienced significant budget cuts. Let's examine some of those cuts. In 2010, the then Labor government cut $298 million by abolishing the Capital Development Pool. In 2013, the MYEFO cut $113 million in ARC funding. In 2015, changes to start-up scholarships, cuts to the Sustainable Research Excellence initiative, closure of the OLT and closure of the Structural Adjustment Fund saw further cuts of over $2 billion. In total, over $3.4 billion of funding has been removed from the university sector in recent years. It is worth remembering that, while many of the funding cuts have occurred since the Abbott government, the Labor budget in March 2013 made cuts of $2.37 billion in higher education through the introduction of a so-called efficiency dividend.


The Nick Xenophon Team is not convinced that this bill as it currently stands will assist the sector to reform. We agree that reform is needed but cannot accept that this is the reform that is indeed needed. With the greatest of respect, this bill is tinkering around the edges with some small good measures and a blunt and deep cut that will mean job losses to the sector and higher education costs for students.


What we need is a comprehensive review of higher education that involves federal and state governments, universities and the vocational education apprenticeships sector around the table. We need a comprehensive review, akin to the Gonski-led review of education. We must look at how we prepare the next generation for the world of work to ensure young people successfully transition to sustainable employment. Right now we have university educated young people stacking shelves at supermarkets because there are few graduate jobs. These young people are in debt for thousands of dollars and their degrees are essentially redundant if they are not able to find employment in their chosen field of study in the years immediately following graduation. Unfortunately, I see too many of those young people in my electorate. At the same time, apprenticeships and traineeship numbers have significantly declined. According to the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research, in 2012 there were 470,000 apprentices and trainees. By March this year that number had declined to just 275,000 apprentices and trainees, a loss of nearly 200,000 places, yet we're not adequately addressing this crisis.


As recently highlighted by my colleague Senator Nick Xenophon, the government is yet to act on Senate inquiry recommendations that addressed skills shortages that were raised two years ago. The report Directions in Australia’s automotive industry: an industry report 2017 detailed 27,000 jobs waiting to be filled. The automotive industry is just one industry where there are skills shortages; residential construction trades is another area. This will be exacerbated as older tradesmen, highly skilled craftsmen—carpenters, stone masons and electricians—retire. If you think it's difficult to get a plumber now, wait five years!


One of the reasons for the skills shortage is that, in our culture, trades are considered an inferior career and universities the only pathway to success. In the article 'What now for the demand driven system?' Mark Burford, the former education advisor during the Rudd-Gillard government, held concerns that were raised in the 2008 Bradley review of higher education. It stated: 


… moving to a demand-based approach to funding higher education cannot be done in isolation from VET. Changing higher education funding but leaving VET funding untouched would compound existing distortions. 


A decade on, we can see that these concerns were well founded. We have a more educated population but job outcomes for graduates are getting worse. High-school students receive little pathway planning to determine their strengths. Trades are not seen as a valuable career. I believe they should be. By the same token, the university sector has encouraged an increase in enrolments that has led to a drop in entry standards and teaching quality. In 2016, figures released by the Department of Education and Training show that over 1,000 students were admitted to the Bachelor of Teaching with an ATAR score of less than 50. How are these students expected to teach the Australian curriculum to others when they are unable to pass it themselves? I want to make it clear that I'm not advocating for the removal of the demand driven system and a return to capped places, but we urgently need to examine the impacts of the demand driven system and examine admissions standards for students looking to enter university. 


There are a number of measures that have merit in this bill. I'll detail some of those measures. I support enshrining the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program in legislation. This program helps to ensure that Australians from low-SES backgrounds have the opportunity to attend university. I support the $24 million allocated to work-integrated learning opportunities. A graduate leaving university with experience in their chosen field and with contacts in the industry is invaluable for their future job prospects. I support the $15 million investment in regional higher education through the establishment of eight community hubs across Australia, although I do feel that $15 million is woefully inadequate for regional Australia. I support the transparency measures and the principle of performance-contingent funding. However, I believe that what is proposed has the potential to lead to perverse outcomes. In reality, the proposed contingent funding will mean that universities will need to reduce their expenditure by 7.5 per cent each year and hold on to those funds on the likelihood that such funds may be clawed back by government in the following year should they not meet expected performance targets. This measure does not have savings in the budget, but it will pit university against university for the share of the losers' funds. It will, if you like, be a Hunger Gamesstyle policy, where smaller universities and, in particular, regional universities will be at a disadvantage when entering the game. This approach will create winners and losers rather than lifting the performance benchmarks overall.


I'm also concerned about exactly what those measures will be. If it is determined that performance-funding measures will be based on such things as retention rates or collective GPAs, will universities cherrypick students that they know will need the least support? 


Does this mean a single parent or a student with a disability or a first-in-family student will be less likely to receive a place? 


I accept that the new measures need to be paid for but I can't justify new measures worth $158 million coming at a cost of $3.8 billion. I cannot support increasing the student contribution. Australia currently has the fifth-highest tuition fees in the OECD countries, behind the United States, Japan, Korea and Canada. The government is asking Australian students to shoulder even more of the burden. Nearly 80 per cent of students enrolled in a bachelor degree are young people. We are asking them to pay more to get less. It is not lost on young people that many of the decision-makers in this place had the great benefit of a free university education and are now legislating for them to pay more.


Young people have borne the brunt of budget cuts for years. In the 2014 budget, we had a proposal for 'six months on, six months off' youth allowance for young jobseekers—as if young people could magically live on fresh air for six months at a time. In the same budget, National Youth Week was stripped of funding, and the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition, also known as AYAC, was defunded, ensuring young people are denied a national advocate. 


Last year the government sought a five-week waiting period for young people applying for Centrelink assistance. From the 1970s through to 2013, successive governments in this place have recognised that young people deserve representation through a minister for youth. One Australian in five is aged 12 to 25, yet both major parties rejected a motion asking the Prime Minister to appoint a minister for young people, also known as a minister for youth. How can we expect young people to ever reach prosperity, or start a family if they desire, if at every turn we want to charge them more and take more from them.


The lowering of the HELP repayment threshold is an issue that has caused angst amongst young people. The HELP system is one of the most generous higher education loan systems in the world, and the current threshold for repayment is $54,869. That is significantly more than comparable countries. New Zealand has a threshold of $18,000 and the UK has a threshold of $36,000. The HELP system means no Australian student faces the barriers of up-front costs for their university education. This, I believe, above all else is the biggest contributor to encouraging students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter university. It is, in my opinion, one of the best facets of our higher education system and we must do all we can to protect it.


The HELP loan is designed to be repaid gradually once a student has derived a benefit from it and is contributing to society. Under the proposed legislation, the repayment threshold would be lowered to $42,000 at a rate of one per cent. The question must be asked: has a person who is earning $42,000 per year derived a benefit from their university studies? The average income for a working Australian is $61,000, and that is $19,000 more than the proposed threshold. I don't believe students who are earning just $6,000 above the minimum wage are yet deriving a significant benefit from their studies. I do concede the repayment is low at that level, but I do think we need to look at this very carefully. I'm not yet convinced the $42,000 threshold is the right approach. I will be open to discussing that further with the government, as will my Senate colleagues.


The proposed changes for residents, and particularly for New Zealand students, will mean many students will no longer be able to afford to study in Australia. Remember, New Zealand is facing an election at the moment. Should the New Zealand Labour Party win—and it will be on a platform of free university study—we will find that very few students from New Zealand will be interested in migrating to Australia.


In South Australia, we have three excellent universities: the University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide and Flinders University, of which I have very fond memories. Collectively they employ 10,000 people and contribute significantly to South Australia's economy. The measures put forward in this legislation could result in up to 770 job losses across those three universities. South Australia cannot afford to lose those jobs. We cannot afford to implement legislation that will not reform the sector but will be a blunt instrument that results in job losses and higher student debt.


The Nick Xenophon Team believes we need a comprehensive review of the whole post-secondary education space in both metropolitan and regional areas. We need to consider our future workforce and how best to shape the university and vocational and education sectors together to build our nation's capacity. We need sensible university reform that does not punish students. In order to do this we must do our homework first, bringing together government and all the relevant stakeholders to design reform and then to legislate and implement same.

Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (17:44):  There are a number of measures in the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 that there's no possible way the Labor Party can support. And there are certainly a number of measures in this bill that the university sector itself does not support.


This bill will cut university funding by $4 billion and hit students with higher fees. I personally know what it's like to be paying back a non-government-supported HELP debt. It is not nice. Particularly when you're older, it's a lot harder to stomach. It will saddle students with bigger debts that they'll have to pay back at the same time as they are trying to buy a house or start a family. If you're a young Australian and you aspire to go to university, aspire to earn a decent wage and aspire to have a house, under this government you cannot actually aspire to have all of those things. This government is making people choose. These were things that many, many years ago we took for granted. This bill compromises the teaching and learning and undermines research at our universities, which is absolutely gut wrenching considering how well our universities do on the global stage. And it slashes investment in universities at a time when the government should be investing in both universities and TAFEs in order to guarantee a strong, productive economy.


This government talks about the economy all the time, yet what this bill is actually doing is going to be extremely detrimental to our economy, because higher education is an investment in our people; it's an investment in our economy. This legislation will seek to make it harder for regional students, those who are from a disadvantaged background and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds to access a higher education. It also goes against the grain of what the other OECD countries are calling for. The legislation is not supported by Australia's Group of Eight universities, and the legislation is obviously of great concern to Universities Australia.


There was one person I heard yesterday in the MPI debate, and that was the member for Hughes, who seems to be the chief cheerleader for this government. He's somewhat in denial. He claimed yesterday that Labor needed to get some maths education and we needed to do our research. He claimed that this government is not making a cut to higher education. Well, I say this to the member for Hughes and everyone else on the other side who says this is not a cut. I don't know; I think most people on this side would agree that at universities they have professors of economics and professors of mathematics. You've got Universities Australia saying, 'Science would be hardest hit by proposed university cuts,' 'Rankings highlight risk of uni funding cuts,' and, 'Government out of step with community opposition to uni cuts: only one in 10 SA voters support,' about the government's cuts. You've got them saying that all the leaders of Australian universities are 'unanimous' in their 'opposition to the proposals to cut university funding and lift student fees'. You've got the Innovative Research Universities saying:


The package cuts university funding and increases the student charge.


A cut's a cut. If the universities are saying it, they're the experts. They're probably more expert in economics than many in this place. It is a cut.


This is exactly what we're facing under this legislation, and it's certainly not something that we can support. Universities Australia—and this is the chief executive, Belinda Robinson—had this to say about the Prime Minister's cuts:


As our economy changes and old industries face new threats, Australia needs to keep—not cut—our investment in universities to create new jobs, new industries and new sources of income for Australia.


Ms Robinson's message is particularly relevant to the regions where local economies are in transition. I would have thought the government would recognise that that's the fact, but, if they're not in touch with regional Australia, then surely they mustn't know.


The Group of Eight universities are calling on the Senate to block the changes. What they're saying is that this legislation puts at risk the capacity building in universities. I quote from the Group of Eight in the submission that they've made to the Senate:


… cuts to university funding will force universities to make difficult choices about the allocation of resources across teaching, student support, and research with serious impacts on access, choice, quality, and, most importantly, equity.


And I don't think those on the other side really understand what equity means, particularly in regional Australia. They also state:


Regional Australia makes an enormous contribution to Australia's progress across multiple sectors and industries. Its success depends in part on university graduates being able to apply their knowledge and capabilities to drive economic progress and create healthy communities.


I would have thought everyone in this place would agree with that statement. But this legislation goes against that. How on earth those sitting opposite who are from regional communities and claim they represent regional communities can support this legislation is beyond me, because this will make it harder for regional students.


The OECD last night released some documentation around where we're at in Australia, and it was quite telling indeed. They were basically saying that Australia's higher education has amongst the lowest levels of public investment within the OECD. Australian public investment in tertiary education institutions is 0.7 per cent of GDP, 40 per cent below the OECD average of 1.1 per cent. In contrast, however, Australia's level of private investment in tertiary education is at 1.1 per cent of GDP, more than twice the OECD average of 0.5 per cent. I think we have to have some recognition—certainly on this side of the House—that the primary benefit of a university student's education is a public benefit. These figures don't really reflect that at all. The government is investing less in higher education as we move forward.


The OECD report also says the high private contribution Australian students make to the cost of their tertiary education is reflected in the high level of tuition fees our students are required to pay. Again, the report shows these to be amongst the highest in the OECD. And this government is expecting students to pay more. Let's say you're from a regional community in the north-west of Tasmania, where we have a regional campus of the University of Tasmania. You know that the job prospects in your region are not going to give you high wages. That's the reality of living in regional Australia. The average wage is a lot less, particularly in Tasmania. You then have to have this massive HELP debt at the end of your university career to get into a job that is paying you less than the national average for that occupation. You have to question why you'd want to do that in the first place. This government is setting up regional students and regional Australia to fail.


So what does this legislation mean for my local university, the Cradle Coast campus of the University of Tasmania? Universities Australia have established that these cuts will see the University of Tasmania worse off by $51.3 million. My electorate, like many regional areas in Australia, has a disproportionate number of people not engaged in higher education. Torrens University Australia's social health atlases state that Braddon's school leaver participation in higher education, at an average of 18.58 per cent, is lower than the Tasmanian average and the national average. Respected economist and University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor's Fellow Saul Eslake has previously said:


Higher levels of educational participation and attainment won't solve all of Tasmania’s economic and social challenges—but they will make them less difficult to solve, not least by sustainably increasing the resources which can be used to solve them.


This legislation is going against what someone like Saul Eslake is saying. Former UTas vice-chancellor Peter Rathjen has been on the public record that cuts to the University of Tasmania could threaten the future of regional campuses. You have to understand the Cradle Coast campus is subsidised by the main campus in Hobart. It operates at a huge loss, and I take my hat off to the University of Tasmania for wanting to maintain the Cradle Coast campus, because it has made a huge difference to the lives of the people in the north-west and on the west coast of Tasmania and their ability to access education.


When I first went to the University of Tasmania in Launceston, it was 100 kilometres from where I lived. I had to move home. Thankfully, my single mother could subsidise my rent, and I had to pay for my schoolbooks. When you're living off two-minute noodles you can just about do that, but I understand what it's like to be an undergraduate, leaving home and living on barely anything, just to get a university education. The Cradle Coast campus allows accessible courses for people in my region. The message is very clear that the Group of Eight and our local universities will have to make very, very hard decisions if this legislation is passed.


The Cradle Coast campus offers a number of degrees and research based postgraduate study which directly relate to the industries in my electorate, particularly in agriculture and advanced manufacturing. What's really hard to stomach is this government's decision to put an up-front cost on enabling courses. Enabling courses don't actually give anyone a qualification at the end, but they help people who may be very hesitant about entering higher education. There are a number of those people in my electorate who will have to come up with $3,200, or at least defer the cost through HELP. The Cradle Coast campus offers a number of enabling courses. University preparation programs are offered to kids who are 16 and 17. It's ludicrous that you would saddle a 16- or 17-year-old with a debt just to decide whether they're going to continue with their education. Other programs are UniStart, Students in Schools, the VET to higher education achievers program and the University Connections Program for year 11 and 12 students. These courses help potential students develop the skills required for independent learning and success: critical thinking—which, I have to say, is a bit lacking on the other side—critical reading and academic writing.


The other area that's of concern to me as someone who has studied a couple of postgraduate degrees is the changes made to placements for postgraduate positions within universities, those that are not Commonwealth supported places and those that are. This government is reducing the number of government supported places. I graduated last year from Monash University in a non-government supported place by studying 10 units, which is the first step to become a registered psychologist, and I ended up with a HELP debt of $28,000 after 10 units. The next stage is to do an advanced or honours equivalent course. Monash were offering that and it is all done online, which is very accessible to students and a great way of studying for postgraduate students, but that second course, which you had to do to just become provisionally registered as a psychologist, was going to cost another $28,000. I know that people in my course, when they were contemplating at that time what to do next, found that a huge barrier to them undertaking further education just to become provisionally qualified as a psychologist. These were older people in their 40s and 50s wanting a career change, and this government is going to stop even more of them from going into advanced education for higher degrees.


It is not only that; in some cases, you have to be offered a position to study in a higher degree. What this government is saying is that it may be introducing a system where you take a voucher to a university. So, if you're offered a place, do you then go and say: 'I've got to apply for a voucher. I'm not sure if I'll get it. It's sort of like a scholarship. Can you hold off on that placement until I can confirm with the government whether it will support me to go on and get a higher degree?' We don't know. This legislation is so scant on details. This is really unsettling for university students right now who are looking at whether they should go and get a higher degree and those, particularly from regional communities, thinking about going into university and wondering what on earth this government is doing, why it is creating all these barriers to higher education and why it is stopping people in regional Australia from improving their lives and being in a position to earn a good income, to pay more tax and to make a contribution to our society. This is a real shame of this government—an absolute shame—and I hope that those in the Senate and on the crossbench do not support this bill.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-09-13,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (17:59):  The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 is bad public policy. I am very disappointed. I am sure I speak for a great many people in the electorate of Denison and throughout Tasmania when I say this is bad policy and it should not be pursued. It is very disappointing that the government is so determined to try and ram these sort of reforms through the parliament.


Why on earth would we be asking university students to pay more and asking university graduates to start paying back their debt sooner? Why on earth would we be cutting university funding even more when they are already chronically underfunded, even though we live in one of the richest, most clever and most fortunate countries in the world? This country, more than any other country, can afford to properly resource our universities, yet here we are again in this place, debating more cuts to university funding.


This is going to hurt the University of Tasmania greatly, and I associate myself with the comments from the member for Braddon, who has covered some of this ground quite effectively. By one estimate, the University of Tasmania will see its funding cut by over $11 million annually by 2021 if these so-called reforms come to pass. Tasmania is a small state with a relatively small university that is cross-subsidising two campuses outside of Hobart and, in fact, is cross-subsidising the campus at Burnie to a very great extent. This is one university that simply cannot afford to lose $11.2 million annually. It is not just the university that will be worse off; the students will be worse off. In fact, students will be paying something like $11.3 million extra in fees in Tasmania by 2021 if these so-called reforms go through. This will hurt the University of Tasmania. This will hurt students at the University of Tasmania. This will especially hurt the campus at Burnie and the students of that smaller campus. I associate myself in full with the very wise comments from the member for Braddon about the Burnie campus.


It is also a direct attack on disadvantaged people and women throughout Tasmania and throughout this country. When the government is demanding that ex-students on incomes as low as $42,000 a year—barely above the minimum wage—start paying back their debts, that is unacceptable. It will disproportionately hurt disadvantaged people, people on low incomes and people who are, for good reason, in and out of the workforce and have a lower average income. For example, women might be in and out of the workforce as they start a family and raise a family. Also, I would hope, there are men who are in and out of the workforce to care for their young children and to allow their partner to be in the workforce full time.


This is very ill-considered policy. This is policy that is coming on top of all of the other cuts to the tertiary sector over recent years. For example, between 2010 and 2013, the Gillard Labor government cut $2.3 billion from universities. Cuts have been so severe that universities throughout the country are now effectively underfunded by about $1 billion a year. I make the point again that this is one of the richest countries in the world—a country with a federal budget which forecasts expenditure of some $456,000 million this financial year. With all of that money sloshing around, and with all that we know about the value of education and the richness it brings both to our community and to the members of our community, the government would go ahead with a reform that is going to cost the University of Tasmania alone over $11 million a year by 2021 and hurt campuses like the Burnie campus. The reform is going to cost the students at our university over $11 million a year by 2021. This is not good enough.


Don't just take my word for it. If you don't believe me then believe the OECD, because they have just released a report, Education at a glance 2017. They have put Australian public investment in tertiary education institutions now at 0.7 per cent of our GDP, some 40 per cent below the OECD average of 1.1 per cent of GDP. Do you know where that puts us? Thirtieth out of 34 countries when it comes to public funding for our universities. How naive and short-sighted are we when this is all that we know about the value of education? How are we going to compete with the 29 countries ahead of us in the OECD when we're dumbing down our education and we're restricting education to the rich or the kids of the rich or the kids in the big cities? How are we going to compete with the other 29 countries? Well, we won't. It's as simple as that.


One of the problems here is this obsession over many years—and I'll probably trace it back to the Howard government, but it has continued to this day—with commercialisation, privatisation and user pays. We now have a two-class society in this country, and it's going to get a whole lot worse if this bill goes through: the haves and the have-nots, the rich and the disadvantaged, and the people who can afford user pays and the people who can't afford user pays. We have a two-class society, with the rich and the poor. The rich are doing okay. They'll go to the best private schools, they'll go to the best universities and they'll go to the best hospitals. They'll do well and they'll keep doing well. It will snowball, and they'll do better and better and better, and their families will do better and better and better. What about the rest of the community, the people who can't afford user pays, who are going to have to put up with underfunded universities, low-price courses, underfunded hospitals, underfunded high schools and underfunded primary schools? 'Safety nets' is how John Howard referred to the public education system—a safety net.  It is a bizarre comment but a comment which is being echoed by the current conservative government, who have an obsession with privatisation and commercialisation: 'Don't worry about the members of the community; just make them pay more for their course and make them start paying it back sooner.' There is a reliance on foreign students and a reliance on commercial sponsorship of research. It is all about user pays and someone else paying for it other than the government.


I saw in the paper this morning a report that the accumulated student debt in this country has now reached approximately $50 billion, but the tone of the article in the paper was that this is a problem, it's too much money and the government has to claw it back. But you know what? The government's missing the point, because that's $50 billion that the government should have paid for. It shouldn't be $50 billion of student debt that we're now going after, because governments over many years have shifted $50 billion of the government's financial responsibility to students themselves. Much of that outstanding debt is being carried by lower income people, lower income families and disadvantaged people. They're carrying that debt, but the government's still going after them. That's not good enough. That's cost-shifting. So how dare the government tell the media today, seemingly as though it's an explanation for this bill, that all of these people owe all of this money, and that's bad, and they want it back. Well, the government should never have had them rack up the bill in the first place.


In fact, I'll go so far as to say that the last good university policy we had in this country was between 1972 and 1975, when there was fee-free undergraduate study for Australian students. That's where we should be going. That's where we should be trending, not to more and more user pays and complaining because students are racking up debt and not paying it back quickly enough.


We are rich enough to return to the days of the early seventies. We are rich enough to do what Gough Whitlam did and say we do not tolerate but celebrate education. We understand the inherent value of education. We understand that, the more learned our community is, the happier they are, the more prosperous they are, the healthier they are and the better this country can compete with the 29 countries in the OECD who fund their universities better than we do. How on earth do we compete with countries like Singapore, Thailand, China, Korea and Taiwan—countries that celebrate learning and invest so much more money into the community? No wonder they're doing so well. No wonder we're struggling against these countries when it comes to trade and other matters. We are just missing the point here. We are completely and utterly missing the point.


There is a $456,000 million forecast expenditure in Australia in this financial year, but you know what? We've still got to go after uni students. We've still got to cut funding for universities. We've still got to complain that university students owe too much. We are missing the point. I would make that point again. In fact, I'm going to labour this point because I don't think it's ventilated enough in this place. We can actually afford and, I think, should aspire—and maybe a future government will come along with the foresight and the fortitude to return us—to the early seventies, when we saw the value in free or fee-free undergraduate university places. That is exactly what we need to do. That's where we should be heading, and there's no reason why we shouldn't be doing that or at least trending towards it, because we can definitely afford it.


It's all about priorities. Everything in this place comes back to priorities. I know money can't solve all problems, but I tell you what: it can go a long way to solving many problems. With the amount of money that's sloshing around in this place, you've really got to wonder why we have so many problems—why we have underfunded universities to the tune of $1 billion a year, underfunded hospitals with ridiculous waiting lists, underfunded high schools, underfunded primary schools, homeless living on the street and people who can't afford their power bills—in a country as rich as ours. It's because too few people in this place have the vision or priorities in the right order to fix them.


The government thinks it is okay—in fact, the government is boasting—to trend towards two per cent spending on defence. They're going to double the submarine fleet even though we can't find the crews for the existing six, but don't worry about that. Don't worry that we can't find the crews for our six subs. Let's buy 12! How ridiculous all of this chest-beating is. Why don't we get our priorities in order? Yes, we need a Defence Force. Yes, we need to replace the submarines. But let's get our priorities in order.


We are spending an outrageous amount of money on the Joint Strike Fighter when there were always other cheaper alternatives. Why aren't we raising more revenue? Why don't we have a superprofits tax on any sector of the economy that achieves a disproportionate return on its investment? Why don't we get a bit more tax back from the banks that made $30 billion of profit last year? They can afford to pay a bit more. High wage earners like us—parliamentarians—can afford to pay a bit more. There are so many ways that we can save money in the budget sensibly, so many ways that we can raise extra revenue in this country sensibly, so many things we could be doing and talking about in this place, but what are we talking about tonight? We're talking about attacking the tertiary sector, which is already underfunded by $1 billion a year, and we're debating whether or not we should go after it for more.


I bring my little talk back to Tasmania. Tasmania: a small state, a small uni, a lot of disadvantaged people. This government thinks it is okay to cut the University of Tasmania's funding by more than $11 million a year. This government thinks it is okay to charge Tasmanian students at the University of Tasmania more than $11 million extra in fees each year, and, in doing so, to jeopardise some of the most disadvantaged people in the state and in this country, and very important campuses like Burnie.


I don't support this bill. I am pleased the opposition won't support this bill. It's bad public policy. (Time expired)

(2) Schedule 3, page 40 (after line 7), after item 35, insert:




35A


At the end of section


154
‑15



   Add:


(3) In working out a person's repayable debt for an *income year for the purposes of section 154‑20, ignore any part of the person's *accumulated HELP debt referred to in paragraph 154‑1(1)(b) in relation to that income year that relates to a unit of study undertaken on a regional campus, unless the person's *repayment income for the income year is $56,205 or more.


(4) A unit of study is undertaken on a regional campus by a person if:


   (a) the person is enrolled at a particular campus to undertake the unit of study; and


   (b) either:


      (i) during the year in which the unit of study is undertaken, a regional loading was payable to the higher education provider in respect of the campus; or


      (ii) the Minister determines, under subsection (5), that this subparagraph applies to the campus for the year in which the unit of study is undertaken.


(5) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine that subparagraph (4)(b)(ii) applies to a campus for a year if the Minister is satisfied that, during that year, the campus has an above average number of students whose permanent home (as defined in section 19A of the Social Security Act 1991) is in a regional area.


This amendment is designed to create a financial incentive for students to study at regional universities by creating a HELP-debt-repayment-free period for students studying at regional campuses. Under the amendment, regional students would have a HELP-debt-repayment-free period on the units completed at a regional campus until they reach the $56,205 threshold under the government's proposed legislation. Repayments would then continue as per the government's proposed legislation. The HELP-debt-repayment-free period would apply to students attending a campus that receives a Commonwealth Grant Scheme regional loading or that the minister has identified as having an above-average number of students whose home address is at a regional location.


The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed this proposal as having a $21.6 million cost. I repeat: $21.6 million—nothing in the scheme of things, considering the investment that it would give to regional Australia. This investment will make a significant difference in increasing higher education participation by regional and low-SES students and by reducing the financial burden.


Colleagues, and particularly colleagues from regional Australia: I call on you to consider this recommendation, because this amendment will encourage regional students to remain in our regions and potentially attract regional students from the cities, providing a financial incentive to students to study in regional areas and addressing one of the biggest threats to sustainability of rural communities. The package before us has not adequately considered the impact on regional students, and my proposed amendments will go some way to ensure more students study in regional Australia. I commend this amendment to the House.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (18:42):  In rising to support this amendment, which makes a bad bill just a little bit better, I want to note the government's utter contempt for democracy that they would gag this very important debate and prevent the Greens and other members from the opposition from speaking, because they are trying to hide the fact that they are ripping billions of dollars out of our university system. Government, you might not like what the Greens have to say in standing up for students in universities, but at least give us a chance to say it. What have you got to hide that you want to gag this debate? What you're trying to hide is the fact that universities in this country are underfunded and are in need of support, and students are struggling under enormous debt. What this government is trying to do, so that it can fund a corporate tax cut to the big end of town, is to put students into even more debt and place the burden on universities.


And where's the money going to come from out of universities' pockets? We know, because just recently one university, the university that I went to, decided to cut the wages of all its staff by terminating their enterprise agreement, and then the minister got up and said he encouraged every other university in the country to do exactly the same. So this government wants to get some of its $3.8 billion of savings from the pockets of students and the rest of it from the pockets of staff members, putting an already stretched system under even further stress.


What we know is that universities in this country have been underfunded for a long time. We saw that with the Bradley review, which said we need a 10 per cent increase in base funding. Then what happens every time the budget comes around is that we see governments dipping into universities and students to try to balance it. A number of us were here and remember when in the last Labor government, to try to fund the Gonski reforms, the Labor Party cut $2.3 billion out of universities. We saw it with the Abbott government in their first budget here, and now we're seeing a sneaky second attempt to get it back. No wonder this government is trying to hide what it is doing by gagging debate and stopping proper scrutiny from being brought to bear on it. We should not be supporting bills that are being gagged through this place. The Greens will continue to stand up for students and universities.


There are much better ways of balancing the budget than taking the axe to students and taking the axe to universities. If the government wants to look for a place to start balancing the budget, perhaps it shouldn't give $50 billion in tax cuts to the big end of town. When you give $7 billion of tax cuts to the big banks, they're not going to use it to create more jobs; that is going straight to their bottom line, straight into profits. If this government seriously thinks that universities and students should find themselves almost $4 billion worse off to help with a $7 billion tax cut to the big banks then it is no wonder that they are falling behind in the polls.


The sooner that we can kick this rotten government out, the sooner many students will breathe a sigh of relief and the sooner we can get on to holding the next government to account and make sure we properly fund universities and students, so that students can study properly, without having to put themselves into further debt.

National regional higher education strategy



(1) The Minister must cause to be prepared a strategy to be known as the national regional higher education strategy.


(2) The strategy must cover, but is not limited to, the following matters:


   (a) strategies to support the provision of higher education in regional areas, including a review of regional loading;


   (b) strategies to increase the representation of regional students in higher education;


   (c) strategies to address the sustainability of rural communities and the declining population of young people in regional centres;


   (d) strategies to provide greater support for those transitioning between secondary and higher education, including support to stay in a regional area or to relocate from a regional area to an urban area;


   (e) strategies to ensure there is recognition of the workforce and economic development requirements of the community in developing higher education policy.


   (f) strategies to support the role of regionally based higher education providers in creating diverse and resilient regional economies, taking into consideration other relevant policies and programs.


(3) The Minister must cause a copy of the strategy to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after 1 January 2018.


(4) The Minister must cause the strategy prepared under subsection (1), or that strategy as previously revised under this subsection, to be revised every 4 years.


(5) The Minister must cause a copy of a revised strategy under subsection (4) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 4 years after the previous strategy or revised strategy was tabled under this section.


This will require the minister to present the parliament with a national regional higher education strategy within 15 sitting days after 1 January 2018. The minister will be required to table an updated strategy every four years. To my colleagues on the other side who represent regional Australia: can I ask you to pay particular attention to this amendment and choose carefully how you will vote. 


I move this motion from a sense of absolute frustration. The government says it supports regional development. The government says it supports decentralisation. The government says it supports economic growth and development. How are we going to do it if our universities can't provide us with the skilled people in the areas that we need over the longer period? So I say to my colleagues: please pay serious consideration to this particular bit of legislation and to this particular amendment because, in voting against it, you vote against the future of our regional universities.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (18:49):  Labor supports this amendment to legislate for a national regional higher education strategy. We know that the cuts in this bill would disproportionately impact regional universities that rely on CGS funding more than their city counterparts. Every Australian, no matter where they live, deserves to get a great education. From early childhood education, through schooling, TAFE and to university, we know that kids who are growing up in regional areas are often missing out. We've seen $17 billion of cuts to schools, more than $2.8 billion of cuts to vocational education and training and an extra $600 million cut in this year's budget. We've seen a loss of about 148,000 apprenticeships and traineeships. This bill will cut almost $4 billion from universities; and that's before you get to the cuts from the Education Investments Fund, which is close to another $4 billion, so it is almost $8 billion in cuts in total from universities. That will have a lasting effect on regional universities, whether they're in Newcastle or Launceston. Plans will be delayed or cancelled because the universities won't have the ability to pay for them.


It is absolutely time that those in this government, particularly those from the National Party, who say they stand up for regional education, actually do it. Labor has a very strong record of supporting regional students. We made landmark changes to student income support when we were last in government. We opened the doors to universities through the demand driven system and through HEPPP. Under Labor, we saw a 30 per cent increase in regional students in our universities. All of this is at risk because of the cuts that the government is persisting with. We are absolutely delighted to support the member for Indi and the other crossbenchers in the development of a regional higher education strategy.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:50):  I'm very pleased to be able to continue my remarks in opposition to this Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 and in support of the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I'm struck when I think about education by the continued insistence by the minister and government members generally that money doesn't matter. Of course we know it does, and the overwhelming body of evidence is to that effect. Of course, it is not simply the money in itself but how it's used as well. Overnight, we began the debate: what is significant legislation? It is significant in as much as it would send our university sector backwards and radically constrain the life opportunities of many thousands of Australians.


I'm struck by reports from the OECD, which are extraordinarily worrying and concerning and should give government members pause for thought before persisting with this legislation. What the OECD is telling us is that Australia is ranked 30th of the 34 OECD nations in our public investment in higher education—right at the very bottom. Of course, those statistics were collated before the very significant cuts which are contained in this legislation. The context of this is really important because, while my remarks and those of my colleagues are largely focused on talking about the retrograde impact of this legislation on my constituents and young Australians in the Australian economy, our economy does not exist in isolation. That's particularly true of higher education, which makes such an enormous impact on our economy, and that is certainly so in my home town of Melbourne.


When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke on this, she expressed her concern about the decline of some Australian institutions in significant international rankings and talked through the significance of this. The OECD report is further cause for alarm in that Universities Australia said—quite rightly in my view—that it is increasing investment that is driving the rise of other universities within our region, particularly in places like mainland China. This has caused Belinda Robinson, the CEO of Universities Australia, to warn us—and she's right to warn us—that we simply can't afford to cut our investment at a time when other countries, including those in Asia, are 'turbocharging their investments'. They are turbocharging their investments and are deriving a serious return from them in boosting their human capital, ensuring that their young people have their potential fully realised and are equipped for the changing future world of work. Again, this will have a significant impact on our ability not just to boost the individual capacity of young Australians but to earn significant export income.


Now is the time to take, effectively, the opposite tack of that which the government proposes. Now is the time to back-in our universities; those fantastic hardworking people who work in them; those who are presently studying in them; and those who should continue to be studying in them into the future, particularly those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who would be, should be, first-in-family-participants in higher education. These are the people who are already being adversely affected by this government's walking away from needs based schools funding.


I say to government members: far from blithely assuming that current funding levels for universities are excessive, as an efficiency dividend would imply, we should be querying this assumption. We should be querying it because it flies in the face of the evidence and it flies in the face of the wider importance of higher education to the Australian economy, as well as to individual Australians. I was really struck by it when I was reflecting on, in this context, the contributions of government members to this debate, some of which have been quite extraordinary, not simply in their preoccupation with an imagined past. The member for Barton, who is in the chamber, will no doubt share my interest that government members seem much more interested in talking about Menzies—imagining his record in government—than setting out their vision for the future of Australia. It's telling as to the crisis of confidence that goes to the heart of this government. It's not just in energy policy; it's right across the board.


We have a Prime Minister who sought office but, having attained it, has no power and hasn't got the courage of his convictions to set forward any course for Australia. In education, the consequences of this are huge. And there is this preoccupation with the past, this reification of Menzies in defiance of the evidence and their attempt to claim Labor's record in higher education. Many of my colleagues have gone through this and rebutted it effectively.


But I think it is worth saying that it is Labor governments which have made Australian universities what they are today and have ensured that the opportunity of university education has been opened up, whether it be by the Whitlam government, the extraordinary public-policy-making efforts of John Dawkins in the Hawke and Keating governments or, of course, the massive expansion of participation in higher education that took place under the former Labor governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Those governments really opened up higher education to so many Australians. And it's amazing, I think, as a member of this place, to reflect on what would have been lost had these people not been given the opportunity by Labor's reforms—the demand-driven system, opening up higher education.


I note that there are some positive elements contained within this messy bill dressed up as reform. I will make particular mention, as many of my colleagues have done, of the HEPP Program. It is a good thing—unequivocally a good thing—that we will continue to have the opportunity to address some of the cultural barriers to higher education participation in many disadvantaged cohorts and that people will continue to be able to reach out into the community and make sure that universities are not cloistered, shut-away places for the elite. That is vital. But it is cruel that this legislative recognition, firstly, comes on the back of very significant cuts to this important program and, secondly, is held hostage to reforms that completely undo the worthy work of HEPPP.


But I think that, as well as the attitude to Labor and higher education, we see something quite revealing from the contribution of many government members with their utter preoccupation with private benefit in their attitude to the benefits of education. We see their complete failure to acknowledge the wider benefits, economic and beyond, provided to our community at large from higher education. That we have world-class doctors in Australia surely matters just as much as those doctors' individual earnings and, I'd hope, their satisfaction in carrying out their work following graduation. This was a point very effectively made in the contribution of the shadow assistant minister for universities, the member for Griffith. The narrow, rigid individualism that characterises the engagement of government members with this challenge is extraordinarily disappointing. Surely, when we look at the sorts of professions on the one hand and the skill sets and disciplines on the other that result from university graduation, there needs to be a wider reflection on the purpose of higher education beyond simply supporting an individual's capacity to earn their income.


I also want to touch on the second reading contribution of the assistant minister. She pays homage to the minister, Senator Birmingham, in talking around rather than engaging with the key issues in the legislation. She speaks of the goal of a more student-focused system and asserts—amazingly, for me—that we are all in this together. Of course, we should all be in it together when it comes to university education, but what this government is doing through this bill and its wider neglect of our education system is quite the reverse. In fact, what it's saying to young Australians thinking about pursuing a university education and to Australians working in our higher education institutions is: 'You are on your own. You are not part of our vision of Australia's future.'


In Labor, we believe, all of us, in the power of education. We believe in the importance of early learning and of schools which are funded and equipped to enable every child to fulfil his or her potential. We believe in TAFE as the cornerstone of skills development, not just post school but throughout life. And we believe in our universities, which are so important to building individuals up to their potential and in supporting our economy, particularly in Melbourne. We are optimistic on this side. We believe in young Australians. And that's what's so disappointing about this government's attitude: its failure to see that our future lies in our capacity to develop our human capital more than anything else.


And it is telling also, beyond these contributions of government members, that this legislation arrives after, I believe, 29 reviews but no consultation. When you look at this bill, it is easy to see that there hasn't been meaningful consultation. This package of so-called reforms has done something quite remarkable: it has united the higher education sector against the government and this flawed legislation. Not even the member for Sturt was able to do that. It's quite a tribute to Senator Birmingham that he has managed to do that!


On the other hand, with my colleagues, led by the member for Sydney, I have been listening to what universities say and, vitally, to students too. I'm particularly concerned about the impact on the universities that principally service the communities that make up the Scullin electorate. I'm concerned that Victoria over the forward estimates will receive $533 million less. La Trobe University, just outside the electorate, will be impacted by cuts of over $68 million, and RMIT university's Bundoora campus faces cuts of over $80 million. This will have a huge impact on the communities I'm so proud to represent.


I note the contribution of the La Trobe University Vice-Chancellor, John Dewar—someone who was a supporter of previous government reform initiatives in this agenda, so no friend of the Labor Party when it comes to this. Professor Dewar says,


We all recognise the powerful economic, intellectual and innovation benefits a university education delivers to everyone in the community.


It seems counterintuitive for the Federal Government to talk of boosting innovation and productivity, while also introducing financial hurdles to creating the very workforce that will deliver on that ambition.


For 50 years, La Trobe University has been undertaking world-class research and educating leaders and innovators from all walks of life. I am concerned that the measures could mean more students from regional Australia or low SES groups – already underrepresented in University lecture halls – being unable to attend university in the future.


This is a contribution that government members should have very serious regard to.


Look at the substantive measures in the bill: the massive cuts, the absurd fee increases, the extraordinary proposals to change the repayment threshold by reducing it to a level barely beyond minimum wage, the shabby treatment of New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, the trashing of enabling courses. There is nothing in this bill which evidences a vision for our university sector or a vision for young Australians being equipped for all the challenges of life in the 21st century, the Asian century.


I'm proud to be standing here with all of my Labor colleagues in clear, firm opposition to this legislation and in solidarity with all of our students and our future university students.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2017-09-13,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (17:03):  I'm pleased to speak to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. I believe that this bill does not adequately support regional universities and their students. I will not support the bill in its current format and will be proposing amendments in the consideration in detail stage.


In my speech I will address three points. Firstly, I will outline my amendments as practical solutions to ensure that regional universities and their students are not disadvantaged. Secondly, I will recognise the central role regional universities play in driving the economic, social and cultural value of our communities. And finally, I will acknowledge the role of my community and the role of regional universities. It's not only working actively to raise these issues but coming to the table to genuinely work with me and identify solutions.


My amendments will legislate for a national regional higher education strategy and provide some financial relief to students studying in regional Australia through a HELP debt repayment. The national regional higher education strategy will ensure regional higher education is prioritised and remains a focus of future governments. It will require the minister to table the strategy in parliament in early 2018 and review and update the strategy every four years. The introduction of a regional student HELP-debt-repayment-free period will create a HELP-debt-repayment-free period for students studying at regional universities. This will provide a financial incentive to students to study in regional communities. It will encourage regional students to remain in the regions, and potentially attract students from the major cities. The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed this proposal as having only a $21.6 million cost to the headline cash payment over the forward periods to 2020-21—let me stress: only $21.6 million. It is a very small investment with an enormous return on investment for regional communities and those who live there.


As you know, our regional universities do more than educate. They are one of the largest and most visible physical, intellectual, cultural and sporting assets in our regions and cities. They are a critical player in workforce planning. They are a driver of economic growth and development. They are key employers. They innovate and they inspire. They act as major attracters to young people, and they can make the difference between economic survival and going backwards.


All regional MPs in this House know the many advantages related to living in regional Australia's towns and cities, including affordability and livability. Small cities can have the benefits of big cities without the disadvantages. They can be both highly productive and great places to live. The government knows this, too. They tell us in Regions 2030: Unlocking Opportunity:


Regional Australia is not just important to those of us who live here. The Australian economy is largely driven by its regions. Australia’s agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining industries, predominantly located in regional Australia, made up 57 per cent of the value of Australia’s merchandise exports in 2016.


Fifty seven per cent! It says:


Forty five cents in every dollar spent in Australia by international or local visitors is spent in regional areas. Most of the gas and electricity which powers city households is produced in regional Australia.


It is only logical that we should invest in Australia’s regions because Australia’s regions power Australia’s economy.


So says the government report. It continues: 


Investing in our regions pays massive dividends for our nation—strong regions are the foundation of a strong Australia.


That's from the government's own propaganda. Let me say that again: it's only logical that we should invest in Australia's regions because Australia's regions power Australia's economy.


My community knows the value of regional universities. They know that regional universities enable the best use of human capital and resources and contribute to educational opportunities, economic prospects, innovation and community capacity. The universities' teaching and learning activities, research and innovation, and services functions contribute to human capital development, regional governance and planning, community development, health and ageing care, arts, culture, sport, environmental sustainability and industry and business development. Our unis provide leadership in stimulating positive change and staff and students play active and visible roles in the community. For many regional centres, a strong university presence is intrinsic to a strong regional presence.


Large regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, have surely benefited from the presence of Charles Sturt and La Trobe universities. In the border's case, there is the added advantage of two university colleges. I would particularly like to acknowledge the role of Wodonga TAFE. Charles Sturt University, Australia's largest regional university, is the result of the formation of the Bathurst experimental farm and the Wagga Wagga experimental farm in the 1890s. In one form or another, research, innovation and education have been integral to the university's character and mission for more than a century.


My communities recognise the values of access to education, specifically tertiary education. They have consistently raised this as a priority. In the postbudget survey that my staff and I carried out in May of more than 1,000 people across the electorate, 92 per cent of respondents identified education as their top priority. They made the following points: forcing graduates to repay loans at a lower income threshold will just create a new category of poor—it's better to leave them enough money to spend, to live, to invest, to pay for housing and to have their families. So, clearly, regional universities and the ability to have money and live in your community are really important.


Marilyn Bakker told me: 'Something needs to be done to support kids for their tertiary education when they can't live at home.' Ian Jarvie said, 'Education and equitable access to all ensures diversity, access to information, better decisions and innovation.' Support for regional kids to attend universities includes regional subsidies, better and more relevant transport and more connectivity within the regional centres. Adrian Twitt tells me: 'Country students are handicapped in accessing tertiary education. There needs to be more support for such students.' So today I'm standing up for those in my electorate who have asked me to do so, to stand up for accessibility and for positive discrimination for rural and regional people, and universities. 


La Trobe and Charles Sturt universities and the Regional University Network told the Senate inquiry into education and employment that the net effect of this complex package can be summarised as government reducing the level of public investment in higher education while increasing the amount of student contributions. Students are asked to pay more for a university education that is funded less, and country students have to pay even more. The evidence provided that the bill runs counter to the importance of the sector to Australia and our regional economies. It sidesteps the critical issues of support for regionally delivered higher education, and creates disincentives for improving the participation and retention of under-represented student cohorts. 


They went on to say that the proposed bill in its current form would destabilise the foundation of Australia's world-class university system, and Australia cannot afford to risk our economic future and jeopardise the potential of our students by undermining the capacity of our higher education sector. I believe this legislation will do that. We know that regional students remain underrepresented in higher education institutions, and data shows that regional and remote students make up just 18.8 per cent of domestic undergraduate students at universities, compared to 26.4 per cent for the population as a whole. 


We know the real threat to rural communities is the declining population, particularly of our young people. The trend is to lose young people to the cities, as they leave their country homes for opportunities related to employment, education and training, and leisure in urban centres and overseas. Statistics show that they are unlikely to return in a hurry. The Regional Universities Network reports that people who study in regions largely stay in the regions. A study undertaken by the Regional Universities Network demonstrates that between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the employed recent graduates of those universities were employed in regional Australia. If they study locally, they stay locally. And herein lies the problem.


The government's proposed package will disproportionately affect low-income households. For students who are studying and working part-time, financial pressure has been shown to be a major contributor to a student's decision to drop out of or not take up higher education. Far away from family and community support, this captures regional students who go to metro areas at a disproportionate rate. And, while the independent review considers students who will look to travel to metropolitan universities, it does not support the students who elect to continue their education at a regional university. These very issues are, at best, barely adequately addressed and, at worst, ignored completely.


In closing today, I want to reflect on the words from this week's editorial in TheBorder Mail, my local paper. It supports my call for a national regional higher education strategy:


For several decades now though some of the larger regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, have benefited from a university presence. In the Border’s case, it has had the added plus of go-ahead TAFE colleges – especially in Wodonga.


Charles Sturt University has certainly long championed the enormous value for regional economies that comes from developing and providing courses that turn out graduates with a commitment to rural Australia, as well as having a significant commitment to research.


La Trobe University, which of course also has long had a Border presence, has a similar commitment.


And that is why all must be done to ensure there is no attempt to water-down these universities at a time when their commitment is to expand in order to even better serve regional areas.


In closing, I'm speaking against this legislation. I ask my colleagues opposite to stand up for rural and regional Australia—to actually do what needs to be done and support my amendments when I bring them on, to show their dedicated commitment for what we know to be true: without support, our rural universities, which underpin our whole economic development in our regions, will be at stake. It is too important to let go on a whim—as to which, let me say: the National Party opposite and the Liberal Party vote because they're told to vote. So, in closing, colleagues, can I say: will you please stand up for rural and regional Australia. Will you please do the right thing. Will you please—please—convince the government that we've got to do better by our regions.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:15):  I wish to join with my Labor colleagues on this side of the House in condemning this bill before the House tonight, the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. This bill purports to be about 'higher education support', but that, in fact, is one of the great misnomers.


Large parts of this legislation are simply wrong. If passed, this legislation would see massive cuts to universities and increased fees and debts for students, whilst also shifting the burden back onto students—who would have, as I said, bigger debts to repay much sooner. More critically, this bill will close the door of opportunity to many, many potential students. And it will disproportionately hurt regional universities like the University of Newcastle in my electorate.


Australia already has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD, and our students are already paying the sixth-highest fees. This package will only make that bad record even worse. That's why we see near-universal opposition to this legislation from the higher education sector. The peak body for the universities, Universities Australia, has said:


An overwhelming majority of Vice-Chancellors … could not recommend that the Senate crossbench pass the legislative package.


And the NTEU, the sector's union, has also opposed the bill, because of the impact of the cuts and fee hikes to students. This opposition is because these people in the sector know that this legislation is not reform. Indeed, this legislation fails to make any inroads into the really serious challenges that we face in higher education in Australia.


Instead of carving out a vision for the nation and a pathway to get there, all the government have got on offer are cuts: cuts to funding, cuts to services, cuts to infrastructure and cuts to programs. Make no mistake: if the Prime Minister persists with this plan, our universities will suffer. The quality of university education in Australia will be compromised, and students will be expected to pay more and more and more. At a time when Australia should be investing in our tertiary education sector, this bill enshrines $3.8 billion of cuts, while also increasing the debt for students, and locking tens of thousands of potential students out of higher education altogether.


In New South Wales alone, this would result in $617.8 million of cuts into vital university services. In my electorate of Newcastle, the Turnbull Liberal government's plan for higher education, if it proceeds, means that our local university, the University of Newcastle, will have its funding slashed by a staggering $63.2 million over the next four years alone, and that blows out to more than $100 million over the decade.


There can be no doubt that student learning and outcomes, university programs and university infrastructure will all suffer as a result of these savage cuts. This legislation means that Australian students will end up paying more and getting less.


Whilst cutting university funding, the Prime Minister is hitting students with higher fees and asking them to pay off those larger debts at a much quicker rate. Under this legislation, students will have to start paying back their HECS loans when they start earning just $42,000, a threshold which is only around $6,000 more than the minimum wage, instead of the current $54,869. Graduates caught between these policies will experience considerable financial stress, making opportunities for home ownership and financial security less likely. This locks in financial insecurity for young Australians at a time when they should, in fact, be setting themselves up.


There can be no doubt that this legislation hits universities based in regional and rural settings the hardest. Regional Universities Network summed it up in their submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation when they warned that:


… serious perverse consequences for RUN universities are likely to be associated with such measures. These include: further lowering the participation rate of regional students in higher education; and detrimental economic and social impact in regional Australia.


At a time when regional students are already under-represented in our universities, these outcomes are utterly unacceptable.


While there are many measures in this legislation that are wrongheaded, I particularly want to focus on just one of those measures in the time that I have left in this debate, and that is the damage being done by these proposals to the delivery of enabling education programs in Australia. The Liberal government's ill-thought-out proposal to introduce fees for enabling programs, to cap student numbers and, indeed, to look at outsourcing or privatising enabling education in Australia is a dangerous slippery slope for enabling education.


These programs are university preparation courses. These enabling programs give people who have sometimes not had opportunities to finish high school, who have had their education and life interrupted by all sorts of issues and complications along the way, an important pathway to participate in tertiary education. Indeed, they ensure that regions like the Newcastle and Hunter region have a local skill base that can capitalise on opportunities in the 21st century economy.


These courses are particularly successful in helping students from overwhelmingly disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds to get a university education. As I said, they provide the very skills that you would want every young person in our community to have, but this legislation before us tonight puts all of that under threat. This has particular significance for the University of Newcastle, because the University of Newcastle is the oldest and largest provider of enabling education in this country.


We do enabling education very well; we're very experienced at it. It is no coincidence, for example, that there are more than 1,000 Indigenous students enrolled at the University of Newcastle. It is no coincidence that we train more than half of this nation's Indigenous doctors. And that's because the University of Newcastle, for more than 30 years now, has invested heavily in enabling programs that specifically target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. We have the Yapug program, which has opened up so many opportunities for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women of Australia.


I was really very fortunate to be at a scholarship presentation ceremony at the university recently. I met this amazing woman, Michaela, who was in her second year of medicine at The University of Newcastle. She had completed the enabling program. She was a young woman whose experience of secondary education had given her very little hope or confidence that she could attend university. She was introduced to the enabling program, and is now a scholarship recipient in her second year of university. She introduced me to the other 19 Aboriginal men and women undertaking second-year medicine at the University of Newcastle. All but one of these students came through an enabling program—the very programs this legislation seeks to destroy. 'Destroy' might seem a very loaded word to some people opposite, but I warn them that putting a price barrier in front of kids who already face multiple obstacles getting their foot in the door of higher education is all it takes to stop them from making that step.


I was very fortunate last July to have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for higher education, Tanya Plibersek, visit the University of Newcastle. She spent time with students and the providers of these enabling programs. We met so many terrific students that day. One who particularly comes to mind is a young man who is now doing his master's degree, who was so ill during his high school education that he barely got beyond year 9. Nobody had any hopes for him, yet he managed to find his way to the University of Newcastle. His mother encouraged him to take part in an Open Foundation course—the very course that the government is seeking to price these kids out of, to outsource to the private sector and then cap the number of students allowed to enter. He is now enrolled in a master's program and is flying high. He is now excelling, but he is just one of—you are lucky you are seated, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons—42,000 students that the University of Newcastle have put through enabling programs in order for them to access and complete their higher education.


Any given day you step on the campus at the University of Newcastle, one in five students in the current cohort will be from an enabling program—one in five. My colleague the member for Dobell, who spoke earlier, has campuses of the University of Newcastle at Ourimbah. One in four of the students there come through enabling programs. That is because these are programs that provide access for a lot of kids who are the first in their family to ever go to university; women who have faced multiple obstacles; a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids who otherwise would be locked out; and kids who come from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. These are the very people that you would want to support in every way you could to get a quality higher education, and yet these are the people that this government seeks to block out. It is shameful.


I ask: where are all the members of the National Party right now to speak up for their constituencies? Where is the member for Cowper, who has two campuses—in Port Macquarie and in Coffs Harbour—of the University of Newcastle? Where is the member for Calare, who has a campus and the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health in Orange, run by the University of Newcastle? Where is the member for New England, the Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister? Where is he? He has two campuses: in Tamworth and Armidale. Where is the member for Lyne, who has a campus in Taree? Where is the member for Parkes, who has a campus in Moree? Why are they not here in this chamber, standing up to defend the universities that are going to educate their young men and women to help build and strengthen their regions? I am just astonished that they could not even put their name on a speaking list to justify why it is that they will come in here to vote in support of legislation that does nothing but damage to regional communities across Australia. I want to thank my colleague the member for Dobell, who, in stark contrast, stood up here defending the university and her constituents who attend the University of Newcastle's Ourimbah campus. It's a shame that the member for Robertson is not here doing likewise. She has a lot of her constituents attending the Ourimbah campus. It would be timely for these men and women, the so-called champions of regional Australia, to show their faces right now and actually be here for this debate instead of shunning it. They will be turning up when the bells ring for a division, any time soon, and they'll sit over on those benches supporting these cuts, supporting cuts to these universities that provide important catalysts in each of their regional communities.


There is no way that we can develop a quality 21st century higher education sector if all you have on the table is cuts to funding, cuts to services, cuts to infrastructure and cuts to vital programs like the enabling programs that I've spoken about tonight; programs that prepare young men and women who would otherwise have been locked out of university for the future economy and instead give them every opportunity that they rightly deserve to have quality education in Australia.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",NXT,2017-09-13,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:30):  When considering the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, we should reflect on a statement made by Prime Minister Turnbull when he assumed office as Prime Minister in September 2015. The Prime Minister said:


The Australia of the future has to be a nation that is agile, that is innovative, that is creative. We can't be defensive, we can't future-proof ourselves.


This is a national goal that I share with the Prime Minister. As technology evolves faster than it ever has before, we rely on an educated society to drive the innovation that will keep Australia placed as one of the best countries in the world to work and live in.


Universities are the cornerstone of innovation. Over the last century, Australian universities have been the catalyst for some truly remarkable inventions, creations and research that have dramatically shaped the world we live in. This includes the bionic ear, invented at the University of Melbourne, which has benefited close to 200,000 people worldwide and has led to the employment of over 2,200 people; solar conversion technology developed by the University of New South Wales; CPAP technology to treat sleep apnoea, developed by the University of Sydney, which built the company ResMed, which has over 4,000 employees and annual revenues of $1.6 billion; a cervical cancer vaccine invented by the University of Queensland which saves over 250,000 lives each year; and so many more. Indeed, I don't think we give enough recognition to the university sector for research and innovation that is changing lives and creating jobs and investment in Australia.


I realise that funding has increased considerably since the uncapping of places. The sector has experienced unprecedented growth, and this has created unintended consequences and affected other sectors such as apprenticeships. While there has been unprecedented growth in student numbers, over the last five years universities have experienced significant budget cuts. Let's examine some of those cuts. In 2010, the then Labor government cut $298 million by abolishing the Capital Development Pool. In 2013, the MYEFO cut $113 million in ARC funding. In 2015, changes to start-up scholarships, cuts to the Sustainable Research Excellence initiative, closure of the OLT and closure of the Structural Adjustment Fund saw further cuts of over $2 billion. In total, over $3.4 billion of funding has been removed from the university sector in recent years. It is worth remembering that, while many of the funding cuts have occurred since the Abbott government, the Labor budget in March 2013 made cuts of $2.37 billion in higher education through the introduction of a so-called efficiency dividend.


The Nick Xenophon Team is not convinced that this bill as it currently stands will assist the sector to reform. We agree that reform is needed but cannot accept that this is the reform that is indeed needed. With the greatest of respect, this bill is tinkering around the edges with some small good measures and a blunt and deep cut that will mean job losses to the sector and higher education costs for students.


What we need is a comprehensive review of higher education that involves federal and state governments, universities and the vocational education apprenticeships sector around the table. We need a comprehensive review, akin to the Gonski-led review of education. We must look at how we prepare the next generation for the world of work to ensure young people successfully transition to sustainable employment. Right now we have university educated young people stacking shelves at supermarkets because there are few graduate jobs. These young people are in debt for thousands of dollars and their degrees are essentially redundant if they are not able to find employment in their chosen field of study in the years immediately following graduation. Unfortunately, I see too many of those young people in my electorate. At the same time, apprenticeships and traineeship numbers have significantly declined. According to the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research, in 2012 there were 470,000 apprentices and trainees. By March this year that number had declined to just 275,000 apprentices and trainees, a loss of nearly 200,000 places, yet we're not adequately addressing this crisis.


As recently highlighted by my colleague Senator Nick Xenophon, the government is yet to act on Senate inquiry recommendations that addressed skills shortages that were raised two years ago. The report Directions in Australia’s automotive industry: an industry report 2017 detailed 27,000 jobs waiting to be filled. The automotive industry is just one industry where there are skills shortages; residential construction trades is another area. This will be exacerbated as older tradesmen, highly skilled craftsmen—carpenters, stone masons and electricians—retire. If you think it's difficult to get a plumber now, wait five years!


One of the reasons for the skills shortage is that, in our culture, trades are considered an inferior career and universities the only pathway to success. In the article 'What now for the demand driven system?' Mark Burford, the former education advisor during the Rudd-Gillard government, held concerns that were raised in the 2008 Bradley review of higher education. It stated: 


… moving to a demand-based approach to funding higher education cannot be done in isolation from VET. Changing higher education funding but leaving VET funding untouched would compound existing distortions. 


A decade on, we can see that these concerns were well founded. We have a more educated population but job outcomes for graduates are getting worse. High-school students receive little pathway planning to determine their strengths. Trades are not seen as a valuable career. I believe they should be. By the same token, the university sector has encouraged an increase in enrolments that has led to a drop in entry standards and teaching quality. In 2016, figures released by the Department of Education and Training show that over 1,000 students were admitted to the Bachelor of Teaching with an ATAR score of less than 50. How are these students expected to teach the Australian curriculum to others when they are unable to pass it themselves? I want to make it clear that I'm not advocating for the removal of the demand driven system and a return to capped places, but we urgently need to examine the impacts of the demand driven system and examine admissions standards for students looking to enter university. 


There are a number of measures that have merit in this bill. I'll detail some of those measures. I support enshrining the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program in legislation. This program helps to ensure that Australians from low-SES backgrounds have the opportunity to attend university. I support the $24 million allocated to work-integrated learning opportunities. A graduate leaving university with experience in their chosen field and with contacts in the industry is invaluable for their future job prospects. I support the $15 million investment in regional higher education through the establishment of eight community hubs across Australia, although I do feel that $15 million is woefully inadequate for regional Australia. I support the transparency measures and the principle of performance-contingent funding. However, I believe that what is proposed has the potential to lead to perverse outcomes. In reality, the proposed contingent funding will mean that universities will need to reduce their expenditure by 7.5 per cent each year and hold on to those funds on the likelihood that such funds may be clawed back by government in the following year should they not meet expected performance targets. This measure does not have savings in the budget, but it will pit university against university for the share of the losers' funds. It will, if you like, be a Hunger Gamesstyle policy, where smaller universities and, in particular, regional universities will be at a disadvantage when entering the game. This approach will create winners and losers rather than lifting the performance benchmarks overall.


I'm also concerned about exactly what those measures will be. If it is determined that performance-funding measures will be based on such things as retention rates or collective GPAs, will universities cherrypick students that they know will need the least support? 


Does this mean a single parent or a student with a disability or a first-in-family student will be less likely to receive a place? 


I accept that the new measures need to be paid for but I can't justify new measures worth $158 million coming at a cost of $3.8 billion. I cannot support increasing the student contribution. Australia currently has the fifth-highest tuition fees in the OECD countries, behind the United States, Japan, Korea and Canada. The government is asking Australian students to shoulder even more of the burden. Nearly 80 per cent of students enrolled in a bachelor degree are young people. We are asking them to pay more to get less. It is not lost on young people that many of the decision-makers in this place had the great benefit of a free university education and are now legislating for them to pay more.


Young people have borne the brunt of budget cuts for years. In the 2014 budget, we had a proposal for 'six months on, six months off' youth allowance for young jobseekers—as if young people could magically live on fresh air for six months at a time. In the same budget, National Youth Week was stripped of funding, and the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition, also known as AYAC, was defunded, ensuring young people are denied a national advocate. 


Last year the government sought a five-week waiting period for young people applying for Centrelink assistance. From the 1970s through to 2013, successive governments in this place have recognised that young people deserve representation through a minister for youth. One Australian in five is aged 12 to 25, yet both major parties rejected a motion asking the Prime Minister to appoint a minister for young people, also known as a minister for youth. How can we expect young people to ever reach prosperity, or start a family if they desire, if at every turn we want to charge them more and take more from them.


The lowering of the HELP repayment threshold is an issue that has caused angst amongst young people. The HELP system is one of the most generous higher education loan systems in the world, and the current threshold for repayment is $54,869. That is significantly more than comparable countries. New Zealand has a threshold of $18,000 and the UK has a threshold of $36,000. The HELP system means no Australian student faces the barriers of up-front costs for their university education. This, I believe, above all else is the biggest contributor to encouraging students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter university. It is, in my opinion, one of the best facets of our higher education system and we must do all we can to protect it.


The HELP loan is designed to be repaid gradually once a student has derived a benefit from it and is contributing to society. Under the proposed legislation, the repayment threshold would be lowered to $42,000 at a rate of one per cent. The question must be asked: has a person who is earning $42,000 per year derived a benefit from their university studies? The average income for a working Australian is $61,000, and that is $19,000 more than the proposed threshold. I don't believe students who are earning just $6,000 above the minimum wage are yet deriving a significant benefit from their studies. I do concede the repayment is low at that level, but I do think we need to look at this very carefully. I'm not yet convinced the $42,000 threshold is the right approach. I will be open to discussing that further with the government, as will my Senate colleagues.


The proposed changes for residents, and particularly for New Zealand students, will mean many students will no longer be able to afford to study in Australia. Remember, New Zealand is facing an election at the moment. Should the New Zealand Labour Party win—and it will be on a platform of free university study—we will find that very few students from New Zealand will be interested in migrating to Australia.


In South Australia, we have three excellent universities: the University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide and Flinders University, of which I have very fond memories. Collectively they employ 10,000 people and contribute significantly to South Australia's economy. The measures put forward in this legislation could result in up to 770 job losses across those three universities. South Australia cannot afford to lose those jobs. We cannot afford to implement legislation that will not reform the sector but will be a blunt instrument that results in job losses and higher student debt.


The Nick Xenophon Team believes we need a comprehensive review of the whole post-secondary education space in both metropolitan and regional areas. We need to consider our future workforce and how best to shape the university and vocational and education sectors together to build our nation's capacity. We need sensible university reform that does not punish students. In order to do this we must do our homework first, bringing together government and all the relevant stakeholders to design reform and then to legislate and implement same.

"Keay, Justine, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (17:44):  There are a number of measures in the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 that there's no possible way the Labor Party can support. And there are certainly a number of measures in this bill that the university sector itself does not support.


This bill will cut university funding by $4 billion and hit students with higher fees. I personally know what it's like to be paying back a non-government-supported HELP debt. It is not nice. Particularly when you're older, it's a lot harder to stomach. It will saddle students with bigger debts that they'll have to pay back at the same time as they are trying to buy a house or start a family. If you're a young Australian and you aspire to go to university, aspire to earn a decent wage and aspire to have a house, under this government you cannot actually aspire to have all of those things. This government is making people choose. These were things that many, many years ago we took for granted. This bill compromises the teaching and learning and undermines research at our universities, which is absolutely gut wrenching considering how well our universities do on the global stage. And it slashes investment in universities at a time when the government should be investing in both universities and TAFEs in order to guarantee a strong, productive economy.


This government talks about the economy all the time, yet what this bill is actually doing is going to be extremely detrimental to our economy, because higher education is an investment in our people; it's an investment in our economy. This legislation will seek to make it harder for regional students, those who are from a disadvantaged background and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds to access a higher education. It also goes against the grain of what the other OECD countries are calling for. The legislation is not supported by Australia's Group of Eight universities, and the legislation is obviously of great concern to Universities Australia.


There was one person I heard yesterday in the MPI debate, and that was the member for Hughes, who seems to be the chief cheerleader for this government. He's somewhat in denial. He claimed yesterday that Labor needed to get some maths education and we needed to do our research. He claimed that this government is not making a cut to higher education. Well, I say this to the member for Hughes and everyone else on the other side who says this is not a cut. I don't know; I think most people on this side would agree that at universities they have professors of economics and professors of mathematics. You've got Universities Australia saying, 'Science would be hardest hit by proposed university cuts,' 'Rankings highlight risk of uni funding cuts,' and, 'Government out of step with community opposition to uni cuts: only one in 10 SA voters support,' about the government's cuts. You've got them saying that all the leaders of Australian universities are 'unanimous' in their 'opposition to the proposals to cut university funding and lift student fees'. You've got the Innovative Research Universities saying:


The package cuts university funding and increases the student charge.


A cut's a cut. If the universities are saying it, they're the experts. They're probably more expert in economics than many in this place. It is a cut.


This is exactly what we're facing under this legislation, and it's certainly not something that we can support. Universities Australia—and this is the chief executive, Belinda Robinson—had this to say about the Prime Minister's cuts:


As our economy changes and old industries face new threats, Australia needs to keep—not cut—our investment in universities to create new jobs, new industries and new sources of income for Australia.


Ms Robinson's message is particularly relevant to the regions where local economies are in transition. I would have thought the government would recognise that that's the fact, but, if they're not in touch with regional Australia, then surely they mustn't know.


The Group of Eight universities are calling on the Senate to block the changes. What they're saying is that this legislation puts at risk the capacity building in universities. I quote from the Group of Eight in the submission that they've made to the Senate:


… cuts to university funding will force universities to make difficult choices about the allocation of resources across teaching, student support, and research with serious impacts on access, choice, quality, and, most importantly, equity.


And I don't think those on the other side really understand what equity means, particularly in regional Australia. They also state:


Regional Australia makes an enormous contribution to Australia's progress across multiple sectors and industries. Its success depends in part on university graduates being able to apply their knowledge and capabilities to drive economic progress and create healthy communities.


I would have thought everyone in this place would agree with that statement. But this legislation goes against that. How on earth those sitting opposite who are from regional communities and claim they represent regional communities can support this legislation is beyond me, because this will make it harder for regional students.


The OECD last night released some documentation around where we're at in Australia, and it was quite telling indeed. They were basically saying that Australia's higher education has amongst the lowest levels of public investment within the OECD. Australian public investment in tertiary education institutions is 0.7 per cent of GDP, 40 per cent below the OECD average of 1.1 per cent. In contrast, however, Australia's level of private investment in tertiary education is at 1.1 per cent of GDP, more than twice the OECD average of 0.5 per cent. I think we have to have some recognition—certainly on this side of the House—that the primary benefit of a university student's education is a public benefit. These figures don't really reflect that at all. The government is investing less in higher education as we move forward.


The OECD report also says the high private contribution Australian students make to the cost of their tertiary education is reflected in the high level of tuition fees our students are required to pay. Again, the report shows these to be amongst the highest in the OECD. And this government is expecting students to pay more. Let's say you're from a regional community in the north-west of Tasmania, where we have a regional campus of the University of Tasmania. You know that the job prospects in your region are not going to give you high wages. That's the reality of living in regional Australia. The average wage is a lot less, particularly in Tasmania. You then have to have this massive HELP debt at the end of your university career to get into a job that is paying you less than the national average for that occupation. You have to question why you'd want to do that in the first place. This government is setting up regional students and regional Australia to fail.


So what does this legislation mean for my local university, the Cradle Coast campus of the University of Tasmania? Universities Australia have established that these cuts will see the University of Tasmania worse off by $51.3 million. My electorate, like many regional areas in Australia, has a disproportionate number of people not engaged in higher education. Torrens University Australia's social health atlases state that Braddon's school leaver participation in higher education, at an average of 18.58 per cent, is lower than the Tasmanian average and the national average. Respected economist and University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor's Fellow Saul Eslake has previously said:


Higher levels of educational participation and attainment won't solve all of Tasmania’s economic and social challenges—but they will make them less difficult to solve, not least by sustainably increasing the resources which can be used to solve them.


This legislation is going against what someone like Saul Eslake is saying. Former UTas vice-chancellor Peter Rathjen has been on the public record that cuts to the University of Tasmania could threaten the future of regional campuses. You have to understand the Cradle Coast campus is subsidised by the main campus in Hobart. It operates at a huge loss, and I take my hat off to the University of Tasmania for wanting to maintain the Cradle Coast campus, because it has made a huge difference to the lives of the people in the north-west and on the west coast of Tasmania and their ability to access education.


When I first went to the University of Tasmania in Launceston, it was 100 kilometres from where I lived. I had to move home. Thankfully, my single mother could subsidise my rent, and I had to pay for my schoolbooks. When you're living off two-minute noodles you can just about do that, but I understand what it's like to be an undergraduate, leaving home and living on barely anything, just to get a university education. The Cradle Coast campus allows accessible courses for people in my region. The message is very clear that the Group of Eight and our local universities will have to make very, very hard decisions if this legislation is passed.


The Cradle Coast campus offers a number of degrees and research based postgraduate study which directly relate to the industries in my electorate, particularly in agriculture and advanced manufacturing. What's really hard to stomach is this government's decision to put an up-front cost on enabling courses. Enabling courses don't actually give anyone a qualification at the end, but they help people who may be very hesitant about entering higher education. There are a number of those people in my electorate who will have to come up with $3,200, or at least defer the cost through HELP. The Cradle Coast campus offers a number of enabling courses. University preparation programs are offered to kids who are 16 and 17. It's ludicrous that you would saddle a 16- or 17-year-old with a debt just to decide whether they're going to continue with their education. Other programs are UniStart, Students in Schools, the VET to higher education achievers program and the University Connections Program for year 11 and 12 students. These courses help potential students develop the skills required for independent learning and success: critical thinking—which, I have to say, is a bit lacking on the other side—critical reading and academic writing.


The other area that's of concern to me as someone who has studied a couple of postgraduate degrees is the changes made to placements for postgraduate positions within universities, those that are not Commonwealth supported places and those that are. This government is reducing the number of government supported places. I graduated last year from Monash University in a non-government supported place by studying 10 units, which is the first step to become a registered psychologist, and I ended up with a HELP debt of $28,000 after 10 units. The next stage is to do an advanced or honours equivalent course. Monash were offering that and it is all done online, which is very accessible to students and a great way of studying for postgraduate students, but that second course, which you had to do to just become provisionally registered as a psychologist, was going to cost another $28,000. I know that people in my course, when they were contemplating at that time what to do next, found that a huge barrier to them undertaking further education just to become provisionally qualified as a psychologist. These were older people in their 40s and 50s wanting a career change, and this government is going to stop even more of them from going into advanced education for higher degrees.


It is not only that; in some cases, you have to be offered a position to study in a higher degree. What this government is saying is that it may be introducing a system where you take a voucher to a university. So, if you're offered a place, do you then go and say: 'I've got to apply for a voucher. I'm not sure if I'll get it. It's sort of like a scholarship. Can you hold off on that placement until I can confirm with the government whether it will support me to go on and get a higher degree?' We don't know. This legislation is so scant on details. This is really unsettling for university students right now who are looking at whether they should go and get a higher degree and those, particularly from regional communities, thinking about going into university and wondering what on earth this government is doing, why it is creating all these barriers to higher education and why it is stopping people in regional Australia from improving their lives and being in a position to earn a good income, to pay more tax and to make a contribution to our society. This is a real shame of this government—an absolute shame—and I hope that those in the Senate and on the crossbench do not support this bill.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-09-13,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (17:59):  The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017 is bad public policy. I am very disappointed. I am sure I speak for a great many people in the electorate of Denison and throughout Tasmania when I say this is bad policy and it should not be pursued. It is very disappointing that the government is so determined to try and ram these sort of reforms through the parliament.


Why on earth would we be asking university students to pay more and asking university graduates to start paying back their debt sooner? Why on earth would we be cutting university funding even more when they are already chronically underfunded, even though we live in one of the richest, most clever and most fortunate countries in the world? This country, more than any other country, can afford to properly resource our universities, yet here we are again in this place, debating more cuts to university funding.


This is going to hurt the University of Tasmania greatly, and I associate myself with the comments from the member for Braddon, who has covered some of this ground quite effectively. By one estimate, the University of Tasmania will see its funding cut by over $11 million annually by 2021 if these so-called reforms come to pass. Tasmania is a small state with a relatively small university that is cross-subsidising two campuses outside of Hobart and, in fact, is cross-subsidising the campus at Burnie to a very great extent. This is one university that simply cannot afford to lose $11.2 million annually. It is not just the university that will be worse off; the students will be worse off. In fact, students will be paying something like $11.3 million extra in fees in Tasmania by 2021 if these so-called reforms go through. This will hurt the University of Tasmania. This will hurt students at the University of Tasmania. This will especially hurt the campus at Burnie and the students of that smaller campus. I associate myself in full with the very wise comments from the member for Braddon about the Burnie campus.


It is also a direct attack on disadvantaged people and women throughout Tasmania and throughout this country. When the government is demanding that ex-students on incomes as low as $42,000 a year—barely above the minimum wage—start paying back their debts, that is unacceptable. It will disproportionately hurt disadvantaged people, people on low incomes and people who are, for good reason, in and out of the workforce and have a lower average income. For example, women might be in and out of the workforce as they start a family and raise a family. Also, I would hope, there are men who are in and out of the workforce to care for their young children and to allow their partner to be in the workforce full time.


This is very ill-considered policy. This is policy that is coming on top of all of the other cuts to the tertiary sector over recent years. For example, between 2010 and 2013, the Gillard Labor government cut $2.3 billion from universities. Cuts have been so severe that universities throughout the country are now effectively underfunded by about $1 billion a year. I make the point again that this is one of the richest countries in the world—a country with a federal budget which forecasts expenditure of some $456,000 million this financial year. With all of that money sloshing around, and with all that we know about the value of education and the richness it brings both to our community and to the members of our community, the government would go ahead with a reform that is going to cost the University of Tasmania alone over $11 million a year by 2021 and hurt campuses like the Burnie campus. The reform is going to cost the students at our university over $11 million a year by 2021. This is not good enough.


Don't just take my word for it. If you don't believe me then believe the OECD, because they have just released a report, Education at a glance 2017. They have put Australian public investment in tertiary education institutions now at 0.7 per cent of our GDP, some 40 per cent below the OECD average of 1.1 per cent of GDP. Do you know where that puts us? Thirtieth out of 34 countries when it comes to public funding for our universities. How naive and short-sighted are we when this is all that we know about the value of education? How are we going to compete with the 29 countries ahead of us in the OECD when we're dumbing down our education and we're restricting education to the rich or the kids of the rich or the kids in the big cities? How are we going to compete with the other 29 countries? Well, we won't. It's as simple as that.


One of the problems here is this obsession over many years—and I'll probably trace it back to the Howard government, but it has continued to this day—with commercialisation, privatisation and user pays. We now have a two-class society in this country, and it's going to get a whole lot worse if this bill goes through: the haves and the have-nots, the rich and the disadvantaged, and the people who can afford user pays and the people who can't afford user pays. We have a two-class society, with the rich and the poor. The rich are doing okay. They'll go to the best private schools, they'll go to the best universities and they'll go to the best hospitals. They'll do well and they'll keep doing well. It will snowball, and they'll do better and better and better, and their families will do better and better and better. What about the rest of the community, the people who can't afford user pays, who are going to have to put up with underfunded universities, low-price courses, underfunded hospitals, underfunded high schools and underfunded primary schools? 'Safety nets' is how John Howard referred to the public education system—a safety net.  It is a bizarre comment but a comment which is being echoed by the current conservative government, who have an obsession with privatisation and commercialisation: 'Don't worry about the members of the community; just make them pay more for their course and make them start paying it back sooner.' There is a reliance on foreign students and a reliance on commercial sponsorship of research. It is all about user pays and someone else paying for it other than the government.


I saw in the paper this morning a report that the accumulated student debt in this country has now reached approximately $50 billion, but the tone of the article in the paper was that this is a problem, it's too much money and the government has to claw it back. But you know what? The government's missing the point, because that's $50 billion that the government should have paid for. It shouldn't be $50 billion of student debt that we're now going after, because governments over many years have shifted $50 billion of the government's financial responsibility to students themselves. Much of that outstanding debt is being carried by lower income people, lower income families and disadvantaged people. They're carrying that debt, but the government's still going after them. That's not good enough. That's cost-shifting. So how dare the government tell the media today, seemingly as though it's an explanation for this bill, that all of these people owe all of this money, and that's bad, and they want it back. Well, the government should never have had them rack up the bill in the first place.


In fact, I'll go so far as to say that the last good university policy we had in this country was between 1972 and 1975, when there was fee-free undergraduate study for Australian students. That's where we should be going. That's where we should be trending, not to more and more user pays and complaining because students are racking up debt and not paying it back quickly enough.


We are rich enough to return to the days of the early seventies. We are rich enough to do what Gough Whitlam did and say we do not tolerate but celebrate education. We understand the inherent value of education. We understand that, the more learned our community is, the happier they are, the more prosperous they are, the healthier they are and the better this country can compete with the 29 countries in the OECD who fund their universities better than we do. How on earth do we compete with countries like Singapore, Thailand, China, Korea and Taiwan—countries that celebrate learning and invest so much more money into the community? No wonder they're doing so well. No wonder we're struggling against these countries when it comes to trade and other matters. We are just missing the point here. We are completely and utterly missing the point.


There is a $456,000 million forecast expenditure in Australia in this financial year, but you know what? We've still got to go after uni students. We've still got to cut funding for universities. We've still got to complain that university students owe too much. We are missing the point. I would make that point again. In fact, I'm going to labour this point because I don't think it's ventilated enough in this place. We can actually afford and, I think, should aspire—and maybe a future government will come along with the foresight and the fortitude to return us—to the early seventies, when we saw the value in free or fee-free undergraduate university places. That is exactly what we need to do. That's where we should be heading, and there's no reason why we shouldn't be doing that or at least trending towards it, because we can definitely afford it.


It's all about priorities. Everything in this place comes back to priorities. I know money can't solve all problems, but I tell you what: it can go a long way to solving many problems. With the amount of money that's sloshing around in this place, you've really got to wonder why we have so many problems—why we have underfunded universities to the tune of $1 billion a year, underfunded hospitals with ridiculous waiting lists, underfunded high schools, underfunded primary schools, homeless living on the street and people who can't afford their power bills—in a country as rich as ours. It's because too few people in this place have the vision or priorities in the right order to fix them.


The government thinks it is okay—in fact, the government is boasting—to trend towards two per cent spending on defence. They're going to double the submarine fleet even though we can't find the crews for the existing six, but don't worry about that. Don't worry that we can't find the crews for our six subs. Let's buy 12! How ridiculous all of this chest-beating is. Why don't we get our priorities in order? Yes, we need a Defence Force. Yes, we need to replace the submarines. But let's get our priorities in order.


We are spending an outrageous amount of money on the Joint Strike Fighter when there were always other cheaper alternatives. Why aren't we raising more revenue? Why don't we have a superprofits tax on any sector of the economy that achieves a disproportionate return on its investment? Why don't we get a bit more tax back from the banks that made $30 billion of profit last year? They can afford to pay a bit more. High wage earners like us—parliamentarians—can afford to pay a bit more. There are so many ways that we can save money in the budget sensibly, so many ways that we can raise extra revenue in this country sensibly, so many things we could be doing and talking about in this place, but what are we talking about tonight? We're talking about attacking the tertiary sector, which is already underfunded by $1 billion a year, and we're debating whether or not we should go after it for more.


I bring my little talk back to Tasmania. Tasmania: a small state, a small uni, a lot of disadvantaged people. This government thinks it is okay to cut the University of Tasmania's funding by more than $11 million a year. This government thinks it is okay to charge Tasmanian students at the University of Tasmania more than $11 million extra in fees each year, and, in doing so, to jeopardise some of the most disadvantaged people in the state and in this country, and very important campuses like Burnie.


I don't support this bill. I am pleased the opposition won't support this bill. It's bad public policy. (Time expired)

Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (19:30):  We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, and we will absorb the changes that come with robotics, quantum computing, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. As a result, jobs will change. Some occupations will reduce in number or cease to exist. New and different jobs will be created. It's topical at the moment to produce commentary around the scope of that impact in terms of which sectors will be affected and how many jobs might disappear. When you consider the change we've adapted to in the last 100 years, there's no particular reason to take an apocalyptic view of this further transformation. At the same time, there's no natural law that says everything has to work out in the end. There's no equilibrium that guarantees there will be a new job created for every job made obsolete. On the available evidence it's entirely reasonable to expect that in many areas the need for human labour will decline. Indeed, it's hard not to feel those changes have already begun.


Right now we are experiencing comparatively high unemployment, record underemployment and falling real wages. The wage share of the Australian economy is at an all-time low. Since 2013, when our employment rate put us seventh in the OECD, we have fallen to 16th, and that's another all-time low. The old assumptions about the relationship between investment and jobs or company profit and jobs simply no longer apply. Here in Australia, there's no doubt that booming profits are not leading to more jobs, nor are they being shared through higher wages. And there's no prospect of this changing courtesy of a one-track neoliberal agenda that's decorated with all the old economic policy chestnuts of deregulation, privatisation, big business tax cuts, unfettered labour market flexibility and unending and relentless attacks on Australian unions.


By this government's own PR, the Australian people were promised jobs and growth, yet Australia has experienced a steady deterioration of employment conditions since 2013. As Alan Austin noted last month in his article, 'Remember 'Jobs and Growth'? Neither does our workforce', when you examine the 10 principle measures of employment in a developed economy:


… eight have deteriorated in Australia since the 2013 election. Five have collapsed quite disastrously. Two have barely moved.


Some of the most salient measures include the total number of people who are unemployed, which was 689,000 in 2013, but is now 730,000; and the number of people who are underemployed, which, four years ago was 911,000, but is now 1,129,000, an increase of 24 per cent. Within this overall picture of weak and declining employment conditions there are some particularly bleak details. There has been, for example, a 21 per cent increase in people suffering long-term unemployment. We've seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of jobless young people, and the workforce participation of Indigenous Australians is well off our closing-the-gap target, and that gap is widening.


There is no great mystery as to how we got here. Contrary to the repeated slogan or promise, the Abbott-Turnbull government has followed a program that is utterly unsuited to creating jobs, both in its action and inaction. The government hangs its hat on settling preferential trade agreements, with no acknowledgment that such agreements don't tend to produce jobs in a developed country like Australia. Work done by Tufts University shows the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement would have had a net loss of 39,000 jobs within the first decade. Yet this government continues to remove labour market testing for overseas contractual service providers in all new trade agreements.


This government's sins of omission include a failure to invest in productive infrastructure and a failure to invest in education. The highest year of infrastructure spending by this government sits underneath the lowest year of the former Labor government. This week the government introduced its higher education changes which cut funding to universities, increased fees for students, lowered the student debt repayment thresholds and defunded the enabling courses that are critical if people facing disadvantage are to have the opportunity to attend university. In all these areas the failure of the government to bear down on the deep and wide malaise of unemployment has wider ramifications for Australian households and for our economy. It feeds into lower wages. It feeds into a lack of consumer confidence and spending.


I want to finish by recognising the members on this side who are engaging on the question of jobs and our work future, not least the shadow minister for finance, whose new book is titled Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age. Navigating the fourth industrial revolution in a way that delivers fairness and reduces inequality will need thoughtful, active and creative government.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (10:00):  Today I'd like to speak about an extraordinary birthday party I attended recently, made more extraordinary because it was in honour of a friend of mine who turned 107 years of age. That makes Ted Wale now the third-oldest living person in our country and, I've got to say very proudly, the oldest living member of the Australian Labor Party. Ted has been a constituent of mine ever since I transferred to the seat of Fowler, and he's been living in Cabramatta. He has only recently moved into aged care at the Whiddon Easton Park residential care facility in Glenfield. By the way, I closed my office and took all my staff to this party, because it's very unusual to meet a person of this age who's so articulate.


The extraordinary part about this party is that Ted shared many memorable experiences of growing up in the First World War and living through the Second World War. He talked about his role in working for the government's small arms factory in Lithgow, and he talked about being an instrument fitter for the Commonwealth aircraft facility in the Second World War, but he also talked about things such as growing up as a boy, migrating to this country from England, and his parents building a house. He didn't have electricity or running water. As the son, he would be dispatched to go and get the pails of water for the baths, and I think all the young women who were working for me were aghast at the fact that the family only had one bath a week, and they shared the same bath. He would fill the bath with water, they would boil it, and the girls would go first, followed by the mother, followed by him and then followed by his father. I think that really put in place how things that we take for granted have changed. Within the scope of this one man's lifetime, these things were all happening.


Despite aspects of his past, even now he is still a practising artist. Ted has made a lifetime contribution to the local art societies. In particular, he's a foundation member of the Fairfield City Art Society. He was instructing in art until two years ago, giving art classes. That earnt him the award for Fairfield Citizen of the Year last year. He is just such an inspiration and a joy to be around. I have a multicultural electorate and multicultural people on my staff. For the Chinese speaker on my staff he counted from one to 10 in Mandarin, and he welcomed the Arabic speaker on my staff in Arabic. Here's a man who still possesses all those faculties. He was just a joy to be around. It was a true honour.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:14):  It is probably a good thing the chamber is empty, because this won't be the most scintillating contribution to Hansard in this term—far from it! I was challenged by my friend the member for Oxley to insert the word 'unicorn' into my speech, so I thought I would meet that at the outset, hoping it may liven things up!


In thinking about this bill, we are going to hear at the outset about another mythical creature that tends to stalk the Notice Paper, and that is a 'zombie'. We've heard a lot about zombie bills and zombie budget measures that just do not die and keep coming back in different forms. Now we have before us a bill to kill three zombie acts and seven zombie bodies. It's a bill to kill, which is a nice change from 'kill Bill'—the government's latest campaign when they have nothing positive to say. This bill is again what largely seems to pass for action and reform under this government. 


I say at the outset that Labor will not oppose this bill. We don't support the abolition of all of these bodies, but after they've been gutted by this government, by not appointing members, by removing funding and staff and not providing them with any work to do—left unloved to wither in the corner—they now exist, in effect, in name only. But it is important, I think, to make some remarks and not just let this stuff sail through, because these bodies did play an important role over their life, and so, if you like, this is a bit of a funeral oration, a last rites, for some of these bodies. 


The bill repeals three acts and amends 10 acts to abolish seven bodies. The tradespersons' rights committee, rest in peace. The Oil Stewardship Advisory Council, rest in peace. The Product Stewardship Advisory Group, rest in peace. The advisory group of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, rest in peace. The Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee, rest in peace. The Development Allowance Authority, rest in peace. Perhaps most substantively from our point of view, the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, rest in peace. Some of them are redundant because other bodies have overtaken their roles, such as the tradespersons' rights committee, or the programs they administered have ceased, such as the Development Allowance Authority, and it is entirely appropriate that those bodies should be removed from the statute books. But it is important to note that not all were redundant in function, and so I want to provide a brief eulogy, if you like, for CAMAC, to illustrate the point. 


The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee was born in 1978, and through its life it had three incarnations. It started off as the Corporations and Securities Law Reform Council, and then in 1989 it was reborn as the Corporations and Securities Advisory Council. Around 2002, when the corporations powers were referred by the states to the Commonwealth, it was reborn as CAMAC, as it has been known until this bill passes. It was an expert advisory committee. I know experts and advice are out of fashion under this government, but it provided non-partisan advice, independent advice, to the government of the day. Indeed, oppositions throughout its time, have also drawn on its transparent, independent advice. It focused on corporations and financial markets, which are, of course, still important matters for governments to constantly pay attention to and, I believe, to receive transparent, expert advice on. In its life, it did play an important role. Some of its recommendations, even in more recent times, influenced governments in very important ways. For instance, there are the related party transactions and continuous disclosure rules—no small matters from a corporate governance point of view and in terms of ensuring as best as we possibly can as policymakers the integrity and efficient operation of the markets in this country. There are the reforms to takeover and insolvency laws, the establishment and operation of managed investment schemes, and the introduction of crowdsourced equity funding. Again, these are all important matters, which have been, I think, improved because of the independent advice from CAMAC. 


Despite the importance, you would think, of these kinds of functions, the government decided early on in its term, when it was the Abbott government, before it became the Turnbull government—what is it at the moment? Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-Chester government, depending on how things play out—



Honourable members interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  We'll see—speculation. You heard it here—not first, actually; I think I've heard it in the other place. In 2014 there was a bill to abolish it; it was in an omnibus bill. Labor opposed that bill, as did the business community, academics and all of the experts in the country, saying: 'For goodness sake, government, this is critical. Politicians aren't always the best at knowing the detail and the ins and outs and, of course, the corporate world.' This is so even for people who come into this place, having had significant business experience. The corporate world changes fast and it's important we have expert advice. Sadly, the tin hat, Neanderthal, buffoon elements of the government seem to have won this debate and the government starved it to death. They gutted it, provided it with no funding and no people. It was unloved, left to die in the corner. It was then eaten by the Treasury when Joe Hockey was the Treasurer. He started chewing it, and here we are today. 


There is benefit in independent advice, I believe, because transparency in advice, which does often have to be institutionalised, leads to better public policy in so many important areas. It's sadly a pattern of the Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-Chester government that they ignore experts, even when they ask for advice. An example recently, to illustrate the point that I'm making, was the Finkel report. That was asked for. It provided what I think most people in the community would say is a pretty reasonable path through a very difficult maze also filled with zombies and monsters of the last decade. Trying to get a sensible bit of public policy that will last the distance in place, it proposed the clean energy target, which would lead to new investment and lower power prices. But, in response to that sort of independent advice, the government have escalated the war on evidence, reason, facts and independent, non-partisan advice. So now they're chewing off that report.


I'm not sure whether it's better or worse, though, if you ask for advice and then ignore it completely or do not even seek advice, as we've seen on other important matters just in recent weeks, like the proposal to drug-test welfare recipients. That was the subject of no independent advice and, indeed, every independent expert has spoken out on it. Or there are the citizenship changes, which were the subject of no advice from national security agencies. Indeed, 14,000 submissions received, including many from experts, said, 'That is a dumb idea,' and two said it was a good idea. Departments—and this is an important point that is relevant to the bill—are ultimately under the control of ministers. I've worked in many departments for both sides of politics. Ultimately departments are not independent bodies; they're not always best placed to provide the accurate, transparent advice on important matters like corporate market regulation that governments need. Most recently there was the fake crackdown on skilled migration by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who didn't even seek the advice of his own advisory committee, MACSM. So, when you set this decision against the pattern, colour and record of the government, the death of CAMAC makes a certain kind of morbid sense. But I hope it finds a little peace, and I do, on behalf of our side, thank those people who put in their time and expertise to provide advice for governments of all persuasions over many years.


We're told that these independent transparent arrangements will be replaced by a variety of ad hoc or informal consultation arrangements—agile, innovative, not transparent and not independent. In some cases, of course, that's okay. But this is an important point. Where there is insufficient transparency, as we have here, as to what in each instance is replacing these bodies then it really is hard for the parliament to make an informed judgement. That is why, when these proposals were put forward in 2014 when there was still a little bit of life and a little bit of blood and money flowing through these bodies, the Senate committee said: 'No, you haven't given us enough of a case. It's fine to put forward a case, Government, saying you don't want this pair of socks, but what's going to replace them?' There's still no transparency. It's been buried and eaten up by government departments. Two examples of that in particular were talked about in the Bills Digest—OSAC and PBRAC.


Of course there is a balance between flexibility and possibly lower costs. Yes, at times, if there is institutionalised advice with salaries for chairs and all that kind of stuff, that can have a marginally higher cost. But that does have to be weighed transparently against the quality of advice received by a government. If I were sitting there as a minister with these kinds of bodies, I would think it was good, long-term public policy architecture not to just get rid of them but to actually say: 'It's all right. I might not always want to hear the advice. I don't have to accept it.' Jokes aside, the government doesn't have to accept the independent advice it gets. It could choose to give up on renewable energy and go a different way to the rest of the world and burn coal forever. It could do that. We'll see, no doubt. The party room will be talking about lumps of coal for weeks to come.


But the point is that, at least when you have that kind of frank, fearless and transparent advice that can speak truth to power, the government and ministers of the day, whichever side they're from, are at least, I think, forced by the parliament to consider proper evidence and reason. Evidence and reason I know are sort of out of fashion at the moment, but I remain hopeful they will come back. So I think institutionalising this kind of advice is good public policy practice.


The final thing I would say—I couldn't find anything in the Bills Digest, but I will put it on the record—is that I have little bit of concern about some government legislation, and I want to build on some remarks that I made in probably an even less fascinating contribution to the Hansard in August in relation to the statute law update revision bill—catchy!


In that one we talked about the government's war on hyphens, the war on typos, the war on semicolons and curious spellings—'program' or 'programme'? These are big matters for the parliament to consider! And of course they could have just been dealt with under delegation by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, but, hey, you've got to pretend you've got an agenda by clogging up the Notice Paper with this kind of rubbish. But there was a concern I noted then that that sort of nonsense maybe substantially counted towards the government's deregulation targets. 


You'd remember there was great fanfare in the first couple of years of the Abbott-Joyce-Turnbull-Chesters government about four repeal days—



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  The acronym is UNICORN, indeed! There were four repeal days, when ministers stood up and occupied whole days in the parliament and counted the deregulation benefits to the Australian economy, repealing all sorts of things—wonderful! Now, that was 2014 and 2015, and annual reports were published for those two years. Indeed, I think the 2015 report counted $50,000 of economic value to the nation from fixing some typos in legislation. So that's wonderful methodology! But there is no 2016 annual report. Maybe it'll come, but it seems they've lost focus; the website's gone dead. But I will be interested to see what the contribution this bill, if passed, is counted as making towards the nation's deregulation economic agenda. If you get $50,000 for some typos, this could be a million dollars of economic benefit to the country—a million dollars from killing some zombies!


The final point I'd make is that, whatever numbers the government claim as the deregulation benefits of this kind of stuff, there's still no basis for public confidence in those numbers—back to that point of transparency and confidence; who knew!—because the government did have this inconvenient truth: there was a little election commitment, saying, 'We'll conduct an independent'—independent; who knew!—'evaluation of the benefits of our deregulation agenda.' But the Auditor-General noted in his report looking at the deregulation agenda in 2016 that they hadn't done that and suggested, 'You probably should go and do that.' 


I'm pleased to say that, finally, after we had a public inquiry by a government controlled committee in this parliament and poked the government—'You really should go and do that, it's been four years; you've got some numbers and we don't know what they mean. No-one knows what they mean. They're probably okay, but who knows, really? What have you got to hide? Why don't you just do that'—fairly recently an independent report was commissioned and handed to the assistant minister for deregulation. I tried to google who that was and I still couldn't find out, but apparently there is one, because we were told that in the public accounts committee. It's gone mysteriously quiet since the current Prime Minister took over. But, hopefully, that report will be released and there will be a greater basis for public confidence in the numbers that are bandied around.


I've made some points there; I think I've said enough. Rest in peace, CAMAC. Really, I do think that, in future, when we on either side of politics are putting forward proposals to get rid of independent advisory committees we should be a little bit more transparent about what is proposed to replace them, because in important areas of public policy, particularly corporates and markets, I think that is good practice. So, rest in peace.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Statute Update (Smaller Government) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:27):  The Statute Update (Smaller Government) Bill 2017 will enable the abolition of seven Commonwealth bodies: the Central Trades Committee; the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council; the Product Stewardship Advisory Group; the Advisory Group of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority; the Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee; the Development Allowance Authority; and the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, the sad passing of which my colleague the member for Bruce has just lamented. This bill follows a series of government decisions relating to the abolition of a number of bodies announced in earlier tranches of the so-called smaller government agenda.


Labor is not opposing this bill, but that should not be taken as support. We do not support the abolition of these bodies, but the fact is they have been gutted by the government and exist in name only—as zombies, as my colleague just remarked—with members not appointed and staff and funding removed. Some of the bodies are redundant, with their work now done elsewhere, but others could have continued to play an important role. This government, however, continues to take an axe to services and bodies whose wise counsel might prove inconvenient to its extreme right-wing agenda.


Part of that agenda is an obsession with cutting government services and slashing what it likes to dismiss as red tape—those inconvenient things like regulations about health standards and environmental management. Smaller government is a right-wing idea that has been popular since Reagan and Thatcher. It's attractive to libertarians, economists and CEOs who prefer to see democratically elected governments get out of the way of corporations, which they believe should be as unfettered as possible to make as much money as they can, irrespective of the social consequences.


The notion of smaller government appeals instinctively to voters who choose to believe claims that it leads to more money in their pocket, despite all evidence to the contrary. We already have a small government in Australia. I know, it's mind-blowing. Cutting it more is no recipe for better days ahead. Smaller government is voodoo economics. More than 150,000 people are employed by the Australian Public Service, which, on average, is a little more than 1,000 per electorate. Of course, electorates like mine in regional Tasmania have far fewer, while electorates here in Canberra and the big capitals have far more; but on average it is about 1,000 per seat. Australia has about 24 million people, so on a population basis that is one Australian public sector employee per 160 people. Imagine the scene: there is your one Australian public sector employee behind a desk in a tiny town of 160 people and they all want advice, service and action on every federal issue such as defence, health, education, social security, pensions, AFP, immigration, aged care, parliamentary services and more. That person would get worked to the bone just fielding the calls and emails, let alone doing the work. No wonder public sector employees are regarded as amongst the most efficient and hardest working in the world. 


Disappointingly, 18,000 of those 150,000 are contract workers. So, while those opposite might like to boast of how they're keeping public sector growth under control and how committed they are to smaller government, what they're often doing is simply outsourcing the work. It still needs to get done and be paid for. It just doesn't show up in the books as public sector wages. But, at the end of the day, voters don't save any money and they arguably get a poorer level of service when government services are outsourced and contracted out for profit motive. 


Ian McAuley, a lecturer in public finance at the University of Canberra, questions an often uncritical support for the smaller government ideal. In an extended essay published by the Australian Collaboration, The Australian economy: will our prosperity be short-lived? he writes:


Contrary to some perceptions, Australia has a small public sector, and a low level of government debt. Successive governments have kept taxes and deficits down by keeping expenditures down. As a result Australia has one of the smallest public sectors of all developed countries.


Public spending is essentially divided between goods and services, including physical infrastructure such as roads, ports, schools, hospitals, health care, education services and consumer protection, and transfer payments, such as pensions, family allowances and industry subsidies. McCauley argues that Australians have yielded to pressure for ever-increasing spending on transfer payments, with the share of total federal spending on social security rising from 21 per cent in 1972 to 33 per cent today—and that doesn't count the ever-growing amount of revenue foregone in the form of tax concessions for superannuation, private health insurance, capital gains and much else. 


Combine the growth in transfer outlays and foregone revenue and what is crudely termed middle-class welfare with the pressure to limit overall spending and not increase overall taxation, and what gets crowded out in the middle is investment in public goods and services—health, education, those sorts of things. So for years Australia has been squeezing investment in education, particularly tertiary education. We see this week a higher education bill before the parliament that seeks to make Australians pay more for their studies and cuts billions of dollars out of higher education from what was promised by the Liberals before the last election. At a federal level we have neglected investment in physical infrastructure and environmental protection at the national level. These are important investments if we're to continue to have a prosperous economy in a world where success rests on the best use of human and natural resources. The Australian public has become far too familiar with computer meltdowns, glitches and system errors from government agencies jeopardising quality of life and privacy. These problems are a direct result of ongoing assaults on public sector staffing levels. There are so many examples, but let's run with just a handful. 


The ATO pay deadlock is simply the latest evidence of a broken public sector failing to fulfil its most basic duties to the nation, according to insiders in the ATO. Shrinking the ATO by an incredible 4,000 people has been inefficient and has led to information leaks, delays in processing, loss of morale and loss of key agency culture and corporate memory. These are irreplaceable. After the recent staff cuts of 4,000, 'unexpected delays in recruiting additional staff at reduced classification levels', according to the ATO, led to lower than expected employee expenses in 2015-16, but that didn't result in a saving. That was because the high number of contractors needed to implement critical IT projects and deliver services meant supplier expenses were higher than expected. Of course, then there's the Centrelink robo-debt shambles and, before that, the census debacle.


James Whelan, research director of the Centre for Policy Development's Public Service Research Program, says Australia underinvests in its Public Service compared with other OECD countries and shrinking the bureaucracy affects government services, program delivery, policy advice and financial management. He sees it as counterproductive, stemming from an ideological desire to scale back government, and says bureaucrats make an easy target because of the misconception that they really don't do much—they're just shiny bums sitting around. Whelan says:


We've probably become a little accustomed to Public Service bashing. It's like the public sector has few outspoken allies or advocates. To the extent that that's true, the public sector is vulnerable.


He's right. Public sector bashing is a national sport. It's not one I like to engage in. I think public sector employees do a great job. I'd like to give a shout-out to every public sector employ in this chamber!


Writer and entrepreneur Tim Dunlop argued, in a 2012 opinion piece called 'Small government can equal big problems':


For the longest time we have been told that getting the government out of government is liberating. We have been told that 'free markets' and 'free enterprise' makes us free. Indeed, this is exactly the sort of argument our newly installed 'Freedom Commissioner' takes as gospel, and that has long been argued by his former employer, the group-think tank, the IPA. It is the logic that has been used to justify the imposition of the 'Washington Consensus' in countries all around the world.


The newly installed 'Freedom Commissioner' Dunlop referred to, of course, now occupies a seat on the government benches. Indeed, the member for Goldstein is but one of a handful of IPA alumni infecting those opposite with their noxious neoliberalism and shrill demands to reanimate the rotting corpse of trickle-down economics. My colleague the member for Lilley, named finance minister of the year by Euromoney magazine in 2011, has said in this House—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Well may you laugh, member. Facts speak for themselves. He said:


The politically inspired inequality of the Liberals is poisoning our society, and the power of big money is crowding out our democracy. Exhibit A of that is an unfunded $50 billion corporate tax cut, where the Treasury modelling shows it will not have the power and the influence over jobs and growth that the government claims it will.


We all know that 0.1 per cent growth to GDP in 10 years time will be the magnificent achievement of this $50 billion corporate tax handout. It beggars belief. How much more could be done with that money? I agree with the member for Lilley when he says Australians of the future will rue the day when the ultralow interest rates of this period were not used to invest in critical economic infrastructure across our regions and cities, and all because of an ideological obsession with avoiding debt. Imagine: we could even have invested in more base-load power stations.


The facts are that public investment in infrastructure in Australia has been substantially cut by the coalition, whether it is in the regions, the rural areas or our cities. Not one dollar was provided in the 2017 so-called 'infrastructure budget' for new infrastructure in Tasmania. The facts are these: in the 2015-16 financial year the Turnbull government cut infrastructure investment by nearly $3 billion—a 35 per cent drop from what it had promised in its 2014 budget. That is theft from the future prosperity of Australia. The private sector simply isn't doing that job, as we can see with power generation. Seven plants have closed since this government came to office. The private sector is not champing at the bit to build more. The public sector needs to step up. The public sector needs to invest in critical capital infrastructure, especially across our regions, in order to drive private sector growth. That's the route recommended by the IMF, which states that interest rates are so low that deficit reduction will actually occur faster due to the higher growth that infrastructure drives than it will through spending cuts of equivalent moneys.


One option could be to locate government agencies in regional areas, establishing well-paid, secure employment anchors in towns now suffering from a reliance on low-paid, insecure and seasonal work. Towns with council staff in them do better than those without them, as do towns with schools and medical centres. The benefits of well-paid, secure and permanent work are not only personal to the employees involved but also social. They provide a foundation for community growth and security.


What I'm proposing is a planned regional rollout of satellite offices in areas where placement fits the community and where public sector employees can settle, raise families and work directly with communities and where they join their local footy and bowls clubs, the CWA, ambos and firefighters without having to worry about where the next job's coming from. I'm focusing on the growth that this will bring to communities, with jobs created for services, retail and local government. As towns grow, more people will be needed—firefighters, police, council workers, support staff for people with disabilities, aged-care staff for people who are aging, childcare staff for the working parents and more teachers. Then, satellite university and TAFE sites may develop or grow. Then, doctors and specialists will need to be based in those areas, along with allied health professionals and community nurses. Where towns struggle with population, it is government that can give them a boost. This is a long-term plan, and it runs counter to the neoliberal economic agenda that has run rampant across Australia in recent years—an agenda that has seen our regional communities hollowed out and services shut down and moved to cities, sacrificed on the high altar of economic rationalism and efficiency.


We are a society, not an economy. Where market solutions fail, government must step in. Some say governments should be run like a business. I do not hold to that view. I say that governments should be run like a family. A family still needs to live within its means, but its motivations are very different to that of a business. In a family, we care for our grandmothers and grandfathers, despite the cost; we love our pets, even though they have no productive value; we take care of our homes and gardens, because we feel better when we live in pleasant surrounds; we go into debt to take on a mortgage; and we care for and love one another not because of profit but because we are human beings. I would much rather have a government that treats citizens like family instead of units of production.


Good governments not only invest in education, health, infrastructure and national security but also invest in the arts, libraries, national parks, the ABC and junior sports, none of which might get a look in on business grounds. Those arguing for smaller, leaner and meaner government see these things as burdens rather than assets, and they are forever arguing for them to be cut back to the point where they are already bleeding. The fantasy that has been woven around the supposed need for smaller government has allowed this government to treat people requiring income support as criminals and bludgers. It's allowed a culture to develop that it's somehow a shameful thing to accept government money, unless, of course, you're a billionaire or a corporation with your handout for a massive tax concession or business break. The ideology of smaller government is a myth that damages our society and our economy. It is a flawed, right-wing ideology that strips society of much-needed capital and human investment and that threatens to accelerate the hollowing out of our regional communities.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:14):  It is probably a good thing the chamber is empty, because this won't be the most scintillating contribution to Hansard in this term—far from it! I was challenged by my friend the member for Oxley to insert the word 'unicorn' into my speech, so I thought I would meet that at the outset, hoping it may liven things up!


In thinking about this bill, we are going to hear at the outset about another mythical creature that tends to stalk the Notice Paper, and that is a 'zombie'. We've heard a lot about zombie bills and zombie budget measures that just do not die and keep coming back in different forms. Now we have before us a bill to kill three zombie acts and seven zombie bodies. It's a bill to kill, which is a nice change from 'kill Bill'—the government's latest campaign when they have nothing positive to say. This bill is again what largely seems to pass for action and reform under this government. 


I say at the outset that Labor will not oppose this bill. We don't support the abolition of all of these bodies, but after they've been gutted by this government, by not appointing members, by removing funding and staff and not providing them with any work to do—left unloved to wither in the corner—they now exist, in effect, in name only. But it is important, I think, to make some remarks and not just let this stuff sail through, because these bodies did play an important role over their life, and so, if you like, this is a bit of a funeral oration, a last rites, for some of these bodies. 


The bill repeals three acts and amends 10 acts to abolish seven bodies. The tradespersons' rights committee, rest in peace. The Oil Stewardship Advisory Council, rest in peace. The Product Stewardship Advisory Group, rest in peace. The advisory group of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, rest in peace. The Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee, rest in peace. The Development Allowance Authority, rest in peace. Perhaps most substantively from our point of view, the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, rest in peace. Some of them are redundant because other bodies have overtaken their roles, such as the tradespersons' rights committee, or the programs they administered have ceased, such as the Development Allowance Authority, and it is entirely appropriate that those bodies should be removed from the statute books. But it is important to note that not all were redundant in function, and so I want to provide a brief eulogy, if you like, for CAMAC, to illustrate the point. 


The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee was born in 1978, and through its life it had three incarnations. It started off as the Corporations and Securities Law Reform Council, and then in 1989 it was reborn as the Corporations and Securities Advisory Council. Around 2002, when the corporations powers were referred by the states to the Commonwealth, it was reborn as CAMAC, as it has been known until this bill passes. It was an expert advisory committee. I know experts and advice are out of fashion under this government, but it provided non-partisan advice, independent advice, to the government of the day. Indeed, oppositions throughout its time, have also drawn on its transparent, independent advice. It focused on corporations and financial markets, which are, of course, still important matters for governments to constantly pay attention to and, I believe, to receive transparent, expert advice on. In its life, it did play an important role. Some of its recommendations, even in more recent times, influenced governments in very important ways. For instance, there are the related party transactions and continuous disclosure rules—no small matters from a corporate governance point of view and in terms of ensuring as best as we possibly can as policymakers the integrity and efficient operation of the markets in this country. There are the reforms to takeover and insolvency laws, the establishment and operation of managed investment schemes, and the introduction of crowdsourced equity funding. Again, these are all important matters, which have been, I think, improved because of the independent advice from CAMAC. 


Despite the importance, you would think, of these kinds of functions, the government decided early on in its term, when it was the Abbott government, before it became the Turnbull government—what is it at the moment? Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-Chester government, depending on how things play out—



Honourable members interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  We'll see—speculation. You heard it here—not first, actually; I think I've heard it in the other place. In 2014 there was a bill to abolish it; it was in an omnibus bill. Labor opposed that bill, as did the business community, academics and all of the experts in the country, saying: 'For goodness sake, government, this is critical. Politicians aren't always the best at knowing the detail and the ins and outs and, of course, the corporate world.' This is so even for people who come into this place, having had significant business experience. The corporate world changes fast and it's important we have expert advice. Sadly, the tin hat, Neanderthal, buffoon elements of the government seem to have won this debate and the government starved it to death. They gutted it, provided it with no funding and no people. It was unloved, left to die in the corner. It was then eaten by the Treasury when Joe Hockey was the Treasurer. He started chewing it, and here we are today. 


There is benefit in independent advice, I believe, because transparency in advice, which does often have to be institutionalised, leads to better public policy in so many important areas. It's sadly a pattern of the Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-Chester government that they ignore experts, even when they ask for advice. An example recently, to illustrate the point that I'm making, was the Finkel report. That was asked for. It provided what I think most people in the community would say is a pretty reasonable path through a very difficult maze also filled with zombies and monsters of the last decade. Trying to get a sensible bit of public policy that will last the distance in place, it proposed the clean energy target, which would lead to new investment and lower power prices. But, in response to that sort of independent advice, the government have escalated the war on evidence, reason, facts and independent, non-partisan advice. So now they're chewing off that report.


I'm not sure whether it's better or worse, though, if you ask for advice and then ignore it completely or do not even seek advice, as we've seen on other important matters just in recent weeks, like the proposal to drug-test welfare recipients. That was the subject of no independent advice and, indeed, every independent expert has spoken out on it. Or there are the citizenship changes, which were the subject of no advice from national security agencies. Indeed, 14,000 submissions received, including many from experts, said, 'That is a dumb idea,' and two said it was a good idea. Departments—and this is an important point that is relevant to the bill—are ultimately under the control of ministers. I've worked in many departments for both sides of politics. Ultimately departments are not independent bodies; they're not always best placed to provide the accurate, transparent advice on important matters like corporate market regulation that governments need. Most recently there was the fake crackdown on skilled migration by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, who didn't even seek the advice of his own advisory committee, MACSM. So, when you set this decision against the pattern, colour and record of the government, the death of CAMAC makes a certain kind of morbid sense. But I hope it finds a little peace, and I do, on behalf of our side, thank those people who put in their time and expertise to provide advice for governments of all persuasions over many years.


We're told that these independent transparent arrangements will be replaced by a variety of ad hoc or informal consultation arrangements—agile, innovative, not transparent and not independent. In some cases, of course, that's okay. But this is an important point. Where there is insufficient transparency, as we have here, as to what in each instance is replacing these bodies then it really is hard for the parliament to make an informed judgement. That is why, when these proposals were put forward in 2014 when there was still a little bit of life and a little bit of blood and money flowing through these bodies, the Senate committee said: 'No, you haven't given us enough of a case. It's fine to put forward a case, Government, saying you don't want this pair of socks, but what's going to replace them?' There's still no transparency. It's been buried and eaten up by government departments. Two examples of that in particular were talked about in the Bills Digest—OSAC and PBRAC.


Of course there is a balance between flexibility and possibly lower costs. Yes, at times, if there is institutionalised advice with salaries for chairs and all that kind of stuff, that can have a marginally higher cost. But that does have to be weighed transparently against the quality of advice received by a government. If I were sitting there as a minister with these kinds of bodies, I would think it was good, long-term public policy architecture not to just get rid of them but to actually say: 'It's all right. I might not always want to hear the advice. I don't have to accept it.' Jokes aside, the government doesn't have to accept the independent advice it gets. It could choose to give up on renewable energy and go a different way to the rest of the world and burn coal forever. It could do that. We'll see, no doubt. The party room will be talking about lumps of coal for weeks to come.


But the point is that, at least when you have that kind of frank, fearless and transparent advice that can speak truth to power, the government and ministers of the day, whichever side they're from, are at least, I think, forced by the parliament to consider proper evidence and reason. Evidence and reason I know are sort of out of fashion at the moment, but I remain hopeful they will come back. So I think institutionalising this kind of advice is good public policy practice.


The final thing I would say—I couldn't find anything in the Bills Digest, but I will put it on the record—is that I have little bit of concern about some government legislation, and I want to build on some remarks that I made in probably an even less fascinating contribution to the Hansard in August in relation to the statute law update revision bill—catchy!


In that one we talked about the government's war on hyphens, the war on typos, the war on semicolons and curious spellings—'program' or 'programme'? These are big matters for the parliament to consider! And of course they could have just been dealt with under delegation by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, but, hey, you've got to pretend you've got an agenda by clogging up the Notice Paper with this kind of rubbish. But there was a concern I noted then that that sort of nonsense maybe substantially counted towards the government's deregulation targets. 


You'd remember there was great fanfare in the first couple of years of the Abbott-Joyce-Turnbull-Chesters government about four repeal days—



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  The acronym is UNICORN, indeed! There were four repeal days, when ministers stood up and occupied whole days in the parliament and counted the deregulation benefits to the Australian economy, repealing all sorts of things—wonderful! Now, that was 2014 and 2015, and annual reports were published for those two years. Indeed, I think the 2015 report counted $50,000 of economic value to the nation from fixing some typos in legislation. So that's wonderful methodology! But there is no 2016 annual report. Maybe it'll come, but it seems they've lost focus; the website's gone dead. But I will be interested to see what the contribution this bill, if passed, is counted as making towards the nation's deregulation economic agenda. If you get $50,000 for some typos, this could be a million dollars of economic benefit to the country—a million dollars from killing some zombies!


The final point I'd make is that, whatever numbers the government claim as the deregulation benefits of this kind of stuff, there's still no basis for public confidence in those numbers—back to that point of transparency and confidence; who knew!—because the government did have this inconvenient truth: there was a little election commitment, saying, 'We'll conduct an independent'—independent; who knew!—'evaluation of the benefits of our deregulation agenda.' But the Auditor-General noted in his report looking at the deregulation agenda in 2016 that they hadn't done that and suggested, 'You probably should go and do that.' 


I'm pleased to say that, finally, after we had a public inquiry by a government controlled committee in this parliament and poked the government—'You really should go and do that, it's been four years; you've got some numbers and we don't know what they mean. No-one knows what they mean. They're probably okay, but who knows, really? What have you got to hide? Why don't you just do that'—fairly recently an independent report was commissioned and handed to the assistant minister for deregulation. I tried to google who that was and I still couldn't find out, but apparently there is one, because we were told that in the public accounts committee. It's gone mysteriously quiet since the current Prime Minister took over. But, hopefully, that report will be released and there will be a greater basis for public confidence in the numbers that are bandied around.


I've made some points there; I think I've said enough. Rest in peace, CAMAC. Really, I do think that, in future, when we on either side of politics are putting forward proposals to get rid of independent advisory committees we should be a little bit more transparent about what is proposed to replace them, because in important areas of public policy, particularly corporates and markets, I think that is good practice. So, rest in peace.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:27):  The Statute Update (Smaller Government) Bill 2017 will enable the abolition of seven Commonwealth bodies: the Central Trades Committee; the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council; the Product Stewardship Advisory Group; the Advisory Group of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority; the Plant Breeder's Rights Advisory Committee; the Development Allowance Authority; and the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, the sad passing of which my colleague the member for Bruce has just lamented. This bill follows a series of government decisions relating to the abolition of a number of bodies announced in earlier tranches of the so-called smaller government agenda.


Labor is not opposing this bill, but that should not be taken as support. We do not support the abolition of these bodies, but the fact is they have been gutted by the government and exist in name only—as zombies, as my colleague just remarked—with members not appointed and staff and funding removed. Some of the bodies are redundant, with their work now done elsewhere, but others could have continued to play an important role. This government, however, continues to take an axe to services and bodies whose wise counsel might prove inconvenient to its extreme right-wing agenda.


Part of that agenda is an obsession with cutting government services and slashing what it likes to dismiss as red tape—those inconvenient things like regulations about health standards and environmental management. Smaller government is a right-wing idea that has been popular since Reagan and Thatcher. It's attractive to libertarians, economists and CEOs who prefer to see democratically elected governments get out of the way of corporations, which they believe should be as unfettered as possible to make as much money as they can, irrespective of the social consequences.


The notion of smaller government appeals instinctively to voters who choose to believe claims that it leads to more money in their pocket, despite all evidence to the contrary. We already have a small government in Australia. I know, it's mind-blowing. Cutting it more is no recipe for better days ahead. Smaller government is voodoo economics. More than 150,000 people are employed by the Australian Public Service, which, on average, is a little more than 1,000 per electorate. Of course, electorates like mine in regional Tasmania have far fewer, while electorates here in Canberra and the big capitals have far more; but on average it is about 1,000 per seat. Australia has about 24 million people, so on a population basis that is one Australian public sector employee per 160 people. Imagine the scene: there is your one Australian public sector employee behind a desk in a tiny town of 160 people and they all want advice, service and action on every federal issue such as defence, health, education, social security, pensions, AFP, immigration, aged care, parliamentary services and more. That person would get worked to the bone just fielding the calls and emails, let alone doing the work. No wonder public sector employees are regarded as amongst the most efficient and hardest working in the world. 


Disappointingly, 18,000 of those 150,000 are contract workers. So, while those opposite might like to boast of how they're keeping public sector growth under control and how committed they are to smaller government, what they're often doing is simply outsourcing the work. It still needs to get done and be paid for. It just doesn't show up in the books as public sector wages. But, at the end of the day, voters don't save any money and they arguably get a poorer level of service when government services are outsourced and contracted out for profit motive. 


Ian McAuley, a lecturer in public finance at the University of Canberra, questions an often uncritical support for the smaller government ideal. In an extended essay published by the Australian Collaboration, The Australian economy: will our prosperity be short-lived? he writes:


Contrary to some perceptions, Australia has a small public sector, and a low level of government debt. Successive governments have kept taxes and deficits down by keeping expenditures down. As a result Australia has one of the smallest public sectors of all developed countries.


Public spending is essentially divided between goods and services, including physical infrastructure such as roads, ports, schools, hospitals, health care, education services and consumer protection, and transfer payments, such as pensions, family allowances and industry subsidies. McCauley argues that Australians have yielded to pressure for ever-increasing spending on transfer payments, with the share of total federal spending on social security rising from 21 per cent in 1972 to 33 per cent today—and that doesn't count the ever-growing amount of revenue foregone in the form of tax concessions for superannuation, private health insurance, capital gains and much else. 


Combine the growth in transfer outlays and foregone revenue and what is crudely termed middle-class welfare with the pressure to limit overall spending and not increase overall taxation, and what gets crowded out in the middle is investment in public goods and services—health, education, those sorts of things. So for years Australia has been squeezing investment in education, particularly tertiary education. We see this week a higher education bill before the parliament that seeks to make Australians pay more for their studies and cuts billions of dollars out of higher education from what was promised by the Liberals before the last election. At a federal level we have neglected investment in physical infrastructure and environmental protection at the national level. These are important investments if we're to continue to have a prosperous economy in a world where success rests on the best use of human and natural resources. The Australian public has become far too familiar with computer meltdowns, glitches and system errors from government agencies jeopardising quality of life and privacy. These problems are a direct result of ongoing assaults on public sector staffing levels. There are so many examples, but let's run with just a handful. 


The ATO pay deadlock is simply the latest evidence of a broken public sector failing to fulfil its most basic duties to the nation, according to insiders in the ATO. Shrinking the ATO by an incredible 4,000 people has been inefficient and has led to information leaks, delays in processing, loss of morale and loss of key agency culture and corporate memory. These are irreplaceable. After the recent staff cuts of 4,000, 'unexpected delays in recruiting additional staff at reduced classification levels', according to the ATO, led to lower than expected employee expenses in 2015-16, but that didn't result in a saving. That was because the high number of contractors needed to implement critical IT projects and deliver services meant supplier expenses were higher than expected. Of course, then there's the Centrelink robo-debt shambles and, before that, the census debacle.


James Whelan, research director of the Centre for Policy Development's Public Service Research Program, says Australia underinvests in its Public Service compared with other OECD countries and shrinking the bureaucracy affects government services, program delivery, policy advice and financial management. He sees it as counterproductive, stemming from an ideological desire to scale back government, and says bureaucrats make an easy target because of the misconception that they really don't do much—they're just shiny bums sitting around. Whelan says:


We've probably become a little accustomed to Public Service bashing. It's like the public sector has few outspoken allies or advocates. To the extent that that's true, the public sector is vulnerable.


He's right. Public sector bashing is a national sport. It's not one I like to engage in. I think public sector employees do a great job. I'd like to give a shout-out to every public sector employ in this chamber!


Writer and entrepreneur Tim Dunlop argued, in a 2012 opinion piece called 'Small government can equal big problems':


For the longest time we have been told that getting the government out of government is liberating. We have been told that 'free markets' and 'free enterprise' makes us free. Indeed, this is exactly the sort of argument our newly installed 'Freedom Commissioner' takes as gospel, and that has long been argued by his former employer, the group-think tank, the IPA. It is the logic that has been used to justify the imposition of the 'Washington Consensus' in countries all around the world.


The newly installed 'Freedom Commissioner' Dunlop referred to, of course, now occupies a seat on the government benches. Indeed, the member for Goldstein is but one of a handful of IPA alumni infecting those opposite with their noxious neoliberalism and shrill demands to reanimate the rotting corpse of trickle-down economics. My colleague the member for Lilley, named finance minister of the year by Euromoney magazine in 2011, has said in this House—



A government member interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Well may you laugh, member. Facts speak for themselves. He said:


The politically inspired inequality of the Liberals is poisoning our society, and the power of big money is crowding out our democracy. Exhibit A of that is an unfunded $50 billion corporate tax cut, where the Treasury modelling shows it will not have the power and the influence over jobs and growth that the government claims it will.


We all know that 0.1 per cent growth to GDP in 10 years time will be the magnificent achievement of this $50 billion corporate tax handout. It beggars belief. How much more could be done with that money? I agree with the member for Lilley when he says Australians of the future will rue the day when the ultralow interest rates of this period were not used to invest in critical economic infrastructure across our regions and cities, and all because of an ideological obsession with avoiding debt. Imagine: we could even have invested in more base-load power stations.


The facts are that public investment in infrastructure in Australia has been substantially cut by the coalition, whether it is in the regions, the rural areas or our cities. Not one dollar was provided in the 2017 so-called 'infrastructure budget' for new infrastructure in Tasmania. The facts are these: in the 2015-16 financial year the Turnbull government cut infrastructure investment by nearly $3 billion—a 35 per cent drop from what it had promised in its 2014 budget. That is theft from the future prosperity of Australia. The private sector simply isn't doing that job, as we can see with power generation. Seven plants have closed since this government came to office. The private sector is not champing at the bit to build more. The public sector needs to step up. The public sector needs to invest in critical capital infrastructure, especially across our regions, in order to drive private sector growth. That's the route recommended by the IMF, which states that interest rates are so low that deficit reduction will actually occur faster due to the higher growth that infrastructure drives than it will through spending cuts of equivalent moneys.


One option could be to locate government agencies in regional areas, establishing well-paid, secure employment anchors in towns now suffering from a reliance on low-paid, insecure and seasonal work. Towns with council staff in them do better than those without them, as do towns with schools and medical centres. The benefits of well-paid, secure and permanent work are not only personal to the employees involved but also social. They provide a foundation for community growth and security.


What I'm proposing is a planned regional rollout of satellite offices in areas where placement fits the community and where public sector employees can settle, raise families and work directly with communities and where they join their local footy and bowls clubs, the CWA, ambos and firefighters without having to worry about where the next job's coming from. I'm focusing on the growth that this will bring to communities, with jobs created for services, retail and local government. As towns grow, more people will be needed—firefighters, police, council workers, support staff for people with disabilities, aged-care staff for people who are aging, childcare staff for the working parents and more teachers. Then, satellite university and TAFE sites may develop or grow. Then, doctors and specialists will need to be based in those areas, along with allied health professionals and community nurses. Where towns struggle with population, it is government that can give them a boost. This is a long-term plan, and it runs counter to the neoliberal economic agenda that has run rampant across Australia in recent years—an agenda that has seen our regional communities hollowed out and services shut down and moved to cities, sacrificed on the high altar of economic rationalism and efficiency.


We are a society, not an economy. Where market solutions fail, government must step in. Some say governments should be run like a business. I do not hold to that view. I say that governments should be run like a family. A family still needs to live within its means, but its motivations are very different to that of a business. In a family, we care for our grandmothers and grandfathers, despite the cost; we love our pets, even though they have no productive value; we take care of our homes and gardens, because we feel better when we live in pleasant surrounds; we go into debt to take on a mortgage; and we care for and love one another not because of profit but because we are human beings. I would much rather have a government that treats citizens like family instead of units of production.


Good governments not only invest in education, health, infrastructure and national security but also invest in the arts, libraries, national parks, the ABC and junior sports, none of which might get a look in on business grounds. Those arguing for smaller, leaner and meaner government see these things as burdens rather than assets, and they are forever arguing for them to be cut back to the point where they are already bleeding. The fantasy that has been woven around the supposed need for smaller government has allowed this government to treat people requiring income support as criminals and bludgers. It's allowed a culture to develop that it's somehow a shameful thing to accept government money, unless, of course, you're a billionaire or a corporation with your handout for a massive tax concession or business break. The ideology of smaller government is a myth that damages our society and our economy. It is a flawed, right-wing ideology that strips society of much-needed capital and human investment and that threatens to accelerate the hollowing out of our regional communities.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:00):  I rise to support the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill, which is one of Australia's largest public research organisations. It's primarily focused on nuclear research and technology, although, as this bill talks about, what it now requires and enables has grown beyond that, moving further into the research ecosystem and, hopefully, the commercialisation value chain.


ANSTO, as it's known, has a number of facilities—there's the head office in Lucas Heights, the OPAL research reactor in Sydney and the Australian Synchrotron in Notting Hill, which is actually in my electorate. I live in Notting Hill, a few hundred metres from the Synchrotron, which was a wonderful initiative of the then Brumby Labor government, who leapt out ahead of the pack and stole the march on Queensland where the Howard government was looking, for electoral reasons and against expert advice, to put the Synchrotron. ANSTO also, I discovered in my research for this bill this morning, has a number of other facilities that I haven't heard of or visited, so I'm putting them on my 'nerd out' list. They are the Centre for Accelerator Science, the cyclotron and so on. 


I am a science nerd. I have a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Monash University, although, given my final year, some of the other activities I was up to and the distractions, it's probably a good thing for Australian science that I stopped!



An honourable member:  Did you say 'science nerd'?




Mr HILL:
  I said 'science nerd', and I'm a proud science nerd. I've also got a view, from that training and discipline, that knowledge, evidence and reason should be the primary underpinnings of public policy. It's an old-fashioned view, I know, in this era where there's a war on evidence and a war on facts by those opposite—for example, in relation to climate change. But, in relation to science and nuclear research, globally it's fair to say—that dreadful, tired phrase—that we do punch above our weight. That's no accident. Unfortunately, though, we're not great at commercialisation. If you have a look at the rates of commercialisation, unfortunately we're still down towards the bottom of the OECD for a range of reasons—not only scale but also incentives. I do hope that initiatives like this will help move us along, but we can't take them for granted, and we need to innovate to create new knowledge and to create value from that knowledge.


I read a beautiful speech, actually, on Friday morning by Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel. Those opposite would've heard of him—he gave them the report they asked for but now don't seem to want. They commissioned a report from the smartest scientist in Australia and seem to have sent it off to the dumbest side of their party room to try to resolve the issue. Nevertheless, in musing about science, this speech talked about the future and the role of science fiction. I won't go to the role of science fiction, but I do highly recommend that members read this speech. We were all emailed the speech. It really is a beautiful read. It's a fairly long speech.


There's some beautiful prose that I will draw on, because it gave voice to the optimism that I feel, which is that science, knowledge and research technology can continue to do amazing things for humanity. In his speech to the Cranlana Program last week, Dr Finkel said:


I start in the firm conviction that human beings can and do adjust to complicated and even dangerous technologies, given time.


Look at the motor car. Look at electricity. Look at aviation.


All of them were once seen as technologies far too dangerous to put in human hands, and yet we tamed them.


So we can and do harness our powers for good—like a child, learning to pick up the sweet guinea pig, and pat it nicely, without crushing it to death.


But soon we’re going to be a child with superpowers—a child who could crush civilisation in his fist before he ever gets the chance to grow wise.


But also, a child with superpowers who could do amazing things.


He then went on to paint three traps that we must avoid if we're to harness the incredible possibilities of modern, cutting-edge science—utopianism, dystopianism and atavism. I do recommend that part of the speech, particularly to those opposite—not the two members here, to be fair, but to some of your colleagues. Then, he concludes his speech by saying:


We are more capable and creative than we know.


We hold the pen and we write the future.


We can choose to be heroines and heroes.


Set out in that spirit, and I promise you, our greatest adventure has barely begun.


And our children will marvel, when they come to read our chapter … that we touched with our human minds, a distant tomorrow.


Certainly, out of all our research institutes, the work, the mission and the physical and human capital of ANSTO is central to this positive future. Nuclear science is, indeed, a superpower for humanity. It could crush civilisation, but it also does and can do more amazing things.


I have visited the Synchrotron a number of times. For any member who hasn't, I'd be happy to hook you up with ANSTO in my electorate. I try not to go too often lest I become a stalker! There are always new things being done there and new things to be seen. It's pretty much 24/7. I was delighted to see that the Commonwealth, in the last budget I think, finally came through, after a few years of negotiation, on a 10-year block of recurrent funding. ANSTO and the Synchrotron are now in this perverse reality, for most agencies, where they've got the recurrent funding locked in and now they're out scouting for capital. Usually, it's the other way around for new beamlines. Hopefully with the next budget industry, universities and the Victorian government will get the new beamlines. 


I also visited Lucas Heights last year. I heard about their work and the value created there and their exciting plans. The new nuclear medicine manufacturing capabilities will meet Australia's growing needs and, economically, will be a boost in helping to meet the global hunger for nuclear medicine and isotopes and so on that are in short supply. I was briefed on the plans to develop this innovation precinct—centred there but it also has national benefits, for the Synchrotron and for universities nationally and in New Zealand. This bill provides for an innovation precinct at Lucas Heights but also, importantly, a potential for similar precincts at other sites around Australia that ANSTO controls, now and into the future. The precinct clusters together subject-matter experts, scientific partners, high-tech businesses and industry and graduates, and uses all of ANSTO's capabilities, those human capabilities and knowledge but also the research infrastructure, to create an innovation ecosystem. It's a really clever and well-thought-out proposal.


I commend ANSTO on the work they have done as an agency in building that case with evidence but also on building it within government. Very cleverly, they've had a number of events here at Parliament House and brought members along as well as the local community. Co-location in the precinct is intended to reduce and remove barriers to mobility for STEM professionals between sectors, agencies and universities. It's that kind of research ecosystem which the modern theory says is particularly critical for cross-pollination and collaboration across disciplines, and for that more fluid work and interrelationship between those who create knowledge and those who seek to commercialise it. Labor commends the government for backing this legislation and supports the precinct because, of course, it was first raised by Senator Kim Carr, the Labor shadow minister, when he was the minister in 2011. Labor expressed this in its Australian jobs plan list in December 2012, and it was commendably picked up in the current government's climate statement in, I think, 2015. So, that bipartisan support has certainly gestated along the way. 


The Graduate Institute is an important and critical part of the precinct proposal. It is distinct although critically related. It's a formal training program for researchers, which will see 300 to 400 postgraduate and postdoctorate researchers as part of the institute. The research will be conducted in Sydney at Lucas Heights, at the Graduate Institute there, but also in Melbourne, at the campus in my electorate, at the Synchrotron. It is right next door and across the road from Monash University. They've done a lot of good research in looking at the best such precincts and institutes around the world. It's drawn, particularly, on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, one of the world's leading universities on that model. Students will stay enrolled at their universities but the supervision and access to infrastructure can happen at ANSTO. You will get top research students and postdoctorates from universities all over Australia and New Zealand, working side by side but still supervised, I guess, and issued with degrees and qualifications by their universities. 


ANSTO already works with 40 Australian and New Zealand universities, and several universities have expressed interest in being formally part of ANSTO's Graduate Institute. It's a very clever model. It won't confer the degrees, but the knowledge and education-intensive hub for STEM and nuclear medicine is important for research in its own sake, for development of skills and for help to commercialise in the precinct. Also, this research is global. It provides a hub for connections with others around the world working on similar problems and challenges. 


With that as the context, the bill itself formally broadens ANSTO's mandate. There is a new definition of 'scientific research, innovation and training', which is broader than the current narrow restrictions in relation to nuclear science and technology—which, largely, ANSTO has outgrown. The world is not so linear and segmented now, so it needs a broader definition. The bill replaces the words 'on a commercial basis' with 'whether or not on a commercial basis', which gives ANSTO the necessary flexibility in its functionality without requiring that everything has to be on a purely commercial basis. This makes sense, and allows ANSTO explicitly, in a new subsection, to share its knowledge, expertise, equipment, facilities, research, property and so on to other entities, whether or not those entities have a direct connection or sit solely within the nuclear science and technology silo. 


I think this bill clearly is of national importance. If you haven't been there, do make the time when you are in Sydney to visit ANSTO for a couple of hours. The government relations team are great and they're passionate about sharing their knowledge and showing you around. It is not just the nerdy science bit that is exciting; it's seeing their entrepreneurialism for spotting market opportunities to create economic value and revenue. It will make any little Treasury bureaucrat's eyes light up with joy, seeing them thinking about revenue streams and so on. 


On a parochial note for my electorate, I point out that the proximity of the Australian Synchrotron to Monash University, my alma mater, is of enormous value not just to the City of Monash but to that whole south-east Melbourne precinct. In coming years we will be looking for other places—knowledge hubs and clusters—around the country, and I think that Monash precinct is fast emerging as one of the most exciting innovation precincts. We have the new heart hospital being co-located with the teaching and research hospital and we have the Australian Synchrotron, which does so much work around cancer treatment, protein structure types and creating world-first drugs. There is some fascinating stuff—which sounds a bit scary—about treating actual patients and experimenting with new treatments for people in incredible pain with bone cancer. There is also the physical side of things. They use neutrons from the OPAL to test the integrity of materials—turbines, bridges, pipes and aircraft engines. They test refurbished power station turbines and give a subatomic seal of approval, if you like, that they are fit for purpose. They are helping water resource management in the natural environment stream of their work, and so on. 


So, in a national sense as well as a parochial sense, I think ANSTO's work is exciting. It is important and deserves airtime and a record of our commendation in the House of their new mission to create knowledge and wealth for the country.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (16:12):  I would like to thank the member for Bruce for making the most sensible speech I have heard him make in parliament. With the exception of the giggle-worthy comments at the beginning of his speech trying to critique the government, I thought it was otherwise quite a commonsense approach, and I would like to congratulate him on it. 


At the end of the day, we are talking about a bill here relating to nuclear science. A lot of people in Australia would hear those words and think that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 must be esoteric in some shape or form. Often, people think that nuclear science has very little to do with their daily lives or even their long-term interests. At one fundamental level, that's pretty understandable and perhaps inevitable. Nuclear science is the pursuit of a tiny minority of unbelievably intelligent people, dealing with matters—and with matter itself—that very few of us could even begin to comprehend. To the vast majority of us, nuclear science can seem incomprehensible. Say the word 'nuclear' in Australia and thoughts of nuclear weapons will be immediately invoked in many people's minds. It will immediately trigger debate and, for some, concern. But people rarely think of the more benign and beneficial aspects of nuclear research. However, this bill encourages us to do just that and provides greater flexibility to promote nuclear research and direct collaboration with universities via minor amendments to the legislation of 1987, which established, and continues to govern, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, as a corporate Commonwealth entity. 


The amendments reflected in this bill are necessary not just because of the positive outcomes and direct impacts here in Australia but also in light of Australia's longstanding participation in this science. The obvious example to point to is health. A statistic I read today that I would like to repeat in this House because I found it amazing is that around one-third of all medical procedures now conducted in our hospitals have a nuclear science component. One-third involve radiation or radioactivity as a diagnostic or even therapeutic tool. On average, every one of us at some point in our lives will have a brush with radiopharmaceuticals and nuclear medicine. Applications are extremely broad. Nuclear medicine is relevant in sectors from cardiology to paediatrics to psychiatry. Some cancers are now being detected two years earlier than they otherwise would have been thanks to nuclear medicine. And such early diagnosis obviously saves lives. There are a vast range of procedures, including irradiation of bones and tendons that are intended for transplants or grafting. Irradiation is also used for sterilisation of bandages, cotton tips and other materials used for implants. Bone imaging can be used to diagnose stress fractures and is widely used not only in our hospitals but by vets, especially in the horseracing industry. The list of medical benefits which have real application to our lives is all but endless.


Another area that benefits from nuclear science is in fact food safety. The radiation of foodstuff at safe levels, far too low to induce radioactivity, can and does make both domestically produced and imported foods safer to eat and for longer. An extension in agriculture involves balancing the use of our precious water resources with maximum productivity. Grape growers, for example, optimise their crops when water is delivered to their vines at precisely the right time and in the right quantities. Nuclear moisture probes pushed into the soil provide extremely accurate data to enable irrigation that is just right, generating big boosts in overall productivity, profit and sustainability. Similar technology is being applied to many other irrigated crops, with equally significant environmental and productivity benefits, which is a very significant thing in a country like Australia which is just so dry.


Other agricultural applications of nuclear technology include sterilised male fruit flies released into the wild that do not breed. This technology, helping to control pests by sterilisation, has enormous extended benefits by helping to reduce insecticides in the environment and is now a very common means of controlling insects and pests worldwide, including right now in controlling fruit flies in south-east Australia.


Many other industries and procedures benefit remarkably from nuclear science. Steel rolling mills use superaccurate nuclear science enhanced gauges to get precisely the right dimensions in their products. The same applies in the accurate measurement of everything from the amount of product in soft drink bottles to the precise composition of detergent ingredients and even jet engine fuel.


Closer to home, smoke detectors rely on nuclear science, with tiny amounts of radioactive materials measuring the quality of the air, triggering that lifesaving beep exactly when it's needed. Even watch faces that glow in the dark owe that glow to very, very small amounts of radioactive material. And the now ubiquitous personal computer and many other electronic devices rely on silicon chips that have been irradiated in a way that turns atoms into phosphorus, enhancing the semiconducting capability of the chips. The mantles used in gas lanterns that have lit many a camping trip, microwave ovens, electric lights and car windshields all owe something to nuclear science.


I could go on and on, providing a long list of examples demonstrating how peaceful nuclear science and research is contributing to our daily lives and to our industries in positive ways and is very often unrecognised outside the immediate environment in which they have their impact. It should be a source of pride to Australians that our nuclear scientists and our nuclear facilities, restricted as they are, have been significant players in the field at a global level for so many decades.


The principal use of our first reactor at Lucas Heights from the late 1950s when it was commissioned was for medical purposes. Its purpose was to produce neutrons for the production of nuclear medicines and for other civil scientific uses, which has led to countless lives saved and massive contributions to industry. We produce our own nuclear medicines and have done so for a very long time. The successor to Lucas Heights, the OPAL reactor, opened at the same site in 2007 and for the same purpose. It's a state-of-the-art facility, one of the best and most important of its type in the world. And the science that's being applied there today accounts for 60 years of Australian expertise in the production of nuclear medicines, industry technologies and academic research. OPAL will, it's expected, become a major source of supply of nuclear medicines globally. A former major supplier, a reactor in Canada, closed last year, and a number of others worldwide are ageing, so we have increased our capacity and our output to mitigate a potentially serious global shortfall. This is also, as a residual benefit, good for the Australian economy.


This bill seeks to further leverage our experience and the quality of our contribution in nuclear science. We are globally recognised as a significant player in this space, albeit from the exceedingly narrow base of a single nuclear reactor. The government wants to enhance our contribution because we have, in our science community, in our population, the innovative capacity to do so at a level that can lift our already significant reputation, based on real achievements, up to even higher levels and continue to deliver tangible benefits. We want more to flow from that expertise—more life-saving breakthroughs in medicine and more benefits for agriculture, the environment and industry. This bill gives ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the legislative flexibility it needs to develop that opportunity by establishing an innovation precinct comprised of three elements—a graduate institute, an innovation incubator and a technology park—to better enable ANSTO to boost outcomes by sharing the knowledge, facilities and properties it has with other entities and individuals, and to become an even more effective conduit between research, industry and universities.


The specific proposal facilitated by this bill—to establish an innovation precinct at ANSTO's Lucas Heights campus—aims to crowd in scientific partners, knowledge-intensive businesses, high-tech industry and STEM graduates from around Australia's regions into a premium nuclear facility and also a hub of knowledge. This is by no means an insignificant aim. Once established, the ANSTO innovation precinct will become the world's first nuclear science and technology incubator—innovation that is in lockstep with the government's National Science Statement and the objectives of our National Innovation and Science Agenda. These reforms are key to the coalition's policy and vision. Whether it be for the defence industry or nuclear science, our aims are the same, and they are to drive growth in our capability and our economy, and to create jobs through investment and ongoing innovation. It's no wonder, therefore, that members opposite do support this bill; it's no wonder that, in consultation with industry groups, universities and local governments, they were all excited about this new vision for ANSTO. It's hard not to be. The potential here is unmissable. The only exception to this, of course, are the barking-mad Greens, but that should go without saying.


This is all good news, but there is a further imperative, and that is the need to capture and hold new technology and skills in Australia. As Australia has, to date, sought to deny itself a nuclear energy sector at even a minimum level, we lag behind our peers in the application of the technology in that regard. If we are, however, to continue down this path or, if, indeed, we decide to seriously explore the nuclear option for energy purposes, then a small but highly capable and well-resourced nuclear science based expert group will keep open a better range of options for our country. In this 21st century, the pace of knowledge generation and the application of that knowledge is 'blurringly' fast. If we want to stay in the main game, we have to accelerate, because standing still is never, never an option. It is for that reason that I commend the bill to the House.

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:25):  I thank the member for Fairfax for his comments. I unequivocally support the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 and recommend it to the House. This bill will enable ANSTO to expand its operations, improve its research, increase both its pre- and post-graduate training opportunities in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine, provide high-technology jobs and increase flexibility to adapt to changes and opportunities which are occurring on an almost daily basis in this high-technology field. It will help to promote the innovation precinct in southern Sydney—a concept first conceived and introduced by the Labor Party, under Senator Carr, as the then minister for industry, in 2011—and provide export earnings and high-value jobs in the technology of the present and the future. It will also help, very much, to promote post-graduate education in nuclear science and nuclear medicine in a sustainable and innovative manner to which a larger student group will become available and provide outstanding, I'm sure, research in the future. 


A little bit of history is important. Australia has led the world in many ways in nuclear physics and in nuclear medicine. ANSTO began in 1949 as an industrial committee, which evolved into the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. It has had many outstanding scientists since. The AEC started in 1953 and it was replaced by ANSTO in 1987. The first nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, the HIFAR reactor, was switched on by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, on Australia Day 1958. The present OPAL reactor, the Open Pool Australian Lightwater reactor, was opened in 2007. As well as providing radioisotopes for medical use, OPAL is invaluable in research, industrial applications, material analysis, industry, agriculture and many other situations. It is state-of-the-art technology and is staffed by incredibly talented scientists. 


As well as the facilities at Lucas Heights, ANSTO operates the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, which uses particle accelerators to produce a beam of high-energy electrons that travel at almost the speed of light, which is invaluable in material analysis, molecular biology and physics. Interparticle or molecular physics is used for highly technical research and has applications across a broad range of industries—agriculture, mining and medicine. It is another world-class high-technology facility. 


ANSTO's OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights produces over two million doses of medical isotopes every year. About 80 per cent of nuclear medicine procedures use one particular isotope, molybdenum-99, which degrades to the medical isotope technetium-99. ANSTO produces molybdenum-99 from low-enriched uranium targets in its reactor. Most of the isotopes are used in Australian hospitals and nuclear medicine facilities, but ANSTO also exports to the USA, China, Japan and South Korea, with increasing interest in many other countries. There previously has been a shortage of supply of molybdenum-99. When I was working at the children's hospital and at Campbelltown Hospital at that time—2009 to 2011—we had a shortage of isotopes available for medical use and it was quite a problem. This was thought at that time to be due to older nuclear medicine plants closing down. But there are now looming shortages, because most of the plants that produce these medical isotopes are reaching the end of their productive lives. ANSTO's new facility will help fill some of that gap.


The new facility, including with its nuclear waste plant to capitalise on processing of nuclear waste, will produce almost 30 per cent of the world's requirements for molybdenum-99. We rely on our nuclear medicine physicians to give us much-needed information about an increasing spectrum of illnesses, so the use of nuclear medicine will increase around the world, particularly for our northern neighbours. They will require increasing sophistication of their medical facilities and the requirement for medical isotopes is going to increase. In paediatrics in particular we use nuclear medicine quite a lot, because we find it much better in terms of requirements for invasive procedures. Nuclear medicine can often avoid some of these. An example is investigating a child for a possible bone or joint infection. We use nuclear medicine scans to try to see if the infection is in the bone, where surgery is not recommended, whereas infection in the joint requires immediate surgery and drainage. Nuclear medicine can be very important in discerning the differences. It can also help tell us whether the child has an infection or an inflammation, such as caused by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. We use nuclear medicine techniques to look for collections of purulent material, collections of pus, to drain that aren't immediately obvious. So it is a very important non-invasive investigation.


We use nuclear medicine in medical oncology in children, particularly for some of the rarer childhood cancers, such as neuroblastoma or Wilms tumour, a kidney tumour. We also investigate for subtle changes in kidney function, particularly kidney scarring, which can follow urinary tract infection, and can dictate best methods of treatment for these conditions. So, in paediatrics we use nuclear medicine a lot. Throughout Australia, the isotopes we use come from the Lucas Heights reactor.


In adult medicine, we also use nuclear medicine isotopes increasingly in things like cardiovascular disease. Cardiac scans can give us a lot of information in a non-invasive way about coronary artery function and myocardial heart muscle function. It can tell us whether we need to consider things like coronary artery bypass surgery or valve surgery or whether even more-invasive procedures are required. Nuclear isotopes are also used in the investigation of thyroid disease. Indeed, iodine-131 is sometimes used in treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. This is another isotope obtained from the nuclear facilities at Lucas Heights. It is also very useful in investigating people for metastatic malignancy. This is very important in determining staging of different cancers and in treatment options. So, increasingly, we are using nuclear medicine investigations.


There is a burgeoning field now of using targeted radio isotopes attached to molecules that can be injected and targeted in a more localised way of providing radiotherapy in some forms of cancer. A classical one now is in the treatment of prostate cancer, where a molecule can have a radioactive isotope attached to it that is concentrated in bone and the isotope then attacks the prostate cancer in the bone, which can be very important in particular for relieving the bone pain that occurs in metastatic prostate cancer. Most of us, unfortunately—or fortunately, in many ways—will require nuclear medicine investigations at some stage in our lives. The technology and the types of investigations are rapidly developing almost every day.


According to the OECD, their nuclear energy agency feels that almost all the current major radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors in the world will cease production over the next 10 years. We've spoken about the 2009-11 crisis in availability of nuclear medicine isotopes, and ANSTO's new production will enable us to provide a significant proportion of the world's global demand in the next few years, increasing the availability of high-technology jobs and increasing export earnings for the country. The Labor Party thoroughly recommends that this bill be passed to enable ANSTO to compete on a global basis for these sorts of technologies.


In industry, the need for radioisotopes is also growing. The development of the ANSTO facility as well as its postgraduate and graduate teaching facilities will further help us meet demand in this burgeoning technology, as will the development of the Synroc waste processing plant, which is part of the redevelopment of the nuclear hub and will be completed in 2019. That will provide us with even more jobs. Labor has for some years promoted the concept of higher-technology, value-added jobs in technology hubs, and this is a really great example of that. The government is to be commended for doing what it can to try to help this get developed. We feel that this current bill will help drive improvements to ANSTO's ability in research and the development of high-technology jobs and export earnings, and also with its collaboration with private industry.


We must continue, of course, to provide supports to ANSTO to continue to upgrade its facilities, also including the Synchrotron, in Melbourne, for which the government has just provided some extra funding. But every year we need to continue to update our progress in these areas. I thoroughly commend this bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:37):  I'd like to commend the member for Macarthur for his speech on the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017. To have such an educated medical man give such convincing, thorough and detailed approval of the work ANSTO does is truly refreshing, especially when we hear in parliament some of the nonsense that is peddled by Greens members. I say that as the only member in this parliament who actually has a nuclear reactor in his electorate, and I say that with great pride, because ANSTO truly does world-leading research that plays a valuable, important role in the health of all Australians.


As my good friend the member for Macarthur noted, on average every single Australian can expect to have a nuclear medicine procedure that uses radioisotopes for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes at some stage in their life. On average, we'll all need those vital, lifesaving nuclear medicines that Lucas Heights provides. Yet we have some misguided Greens who sit in this parliament and want to close it down. What a tragedy that we see such misguided people who fail to look at the evidence and fail to look at the science.


But getting back to the specifics of the bill, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 will provide Australia's nuclear science and research agency, known as ANSTO, with the flexibility required to successfully establish an innovation precinct adjacent to Lucas Heights campus in southern Sydney, in my electorate of Hughes, and will potentially establish additional precincts in association with other campuses. This is fantastic news for my electorate. Having that innovation hub, that innovation precinct, next to ANSTO will enable hundreds if not thousands of high-paying research jobs in the southern part of Sydney, in the electorate of Hughes. I am very, very excited about the future for nuclear medicine and the work ANSTO will do in the future.


We know that one-third of all procedures in modern hospitals involve radiation or radioactivity. The science tells us that these procedures are safe, effective and don't require anaesthetic, and they are useful for a broad spectrum of medical specialities—from paediatrics, which I note the member for Macarthur was very much involved and has great expertise in—to cardiology and psychiatry. This is something that we as a nation should be proud of. In fact, I note that one of Canada's large nuclear facilities is closing down. This will enable Lucas Heights to increase its isotope production from about 550,000 a year to around 10 million. A quarter of the world's demand will come out of the ANSTO reactor at Lucas Heights in my electorate, something that I am immensely proud of. Everyone who is involved in ANSTO should also be immensely proud.


The issue we have had over the years is that we simply haven't had the nuclear research technology that we should have, despite the great work that ANSTO has done. Australia, with our deposits of uranium, should have been one of the global leaders in nuclear technology across the board. But the sad thing was that, when we constructed the new OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights, the country that had the technology to build it for us was Argentina. In fact, we didn't have the technology or the scientists here in Australia. We had to go to Argentina in South America to get the technology that we needed. That was because of the misguided scare campaigns we had against the nuclear industry in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that prevented the development of a nuclear industry in Australia.


A very interesting article in today's Australiantalked about the future for nuclear power. This was written by a gentleman called Michael Shellenberger. He is a former renewables advocate and adviser to Barack Obama and was awarded TIME magazine's Hero of the Environment in 2008. He said:


Like most people, I started out pretty anti-nuclear … I changed my mind as I realised you can't power a modern economy on solar and wind.


He said:


Wind and solar are only useful for leveraging the fossil fuel mix … They have to have back-up, they are doubling the cost of electricity and they have big environmental impacts …


He said:


All existing renewable technologies do is make the electricity system chaotic and provide greenwash for fossil fuels.


He went on and said that opposition to nuclear was 'like a superstitious religious belief'. He said:


In what other issue does the science say one thing so clearly but such a vocal group—


referring to the Greens—


refuses to accept the evidence …


That is where we are. He concluded:


Nuclear is the only technology that can lift everyone out of poverty and reverse human impact.


Yet we, for some unknown or illogical reasons, have simply banned the development of nuclear power in this country.


If we are going to be serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, we simply cannot, as Mr Shellenberger notes, run a modern economy on solar and wind. This is the mistaken ideology that we have had behind the renewable energy target. I think we are now starting to see the results of that policy. I think by the time the history of this century is written, and someone sits down to look at all the policy decisions that have been made throughout this entire century, they will say one of the greatest policy mistakes this nation ever made was Kevin Rudd's Renewable Energy Target. It has caused absolute chaos in our electricity market. It has been the main thing responsible for lifting the price of electricity in this nation, taking what was once our nation's greatest competitive advantage—that of low-cost energy—and turning it into a competitive disadvantage. That is what it has done.




Ms Butler:
  Get back to the point. Get back to the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I am getting back to the bill. This bill talks about Lucas Heights and the work they are doing in nuclear science. In the future this innovation hub will lead us to a greater understanding of nuclear technology. But the reason that we are actually behind in many aspects at the moment, and why we had to go to Argentina to get the OPAL reactor built at Lucas Heights, is our misunderstanding of nuclear power.


We have seen, as I said, the mess that the Renewable Energy Target has caused. If you want a practical example of the failure, just go and look at what has happened in South Australia. Here is a place that now has the proud title of having the highest electricity prices anywhere in the world. It takes a special level of incompetence to go down the track of imposing policies upon your state that give them the highest electricity prices in the world, yet that is what the Labor government has done in South Australia. You would think that, if you had the highest electricity prices in the world, the electricity would at least be reliable, but they've managed to give themselves not only the highest electricity prices in the world but the most unreliable electricity in this nation. We saw blackouts last Christmas. The Australian Energy Market Operator estimates that there is a 30 per cent chance that there will be further blackouts this summer in South Australia.


We've seen the publicity stunt they pulled, the idea that the world's biggest battery can somehow solve it. Look at the numbers for that completely and utterly farcical publicity stunt. It will produce 129 megawatt hours of electricity—129! How much electricity, in megawatt hours, does South Australia need on a hot day? They need close to 50,000. This idea that you can somehow have batteries to back things up is an absolute farce. Just look at the numbers: it will produce 129 megawatt hours out of a daily need of 50,000. For that, it's north of $100 million, and we don't even know what the cost is. Then they have to back that up with 200 megawatts of diesel generators, again at a cost to the taxpayer of over $100 million, that will burn through 80,000 litres of diesel fuel in an hour. If you want to generate electricity in the dirtiest way possible, you probably can't do worse than diesel generators that rip through 80,000 litres per hour, but that is what South Australia are doing.


You would think, holding that up, that everyone would see what an absolute debacle that is, that no-one in their right mind would copy South Australia and that we would thank them for the grand experiment they inflicted upon their people, because we have learnt what not to do. That is what common sense and logic say should happen, but instead we see Labor in Victoria saying: 'We want to copy South Australia. We'll go down the South Australian track, like lemmings off a cliff, and we'll copy South Australia's policies.' When Labor came to power in Victoria, they said it was their policy to get Hazelwood to close down, tripled the coal royalties and chased them out as quickly as they could. What has the Australian Energy Market Operator said of that mess, now they've chased Hazelwood out of town? What's going to be the result? The Australian Energy Market Operator has estimated that, this summer, the state of Victoria faces a 40 per cent chance of blackouts. Not only have they accelerated electricity prices and made them unaffordable to many but they've also given the state a 40 per cent chance of blackouts. You would think common sense, logic, everything that we've been taught, is to look at the examples. We look at the example of South Australia and we say, 'What an economic disaster; that's not what you do.' We look at Victoria—another lemming over the cliff. You see that you cannot go down the path of a 50 per cent renewable energy target. But in this federal parliament the alternative government, the opposition, want to do exactly that. They want to copy Victoria. They want to copy South Australia. They want to bring in a 50 per cent renewable energy target for this nation. 


That is a recipe for the complete economic destruction and de-industrialisation of our society. But the Labor Party stand up in parliament and complain—we hear them complain—about how sad they are about the cost of electricity. Yet they have a completely illogical and incoherent policy that they're copying because they want to appeal to those Green, inner-city basketweavers for votes. They are selling out regional areas, selling out the working people of Australia, selling out the mums and dads and the pensioners in their pursuit of Green votes. That's what this parliament has descended into, where we see that policy from the Labor Party.


If we are going forward, we should have a look at what the options are. What is the nuclear option for our electricity generation fleet? Great research in this area is currently being undertaken. Small nuclear modular reactors of 20 and 50 megawatts are being developed. They're still several years down the track, but we should have that option in this country. We should keep all options on the table. We should take advantage of new technology as it comes along, not artificially force-feed higher-cost electricity options to the market because it will win Green votes in the inner city. 


I am very proud of the work that ANSTO does. This bill will enable them to continue with their great work. It will bring many more jobs, highly paid jobs, to my electorate, and I commend this bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:52):  This is a very important debate because the facilities that are managed by ANSTO are massively important research assets for our nation. It is hard to overstate the significance of these particular facilities. At the Sydney campus, there's the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, and, at the Melbourne campus in Clayton, the Australian Synchrotron, which are, as I said, vitally important research facilities. 


I'm very pleased that I was able to visit the Synchrotron, at Clayton, in recent months to see some of the work that is being done there. Not everyone knows what a synchrotron is, of course. It's a massive facility, about the size of a football field—a great, big, round facility. What it does is speed up electrons so they're going almost at the speed of light and then it deflects them through magnetic fields, creating superbright light. Shooting off from the big, round Synchrotron are things called beamlines, which are big pipes, and that light travels down these big pipes.


'What on earth could that be useful for?' you might ask yourself if you're not a nuclear technology and nuclear science buff. Happily, for all of us, including me, the ANSTO website has a bit of information about the applications of the Synchrotron, and I was able to see some of them in person when I visited. Some of those applications are to biosciences, including macromolecular/protein crystallography and cell biology. When you can see through incredibly strong microscopes the work that's being done, the science that's being done, at this facility, it's quite incredible. Of course, medical research is a major use of the Synchrotron, in microbiology, disease mechanisms, high-resolution imaging and cancer radiation therapy. It has applications to the environmental sciences; agriculture; minerals exploration; advanced materials, like nanostructured materials; engineering, such as imaging of industrial processes in real time; and forensics, such as the identification of suspects from extremely small and dilute samples.


You can tell from what I've said that there's an incredibly diverse and varied group of applications for the Australian Synchrotron, so it was particularly delightful to be able to get the opportunity to meet with ANSTO and have a look at the facilities. These are facilities that a range of Australian universities seek to use for their own research work. I think ANSTO is a national treasure, and that is why I was so keen to speak in relation to this motion today. On the other campus, the Sydney campus, ANSTO has been expanding its activities, including a nuclear medicine plant, and this has tripled the production of molybdenum-99, of which there is a worldwide shortage. It is wonderful to see the nuclear medicine work that ANSTO is doing. 


The aim of this bill is really to develop the Sydney campus into a major national innovation precinct. I was pleased to be able to attend an event here at the parliament that ANSTO conducted a little while ago to talk about their vision for this becoming a major national innovation precinct. It's important not just to think about the benefits that we get from the research that would be done by ANSTO but also to think about the benefits that would be obtained through collaboration at an innovation precinct. If you've been to Silicon Valley, for example, you would have seen that a lot of the work that gets done and the achievements that are made are because people who have the creativity and the right skills are in the same place at the same time. Collaboration does matter, and it's more likely to occur when you bring people together in a precinct. It is also important to remember the broader economic benefits of having good, world-class research facilities, not just because of the ability to commercialise the research that gets done in relation to these facilities but also because it provides opportunities for the local community to have flow-on or second-order benefits from the existence of a research facility or in this case an innovation precinct. It's part of the economic revitalisation of the area in which this innovation precinct is being proposed. When you look at experience in cities around the world, you see that where there's a university, a big research facility or an innovation precinct they stimulate other activities as well. People get excited and it really helps to bring the area to life. So it's a very exciting proposal for ANSTO but, more importantly, it's a very exciting proposal for the part of Australia in which the innovation precinct is intended to be built, down in Sydney. 


So I support the proposal to develop the campus into a major national innovation precinct. Unfortunately, at the moment, as it stands the legislation governing ANSTO unduly restricts the scope and potential of that precinct. This bill would overcome this by allowing ANSTO to share its knowledge, expertise, facilities and property with other entities. These entities would not need to have a direct involvement in nuclear science or technology. That's an important point, because one of the benefits of innovation precincts is that they bring together so many different disciplines, skills and businesses that might not have anything to do with each other, but the communication and camaraderie that develops provides a spark of innovation. Who knows which ideas might come? Who knows which ideas might be developed? You could have an anthropologist working with a nuclear scientist, and the different perspectives they bring to each other can spark new and creative ideas. That's a very important thing. 


This bill broadens the definitions of scientific research, innovation and training in the ANSTO Act so they are not restricted in that way to nuclear science and technology. The precinct will include a graduate institute providing research training for up to 400 postgraduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the Sydney and Melbourne campuses. Again, very importantly, there are direct opportunities for research for postgraduate studies and postdoctoral research. It's very important that we broaden the opportunities that people can have from using ANSTO's facilities and assets. These facilities can make such a massive contribution to research in Australia. 


Together, all of these changes in this bill will make it easier for ANSTO to cooperate with industry, as well as universities and other publicly funded agencies. That collaboration with industry is very important. We do need closer connections between industry and research in Australia. It's something that a lot of universities and other institutions have a strong history of doing. This isn't a comment intended to suggest in any way that only commercialised research or industry-connected research is valuable—I certainly don't suggest that for one minute. Most people in this place would have the view that blue-sky research—research that may not have any immediate foreseeable commercial application or industrial application—is still very important, because blue-sky research can lead to all sorts of world-changing ideas and studies. The recognition of the importance of blue-sky research does not, in my view, undermine the practical work that needs to be done in relation to building connections with industry. From my experience of talking to people working in science and in research, I think it is also quite satisfying to have connections with industry. One of the frustrations that can arise in purely academic work is that you see what needs to be done, but you're not necessarily translating it into getting it done; whereas when you do have industry connections there is a strong imperative for translational work to be done. That, I suspect, is quite satisfying for people—to see ideas and research in real-life application and making a difference to people's lives.


I'm quite excited about this bill. It's great to see the work that's being done to promote the links with industry and to promote the collaboration between research institutions and between Australian universities. As I said, visiting the Synchrotron was really an opportunity to see how different universities were using a piece of plant, or a facility—a very big and technologically advanced facility, but a piece of plant nonetheless—to come up with new applications to solve old problems and to look at things in different ways using incredibly bright light. I think this idea of inviting even more people in to collaborate more, to get more engaged and to work together is a very solid and sound one, and one that deserves support from across this parliament. I should say that this is the kind of exchange between sectors that Labor promoted in government, and we support this bill for those reasons. In fact, we also took to the last federal election a range of innovation policies in which we acknowledged and recognised the importance of bringing people together. I think that that remains such an important focus for innovation and research policy in this nation.


I am pleased to be able to support the bill and am very grateful for the opportunity to have spoken in support of it. I do wish the people at ANSTO well in actually executing the work to be done under this bill in creating an innovation precinct. They can rest assured they've got a good supporter in me—I've got my little ANSTO badge on for them! I do think it is important to promote the work that is done in the nuclear sciences, including nuclear medicine but not limited to nuclear medicine, here in Australia. We do have a lot to be proud of. We're a smart nation. We're a nation that can look forward to good, strong, quality research.


This has been a week of argument about our university system, and I don't necessarily want to repeat some of the concerns that I have about the impact of public funding cuts to universities and what that might do to overall university quality. You will have read the matters in the paper recently about possibilities for other cuts in the event the government's preferred package doesn't go ahead and some of the suggestions that were made there. I hope this is an opportunity for us to say, 'Actually, what we want to see is world-class research in Australia,' because we do have an advantage in it. We do have high quality, we do have the smarts, we do have great facilities, and we do have a tradition of supporting research and innovation here in this country. If we work together, we can see facilities like the wonderful ones that ANSTO has continue to become even greater assets to the Australian community.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Minister for Small Business) (17:04):  I thank all members who have contributed to this debate, including the member for Griffith who's just spoken and the member for Hughes who spoke so passionately just before her. We've heard a lot about research and innovation in this debate and, to that end, I want to compliment most earnestly the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, and his assistant minister, the member for Reid, for what they're doing in this space. 


The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 makes minor but important amendments to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's governing legislation, the ANSTO Act. The amendments will allow our national nuclear science agency the flexibility to successfully establish an innovation precinct adjacent to its Lucas Heights campus in southern Sydney. They will also allow ANSTO to, potentially, establish additional precincts in association with other campuses. More broadly, the bill will facilitate enhanced collaboration between industry, universities, researchers and ANSTO across all its sites. Importantly, the amendments will only empower ANSTO to make available its expertise and equipment or lease its land and facilities to parties that have a science, innovation, high-tech manufacturing or technology development focus and related amenities, and not for unrelated general retail, office or residential purposes. The proposed ANSTO innovation precinct will co-locate and crowd in scientific partners, knowledge-intensive businesses, high-tech industry, science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, and medicine graduates around Australia's centre of nuclear capability and expertise. 


Close synergies and collaborations between our publicly funded research agencies, such as ANSTO, Australian universities and Australian business and industry are a national priority, and the minister and his assistant minister have certainly made that key to everything they talk about and everything they bring to the parliament. These are key to driving Australian innovation, and geography does matter for some innovation. Precincts can facilitate the sorts of collaborative relationships Australia needs if it is to innovate and grow. We all know that. As a parliament we want to remove any impediment that may restrict or discourage these relationships. This bill does just that. 


ANSTO already contributes so much to the Australian community. On average, one in two Australians will benefit from the life-saving nuclear medicine produced by ANSTO. ANSTO's landmark and national research infrastructure, including the OPAL research reactor, the Australian Synchrotron and the Australian centre for accelerated science, are a crucial part of Australia's scientific, social and economic base. They enable scientists to tackle some of Australia's most pressing challenges, in areas as diverse as human health, the environment and solving complex problems for industry. Critically, they maintain a home-grown highly skilled workforce and help sustain Australia's competitiveness and global relevance. The adoption of this bill will allow ANSTO to deepen its impact and reach for the benefit of Australian innovation, education, business and industry. I commend this bill to the House. 


Question agreed to.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:00):  I rise to support the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill, which is one of Australia's largest public research organisations. It's primarily focused on nuclear research and technology, although, as this bill talks about, what it now requires and enables has grown beyond that, moving further into the research ecosystem and, hopefully, the commercialisation value chain.


ANSTO, as it's known, has a number of facilities—there's the head office in Lucas Heights, the OPAL research reactor in Sydney and the Australian Synchrotron in Notting Hill, which is actually in my electorate. I live in Notting Hill, a few hundred metres from the Synchrotron, which was a wonderful initiative of the then Brumby Labor government, who leapt out ahead of the pack and stole the march on Queensland where the Howard government was looking, for electoral reasons and against expert advice, to put the Synchrotron. ANSTO also, I discovered in my research for this bill this morning, has a number of other facilities that I haven't heard of or visited, so I'm putting them on my 'nerd out' list. They are the Centre for Accelerator Science, the cyclotron and so on. 


I am a science nerd. I have a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Monash University, although, given my final year, some of the other activities I was up to and the distractions, it's probably a good thing for Australian science that I stopped!



An honourable member:  Did you say 'science nerd'?




Mr HILL:
  I said 'science nerd', and I'm a proud science nerd. I've also got a view, from that training and discipline, that knowledge, evidence and reason should be the primary underpinnings of public policy. It's an old-fashioned view, I know, in this era where there's a war on evidence and a war on facts by those opposite—for example, in relation to climate change. But, in relation to science and nuclear research, globally it's fair to say—that dreadful, tired phrase—that we do punch above our weight. That's no accident. Unfortunately, though, we're not great at commercialisation. If you have a look at the rates of commercialisation, unfortunately we're still down towards the bottom of the OECD for a range of reasons—not only scale but also incentives. I do hope that initiatives like this will help move us along, but we can't take them for granted, and we need to innovate to create new knowledge and to create value from that knowledge.


I read a beautiful speech, actually, on Friday morning by Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel. Those opposite would've heard of him—he gave them the report they asked for but now don't seem to want. They commissioned a report from the smartest scientist in Australia and seem to have sent it off to the dumbest side of their party room to try to resolve the issue. Nevertheless, in musing about science, this speech talked about the future and the role of science fiction. I won't go to the role of science fiction, but I do highly recommend that members read this speech. We were all emailed the speech. It really is a beautiful read. It's a fairly long speech.


There's some beautiful prose that I will draw on, because it gave voice to the optimism that I feel, which is that science, knowledge and research technology can continue to do amazing things for humanity. In his speech to the Cranlana Program last week, Dr Finkel said:


I start in the firm conviction that human beings can and do adjust to complicated and even dangerous technologies, given time.


Look at the motor car. Look at electricity. Look at aviation.


All of them were once seen as technologies far too dangerous to put in human hands, and yet we tamed them.


So we can and do harness our powers for good—like a child, learning to pick up the sweet guinea pig, and pat it nicely, without crushing it to death.


But soon we’re going to be a child with superpowers—a child who could crush civilisation in his fist before he ever gets the chance to grow wise.


But also, a child with superpowers who could do amazing things.


He then went on to paint three traps that we must avoid if we're to harness the incredible possibilities of modern, cutting-edge science—utopianism, dystopianism and atavism. I do recommend that part of the speech, particularly to those opposite—not the two members here, to be fair, but to some of your colleagues. Then, he concludes his speech by saying:


We are more capable and creative than we know.


We hold the pen and we write the future.


We can choose to be heroines and heroes.


Set out in that spirit, and I promise you, our greatest adventure has barely begun.


And our children will marvel, when they come to read our chapter … that we touched with our human minds, a distant tomorrow.


Certainly, out of all our research institutes, the work, the mission and the physical and human capital of ANSTO is central to this positive future. Nuclear science is, indeed, a superpower for humanity. It could crush civilisation, but it also does and can do more amazing things.


I have visited the Synchrotron a number of times. For any member who hasn't, I'd be happy to hook you up with ANSTO in my electorate. I try not to go too often lest I become a stalker! There are always new things being done there and new things to be seen. It's pretty much 24/7. I was delighted to see that the Commonwealth, in the last budget I think, finally came through, after a few years of negotiation, on a 10-year block of recurrent funding. ANSTO and the Synchrotron are now in this perverse reality, for most agencies, where they've got the recurrent funding locked in and now they're out scouting for capital. Usually, it's the other way around for new beamlines. Hopefully with the next budget industry, universities and the Victorian government will get the new beamlines. 


I also visited Lucas Heights last year. I heard about their work and the value created there and their exciting plans. The new nuclear medicine manufacturing capabilities will meet Australia's growing needs and, economically, will be a boost in helping to meet the global hunger for nuclear medicine and isotopes and so on that are in short supply. I was briefed on the plans to develop this innovation precinct—centred there but it also has national benefits, for the Synchrotron and for universities nationally and in New Zealand. This bill provides for an innovation precinct at Lucas Heights but also, importantly, a potential for similar precincts at other sites around Australia that ANSTO controls, now and into the future. The precinct clusters together subject-matter experts, scientific partners, high-tech businesses and industry and graduates, and uses all of ANSTO's capabilities, those human capabilities and knowledge but also the research infrastructure, to create an innovation ecosystem. It's a really clever and well-thought-out proposal.


I commend ANSTO on the work they have done as an agency in building that case with evidence but also on building it within government. Very cleverly, they've had a number of events here at Parliament House and brought members along as well as the local community. Co-location in the precinct is intended to reduce and remove barriers to mobility for STEM professionals between sectors, agencies and universities. It's that kind of research ecosystem which the modern theory says is particularly critical for cross-pollination and collaboration across disciplines, and for that more fluid work and interrelationship between those who create knowledge and those who seek to commercialise it. Labor commends the government for backing this legislation and supports the precinct because, of course, it was first raised by Senator Kim Carr, the Labor shadow minister, when he was the minister in 2011. Labor expressed this in its Australian jobs plan list in December 2012, and it was commendably picked up in the current government's climate statement in, I think, 2015. So, that bipartisan support has certainly gestated along the way. 


The Graduate Institute is an important and critical part of the precinct proposal. It is distinct although critically related. It's a formal training program for researchers, which will see 300 to 400 postgraduate and postdoctorate researchers as part of the institute. The research will be conducted in Sydney at Lucas Heights, at the Graduate Institute there, but also in Melbourne, at the campus in my electorate, at the Synchrotron. It is right next door and across the road from Monash University. They've done a lot of good research in looking at the best such precincts and institutes around the world. It's drawn, particularly, on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, one of the world's leading universities on that model. Students will stay enrolled at their universities but the supervision and access to infrastructure can happen at ANSTO. You will get top research students and postdoctorates from universities all over Australia and New Zealand, working side by side but still supervised, I guess, and issued with degrees and qualifications by their universities. 


ANSTO already works with 40 Australian and New Zealand universities, and several universities have expressed interest in being formally part of ANSTO's Graduate Institute. It's a very clever model. It won't confer the degrees, but the knowledge and education-intensive hub for STEM and nuclear medicine is important for research in its own sake, for development of skills and for help to commercialise in the precinct. Also, this research is global. It provides a hub for connections with others around the world working on similar problems and challenges. 


With that as the context, the bill itself formally broadens ANSTO's mandate. There is a new definition of 'scientific research, innovation and training', which is broader than the current narrow restrictions in relation to nuclear science and technology—which, largely, ANSTO has outgrown. The world is not so linear and segmented now, so it needs a broader definition. The bill replaces the words 'on a commercial basis' with 'whether or not on a commercial basis', which gives ANSTO the necessary flexibility in its functionality without requiring that everything has to be on a purely commercial basis. This makes sense, and allows ANSTO explicitly, in a new subsection, to share its knowledge, expertise, equipment, facilities, research, property and so on to other entities, whether or not those entities have a direct connection or sit solely within the nuclear science and technology silo. 


I think this bill clearly is of national importance. If you haven't been there, do make the time when you are in Sydney to visit ANSTO for a couple of hours. The government relations team are great and they're passionate about sharing their knowledge and showing you around. It is not just the nerdy science bit that is exciting; it's seeing their entrepreneurialism for spotting market opportunities to create economic value and revenue. It will make any little Treasury bureaucrat's eyes light up with joy, seeing them thinking about revenue streams and so on. 


On a parochial note for my electorate, I point out that the proximity of the Australian Synchrotron to Monash University, my alma mater, is of enormous value not just to the City of Monash but to that whole south-east Melbourne precinct. In coming years we will be looking for other places—knowledge hubs and clusters—around the country, and I think that Monash precinct is fast emerging as one of the most exciting innovation precincts. We have the new heart hospital being co-located with the teaching and research hospital and we have the Australian Synchrotron, which does so much work around cancer treatment, protein structure types and creating world-first drugs. There is some fascinating stuff—which sounds a bit scary—about treating actual patients and experimenting with new treatments for people in incredible pain with bone cancer. There is also the physical side of things. They use neutrons from the OPAL to test the integrity of materials—turbines, bridges, pipes and aircraft engines. They test refurbished power station turbines and give a subatomic seal of approval, if you like, that they are fit for purpose. They are helping water resource management in the natural environment stream of their work, and so on. 


So, in a national sense as well as a parochial sense, I think ANSTO's work is exciting. It is important and deserves airtime and a record of our commendation in the House of their new mission to create knowledge and wealth for the country.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (16:12):  I would like to thank the member for Bruce for making the most sensible speech I have heard him make in parliament. With the exception of the giggle-worthy comments at the beginning of his speech trying to critique the government, I thought it was otherwise quite a commonsense approach, and I would like to congratulate him on it. 


At the end of the day, we are talking about a bill here relating to nuclear science. A lot of people in Australia would hear those words and think that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 must be esoteric in some shape or form. Often, people think that nuclear science has very little to do with their daily lives or even their long-term interests. At one fundamental level, that's pretty understandable and perhaps inevitable. Nuclear science is the pursuit of a tiny minority of unbelievably intelligent people, dealing with matters—and with matter itself—that very few of us could even begin to comprehend. To the vast majority of us, nuclear science can seem incomprehensible. Say the word 'nuclear' in Australia and thoughts of nuclear weapons will be immediately invoked in many people's minds. It will immediately trigger debate and, for some, concern. But people rarely think of the more benign and beneficial aspects of nuclear research. However, this bill encourages us to do just that and provides greater flexibility to promote nuclear research and direct collaboration with universities via minor amendments to the legislation of 1987, which established, and continues to govern, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO, as a corporate Commonwealth entity. 


The amendments reflected in this bill are necessary not just because of the positive outcomes and direct impacts here in Australia but also in light of Australia's longstanding participation in this science. The obvious example to point to is health. A statistic I read today that I would like to repeat in this House because I found it amazing is that around one-third of all medical procedures now conducted in our hospitals have a nuclear science component. One-third involve radiation or radioactivity as a diagnostic or even therapeutic tool. On average, every one of us at some point in our lives will have a brush with radiopharmaceuticals and nuclear medicine. Applications are extremely broad. Nuclear medicine is relevant in sectors from cardiology to paediatrics to psychiatry. Some cancers are now being detected two years earlier than they otherwise would have been thanks to nuclear medicine. And such early diagnosis obviously saves lives. There are a vast range of procedures, including irradiation of bones and tendons that are intended for transplants or grafting. Irradiation is also used for sterilisation of bandages, cotton tips and other materials used for implants. Bone imaging can be used to diagnose stress fractures and is widely used not only in our hospitals but by vets, especially in the horseracing industry. The list of medical benefits which have real application to our lives is all but endless.


Another area that benefits from nuclear science is in fact food safety. The radiation of foodstuff at safe levels, far too low to induce radioactivity, can and does make both domestically produced and imported foods safer to eat and for longer. An extension in agriculture involves balancing the use of our precious water resources with maximum productivity. Grape growers, for example, optimise their crops when water is delivered to their vines at precisely the right time and in the right quantities. Nuclear moisture probes pushed into the soil provide extremely accurate data to enable irrigation that is just right, generating big boosts in overall productivity, profit and sustainability. Similar technology is being applied to many other irrigated crops, with equally significant environmental and productivity benefits, which is a very significant thing in a country like Australia which is just so dry.


Other agricultural applications of nuclear technology include sterilised male fruit flies released into the wild that do not breed. This technology, helping to control pests by sterilisation, has enormous extended benefits by helping to reduce insecticides in the environment and is now a very common means of controlling insects and pests worldwide, including right now in controlling fruit flies in south-east Australia.


Many other industries and procedures benefit remarkably from nuclear science. Steel rolling mills use superaccurate nuclear science enhanced gauges to get precisely the right dimensions in their products. The same applies in the accurate measurement of everything from the amount of product in soft drink bottles to the precise composition of detergent ingredients and even jet engine fuel.


Closer to home, smoke detectors rely on nuclear science, with tiny amounts of radioactive materials measuring the quality of the air, triggering that lifesaving beep exactly when it's needed. Even watch faces that glow in the dark owe that glow to very, very small amounts of radioactive material. And the now ubiquitous personal computer and many other electronic devices rely on silicon chips that have been irradiated in a way that turns atoms into phosphorus, enhancing the semiconducting capability of the chips. The mantles used in gas lanterns that have lit many a camping trip, microwave ovens, electric lights and car windshields all owe something to nuclear science.


I could go on and on, providing a long list of examples demonstrating how peaceful nuclear science and research is contributing to our daily lives and to our industries in positive ways and is very often unrecognised outside the immediate environment in which they have their impact. It should be a source of pride to Australians that our nuclear scientists and our nuclear facilities, restricted as they are, have been significant players in the field at a global level for so many decades.


The principal use of our first reactor at Lucas Heights from the late 1950s when it was commissioned was for medical purposes. Its purpose was to produce neutrons for the production of nuclear medicines and for other civil scientific uses, which has led to countless lives saved and massive contributions to industry. We produce our own nuclear medicines and have done so for a very long time. The successor to Lucas Heights, the OPAL reactor, opened at the same site in 2007 and for the same purpose. It's a state-of-the-art facility, one of the best and most important of its type in the world. And the science that's being applied there today accounts for 60 years of Australian expertise in the production of nuclear medicines, industry technologies and academic research. OPAL will, it's expected, become a major source of supply of nuclear medicines globally. A former major supplier, a reactor in Canada, closed last year, and a number of others worldwide are ageing, so we have increased our capacity and our output to mitigate a potentially serious global shortfall. This is also, as a residual benefit, good for the Australian economy.


This bill seeks to further leverage our experience and the quality of our contribution in nuclear science. We are globally recognised as a significant player in this space, albeit from the exceedingly narrow base of a single nuclear reactor. The government wants to enhance our contribution because we have, in our science community, in our population, the innovative capacity to do so at a level that can lift our already significant reputation, based on real achievements, up to even higher levels and continue to deliver tangible benefits. We want more to flow from that expertise—more life-saving breakthroughs in medicine and more benefits for agriculture, the environment and industry. This bill gives ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the legislative flexibility it needs to develop that opportunity by establishing an innovation precinct comprised of three elements—a graduate institute, an innovation incubator and a technology park—to better enable ANSTO to boost outcomes by sharing the knowledge, facilities and properties it has with other entities and individuals, and to become an even more effective conduit between research, industry and universities.


The specific proposal facilitated by this bill—to establish an innovation precinct at ANSTO's Lucas Heights campus—aims to crowd in scientific partners, knowledge-intensive businesses, high-tech industry and STEM graduates from around Australia's regions into a premium nuclear facility and also a hub of knowledge. This is by no means an insignificant aim. Once established, the ANSTO innovation precinct will become the world's first nuclear science and technology incubator—innovation that is in lockstep with the government's National Science Statement and the objectives of our National Innovation and Science Agenda. These reforms are key to the coalition's policy and vision. Whether it be for the defence industry or nuclear science, our aims are the same, and they are to drive growth in our capability and our economy, and to create jobs through investment and ongoing innovation. It's no wonder, therefore, that members opposite do support this bill; it's no wonder that, in consultation with industry groups, universities and local governments, they were all excited about this new vision for ANSTO. It's hard not to be. The potential here is unmissable. The only exception to this, of course, are the barking-mad Greens, but that should go without saying.


This is all good news, but there is a further imperative, and that is the need to capture and hold new technology and skills in Australia. As Australia has, to date, sought to deny itself a nuclear energy sector at even a minimum level, we lag behind our peers in the application of the technology in that regard. If we are, however, to continue down this path or, if, indeed, we decide to seriously explore the nuclear option for energy purposes, then a small but highly capable and well-resourced nuclear science based expert group will keep open a better range of options for our country. In this 21st century, the pace of knowledge generation and the application of that knowledge is 'blurringly' fast. If we want to stay in the main game, we have to accelerate, because standing still is never, never an option. It is for that reason that I commend the bill to the House.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:25):  I thank the member for Fairfax for his comments. I unequivocally support the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 and recommend it to the House. This bill will enable ANSTO to expand its operations, improve its research, increase both its pre- and post-graduate training opportunities in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine, provide high-technology jobs and increase flexibility to adapt to changes and opportunities which are occurring on an almost daily basis in this high-technology field. It will help to promote the innovation precinct in southern Sydney—a concept first conceived and introduced by the Labor Party, under Senator Carr, as the then minister for industry, in 2011—and provide export earnings and high-value jobs in the technology of the present and the future. It will also help, very much, to promote post-graduate education in nuclear science and nuclear medicine in a sustainable and innovative manner to which a larger student group will become available and provide outstanding, I'm sure, research in the future. 


A little bit of history is important. Australia has led the world in many ways in nuclear physics and in nuclear medicine. ANSTO began in 1949 as an industrial committee, which evolved into the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. It has had many outstanding scientists since. The AEC started in 1953 and it was replaced by ANSTO in 1987. The first nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, the HIFAR reactor, was switched on by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, on Australia Day 1958. The present OPAL reactor, the Open Pool Australian Lightwater reactor, was opened in 2007. As well as providing radioisotopes for medical use, OPAL is invaluable in research, industrial applications, material analysis, industry, agriculture and many other situations. It is state-of-the-art technology and is staffed by incredibly talented scientists. 


As well as the facilities at Lucas Heights, ANSTO operates the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, which uses particle accelerators to produce a beam of high-energy electrons that travel at almost the speed of light, which is invaluable in material analysis, molecular biology and physics. Interparticle or molecular physics is used for highly technical research and has applications across a broad range of industries—agriculture, mining and medicine. It is another world-class high-technology facility. 


ANSTO's OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights produces over two million doses of medical isotopes every year. About 80 per cent of nuclear medicine procedures use one particular isotope, molybdenum-99, which degrades to the medical isotope technetium-99. ANSTO produces molybdenum-99 from low-enriched uranium targets in its reactor. Most of the isotopes are used in Australian hospitals and nuclear medicine facilities, but ANSTO also exports to the USA, China, Japan and South Korea, with increasing interest in many other countries. There previously has been a shortage of supply of molybdenum-99. When I was working at the children's hospital and at Campbelltown Hospital at that time—2009 to 2011—we had a shortage of isotopes available for medical use and it was quite a problem. This was thought at that time to be due to older nuclear medicine plants closing down. But there are now looming shortages, because most of the plants that produce these medical isotopes are reaching the end of their productive lives. ANSTO's new facility will help fill some of that gap.


The new facility, including with its nuclear waste plant to capitalise on processing of nuclear waste, will produce almost 30 per cent of the world's requirements for molybdenum-99. We rely on our nuclear medicine physicians to give us much-needed information about an increasing spectrum of illnesses, so the use of nuclear medicine will increase around the world, particularly for our northern neighbours. They will require increasing sophistication of their medical facilities and the requirement for medical isotopes is going to increase. In paediatrics in particular we use nuclear medicine quite a lot, because we find it much better in terms of requirements for invasive procedures. Nuclear medicine can often avoid some of these. An example is investigating a child for a possible bone or joint infection. We use nuclear medicine scans to try to see if the infection is in the bone, where surgery is not recommended, whereas infection in the joint requires immediate surgery and drainage. Nuclear medicine can be very important in discerning the differences. It can also help tell us whether the child has an infection or an inflammation, such as caused by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. We use nuclear medicine techniques to look for collections of purulent material, collections of pus, to drain that aren't immediately obvious. So it is a very important non-invasive investigation.


We use nuclear medicine in medical oncology in children, particularly for some of the rarer childhood cancers, such as neuroblastoma or Wilms tumour, a kidney tumour. We also investigate for subtle changes in kidney function, particularly kidney scarring, which can follow urinary tract infection, and can dictate best methods of treatment for these conditions. So, in paediatrics we use nuclear medicine a lot. Throughout Australia, the isotopes we use come from the Lucas Heights reactor.


In adult medicine, we also use nuclear medicine isotopes increasingly in things like cardiovascular disease. Cardiac scans can give us a lot of information in a non-invasive way about coronary artery function and myocardial heart muscle function. It can tell us whether we need to consider things like coronary artery bypass surgery or valve surgery or whether even more-invasive procedures are required. Nuclear isotopes are also used in the investigation of thyroid disease. Indeed, iodine-131 is sometimes used in treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. This is another isotope obtained from the nuclear facilities at Lucas Heights. It is also very useful in investigating people for metastatic malignancy. This is very important in determining staging of different cancers and in treatment options. So, increasingly, we are using nuclear medicine investigations.


There is a burgeoning field now of using targeted radio isotopes attached to molecules that can be injected and targeted in a more localised way of providing radiotherapy in some forms of cancer. A classical one now is in the treatment of prostate cancer, where a molecule can have a radioactive isotope attached to it that is concentrated in bone and the isotope then attacks the prostate cancer in the bone, which can be very important in particular for relieving the bone pain that occurs in metastatic prostate cancer. Most of us, unfortunately—or fortunately, in many ways—will require nuclear medicine investigations at some stage in our lives. The technology and the types of investigations are rapidly developing almost every day.


According to the OECD, their nuclear energy agency feels that almost all the current major radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors in the world will cease production over the next 10 years. We've spoken about the 2009-11 crisis in availability of nuclear medicine isotopes, and ANSTO's new production will enable us to provide a significant proportion of the world's global demand in the next few years, increasing the availability of high-technology jobs and increasing export earnings for the country. The Labor Party thoroughly recommends that this bill be passed to enable ANSTO to compete on a global basis for these sorts of technologies.


In industry, the need for radioisotopes is also growing. The development of the ANSTO facility as well as its postgraduate and graduate teaching facilities will further help us meet demand in this burgeoning technology, as will the development of the Synroc waste processing plant, which is part of the redevelopment of the nuclear hub and will be completed in 2019. That will provide us with even more jobs. Labor has for some years promoted the concept of higher-technology, value-added jobs in technology hubs, and this is a really great example of that. The government is to be commended for doing what it can to try to help this get developed. We feel that this current bill will help drive improvements to ANSTO's ability in research and the development of high-technology jobs and export earnings, and also with its collaboration with private industry.


We must continue, of course, to provide supports to ANSTO to continue to upgrade its facilities, also including the Synchrotron, in Melbourne, for which the government has just provided some extra funding. But every year we need to continue to update our progress in these areas. I thoroughly commend this bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2017-09-13,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:37):  I'd like to commend the member for Macarthur for his speech on the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017. To have such an educated medical man give such convincing, thorough and detailed approval of the work ANSTO does is truly refreshing, especially when we hear in parliament some of the nonsense that is peddled by Greens members. I say that as the only member in this parliament who actually has a nuclear reactor in his electorate, and I say that with great pride, because ANSTO truly does world-leading research that plays a valuable, important role in the health of all Australians.


As my good friend the member for Macarthur noted, on average every single Australian can expect to have a nuclear medicine procedure that uses radioisotopes for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes at some stage in their life. On average, we'll all need those vital, lifesaving nuclear medicines that Lucas Heights provides. Yet we have some misguided Greens who sit in this parliament and want to close it down. What a tragedy that we see such misguided people who fail to look at the evidence and fail to look at the science.


But getting back to the specifics of the bill, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 will provide Australia's nuclear science and research agency, known as ANSTO, with the flexibility required to successfully establish an innovation precinct adjacent to Lucas Heights campus in southern Sydney, in my electorate of Hughes, and will potentially establish additional precincts in association with other campuses. This is fantastic news for my electorate. Having that innovation hub, that innovation precinct, next to ANSTO will enable hundreds if not thousands of high-paying research jobs in the southern part of Sydney, in the electorate of Hughes. I am very, very excited about the future for nuclear medicine and the work ANSTO will do in the future.


We know that one-third of all procedures in modern hospitals involve radiation or radioactivity. The science tells us that these procedures are safe, effective and don't require anaesthetic, and they are useful for a broad spectrum of medical specialities—from paediatrics, which I note the member for Macarthur was very much involved and has great expertise in—to cardiology and psychiatry. This is something that we as a nation should be proud of. In fact, I note that one of Canada's large nuclear facilities is closing down. This will enable Lucas Heights to increase its isotope production from about 550,000 a year to around 10 million. A quarter of the world's demand will come out of the ANSTO reactor at Lucas Heights in my electorate, something that I am immensely proud of. Everyone who is involved in ANSTO should also be immensely proud.


The issue we have had over the years is that we simply haven't had the nuclear research technology that we should have, despite the great work that ANSTO has done. Australia, with our deposits of uranium, should have been one of the global leaders in nuclear technology across the board. But the sad thing was that, when we constructed the new OPAL reactor at Lucas Heights, the country that had the technology to build it for us was Argentina. In fact, we didn't have the technology or the scientists here in Australia. We had to go to Argentina in South America to get the technology that we needed. That was because of the misguided scare campaigns we had against the nuclear industry in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that prevented the development of a nuclear industry in Australia.


A very interesting article in today's Australiantalked about the future for nuclear power. This was written by a gentleman called Michael Shellenberger. He is a former renewables advocate and adviser to Barack Obama and was awarded TIME magazine's Hero of the Environment in 2008. He said:


Like most people, I started out pretty anti-nuclear … I changed my mind as I realised you can't power a modern economy on solar and wind.


He said:


Wind and solar are only useful for leveraging the fossil fuel mix … They have to have back-up, they are doubling the cost of electricity and they have big environmental impacts …


He said:


All existing renewable technologies do is make the electricity system chaotic and provide greenwash for fossil fuels.


He went on and said that opposition to nuclear was 'like a superstitious religious belief'. He said:


In what other issue does the science say one thing so clearly but such a vocal group—


referring to the Greens—


refuses to accept the evidence …


That is where we are. He concluded:


Nuclear is the only technology that can lift everyone out of poverty and reverse human impact.


Yet we, for some unknown or illogical reasons, have simply banned the development of nuclear power in this country.


If we are going to be serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, we simply cannot, as Mr Shellenberger notes, run a modern economy on solar and wind. This is the mistaken ideology that we have had behind the renewable energy target. I think we are now starting to see the results of that policy. I think by the time the history of this century is written, and someone sits down to look at all the policy decisions that have been made throughout this entire century, they will say one of the greatest policy mistakes this nation ever made was Kevin Rudd's Renewable Energy Target. It has caused absolute chaos in our electricity market. It has been the main thing responsible for lifting the price of electricity in this nation, taking what was once our nation's greatest competitive advantage—that of low-cost energy—and turning it into a competitive disadvantage. That is what it has done.




Ms Butler:
  Get back to the point. Get back to the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I am getting back to the bill. This bill talks about Lucas Heights and the work they are doing in nuclear science. In the future this innovation hub will lead us to a greater understanding of nuclear technology. But the reason that we are actually behind in many aspects at the moment, and why we had to go to Argentina to get the OPAL reactor built at Lucas Heights, is our misunderstanding of nuclear power.


We have seen, as I said, the mess that the Renewable Energy Target has caused. If you want a practical example of the failure, just go and look at what has happened in South Australia. Here is a place that now has the proud title of having the highest electricity prices anywhere in the world. It takes a special level of incompetence to go down the track of imposing policies upon your state that give them the highest electricity prices in the world, yet that is what the Labor government has done in South Australia. You would think that, if you had the highest electricity prices in the world, the electricity would at least be reliable, but they've managed to give themselves not only the highest electricity prices in the world but the most unreliable electricity in this nation. We saw blackouts last Christmas. The Australian Energy Market Operator estimates that there is a 30 per cent chance that there will be further blackouts this summer in South Australia.


We've seen the publicity stunt they pulled, the idea that the world's biggest battery can somehow solve it. Look at the numbers for that completely and utterly farcical publicity stunt. It will produce 129 megawatt hours of electricity—129! How much electricity, in megawatt hours, does South Australia need on a hot day? They need close to 50,000. This idea that you can somehow have batteries to back things up is an absolute farce. Just look at the numbers: it will produce 129 megawatt hours out of a daily need of 50,000. For that, it's north of $100 million, and we don't even know what the cost is. Then they have to back that up with 200 megawatts of diesel generators, again at a cost to the taxpayer of over $100 million, that will burn through 80,000 litres of diesel fuel in an hour. If you want to generate electricity in the dirtiest way possible, you probably can't do worse than diesel generators that rip through 80,000 litres per hour, but that is what South Australia are doing.


You would think, holding that up, that everyone would see what an absolute debacle that is, that no-one in their right mind would copy South Australia and that we would thank them for the grand experiment they inflicted upon their people, because we have learnt what not to do. That is what common sense and logic say should happen, but instead we see Labor in Victoria saying: 'We want to copy South Australia. We'll go down the South Australian track, like lemmings off a cliff, and we'll copy South Australia's policies.' When Labor came to power in Victoria, they said it was their policy to get Hazelwood to close down, tripled the coal royalties and chased them out as quickly as they could. What has the Australian Energy Market Operator said of that mess, now they've chased Hazelwood out of town? What's going to be the result? The Australian Energy Market Operator has estimated that, this summer, the state of Victoria faces a 40 per cent chance of blackouts. Not only have they accelerated electricity prices and made them unaffordable to many but they've also given the state a 40 per cent chance of blackouts. You would think common sense, logic, everything that we've been taught, is to look at the examples. We look at the example of South Australia and we say, 'What an economic disaster; that's not what you do.' We look at Victoria—another lemming over the cliff. You see that you cannot go down the path of a 50 per cent renewable energy target. But in this federal parliament the alternative government, the opposition, want to do exactly that. They want to copy Victoria. They want to copy South Australia. They want to bring in a 50 per cent renewable energy target for this nation. 


That is a recipe for the complete economic destruction and de-industrialisation of our society. But the Labor Party stand up in parliament and complain—we hear them complain—about how sad they are about the cost of electricity. Yet they have a completely illogical and incoherent policy that they're copying because they want to appeal to those Green, inner-city basketweavers for votes. They are selling out regional areas, selling out the working people of Australia, selling out the mums and dads and the pensioners in their pursuit of Green votes. That's what this parliament has descended into, where we see that policy from the Labor Party.


If we are going forward, we should have a look at what the options are. What is the nuclear option for our electricity generation fleet? Great research in this area is currently being undertaken. Small nuclear modular reactors of 20 and 50 megawatts are being developed. They're still several years down the track, but we should have that option in this country. We should keep all options on the table. We should take advantage of new technology as it comes along, not artificially force-feed higher-cost electricity options to the market because it will win Green votes in the inner city. 


I am very proud of the work that ANSTO does. This bill will enable them to continue with their great work. It will bring many more jobs, highly paid jobs, to my electorate, and I commend this bill to the House.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-09-13,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:52):  This is a very important debate because the facilities that are managed by ANSTO are massively important research assets for our nation. It is hard to overstate the significance of these particular facilities. At the Sydney campus, there's the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, and, at the Melbourne campus in Clayton, the Australian Synchrotron, which are, as I said, vitally important research facilities. 


I'm very pleased that I was able to visit the Synchrotron, at Clayton, in recent months to see some of the work that is being done there. Not everyone knows what a synchrotron is, of course. It's a massive facility, about the size of a football field—a great, big, round facility. What it does is speed up electrons so they're going almost at the speed of light and then it deflects them through magnetic fields, creating superbright light. Shooting off from the big, round Synchrotron are things called beamlines, which are big pipes, and that light travels down these big pipes.


'What on earth could that be useful for?' you might ask yourself if you're not a nuclear technology and nuclear science buff. Happily, for all of us, including me, the ANSTO website has a bit of information about the applications of the Synchrotron, and I was able to see some of them in person when I visited. Some of those applications are to biosciences, including macromolecular/protein crystallography and cell biology. When you can see through incredibly strong microscopes the work that's being done, the science that's being done, at this facility, it's quite incredible. Of course, medical research is a major use of the Synchrotron, in microbiology, disease mechanisms, high-resolution imaging and cancer radiation therapy. It has applications to the environmental sciences; agriculture; minerals exploration; advanced materials, like nanostructured materials; engineering, such as imaging of industrial processes in real time; and forensics, such as the identification of suspects from extremely small and dilute samples.


You can tell from what I've said that there's an incredibly diverse and varied group of applications for the Australian Synchrotron, so it was particularly delightful to be able to get the opportunity to meet with ANSTO and have a look at the facilities. These are facilities that a range of Australian universities seek to use for their own research work. I think ANSTO is a national treasure, and that is why I was so keen to speak in relation to this motion today. On the other campus, the Sydney campus, ANSTO has been expanding its activities, including a nuclear medicine plant, and this has tripled the production of molybdenum-99, of which there is a worldwide shortage. It is wonderful to see the nuclear medicine work that ANSTO is doing. 


The aim of this bill is really to develop the Sydney campus into a major national innovation precinct. I was pleased to be able to attend an event here at the parliament that ANSTO conducted a little while ago to talk about their vision for this becoming a major national innovation precinct. It's important not just to think about the benefits that we get from the research that would be done by ANSTO but also to think about the benefits that would be obtained through collaboration at an innovation precinct. If you've been to Silicon Valley, for example, you would have seen that a lot of the work that gets done and the achievements that are made are because people who have the creativity and the right skills are in the same place at the same time. Collaboration does matter, and it's more likely to occur when you bring people together in a precinct. It is also important to remember the broader economic benefits of having good, world-class research facilities, not just because of the ability to commercialise the research that gets done in relation to these facilities but also because it provides opportunities for the local community to have flow-on or second-order benefits from the existence of a research facility or in this case an innovation precinct. It's part of the economic revitalisation of the area in which this innovation precinct is being proposed. When you look at experience in cities around the world, you see that where there's a university, a big research facility or an innovation precinct they stimulate other activities as well. People get excited and it really helps to bring the area to life. So it's a very exciting proposal for ANSTO but, more importantly, it's a very exciting proposal for the part of Australia in which the innovation precinct is intended to be built, down in Sydney. 


So I support the proposal to develop the campus into a major national innovation precinct. Unfortunately, at the moment, as it stands the legislation governing ANSTO unduly restricts the scope and potential of that precinct. This bill would overcome this by allowing ANSTO to share its knowledge, expertise, facilities and property with other entities. These entities would not need to have a direct involvement in nuclear science or technology. That's an important point, because one of the benefits of innovation precincts is that they bring together so many different disciplines, skills and businesses that might not have anything to do with each other, but the communication and camaraderie that develops provides a spark of innovation. Who knows which ideas might come? Who knows which ideas might be developed? You could have an anthropologist working with a nuclear scientist, and the different perspectives they bring to each other can spark new and creative ideas. That's a very important thing. 


This bill broadens the definitions of scientific research, innovation and training in the ANSTO Act so they are not restricted in that way to nuclear science and technology. The precinct will include a graduate institute providing research training for up to 400 postgraduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the Sydney and Melbourne campuses. Again, very importantly, there are direct opportunities for research for postgraduate studies and postdoctoral research. It's very important that we broaden the opportunities that people can have from using ANSTO's facilities and assets. These facilities can make such a massive contribution to research in Australia. 


Together, all of these changes in this bill will make it easier for ANSTO to cooperate with industry, as well as universities and other publicly funded agencies. That collaboration with industry is very important. We do need closer connections between industry and research in Australia. It's something that a lot of universities and other institutions have a strong history of doing. This isn't a comment intended to suggest in any way that only commercialised research or industry-connected research is valuable—I certainly don't suggest that for one minute. Most people in this place would have the view that blue-sky research—research that may not have any immediate foreseeable commercial application or industrial application—is still very important, because blue-sky research can lead to all sorts of world-changing ideas and studies. The recognition of the importance of blue-sky research does not, in my view, undermine the practical work that needs to be done in relation to building connections with industry. From my experience of talking to people working in science and in research, I think it is also quite satisfying to have connections with industry. One of the frustrations that can arise in purely academic work is that you see what needs to be done, but you're not necessarily translating it into getting it done; whereas when you do have industry connections there is a strong imperative for translational work to be done. That, I suspect, is quite satisfying for people—to see ideas and research in real-life application and making a difference to people's lives.


I'm quite excited about this bill. It's great to see the work that's being done to promote the links with industry and to promote the collaboration between research institutions and between Australian universities. As I said, visiting the Synchrotron was really an opportunity to see how different universities were using a piece of plant, or a facility—a very big and technologically advanced facility, but a piece of plant nonetheless—to come up with new applications to solve old problems and to look at things in different ways using incredibly bright light. I think this idea of inviting even more people in to collaborate more, to get more engaged and to work together is a very solid and sound one, and one that deserves support from across this parliament. I should say that this is the kind of exchange between sectors that Labor promoted in government, and we support this bill for those reasons. In fact, we also took to the last federal election a range of innovation policies in which we acknowledged and recognised the importance of bringing people together. I think that that remains such an important focus for innovation and research policy in this nation.


I am pleased to be able to support the bill and am very grateful for the opportunity to have spoken in support of it. I do wish the people at ANSTO well in actually executing the work to be done under this bill in creating an innovation precinct. They can rest assured they've got a good supporter in me—I've got my little ANSTO badge on for them! I do think it is important to promote the work that is done in the nuclear sciences, including nuclear medicine but not limited to nuclear medicine, here in Australia. We do have a lot to be proud of. We're a smart nation. We're a nation that can look forward to good, strong, quality research.


This has been a week of argument about our university system, and I don't necessarily want to repeat some of the concerns that I have about the impact of public funding cuts to universities and what that might do to overall university quality. You will have read the matters in the paper recently about possibilities for other cuts in the event the government's preferred package doesn't go ahead and some of the suggestions that were made there. I hope this is an opportunity for us to say, 'Actually, what we want to see is world-class research in Australia,' because we do have an advantage in it. We do have high quality, we do have the smarts, we do have great facilities, and we do have a tradition of supporting research and innovation here in this country. If we work together, we can see facilities like the wonderful ones that ANSTO has continue to become even greater assets to the Australian community.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Minister for Small Business) (17:04):  I thank all members who have contributed to this debate, including the member for Griffith who's just spoken and the member for Hughes who spoke so passionately just before her. We've heard a lot about research and innovation in this debate and, to that end, I want to compliment most earnestly the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, and his assistant minister, the member for Reid, for what they're doing in this space. 


The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Bill 2017 makes minor but important amendments to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's governing legislation, the ANSTO Act. The amendments will allow our national nuclear science agency the flexibility to successfully establish an innovation precinct adjacent to its Lucas Heights campus in southern Sydney. They will also allow ANSTO to, potentially, establish additional precincts in association with other campuses. More broadly, the bill will facilitate enhanced collaboration between industry, universities, researchers and ANSTO across all its sites. Importantly, the amendments will only empower ANSTO to make available its expertise and equipment or lease its land and facilities to parties that have a science, innovation, high-tech manufacturing or technology development focus and related amenities, and not for unrelated general retail, office or residential purposes. The proposed ANSTO innovation precinct will co-locate and crowd in scientific partners, knowledge-intensive businesses, high-tech industry, science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, and medicine graduates around Australia's centre of nuclear capability and expertise. 


Close synergies and collaborations between our publicly funded research agencies, such as ANSTO, Australian universities and Australian business and industry are a national priority, and the minister and his assistant minister have certainly made that key to everything they talk about and everything they bring to the parliament. These are key to driving Australian innovation, and geography does matter for some innovation. Precincts can facilitate the sorts of collaborative relationships Australia needs if it is to innovate and grow. We all know that. As a parliament we want to remove any impediment that may restrict or discourage these relationships. This bill does just that. 


ANSTO already contributes so much to the Australian community. On average, one in two Australians will benefit from the life-saving nuclear medicine produced by ANSTO. ANSTO's landmark and national research infrastructure, including the OPAL research reactor, the Australian Synchrotron and the Australian centre for accelerated science, are a crucial part of Australia's scientific, social and economic base. They enable scientists to tackle some of Australia's most pressing challenges, in areas as diverse as human health, the environment and solving complex problems for industry. Critically, they maintain a home-grown highly skilled workforce and help sustain Australia's competitiveness and global relevance. The adoption of this bill will allow ANSTO to deepen its impact and reach for the benefit of Australian innovation, education, business and industry. I commend this bill to the House.
