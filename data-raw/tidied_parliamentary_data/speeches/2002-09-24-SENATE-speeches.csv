"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-09-24,"—On 23 September Senator Stott Despoja asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Science, a question regarding Mr McGauran's comments at the FASTS policy launch concerning future funding arrangements for Backing Australia's Ability. I undertook to provide additional information. I understand Senator Stott Despoja did not attend the FASTS policy launch in Parliament House. If she had, she would have heard the comments made by Mr McGauran when he made it clear that the government has no intention other than to fully implement Backing Australia's Ability as originally announced. As a matter of course and in keeping with good program management practices, all government programs are subject to monitoring and evaluation to ensure they are as effective as possible, represent good value for the Australian taxpayer and continue to meet government aims. Mr McGauran referred to the culling of any duplication or onerous reporting requirements for applicants and recipients of program funding within Backing Australia's Ability—an eminently sensible comment. This government is committed to Australia's science and scientists and intends to allow them to spend the majority of their valuable time conducting research, not filling in paperwork.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Science: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I particularly note that the Minister for Finance and Administration has stated that a representative of Microsoft did not travel with the group. That raises a question about the capacity of the department to give answers to questions, because in the information provided by the department they have clearly stated that a representative of Microsoft actually did travel with the group. 
—So someone is misleading.
—So someone is misleading the parliament. I would suggest, Minister, it might be worth your while doing some more research and development on the answer; I suggest you do some more research and development in respect of this question. Perhaps, if you apply yourself to it, you may double the effort of this government's research and development contribution to the nation's economy, because the reality is that there are two multinational companies that have been funded and the interesting thing about what has occurred with the Microsoft and Boeing representatives is that they were both on programs that finished up visiting the town where their head office is located; they both visited Seattle—
—Scandalous!
— Scandalous! It would be scandalous if you were only looking at this in isolation. But, when you compare this with what you have done in terms of research and development in this country, when you compare this with the decision of the minister to in fact suspend the funding of the R&D Start grant program from 1 January this year and the announcement that it probably will not start again—it probably will not get out of the sin-bin until the first quarter of next year—and when you compare this with the fact that you are allowing these sorts of programs to continue to run, you have to raise the question of where the government has set its priorities in terms of research and development.
This program substantially funds the executives of companies to go on overseas trips. We have that compared to the R&D Start program, which is about funding the research and development capacity of small- and medium-sized enterprises in this country. They have all been seriously disadvantaged as a result of the decision by the government this year to suspend the R&D program. Yesterday and today we heard Senator Alston waxing lyrical in his response about Backing Australia's Ability. The reality is that Backing Australia's Ability, despite being a $2.9 billion program, was back-loaded in terms of the funding. The central feature of that program was the R&D Start program, which is now in suspension. It is now in the sin-bin for one reason and one reason only: if it had been allowed to continue under this year's budget, you would have had to come in here and admit you had a budget deficit. That is why the R&D Start program was suspended.
That is why other programs in this department were cut: to ensure that you were able to come in here in May this year and demonstrate that the budget was in surplus. But you did not cut programs that in many respects were superfluous to our R&D effort. We have had the situation, for example, of the minister of this department going out and claiming that we are one of the best performers in the OECD countries on research and development when all of the evidence proves the opposite. That is an absolute outrage. We are down at the bottom of the ladder in all of the OECD statistics in terms of our R&D efforts. But this minister has gone out and manipulated the figures to try and demonstrate that we are doing very well when we are doing very badly.
The R&D performance of this government has been appalling. It has been appalling since you came into office in March 1996. It has gone backwards from that point in time. We are now spending less on research and development as a nation than we were at the end of 1995—not a very good performance at all from a government that goes out there and claims to be— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-09-24,"—Senator George Campbell has moved that the Senate take note of all answers. The one I particularly want to focus on related to the question to Senator Hill concerning shipbuilding in Australia. It is terrific that, over the last 30 years in Australia, we have increasingly moved towards a system of actually building industry capability for Defence across this country. We have done that in major projects in not only shipbuilding but also aircraft and other military craft for the Army. This creates jobs, flow-on jobs and regional employment.
The question which came up today related to the way in which we may reorganise shipbuilding in this country. It is a complex issue. We have major projects. The flow of these tends to be uneven. We have major shipbuilding companies right around the coastline of Australia. How can we best use these facilities for the enhancement of defence equipment in this country? This government is going to do this in a very rational and systematic way. 
I would like to contrast this with the way in which the Labor Party approached these projects when they were in government for over 13 years. We had a situation where major contracts were awarded by the last Labor government—I will focus on naval contracts here—depending on which particular state they wished to help and prop up at that time. Let me give you two examples. One is the submarine contract. The Bannon government was in some trouble, so they got the submarine contract. At the time, there was a far better proposal coming out of Newcastle and using a German submarine model. The Germans know something about building submarines—let me tell you. I think we would not have the problems we have at the moment if Robert Ray had made a decision at the time to choose the German-designed sub, built by a consortium, including BHP, out of Newcastle. He chose not to do that. We are now faced with a whole lot of bills to try to get the sub that was chosen to work.
This is how things can come back at you in politics: you make a decision in the eighties and here you are, two decades later, still suffering the financial consequences of such a bad decision. The corker of them all was the Anzac frigates. Again, Newcastle had a far superior project for those frigates, but what did the federal Labor government do? It wanted to prop up the Kirner government in Victoria, which was on the ropes as it approached that massive defeat in 1992. So whom did they give the project to? They gave the project to build the Anzac frigates to Williamstown, down in Melbourne.
Bob Hawke, knowing that Newcastle would be a bit disappointed, came up and proposed some flow-on work. One of the things about building these frigates is that you do not build them all in one spot. You can do them around the country, move the units and put them all together. Bob Hawke came up and promised Newcastle that we would get $972 million worth of work. We were incredibly impressed; he was right down to the last dollar! We got a few little units to put together and we made a few nuts and bolts for the project, but the amount of work that flowed on was pretty terrible for Newcastle.
Newcastle historically has a great history in shipbuilding. Recently we had Minister Hill come up to have a look at the minehunters. We were launching the last of the minehunters the day he was in town. The Diamantina was launched and all the workers who had put in such a terrific effort were there. It was penned off, and I am sure the minister was impressed with the technology. As I mentioned before, we have flows of work and we have to be a lot more sensible and rational in the way that we approach them. Having a prime contractor is the way to go about this and work can be then spread around. Shipyards in Newcastle are not uncomfortable with that. They see that there will be work, and, in the works program this government has put ahead, over the next 10 years there is plenty of work for shipyards. We just have to approach it in a rational and systematic way, and our Minister Robert Hill is proposing such an approach. It is a far better approach to shipbuilding than the mates approach of the previous ALP government.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-09-24,"—In response to the question asked today by Senator George Campbell on the issue of the research and development program and the government, the minister effectively said that he did not know the answer. He had to come back to us after question time to establish whether we have executives of major multinational corporations receiving support from this government to undertake travel as part of research and development. It is an extraordinary proposition. Senator Campbell had an answer back from the department through estimates which highlights that this event occurs, and now we have the minister suggesting in the chamber that it has not. Clearly, we have a conflict in terms of the evidence presented to this parliament. 
I think the broader question, however, goes to the way in which this government is dealing with research and development. I noticed that Senator Alston today indicated that Mr McGauran's claims at the launch of a paper yesterday by the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies were a misquote by Senator Stott Despoja. I had a staff member who was also present at that launch and the information that I have been given is that the minister did in fact indicate that Backing Australia's Ability programs were up for review and that some programs could possibly be culled, which is a different position from what has been put to us here today. This is a program, we recall, which was essentially back-loaded and put into the five-year program, with most of the money being spent in the last two years of that program. Eighteen months into the program, we have a statement by the Minister for Science suggesting that that program is now up for review, and part of the evidence for that is what we see with the R&D Start program, which of course has been put on hold. 
However, we notice in general terms that this government has effectively failed to respond to the major problems faced by the research community. As a country, I think we are able to claim that we punch well above our weight when it comes to science and research. The real problem is that it requires governments to allow researchers to fulfil their full potential, and that clearly is a problem way beyond this government. In regard to industry development and assistance, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies are telling us that there are well-founded concerns over the nation's recent performance compared with our major international competitors. The report that they launched yesterday, to which the minister spoke, said that the most worrying of these concerns was our performance in regard to BERD, which is business expenditure on research and development. They go on to say that there has been quite a significant decline in this country's capacity. They also point out in this report that one of the major failings of this government is the failure to commit to a long-term strategy for Australian science and technology—to `a vision', they say, that would allow it to serve its rightful place as a driver of the economy and solution to our environmental problems. Science and technology lie at the heart of Australia's national development.
This government has failed to appreciate that point which our scientists draw to our attention. They point to the fact that the brain drain is still progressing unabated. There is no real action by this government to head off the problem with our major scientists and our major researchers being forced to go overseas. There has been a decline of 25 per cent in the number of university academics, for instance, who have been studying mathematics over the last 10 years. We have seen a situation where our researchers are growing older, and now almost 25 per cent of our academics are over 50 and major numbers of them are likely to retire in the next couple of years. Our researchers are being forced by age to move out of the sector and there are no real strategies to bring young researchers back into the system.
We have a situation where our universities are facing a major funding crisis, where laboratories, libraries and lecture room spaces are declining at such a rate. This is a direct result of the government declining to provide funds, and the universities are then forced to use what money is available for capital to fund recurrent expenditure. We have a situation where our research resources are falling away, where the citation rates for Australian researchers are falling away internationally and, as a consequence, our place in the world is declining dramatically. This government should be condemned for its failure to address those problems. These issues have been raised in this parliament. The Universities in crisis report has been around for 12 months now and the government has failed to respond to it.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2002-09-24,"—I note the earnest contribution of Senator George Campbell in this very important and serious matter of research and development. He could not even wait for the debate to be completed. He was not interested in the outcome of the debate and left the chamber. I find that indicative of the degree— 
—He had a press release—
—Yes. I find that indicative of the degree of seriousness with which he raises this issue. He says that the evidence is clear that we are at the bottom in terms of world performance on the issue of R&D. Where is the substance and detail to that allegation? It is simply a platitude, simply a statement—and a hollow one. 
—Read the FASTS report from yesterday!
—There is an awful lot of reference from the other side after the issue is raised. But when they are in debate, they never think it is appropriate to actually come forward with the detail. It is always a shout across the floor whilst seated. 
What we have achieved in research and development since taking office in 1996 has been quite remarkable and stark in contrast to the complete and utter lack of performance and, what is worse, lack of understanding of industry from the previous government until 1996. There we are with criticism and no detail; the allegations are hollow. Let me talk about a couple of projects that I am aware of as a casual observer. The first relates to the Commonwealth contribution to the Commonwealth cooperative research centre at Curtin University in Western Australia—a centre which specialises in extractive metallurgical technology. The centre has been responsible for the considerable reduction of the dollar cost per tonne in the treatment and processing of metallurgical ores, particularly gold. This centre, funded almost entirely by the Commonwealth, is a research centre bringing together the expertise of the CSIRO, Curtin University, Brisbane University and Murdoch University. Its contribution has been outstanding. I note that Senator Carr is again leaving the chamber. This centre is an example of this government working cooperatively with industry to produce a most excellent world-class outcome.
I turn also to the contribution made by the Commonwealth with respect to the gravitational wave observatory and the spin-offs that have flowed from that. This is a project in Western Australia funded almost entirely by the Commonwealth, where we have joined five other countries in research associated with the measuring of gravitational waves. The development of this observatory, where two laser beams are sent out at right angles over a distance of two kilometres and the fluctuation of these laser beams is measured inside a minus 14 degree atmosphere vacuum tank, has led to the discovery of a number of substantial and important industrial breakthroughs, such as a refrigeration process, a radar amplifier and a stabilising system that eliminates vibration. There has been a whole host of spin-offs for industry through the research which this Commonwealth government, through its understanding, respect and ability to pick good projects, has promoted and this had led to an enormous amount of success.
Lastly, I want to comment on some of the software developments. Senator Campbell focused upon the fact that a Microsoft man was allegedly involved in the trip when we went over to Silicon Valley, and the $8,600 was used to visit the Microsoft centre in the USA. Australia is on the cutting edge and is a leader in the development of software. This government has contributed to it substantially time and again. Let me give one example: Australian Defence Industries has developed software for a command and control system for terrorist and emergency services that brings together the operatives involved at short notice to alleviate a particular emergency or terrorist threatening situation. This software has enormous potential to be exported overseas, particularly to Europe. There again, the Australian government is on the front line as one of the principal customers of that organisation, assisting in its development. There is simply a host of things that this government has done in terms of industrial research and development.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I also rise to take note of the answer given today by Senator Minchin to Senator George Campbell's question about the use of taxpayer dollars being used to fly multinational company executives to conferences in the United States, while funding for the government's R&D Start program has ceased due to an apparent shortage of funds. The minister's lack of knowledge in response to this question really begs the question: what commitment does this government have to the industries of this country and to the essential research and development which is crucial for industrial innovation, export growth and import substitution? The answer is, quite simply: not a very good one. 
Senator Johnston asked about the figures and what actually backs up these allegations. He will be very appreciative to know that there are a substantial number of figures available. Let me go to them, as they speak for themselves. In figures released in the 2002 OECD Observer, Australia's public expenditure on research and development, as a percentage of gross domestic product, ranked 16th out of the 26 nations surveyed. That is, 15 other countries are getting the jump on Australia year after year, year in, year out. Money and investment which could be coming to this country are going elsewhere. Australia is missing these opportunities. Business expenditure on research and development has dropped from its peak— under, I might mention, a previous Labor government—of 0.87 per cent of GDP to 0.72 per cent of GDP, ranking Australia 11th out of the 16 countries surveyed. Remarkably, Australia's business expenditure on research and development as a ratio to GDP represents one-third the level of business funded R&D expenditure in Finland, the United States and South Korea. We are not leading edge; we are at the bottom edge.
Expenditure on research and development in the plastics and chemical industry has declined from $181 million in 1995-96 to $125 million in 1998-99, representing a decline in the ratio of R&D turnover from 0.86 to 0.60. It is another indicator of a decline in research and development funding, both public and private. Moreover, publicly funded research and development undertaken by the country's university sector has fallen steadily since this government took office. Senator Carr went into some of the facts and figures in relation to that industry. This is not a good mid- to long-term outlook for the innovation and prosperity of our industrial sectors or the nation as a whole. If we do not invest in research and development now, we face lagging behind the rest of the developed world and paying dearly for it down the track. 
The above-mentioned statistics are exacerbated by recent comments made by Intel chief, Dr Craig Barrett, who revealed in the Australian earlier this month that his company spends more on research and development than all Australian companies and the federal government itself. Mr Barrett said:
Australia spends something less than $US3.5bn on R&D, while Intel spends $US4.5bn ... my company spends more than your country.
It is a remarkable statistic. This government's record with research and development in pursuing innovation is a bad one. Its major problem is that its programs are primarily based on public relations and not public initiatives. For instance, let us look at the government's program Backing Australia's Ability, a cross-departmental program responsible to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Department of Education, Science and Training and the National Office for the Information Economy. While Minister Macfarlane claimed that Backing Australia's Ability is boosting innovation by $3 billion, the reality is that at the end of the second year of its five-year lifespan just under 20 per cent of the apparent $3 billion available has been spent. Moreover, the R&D Start fund was so badly mismanaged that the money for this year ran out in January, leaving many companies high and dry without much-relied-on funds. The next R&D Start grant funds will not recommence until 2003. From the slashing of the research and development tax concession by 125 per cent to the complete mismanagement of the research and development— (Time expired)

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-09-24,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 23 September 2002, of George Georges, a senator for the state of Queensland from 1968 to 1987.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Georges, Mr George</title>",Condolences,4,1
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2002-09-24,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 23 September 2002, of George Georges, former senator for Queensland, and places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
George Georges was born on 15 April 1920 in Darwin in the Northern Territory. He became a Labor senator for Queensland on 1 July 1968. He was Opposition Whip in the Senate from 27 January 1976 to 23 November 1980. He served as a senator until June 1987.
He was a member and contributed to a number of parliamentary sittings. He served as Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from 11 May 1983 to 24 February 1987 and as Chair of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts. He also served on the Senate Select Committee on the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1975, the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and the Senate Estimates Committee F.
In his first speech in the Senate, George Georges, in speaking on the budget, focused on the need to support families and ex-servicemen and spoke against involvement in the Vietnam War.
He was a hard-working senator and clearly a man of integrity. He made prominent stands to support his beliefs, crossing the floor of parliament, leading campaigns against the Vietnam War and leading street marches in Queensland supporting the right to protest and freedom of speech. He was also a leading figure in the Palm Sunday peace rallies.
His parliamentary career was punctuated by some dramatic moments but I think they only underline the strength of his beliefs. He crossed the floor of the Senate to vote against deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation and for that was suspended from the ALP. After crossing the floor again to vote against the Australia Card legislation, he resigned from the ALP serving as an Independent senator from December 1986 until his departure in June 1987.
His period in the Senate and mine crossed by about six years, so whilst I did not know him well I nevertheless had considerable opportunity to watch and, I might say, learn from him. I remember his passion, his genuine belief for his causes, his commitment to public service and I also remember his sense of humour. This was reflected in his last speech in the Senate where he cited `a couple of small physical things' that he had achieved. One of his achievements was to get flashing lights installed in the toilets after making what he described as a `brilliant' adjournment speech—which is more than what some senators have achieved. Another of his achievements was, after breaking a rib, to get a couple of signs in Kings Hall saying, `Take care on polished floor.'

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-24,"—On behalf of the opposition, I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and associate the opposition with it on the death of former Senator George Georges. George Georges was born George Georgouras in Darwin on 15 April 1920. His family moved to Queensland not long after. As the son of recent migrants—his father had emigrated from Greece in 1916, his mother following a few years later—George had early first-hand experience of the difficulties that underdogs can suffer. As his father struggled to find work during the Depression, George acted as his interpreter. He always said that his dedication to the trade union movement came from seeing his father exploited by employers during that period.
He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1944, in a branch in the state electorate that was represented by Vince Gair, who of course later became Labor Premier of Queensland and later had political incarnations. However, Gair and the young Georges—by this time not merely a budding but a positively blossoming socialist—were not destined to become friends and allies. Nonetheless, George Georges established a solid reputation in the Queensland Labor Party, most particularly for his work with and on behalf of a variety of cooperative organisations, including Queensland's Workers Co-operative Credit Union.
He won preselection for a Senate seat before the 1967 election, and he commenced his Senate term on 1 July 1968. George's first speech was to draw a contrast between the affluence of Canberra, the advantages enjoyed by politicians and the difficulties faced by pensioners. Mocking the idea that imposing hardship on the disadvantaged would encourage them to be more responsible, he thundered that this was `a thrift imposed upon the needy by a Treasurer who has no vision or no foresight or no humanity'. I feel that those words are just as applicable to this year's budget as they were to the budget in 1968. George remained an active campaigner for the underdog throughout his time as a senator and, it is fair to say, beyond his time as a senator. Perhaps most famous for being repeatedly arrested during civil rights marches, George continued his stubborn resistance by refusing to give the military salute to prison officials.
For many within the Labor Party, George Georges will be best remembered for his dedicated work in the cause of party reform in the Queensland branch in the late 1970s and early 1980s. George was part of the ALP reform group in Queensland which saw drastic change as the only solution to Queensland Labor's poor electoral showing. He was one of the 400 present in February 1978 at the first big meeting, which was chaired by a young man who would go on to be a figure of some significance in Queensland politics: Peter Beattie. It was a long and bruising fight but it was ultimately successful. At the same time, George Georges was actively involved in the equally bruising struggle against Bjelke-Petersen's police-state laws.
Any one of these causes would have been enough for most people, but George Georges was not able to turn his back on a cause he believed in, no matter how many calls on his attention there were. To those who knew him, George Georges was a quietly-spoken person, but his manner seemed to give little warning of the volcanic passions that could erupt. Senator John Button once said to him, `The trouble with you, George, is that you go off like a bomb but no-one knows when to expect it.'
George was well known for his idiosyncrasies. Former colleagues recall that when he was whip—in the Old Parliament House, of course, and in the days before monitors brought the proceedings of the chamber into every office—he found it inconvenient to be running down to the chamber constantly to find out what was going on. So George arranged for a hole to be cut into the wall that separated the then whip's office from the chamber, and for a glass panel to be installed. In order to see through the new window, he had to get up from behind his desk. This became more difficult as his health deteriorated and as he got a little older, and it was not long, I am told, before a large cupboard was installed to block the window. 
Many of us were disappointed when George Georges crossed the floor and voted against deregistration of the BLF. In the Labor Party, as many know, the principle of solidarity is paramount, and George was suspended from the federal parliamentary Labor Party at that time. It is true that in 1986 he resigned from the ALP over the Australia Card issue and then unsuccessfully pursued re-election as an Independent in the 1987 election. But I think I can speak on behalf of my colleagues when I say that we were all very pleased indeed when, in 1994, George rejoined the Labor Party. He was very much welcomed back into the fold.
When George Georges left the Senate, former Senator Arthur Geitzelt said:
Senator Georges is possibly one of the most honest men in the Senate. He has principles that he will abide by through thick and thin.
I think that that was a very fair and appropriate comment from former Senator Arthur Geitzelt. Many in the Labor Party found George to be occasionally infuriating, but I think those occasional frustrations were a small price to pay for George's steadfastness in defence of those principles he fought for throughout his political life.
While I did not share a time with him as a senator in this chamber, I knew him well through the forums of the Australian Labor Party and of the Left of the Australian Labor Party. I had a good relationship with him through those years and particularly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many of us will miss him. On behalf of the opposition, I express sincere and deep regret at the passing of George Georges. Our condolences go to his wife and family and to his comrades and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Georges, Mr George</title>",Condolences,4,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I also rise to pay respects to George Georges. I would like to start off by referring to an amazingly isolated island in the south-east of Greece. It is an island which is minute, isolated and barren. It is the island from which George Georges's parents came in 1916 and 1918. It is also the island from which my parents came at around the same time. It is an island now with a population of some 188 people. In its history it had a maximum population of some 9,000 people but over the years they have all fled or migrated, and Australia is now home to some 30,000 or 40,000 descendants and former inhabitants of that island.
Its population is 188 people for most of the year—apart from summer, when it gets repopulated. Not only do we see whole suburbs of Australia migrating to the island but the plethora of shimmering pink bags of Peter's of Kensington seem to dominate the landscape. That is one of the dominant feels of the place. Most of the migrants from that island who live in Sydney live in the suburb of Kensington and they take with them much of what they experience in Australia. So Peter's has, at some times during the year, a branch store on the island of Kastellorizon.
I think the island has been the source of one of Australia's most remarkable immigration success stories. The migration from there was at the turn of the century and in the early twenties. As I said, most of the people who have migrated from there now live comfortable lives in Australia and there are some 30,000 or 40,000 of them. It is an island that had a very difficult and tragic history. For some 400 years it was run by Turks. It was under the dominance of the Italians and French for a number of years in its history. The British were there for one day and the folklore has it they did more damage in one day than the Turks did in 400 years. It is the home island of George Georges and I think when one looks at the location, the geography and the history of the island, one gets to appreciate some of the characteristics that we experienced in George as he lived his life of politics in this country: strong commitment to independence, a sense of justice, an enormous stubbornness against all odds and a commitment to activism. I think those characteristics sum up George Georges very well. 
He was, in the early days, a role model for many people like me who were looking at getting involved in politics. Being of migrant heritage and being a person who basically pioneered the presence of migrants in the national parliament, he was someone whom we looked to for advice and guidance. I first met him in the 1970s in Adelaide, some 30 years ago. He was doing then what he continued to do for all his life in politics— fighting for the cause of justice wherever it may have been necessitated. In this case he was fighting against the junta in Greece. He did so with a passion and commitment that he applied to issue after issue in international affairs. It was not just with Greece and the junta; it was in Cyprus and he was a pioneer in the campaign against involvement in the Vietnam War. He got into trouble for meeting with Yasser Arafat in the early days. His commitment to the overthrow of the racist policies in South Africa and his support for Nelson Mandela were issues that continually got him into some strife with the authorities in this country. He had a strong underlying commitment to justice and democracy and was a strong adherent, for instance, to the principles that guide the United Nations.
In terms of his commitment to justice, there was hardly a minority group that he did not have some association with and whose cause he did not sponsor. Senator Faulkner mentioned his migrant background and George's commitment to working people, not just those with migrant backgrounds, is one that this parliament got to appreciate every time issues relating to workers' rights were raised here. He railed against Bjelke-Petersen's anti-worker laws. He was prepared to go to jail in respect of them. In fact he went to jail a couple of times for peaceful resistance in the streets of Queensland. He was even prepared to be suspended from the Labor Party because of his commitment to the workers' rights that he so cherished. It did not stop him from being a member of the Labor Party for some 50 years, but he was prepared to take the action when he deemed it appropriate.
In terms of civil rights and social issues he was very much on the progressive side. In the seventies and eighties he led marches against Bjelke-Petersen's anti-democratic laws in Queensland to the extent that he was recognised by the former Premier's special branch and given file number 2A9627. He was in good company, it must be said. Sir Zelman Cowan had file number 2E1184 and even Prime Minister Billy McMahon had a file number. But that shows the extent of the undemocratic nature of the system in Queensland, a system that George was prepared to go to jail to try and overthrow. Even in prison he was the rascal that we knew him to be in this place. On one occasion he was released after one day because, as the authorities said, he was a disturbing influence on other people in prison—as he was, obviously, for those who shared this prison cell with him on a number of late nights and sittings.
His commitment to civil rights made him take a strong stand against the Australia Card—one that I shared at the time. He was a pioneer in raising issues in respect of Indigenous Australians, the environment and animal welfare. He spent five years on a Senate committee looking at securities and exchange issues, which led to some of our early trade practices legislation. He had prescience of the sorts of problems this country is now having with drug use and drug trafficking. 
As I said, I first met him 30 years ago, in the early seventies. The second time I met George was in about 1974 or 1975 when I began working for ministers in the Whitlam government. On more than one occasion, late at night, when I would be walking past the caucus room in the Old Parliament House, I could hear loud Greek music flowing through the corridors. On just about every occasion I would walk into the caucus room and there, in a luxurious old lounge chair, George would be sitting, inevitably asleep, while the music affected the lives of all of us around him. He was a person who had experienced all the extremes in political life but he also enjoyed the richness of cultural appreciation which is so important to people in our community.
In closing, I wish also to recognise the role of Gloria and the children. Gloria always seemed to be present in the Old Parliament House. She is a strong and influential person who tolerated George's unpredictability. She is warm and endearing, and that probably enabled her to handle a character like George for such a long time. I think parliamentarians' spouses often deserve medals. If medals were being given out, I think she would have reached the top of the class in respect of her work and the support she gave. In her case she did not know what to expect next, but in that respect she was probably no different from the rest of us in the Labor Party when it came to anticipating what George might do next. 
He was, as I have tried to depict, a very passionate and committed man: someone with an enormous commitment to justice; someone who was prepared to cop personal consequences in the interest of the causes that he so firmly believed in; and someone who made an impression in this parliament and on the history of the Australian parliament.
In essence, he was a lovable rascal and we are all saddened by his departure—not just Gloria and the family but also some of the old comrades who spent quite a long time in this parliament with him. I refer to people like John Scott, Lewis Kent, and Peter Milton from Victoria. I refer also to people like Tom Uren and Arthur Gietzelt, with whom he crusaded on a whole range of issues, as well as people who were not close to him but who I think have benefited from the way he championed causes. For me, he was an important early trailblazer, in a sense. He gave confidence to people from migrant backgrounds that they could participate in the parliamentary process. I think this country will be all the poorer for his departure. ",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Georges, Mr George</title>",Condolences,4,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2002-09-24,"—I, too, wish to say a few words of farewell and well done to former Senator George Georges. George was a colourful, controversial yet dedicated senator—the kind of representative that every parliament really needs, but not necessarily one that every party always wants. Our politics differed markedly but he had some essential characteristics that I always admired. He was a man of great integrity; a man who stood passionately behind his beliefs. With George, you always knew where he stood.
We enjoyed each other's company as members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This committee is noted for its bipartisan outcomes. It was while travelling with this committee, frequently on an aeroplane or at night over a meal, that George recounted so many of his interesting political experiences—and, of course, he had many. I also recall that George was a hard worker. He frequently moved his caravan week by week, as he flew into a new destination in Queensland. He constantly toured around Queensland and he was regarded as an old-time politician. 
He hated badges of authority and compulsory saluting. Two instances come immediately to mind. As has been recalled already, on being sentenced to a 14-day stint in prison, he lasted only a day, owing to his refusal to salute a prison officer—and, it was also alleged, because he had a bad effect on morale. One of the stories goes that the prison officers actually paid his fine in order to get him out of the place.
On another occasion he refused to wear an identifying badge during a Public Accounts Committee inquiry which visited a secure area. To the embarrassment of all at the time, George characteristically stood his ground and refused to wear a badge. He got away with it, although I was very conscious of the fact that an officer was not more than a metre away from him during the entire inspection.
George was a great advocate of cooperative movements to help the poor and the underprivileged. He was a true friend and supporter of the oppressed. We all know that he stood against the Builders Labourers Federation deregulation bill, the Australia Card Bill, the then government's inquiry into Lionel Murphy, and the export of uranium to France, to name but a few of the embarrassments he caused the government of the day. The Age newspaper recalled some advice from John Button that Senator Faulkner referred to earlier with respect to his unpredictability. John said to him, `The trouble with you, George, is that you go off like a bomb but no-one knows when to expect it.' 
I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to George's wife and family. I certainly enjoyed his friendship and I think the parliament is all the poorer for his passing.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Georges, Mr George</title>",Condolences,4,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-24,"—I would like to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on this condolence motion. On behalf of our party, I pass on our condolences to George Georges's family. I think it is something that all of us would be proud of if we managed, after 82 years of life, to achieve even half of what George Georges managed to achieve. Looking back at aspects of his life that I am aware of, one can have only admiration for all his activities, all his commitment and all his achievements. He was, as has been said, a child of a migrant and a great example of the contribution that migrant families have made and continue to make in Australia. He was a child during the Depression years and that obviously had a big impact—as it did for many other Australians who grew up during that period—on his beliefs and his concerns for injustice.
Apart from being born in Darwin, he lived most of his life in Queensland—indeed in Brisbane. He went to school at Brisbane State High and Queensland University and, of course, was a senator for Queensland for nearly 20 years. He was someone who I was certainly well aware of, growing up as a young person interested in social issues in Brisbane. He, as has been stated, was one of those early supporters for the campaign against the Vietnam War. He was the figurehead of the long and difficult campaign in Queensland in favour of the right to march. It is often easy to forget, 15 or 20 years down the track, what different places Brisbane and Queensland were in those days. 
At the time when I was growing up through the 1980s, there were regular confrontations over the oppressive laws preventing public demonstrations and the right to march, and George Georges and others were frequently at the head of those marches. It is a reminder of the extreme level of oppression that was inflicted on anybody with progressive views in Queensland in those days. As a symbol or an indication of that— looking back through some of the clippings that the Parliamentary Library kindly provided in relation to former Senator Georges—those laws involved the arrests of more than 1,000 people in their first 12 months of operation. An enormous number of people were repeatedly trying to express a basic civil liberty in the face of what has subsequently been recognised as extreme police oppression.
George Georges had a strong interest in the peace movement and was heavily involved in the days when there were thousands and thousands of people involved in the Palm Sunday rallies for peace. His legacy lives on with the continuation of those Palm Sunday events. The number of people that have attended over the years has fluctuated, but in recent years it is attracting a greater number of people. If I am correct, Joan Shears, who is still involved in organising those rallies, was on his staff for a long period. She certainly continues to work, carrying the flame in that area of activity. 
He was a strong campaigner against Australia's involvement with the US military machine and the use of facilities such as Pine Gap. Of course, we are now seeing again the legacy of that policy with the current situation where Australian facilities will undoubtedly be utilised as part of any US involvement in any war in Iraq. He was involved in the heated campaign in relation to the SEQEB strikes—again, an area of strong oppression by the Bjelke-Petersen government at the time, involving the arrests of many people. He was strongly involved in the anti-uranium movement and some big fights in his own party in relation to the Labor Party's policy on uranium mining. I recall, even back in the 1980s, the Democrats' strong support for an anti-uranium policy. One of the examples that would continually be pointed to was the terrible situation of people in other parties who were forced to vote against absolutely, deeply and passionately held beliefs, such as George Georges was required to do a number of times.
I know he had an ongoing interest in the Paddington Workers Club, which is still a fabulous venue—part of the inner city of Brisbane—and one that is used by many organisations, including, from time to time, the Australian Democrats. They have let us in the doors a couple of times and have been very polite to us, as well as other organisations. It is a venue that serves an important role.  
It is particularly poignant, given George Georges's strong support for the peace movement and his battles with his own party that have been detailed a bit here today, that Australia is now considering again whether or not to engage in supporting a war and considering whether or not there should be a conscience vote, a matter which I have just spoken about in a previous debate. I noted an article in the Canberra Times from 1986 where the then secretary of the ALP, Mr Bob McMullan, criticised the ALP for requiring too much discipline from its members and suggested that perhaps they need to be a little bit more flexible. He said, `They should give people more chance to express their views.' I would like to support Bob McMullan's views from 16 years ago. I invite him to express those views again today and encourage his leader, Mr Crean, to adopt them in relation to the fundamental issue of the war on Iraq to enable more flexibility for parliamentarians to express their views by virtue of them being able to vote according to their beliefs.
I note for the record—it may or may not be in my interests to note this—that, when George Georges quit the Labor Party and ran as an Independent in the double dissolution election in 1987, it was the last time that I did not vote for a Democrat in the Senate. My apologies to Michael Macklin at the time, but I was one of those 26,000-odd Queenslanders who voted for George Georges. He did not get elected, obviously. He polled a bit under two per cent, but that was still more than the Nuclear Disarmament Party at a time when they were polling fairly well. He was still in the count when the 12th senator was elected on that particular occasion.
Again, as a reminder of how much things have changed since then, those were the days when the National Party elected four senators from Queensland, instead of one, and significantly outpolled the Liberal Party in Queensland. I am sure that Senator Ian Macdonald would happily note how different things are these days. Looking at some of the names from those days, I see that there is a lot of history there as well. The only one from those 12 who were elected in 1987 who is still here is Ron Boswell but there were some other great and not so great contributors such as Margaret Reynolds and Michael Macklin; and David MacGibbon, Mal Colston and John Stone, to use the second category. It was a different world back then in many ways but George Georges's commitment to his beliefs continued on throughout the rest of his life and it was because of his ongoing interest and support for many causes that I met him a couple of times.
I would like specifically to note his ongoing support for and legacy to animal welfare. People have touched on that very briefly in terms of his role as Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. He was the founding chair of that committee which was set up at the initiative of Don Chipp and the Australian Democrats back in 1983. He is still remembered very strongly by people in the animal welfare movement for his contribution in that role and for his ongoing support. It was not just something he had an interest in whilst he was on the committee; he maintained his interest in and support for that issue after he was out of the parliament. He has left an important legacy there. If you try to raise animal welfare issues in committee forums today, you still meet hostility from people who ask, `Why the hell are we wasting our time with this stuff?' But George Georges was one of those, along with the Democrats, who first gave animal welfare the seriousness that it deserved.
I would like to take the opportunity to pass on some comments from one of the peak animal welfare bodies in Australia that have noted George Georges's passing. He was well respected by animal welfare and animal rights people. He understood and took seriously the animal cause. The establishment of that Senate committee, together with his appointment as its chair, was one of the first things that the Australian Federation of Animal Societies, as it then was—I was previously on its executive—was involved in getting under way. The select committee ended up operating for some nine years and it produced 10 reports and hundreds of recommendations. It was the first time that animal welfare had been given adequate attention nationally. George Georges was the chair for the first two reports on dolphins and whales in captivity and the export of live sheep from Australia and he was heavily involved in most of the inquiry into kangaroo issues.  
I think his success can be noted particularly in the area of dolphins and whales in captivity. Again, it was a very different world back then. There were a number of oceanariums around Australia that were very small, very inadequate and very inappropriate facilities for animals such as whales and dolphins. The committee recommended that those oceanariums be allowed to continue for the time being but that the keeping of cetaceans should ultimately be phased out, unless further research justified the existence of such oceanariums. Most of those facilities have disappeared and the few that remain are of infinitely better quality than those that were around at the time. That is a lasting legacy—one that he copped a lot of flak for at the time—and probably one of the areas where there has been most success. Whilst we still have a few facilities, and I and others can be critical of them, the improvement in those facilities is beyond belief compared to what was around in the 1980s.
He raised with the kangaroo industry the concerns and flaws that he mentioned back in those early committee reports and said that if the industry was not fixed up there would be continuing campaigns against it and there would be boycotts. That situation continues today because the industry has not been fixed up and, as we have seen from recent reports from the RSPCA, uncontrolled cruelty continues. Similarly, with the live sheep and live export trade, we have seen regular and ongoing instances of inappropriate facilities. As that report at the time pointed out, if it were simply a matter of making a judgment on welfare grounds then live sheep and live cattle exports would be ended tomorrow, but of course we all know that there are economic issues involved.
Partly because I know that others will not focus as much on George Georges's contribution to animal welfare I thought it was appropriate to emphasise it. It is a part of his record that is often glossed over and it is a part of his achievements that is often not recognised. He is often seen, quite appropriately, as a very left-wing agitator on some of those core civil liberties issues. People often do not remember his strong record of achievement in animal welfare, but it is a strong one. Even though it is 15 years since he left this place, his record is still widely remembered and respected in the animal rights movement. I pay tribute to his contribution in that regard as well as to all the other achievements he attained through what was an incredibly valuable and well-lived life.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Georges, Mr George</title>",Condolences,4,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I am very honoured to be able to pay respect to George Georges. I first met George Georges at a Palm Sunday rally for peace in King George Square in Brisbane. Already a legend in many circles for his outspoken views on a range of issues—including democracy, peace, conservation and many others—as well as his highly publicised relationship with the Australian Labor Party, George was quietly working the crowd, making sure that people were introduced to one another, making jokes with the crowd of retired trade unionists who loyally turned up for the action and then, of course, passing around the hat to help out with the cost.
George genuinely enjoyed meeting and working with people. He has provided enormous support and stimulation to a wide range of people. In his later years in Brisbane, George spoke very quietly, and conversations with him were very personal and private affairs. He shared his knowledge and his experience generously, and was always prepared to take the time to have a chat, talk about the lessons from his own colourful past and encourage people to `get into the fight— because, remember, it will always be a fight'. Funnily enough, in those conversations it was always noted by other people just who was talking with whom and when. 
George was a socialist. He was proud of his beliefs, and they were tested thoroughly throughout his service in the Senate and on the pages of the Queensland media. He regularly talked about the need to go out and get those who were politically active and aware and, if there were no socialists there, to go out and encourage them to become part of the process anyway. George, though always ready to talk, did not believe in words alone. He was active in protest movements in the street. He was seen:
... standing arm-in-arm with people and fighting for their rights, not just in the House but in the streets.
He was arrested many times in street marches for the right to demonstrate. Many of us in Brisbane remember his presence at peace rallies, rallies for East Timor and trade union rallies—so many meetings—and somehow the activity was legitimised if George was there.
When I was preselected for the Senate, I was summoned for a chat at the Paddington Workers Club. In his favourite corner— where he could see everything that was going on and from where he had overseen the operations of the Workers Cooperative Society and the Paddington Workers Club—he held court. Some people compared this location to his Senate office, which was fondly remembered as a meeting place where local community groups, families, trade unionists and passers-by gathered to meet with their senator and his devoted staff, have a cup of tea and talk about what was really going on in the world.
George was not a comfortable companion. When you were engaged in a conversation, there was always a purpose: something was needed, George thought that you could do something about it and he was going to make you take action. In the conversations about the Senate, he advised me to get involved in committees—particularly the public accounts committee, because `that was where you found out where the dollars were and how it all works'. His key advice to me was to remain true to myself and my beliefs and to `remember where you came from'. All the media comments—and I know George would be thoroughly enjoying all the media comments and all the eulogies about him at the moment—now note his many campaigns, his left-wing credentials and indeed the fights that he was involved in, and note that he was true to himself and his beliefs.
Many people have been influenced by George—and I know Senator Jan McLucas will be talking about George at another time—his strength, his amazing sense of humour, his love of his union, the Transport Workers Union, and his passion for the rights of workers. This was evidenced in his activities in developing the Workers Cooperative Society and the Paddington Workers Club, where workers and their families could gather, enjoy good food and drink—because George always did—and be engaged in stimulating conversation. We share his passions, and our thoughts are with his family: Gloria and his many family members. He shared a particular relationship with Gloria, which he so beautifully mentioned in his final speech. We have lost George himself, but I know that we have not lost his spirit and hopefully we have not lost his tenacious devotion to ideals and the willingness to take up his fight. We miss you, George, but you are still with us.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-09-24,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002
Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend Schedules 3 and 5 to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 (the Act) to insert maximum capital grant funding amounts for government and non-government schools for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. This amendment is foreshadowed in Note 1 to Schedules 3 and 5 to the Act, which states 'Amounts for 2005, 2006 and 2007 will be inserted by an amending Act'. 
Reasons for Urgency
The Annual Schedule of capital grant recommendations for non-government schools will be submitted by 30 September 2002 for approval by the Minister, and will include recommendations for funding in 2005. While the government sector operates on a different time frame in line with state/territory government processes, it is appropriate to update the amounts for 2005-2007 for the government sector at this time.
Without passage of the Bill there is no authority to commit 2005 funding and approval of all recommended projects with 2005 funding will be delayed until the Bill is passed.
Forward commitment arrangements set out in the Commonwealth Programs for Schools Quadrennial Administrative Guidelines 2001-2004 authorise relevant funding authorities to commit a proportion of capital grant program funding up to two years in advance of the current program year. Education authorities will submit capital grant funding applications in 2002 for capital projects which may extend across the years 2003-2005. This is a long-standing arrangement that provides schools and school system authorities with greater scope to plan capital developments, which typically require extended time frames. 
A large proportion of capital projects submitted for approval in the Annual Schedule of capital grant recommendations for non-government schools in September 2002 will include funding allocation for the 2005 program year. Schools often commence their projects immediately upon approval and schedule construction works during the end of year school holidays. A delay in funding approval could cause delays and disruption to the building plans for these non-government schools, in all states and territories.

—————
DAIRY INDUSTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill would allow the dairy industry, through the Australian Dairy Corporation (ADC), to fund reform of the industry statutory bodies, including the ADC and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation (DRDC), to deliver research and development and other services for the dairy industry. The Bill would also provide dairy farmers with a Dairy Structural Adjustment Program (DSAP) and/or Supplementary Dairy Assistance Measures (SDA) entitlement, access to an exit grant after the cessation of the Dairy Exit Program (DEP) on 30 June 2002, through the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant (FHRG).
Reasons for Urgency
With market milk deregulation completed, the dairy industry is now considering the services required in a deregulated environment and the most appropriate structure for the delivery of those services.
With deregulation farmers have seen a major change in their market environment, and significant competition and rationalisation at the processor level is occurring. Many farmers have seen a reduction in their income following deregulation and it is therefore imperative that services to farmers and other industry participants are delivered efficiently. It also important that industry services and the associated service delivery body be tailored to the new environment.
As with other industries, the dairy industry is also seeking a greater role in taking responsibility for how industry levies are used.
Industry has indicated that they would like the new service delivery body to be in place by 1 July 2003. To meet this deadline, industry will need to conclude their investigations as soon as possible. Removing impediments to funding the process through the statutory levy stream will allow industry to focus on the important issues of services and structure and thereby ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new arrangements.
The Government's policy is, generally, for industry to meet all statutory reform costs. The intended approach is directly consistent with that used in the reform of wool industry service structures over recent years.
With the cessation of the DEP on 30 June 2002 dairy farmers with a DSAP and /or SDA entitlement are excluded from any exit assistance program. Currently all farmers, with the exception of the affected dairy farmers, are eligible for a FHRG. These amendments will remove this inequitable situation by allowing affected DSAP and/or SDA entitlement holders access to the FHRG.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-09-24,"—On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, I table the 11th annual statement to parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program, together with a document entitled Australian aid: investing in growth, stability and prosperity.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-09-24,"—by leave—The Senate will be aware from the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Australia's Development Cooperation Program that, when we came to government in 1996, Minister Downer commissioned a major study on Australia's aid program. The outcome of this inquiry by Mr Simons, the former chief executive of Woolworths, was titled Better aid for a better future. It identified the theme of Australia's aid program, which has maintained the same clear and single focus, and that is to advance Australia's interests by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. 
I note in the minister's statement the 1999 OECD Development Assistance Committee finding that Australia's Development Cooperation Program has `gone through an impressive process of restructuring and renewal', with Australia `in the vanguard'. That commitment to adjustment and improvement continues. The Australian electorate wants this assistance to be given. Australians feel that a fair go should be given to less fortunate nations. However, we do expect to get fair value and not see our assistance dollar wasted or stolen. The legitimacy of assistance programs must always be a priority for any prudent provider of development assistance.
Zimbabwe is in the news today. When I was an observer at the June 2000 election I sought out our aid projects, which understandably revolved around health and literacy. Getting legitimate and effective programs in Zimbabwe was not made difficult because there was not a wide variety of need but was to do with running the help programs properly. I think that taxpayers would be pleased to know that we try not to spend aid dollars unless we are sure of the outcome and unless we believe that we are getting value for money for the Australian taxpayer.
In the main, our aid program focuses on the Asia-Pacific. It clearly prioritises Australia's strong engagement in our region and our commitment to working in partnership with our immediate neighbours. The challenges are considerable. The Asia-Pacific region has the world's highest concentration of people living in real poverty—which I find quite amazing. Over 800 million people survive on less than $1 a day in our near region. Papua New Guinea, the Pacific Island countries and the poorest regions of East Asia are where we are most active, but the program also responds selectively to development needs in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
The fostering of economic development in our region encourages stability, obviously, and expands trade and investment opportunities for Australia. Our aid program is all part of the good fabric of globalisation. Increased trade equals rising standards of living. This promotion of sustainable development clearly addresses issues of direct interest to Australia, including HIV-AIDS, illegal migration, global environmental problems and drug trafficking. Our aid program will remain vital in Australia's desire to be further integrated in our region. Specific examples of the program's contribution include capacity building for improved economic governance following the Asian financial crisis in 1999 and 2000, assisting in the recovery and restructuring of East Timor and the Solomon Islands and a number of other important areas. As the minister points out, our aid program defines key principles and priority sectors that are crucial to the aim of alleviating poverty and achieving sustainable development. I endorse his statement, and I wish those who run our aid projects in AusAID and through our very considerable assistance provided to Australian based NGOs the very best of luck in carrying forward their many worthwhile projects.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-09-24,"—by leave—I want to make some brief remarks in relation to this report on the Australian government's overseas aid program, entitled Australian aid: investing in growth, stability and prosperity. The Australian Democrats welcome the government's focus on poverty reduction as the ongoing aim of our overseas aid program. We know that Australia's focus in this regard is consistent with our commitment in 2000 under the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, especially our commitment to the UN to work with the international community to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger and extreme poverty by 2015. We also welcome the government's emphasis in this new policy document on engaging with civil society groups and, more particularly, with NGOs, even though there are qualifications in this regard. I will refer to them shortly. 
Where the Australian Democrats have serious concerns is in relation to the obvious shift in this new policy approach to a reliance upon economic growth and good governance to drive development and reduce poverty. Economic growth alone is insufficient. You need a range of measures to overcome the circumstances of poverty. The examples cited by the government today of countries who have succeeded as a result in part of aid programs include China, Vietnam, and Korea. Some of them were opened to trade, others established strong protectionist measures to foster their fledgling industries that are now international powerhouses, but few have a human rights record that can stand up to international scrutiny. In other words, it is highly misleading and, indeed, simplistic to credit the principles of good governance and economic growth as the two measures that reduced poverty in these countries and helped to establish them as international economic successes.
On a first reading of this document this afternoon, I have not seen any mention of the integral role that human rights and the rule of law have to play in achieving real and sustainable development, the reduction of poverty and, more particularly, the reduction of suffering. This glaring oversight in policy terms is of great concern, especially in light of the situation facing the international community at the moment. In my view, Australia does have a responsibility, now more than ever, to affirm the principles of human rights and international law rather than to ignore them. 
Another serious oversight in this document is the absence of Africa. Enormous poverty and development challenges face Africa, especially in the fight against HIV-AIDS. Whilst we understand the rationale and logic behind Australia focusing this budget on our immediate region—the Asia-Pacific region—we are also conscious of the decline in real terms of Australia's aid to Africa under the Howard government. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid, for example, estimates that it has fallen by 40 per cent over the last 10 years. The Australian Democrats would therefore encourage the government to rethink this element of its policy with a view to at least maintaining our aid level to Africa.
In short, the Democrats are concerned that this new policy is high on rhetoric but low on real measures to meet problems confronting our region and the world's poor. Aid should be 0.7 per cent of gross national product, as recommended by the United Nations. For over two decades the Democrats have been consistent in our approach to overseas aid. One of the central tenets of Democrat policy is the need for Australia to meet the target set by the UN in 1969 to provide 0.7 per cent of GNP for international aid programs. In light of this longstanding target, the Australian Democrats again call on the government to deliver a major increase in Australia's overseas aid commitments, not reductions. We acknowledge that, sadly, the 1997 Simons report, One clear objective, took a completely pragmatic approach to abandoning the UN 0.7 per cent target. This position was forced upon Simons as successive Australian governments have politically committed to meeting the target but, in practice, have justified their failure to meet the target on budgetary grounds. The line, as usual, is: as and when budgetary circumstances permit'. In my view, that has lost credibility. While it continues to be used, Australia continues to diminish its real GNP contribution to overseas development assistance.
In 1972 Australia was delivering 0.48 per cent of GNP in overseas development assistance. This percentage has been steadily declining over the past 30 years. In real dollar terms in 2002, Australia has only increased its overseas aid contribution by about $400 million over the past 30 years. During this period the Australian economy has been growing at an average annual rate of 3.2 per cent. In 1972 Australia's GNP was $270 billion; in 2002 it was approximately $695 billion. Today, Australia's aid budget is the lowest it has been in 30 years at only 0.25 per cent of GDP.
Australia should begin increasing our overseas aid commitment now in order that, through yearly incremental increases, the 0.7 per cent target is met by 2010. The nations of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden have already met and exceeded the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Whilst Belgium, Switzerland, France, Finland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany have not reached this target, they remain well ahead of Australia in their progress. In short, it simply means that Australia's performance in regard to meeting our commitment to the UN target is not something that we as a nation can be proud of. 
It seems to me that aid must be delivered to the poorest and is best delivered through non-government organisations rather than through bilateral agreements and other governmental forms of deliverance. The Australian Democrats welcome the commitment by the government today to channel our assistance directly to community organisations, non-government organisations and other civil society groups but note that this should be happening as a matter of course—not just when government systems are failing, as the new policy provides. Aid is a vehicle through poverty reduction for the easing of tensions, which can lead to regional tensions. 
The Australian Democrats welcome the emphasis in this new policy approach on the need to focus on humanitarian assistance that directly targets the poor and reduces their vulnerability by targeting essential services like health and education. We also recognise that this approach is critical if Australia is to honour commitments made under the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015, which include halving global poverty by 2015, achieving universal primary education, reducing child mortality by two-thirds, reversing the spread of HIV-AIDS, and being able to integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and reverse the loss of environmental resources. But to achieve these goals the United Nations and the World Bank estimate that we need to increase global aid by $70 billion per year until 2015. This of course will require Australia's contribution to that target to increase proportionately—but we are clearly failing in this regard and, indeed, as I mentioned earlier, we are going backwards.
What commitment will Australia make to additional resources to achieve the millennium goals? In light of our commitments to those goals, the Democrats also question whether the government has the right policy focus. The goals would require greater emphasis on poverty reduction programs rather than on good governance. On the issue of good governance, and having raised this question of the balance between a policy focused on poverty reduction and the pursuit of good governance, the Democrats recognise the need for Australia to engage governments on good governance and furthering the goal of civil society.
We have serious reservations about the sincerity of this commitment, given our recent practice of placing asylum seekers in neighbouring Pacific countries like Nauru and PNG in order to deal with our own immigration concerns. For example, how can we expect our Pacific island neighbours to improve their record on good governance when, in the case of Nauru, we increased our aid budget by 195 per cent in the last year and effectively bribed this country to take asylum seekers off our hands? How is this practice promoting human rights, the principle of good governance or affirming the sincerity of our country's commitment to capacity building and poverty reduction in our own region? We run the risk of being accused of `taking a hectoring approach' or `behaving like a colonial power' that has one set of rules for itself and another for its neighbours—precisely what Minister Downer said that he wants to avoid. If Australia's ultimate goal is to be a responsible aid donor, we need to ensure that the recipient country upholds international standards for human rights protections and the rule of law in its definition of `good governance'. It is not enough to just focus on programs that deliver stronger police forces if the recipient country does not enshrine fundamental human rights protections and safeguards in its legal and judicial system.
I think the recent experience of East Timor one year on from independence is a perfect case in point. We have a new nation that is urgently trying to focus on building an effective legal and judicial system after decades of foreign occupation and, more recently, gross violations of human rights. Billions of dollars are needed to rebuild East Timor's devastated infrastructure, but I believe there must also be a determined effort to put in place the kinds of legal and human rights protections that East Timor badly needs. The international community has an obligation to help, and I acknowledge that Australia has been particularly active and responsive in this regard. In particular, we have given considerable practical and professional assistance to put in place a fully functioning and independent judiciary to curb corruption, establish East Timorese confidence in civil institutions and attract foreign investment. 
But, on the other hand, I think we do have a responsibility to support the calls from the East Timorese people to establish an international tribunal for East Timor to bring the perpetrators of serious crimes against humanity in East Timor to justice. Only last month we saw the acquittal of six members of Indonesia's security forces on charges arising from the massacre of three East Timorese priests and scores of civilians in 1999, as a result of a decision by the Indonesian ad hoc human rights court. This was a decision that received condemnation from the East Timorese people, along with the then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. If Australia is serious about its commitment to promoting and upholding the principles of good governance and the rule of law in our region through our overseas aid program, it must also be prepared to do so in our foreign affairs policy. There has to be consistency in approach across all portfolio areas if we hope to lead by example in the Asia-Pacific region.
In concluding, I want to note that the Democrats reserve the right to elaborate further on our initial remarks in response to this policy document. We have had only a matter of a couple of hours to skim the document, and I realise that a more considered response is required, as well as discussions with organisations and individuals who have expertise in the portfolio area. But I am concerned that the report does little to reassure the Australian Democrats or, for that matter, the Australian people that the government is serious about us carrying our own fair share of responsibility in relation to nations that are not as affluent as our own.
We are concerned that there is no consistency in approach across the range of portfolios, particularly in relation to our immigration policy and how it works in conjunction with our overseas aid policy in the Pacific. We are also concerned about Australia's ability to contribute our fair share to the achievement of the UN millenium goals. We can only hope that we do not decide to abandon these goals, as we did in relation to the UN aid target that was set in 1969.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-09-24,"—This report entitled The Australian meat industry consultative structure and quota allocation: US beef quota allocation has the support of all members of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, as I understand it. It is an all-party report, based on evidence, both oral and written, from a wide cross-section of the beef industry. Its unanimous conclusions reflect an open and comprehensive inquiry that received evidence of broad industry support for a global model. 
The committee received a significant number of written submissions, took evidence from 34 witnesses and generated about 150 pages of Hansard transcript. It was clear from the evidence presented to the committee that the industry itself is tired of division on the question of quota allocation and wants a model adopted that will enhance Australia's overall export effort. Companies were happy to provide the committee with considerable details about their individual export effort to enable us to gain an understanding of the impact of the various quota allocation proposals.
I have no doubt that I speak on behalf of the chair, Senator Heffernan, and my fellow committee members when I say that we appreciated the time and effort many processors devoted to assisting the inquiry. I must place on record my thanks to Robina Jaffray, Trish Carling, Lyn Fairweather and Shirani Visvanathan from the committee secretariat. As usual, we demanded a lot of them, and they delivered. I also place on record my admiration for the manner in which my fellow senators went to work on this issue.
The report recommends the adoption of a global allocation model based on the performance of companies in the previous 12-month period. The model proposes a quota allocation every four months—on 1 November, 1 March and 1 July of each quota year. As a transitional arrangement, it is proposed that the initial specialist allocation for 2003 be based on quota year 2001, an arrangement that takes into account the difficulties faced by many processors in 2002. Certainly that is only the case for what I might call the US specialists. Beyond these transitional arrangements, the model proposes a quota allocation based on export performance in the preceding 12-month period.
In the view of the committee, this approach picks up the real-time benefits of the model proposed by Australian Meat Holdings but over a longer time frame. In addition to the difficulties faced by many companies this year, the committee also recognises the challenges a global allocation model will pose for US dependent processors. On this matter, the committee noted, in particular, evidence from processors like Mr Peter Greenham. We have therefore recommended that, in the 2003 quota year, companies that were more than 70 per cent reliant on the US market in 2001 be allocated the equivalent of their total 2002 quota allocation—that was the reference I made to 2001 earlier.
The second phase of the transition for US dependent companies will provide those companies that are 70 per cent reliant on the United States in 2003 with 85 per cent of their 2003 performance in 2004. I know that sounds rather complex, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I can assure you that it does make sense. When you have a look at it, it is simpler than it might seem.
The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has no choice but to immediately adopt what I will describe as the Heffernan model—Senator Heffernan being the chair of the committee making this proposal. The appointment of a panel to advise Mr Truss on the quota was little more than an attempt by the minister to deflect some of the political pressure to which he was subjected. That is not a criticism of the members of the panel, because they are clearly competent people serving at the minister's request.
The problems Mr Truss has faced in relation to the management of the US beef quota have been very much of his own making. It is difficult to imagine how Mr Truss's panel could have formed a different view from that of the committee if it had had the opportunity to undertake the same exhaustive and transparent consultative process. I understand that the panel has been asked to report back to the minister with its recommendations regarding quota arrangements on 1 October. That is just 31 days before the commencement of the new quota year on 1 November.
Mr Sutton, AFFA's general manager of the Meat, Wool and Dairy Branch, told the committee that the panel was still working on the allocation of discretionary quota for 2002 as at 19 August. Advice to applicants on that discretionary quota allocation—an allocation for the current year—was posted on 23 August. It is with some alarm that I note that, based on evidence from AFFA, the panel allowed just eight weeks to determine how billions of dollars worth of quota entitlement should be allocated next year. 
There have been some strong signals coming from Mr Truss and his department that he wants minimal change to the current arrangements for the 2003 quota year. That has more to do with administrative convenience for Mr Truss than with good public policy and good outcomes for a multibillion dollar industry that sustains thousands of regional jobs. It also reflects the impossible time frame given to the panel to consider this matter.
I asked most of the witnesses that came before the committee whether they would accept the extension of Mr Truss's model into 2003. I can tell the Senate that support for that model was extremely limited and heavily qualified. In fact, the vast majority of witnesses opposed the model. The Australian Meat Council described it as unfair. The AMC said that the situation in 2002 bordered on chaos. Mr Paul Troja from Rockdale Beef told the committee:
If the government decided to maintain the present arrangements, I believe you would see a lot of export establishments, who are holding on desperately, go broke.
He said:
I think the Truss model was a disaster and is a disaster to our industry.
The Northern Cooperative Meat Company was happy for the Truss model to carry through to 2003 but only after a substantial variation to the manner in which it was calculated—that is, a radical change to the basis on which the quota was allocated. Mr Kennedy from Kilcoy Pastoral Company told the committee:
Our company would have to give very serious consideration to closing down and winding up if that program were continued next year without significant discretionary assistance.
And the Stanbroke Pastoral Company—the world's largest cattle producer—said that it did not support the Truss model.
The minister's department was able to provide the committee with a considerable amount of data in a timely fashion. The committee appreciates that support. The department did express some concern about a model that allocated quota on a quarterly basis. The committee noted that concern and has provided for a four-month cycle. During the hearings a director of the Australian Meat Council, Mr Carl, told the committee:
We need a sure scheme in place so that people know what they are working towards.
This was a key issue for the committee and ought to be a key issue for the minister. Unfortunately, Mr Truss has again run himself very short of time in addressing quota arrangements. One would have thought that he might have learnt from last year's fiasco, but it appears not.
The basis of the Heffernan model—as I describe it—outlined in the committee report, has widespread industry support. Obviously, the industry will look at the variations that the committee has put down, and I believe that there will be widespread support for it as varied. It has, as I said earlier, unanimous support from the Labor, Liberal and Democrat senators who formed the committee. It deserves support from everyone concerned about a vibrant, export focused beef industry and a good return to the Australian economy.
I hope this is not the case, but, if Mr Truss chooses to ignore the Heffernan model, he ignores the considered views of an all-party Senate committee that happened to be dominated by members of his own government. More importantly, he will ignore the desire of the beef industry for some long overdue certainty on quota allocation. On these two counts, the minister will ignore the committee's recommendations at his own peril.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,14,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2002-09-24,"—I must say at the outset that the difficulty of moving from what essentially has been a completely deregulated industry to one that is regulated is demonstrated in both the evidence and the deliberations of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee in its inquiry and report on US beef quota allocation. Remember, the main reason we are essentially considering this situation is the downturn in the Japanese market over the last 12 months and the desire of those servicing that market to move into the US market. 
With respect to a quote that Senator O'Brien has just referred to from one of the witnesses, the Australian Lot Feeders Association noted that the current system took away the ability of a lot of those who were having great problems in servicing the Asian markets to move into the US market and was historically different from what was the case. Essentially, we had in this circumstance a large group of industry players who were looking to move from a market that had collapsed and to take a slice of a market that was being serviced by other industry players. I would have to say that throughout this entire process I have been extremely disappointed in the industry itself. It appears that it has been largely driven by self-interest rather than by industry interest. The difficulty of the RMAC group in coming up with a proposal in the initial circumstance clearly demonstrates that.
The thing that this report brings with it, though, is that it largely has the support of the majority of the industry, and more particularly those who are not focused on the US market. Importantly, the changes made to what started as the AMH model—which I think was largely grasped at by industry players in an effort to get a global model— cater to those who have historically, since 1994, built markets specifically into the US. A key issue for members of the committee was to ensure that those who had, through essentially a free market, made a choice to work in the US market did not have their businesses jeopardised by any changes to this system, and that was one of the imperatives put forward by Minister Truss in his initial proposal.
A concern that remains with some members of the committee is that the model in the report will result in significant handouts of rental from the US market being diverted to those who have not traditionally worked in that market and will potentially develop a paper trade in quota. There are some in the industry who believe that is a good thing. I am not of that view, but the committee also has recommendations in place to restrict this, for which I am very grateful. I will be very interested to see the impact of this system in 18 months time, once it has bedded down and we review it a little further.
The AMH model in its raw state left out several sectors of the industry such as the branded beef specialists and, again, I mention the transitional arrangements put in place for the US specialists. There is also the modification to the allocation of tranches to flatten out the seasonal variations that would have existed under the original AMH model that was proposed to be put together on a quarterly allocation basis.
As I said at the outset, this would have to be one of the most difficult industries I have been involved with. It is a significant industry for Australia, as Senator O'Brien said. I just hope that we are not back here in a short period of time, having to reconsider this particular issue in the event that what we are proposing does not work.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2002-09-24,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 seek to amend the Workplace Relations Act, and I particularly want to focus my remarks on what has been named the genuine bargaining bill. Mr Tanner in the other place described the title of the bill as `Orwellian', because it really is not a bill about genuine bargaining. Rather, it is properly construed as a bill designed to weight aspects of this legislation, and the system of enterprise bargaining which is underpinned by this legislation, against workers and their unions. This bill reflects the government's aversion to the role of the Industrial Relations Commission as the independent umpire and a desire to create a system that advantages one side of the employment relationship over the other. It is not a bill that seeks to encourage genuine bargaining.
This government is not interested in genuine bargaining. If it were, it would have supported the amendments moved by the opposition in the other place which sought to include provisions ensuring that the parties in the bargaining process bargained in good faith. Surely this is not a radical concept. If this government were genuinely interested in enterprise bargaining and ensuring effective outcomes, surely it would support Labor's amendments seeking to ensure that the parties to the employment relationship bargain in good faith. If it were interested in effective outcomes, it would do this. However, it is more interested in a take it or leave it approach to enterprise bargaining. It should be noted that there is currently nothing in the substantive legislation which requires parties to act in good faith through the bargaining process. There is nothing in the current act, nor in either of the bills proposed, to prevent an employer from simply refusing to meet and confer with a union or consider and respond to that union's proposals, regardless of whether or not those proposals may have merit. Even if the employer does this, under this legislation it is still incumbent upon the union to demonstrate that it is genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the other negotiating parties. There is nothing in the current act which requires the employer or the union to negotiate in good faith, nor does the current act require the employer to even meet with the union. It appears that the government's view of this approach to bargaining is that this arrangement is fair enough.
It is against this legislative backdrop that the government seeks to impose further handicaps upon workers and their unions in the bargaining process. We should be clear about what precisely the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 aims to do. As honourable senators would be aware, the act sets out a process whereby the industrial parties may take protected action during a bargaining period. Under the terms of the act, it is only during the period of bargaining, as defined by the legislation, that the industrial parties—particularly trade unions—are protected from sanctions, both in the common law and under the act, for any action taken. If the bargaining period is terminated or suspended, that protection is removed. With this legislation, the government is seeking to make it easier for the bargaining period to be terminated or suspended—that is, to make it easier for unions, in particular, to be subject to legal sanctions in relation to any action that may be taken. It can be properly construed as an increased fetter on the rights of workers and their unions to take action in the context of enterprise bargaining which is allowed by the current legislation. 
It is not unusual for enterprise bargaining to involve a common claim, at least as a starting process, or for common aspects to exist between different claims against different employers. As someone who has been an official with two unions—initially with the CFMEU and later, as a legal officer, with the LHMU—I can say that many of the agreements that were negotiated whilst I was an official with those unions included aspects of commonality, particularly at the commencement of the claim. To varying extents, the agreements that those unions—and other unions in various industries—negotiated involved substantial productivity improvements. A great many enterprise agreements include innovative work practices which have been negotiated at the workplace between workers, their union representatives and the employer. It is not uncommon practice, as a matter of industrial relations in many industries, for agreements to be commenced with a common claim or for aspects of claims served on employers to contain common clauses. This is not an unusual state of affairs and, despite the government's protestations to the contrary, it does not lead to industrial anarchy. Often it is simply a matter of practicality or what is appropriate in the circumstances. We are often talking about the commencement of negotiations with a common demand or at least a minimum set of demands which might be included in a number of claims. An example would be something like paid maternity leave, where unions may agree on a common claim or a clause that is proposed for inclusion in enterprise agreements that would be common across a number of industries in relation to a number of employers.
That is the industrial backdrop against which this proposal operates. What, in fact, is the government proposing? This is a set of amendments designed to prevent common demands. It is a set of amendments seeking to impose a legislative presumption as to one party not genuinely trying to reach agreement with the other. The effect of that presumption would be to facilitate the suspension or termination of a bargaining period. That is the stick the government seeks to put in the legislation to use against workers and their unions. These amendments seek to force the commission's hand. The commission already has powers to suspend or terminate a bargaining period. Here we have a specific set of circumstances which the government proposes to put in the legislation regarding bargaining—clearly, on the face of it, directed at unions—which would enable an employer to seek the suspension or termination of a bargaining period to their negotiating advantage. Why is this legislation needed? It is not. It is not justified in terms of the industrial practice—a practice that is engaged in by both employers and unions— of putting common claims on one another. It is also not required as a matter of law. It is already within the commission's powers under the existing legislation to suspend or terminate a bargaining period. That is a general discretion which is not fettered in a partisan way as is currently proposed in the bill.
The discretion which is currently in the legislation enables the commission to consider the totality of the facts before the commission in any application to suspend or terminate a bargaining period. One would have thought that this is a sensible legislative approach because it enables the commission to consider the multiplicity of the factual circumstances of the various disputes with which it deals. There is something to be said for a general discretion being vested in the commission to consider all these facts. In the absence of some pressing public policy concern or evidence of that discretion being exercised improperly, surely it is better to allow the commission to consider all the facts before it to reach a conclusion. However, that is not the approach that this government is taking. It is attempting to beat up what it says is a deficiency in the legislation. When one examines the proposal closely one can see that this is a beat-up and there is very little factual material which would support the government's suggestion that there is a deficiency in the legislation. 
A number of honourable senators have mentioned the decision by Justice Munro in the metals case, which has been asserted as support for the government's legislation. I make a number of points about that case. As the Senate would be aware, that case did deal with an application to terminate bargaining periods under the existing legislation, and the commission did in fact move to terminate a number of bargaining periods on the basis— amongst other things—that the parties were not genuinely trying to reach agreement with a specific employer. One would have thought that that outcome itself puts paid to the government's argument that the legislation is deficient. Justice Munro did, however, find that pursuing an industry-wide campaign was not itself evidence of a failure to try and reach agreement at the enterprise level, so long as the union was prepared to negotiate with individual employers. His Honour also commented on the fact that employers engage in `pattern bargaining', which is the phrase used by the minister who sponsors this bill. Justice Munro made the following comment:
It appears that some of the more loudly voiced and caustic criticisms of pattern bargaining as practised by the unions are muted or tolerant of corporate practices intended to achieve similar uniformities of negotiating outcomes across different workplaces. 
In other words, there are those in this government who criticise unions for seeking to progress industry-wide claims, but when there is a similar set of common demands or a common position is taken by an employer group—as has been documented in the metals case and in others—those criticisms are somewhat more muted. One would note that the legislation as it is currently drafted has unions specifically in mind.
As I said earlier, in the metals case the bargaining periods were terminated under the existing legislation. The comment was made by His Honour that advancement of claims in a way that denied individual negotiating parties the opportunity to concede, or modify by agreement, did not meet the test of genuinely trying to reach agreement. In other words, the existing legislation was not deficient in relation to the issue of pattern bargaining. The industrial context against which this bill is introduced was discussed at some length in the metals case. It was recognised by the commission that common claims and outcomes do have a place in Australia's industrial relations system and are pursued by employers as well as unions. One wonders why there is, despite this fact, a beat-up by this government about this legislation. One can only assume that there are some particularly political objectives that this government is pursuing.
This bill is not about genuine bargaining. It is a bill clearly aimed to weight rules which currently govern bargaining against unions. It seeks to diminish the powers of workers and their unions to bargain. What is the ultimate objective? It is bargaining Reith and Abbott style. As has been commented on in another speech, it is an approach to bargaining which is, `Please, Sir, can I have some more?' This framework reduces the negotiating position of workers and their unions. It seems odd that a government which professes to be supportive of genuine bargaining has refused in the other place— and presumably will refuse in this place—to support the notion of bargaining in good faith. One would have thought that this was a minimum standard of behaviour between the industrial parties, one which it is appropriate that the parliament seeks to facilitate amongst the industrial parties.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. I do so in the knowledge that this is the third time the government has attempted to introduce legislation with the aims of preventing so-called pattern bargaining and introducing cooling-off periods. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 is less prescriptive than its predecessors that were rejected by the Senate in 1999 and 2000. The earlier bills obliged the commission to suspend or terminate a bargaining period if certain conditions existed. This bill leaves intact the commission's discretion but provides guidance as to how this discretion should be exercised. This bill does not refer to pattern bargaining as such. Instead, it directs the commission's attention to what the government perceives as the objectionable features of pattern bargaining. While the bill refers to genuine bargaining, nothing in this bill seeks to facilitate genuine bargaining. The government has tried to portray this bill as moderate. However, like its predecessors, the bill is narrowly focused on reducing the right to take protected industrial action and on suspending or terminating the bargaining process. This bill is not a genuine attempt to enhance the bargaining process. Rather, it interferes with the discretion of the commission to deal with industrial disputes in the most appropriate way. 
I wish to briefly mention enterprise bargaining and Labor's support for the development of enterprise negotiations. The Labor Party has not only supported but has initiated changes to industrial relations law in this country—changes that have increased productivity in Australia. I also wish to mention the role that workers and their elected representatives, the unions, have played in increasing the productivity of industry in Australia. Workers and their representative unions have played a vital role in changes that have occurred in Australian industrial relations law. It is unreasonable, to say the least, that this government refuses to acknowledge the enormous contribution that Australian workers and their unions have made to the productivity of this nation.
This bill represents a watered down version of previous bills. Presently the commission has a general discretion to suspend or terminate a bargaining period if it is satisfied that an organisation taking industrial action is not genuinely attempting to reach an agreement with the other party. This legislation will require the commission to consider, among other things, whether the organisation's conduct evidences an intention to reach an agreement with other parties in the industry. The bill specifies that such an intention would indicate that the organisation is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement with other negotiating parties. Under existing law, a party initiating a bargaining period can terminate the bargaining period if it gives notice to the other negotiating parties that it no longer wants to reach an agreement. This bill will give the commission a discretion to order that the party who terminates the bargaining period may not initiate a new bargaining period in relation to the matters dealt with under the proposed agreement, or may only initiate a new bargaining period on certain conditions.
Proposed section 170MW(2A) of the bill purports to provide guidance to the commission on matters that would tend to indicate whether a party to enterprise bargaining negotiations is genuinely seeking to reach agreement. The explanatory memorandum of the bill refers to a significant decision of Justice Munro in the metals case in 2000. However, a close reading of Justice Munro's decision in this case makes it clear that the commission does not require guidance in this area. Justice Munro was clearly able to articulate what he regarded as factors that indicate whether a party was genuinely negotiating. In the metals case, Justice Munro used the existing section 170MW(1) to terminate a bargaining period of 33 employees because he was not satisfied that there was good faith bargaining. It is worth referring to the key finding of Justice Munro. He said:
Does it follow that, if in truth the respondent negotiator is trying to secure agreement with all, or an entire class of negotiating parties in an industry—all or none—the respondent negotiating party is not genuinely trying to reach agreement with any individual negotiating party in the industry or class? In my view, it does. But in a particular case, a finding to that effect is dependent upon matters of fact and degree.
In other words, Justice Munro made it clear that there is no black-and-white prescription as this legislation is attempting to impose. In explaining what he meant by `fact and degree', Justice Munro said: 
Such questions of fact and degree obviously need to be answered by reference to evidence and details of particular facts. The more the negotiation conduct can be categorised as evidencing a refusal to allow agreement other than on an all or none basis, the greater the likelihood that it should be found to fail the `genuinely try to reach agreement with the other negotiator'test. However, there are variations and permutation of demands, conduct, and character of negotiating parties that must be assessed. 
Justice Munro approached the matter in a pragmatic and sensible way, by looking at what was actually occurring without making any ideological assumptions. The commission did not need to be directed to work out whether the parties in this case were negotiating in a genuine way. It is appropriate and sufficient, in the Labor Party's view, for a reference to the decision of Justice Munro to be inserted in section 170MW of the act. This is the effect of the opposition's amendments, in the proposed section 170MKA.
As I said earlier, the government has removed any reference in this bill to pattern bargaining, yet under this legislation the commission is required to determine that if commonality of bargaining is occurring this cannot be genuine bargaining. This reflects a fundamentally flawed assumption. There are many examples where common agreements are reached throughout an industry, for example in the retail industry. These agreements not only have excellent results for workers and employers alike but also are conducted in good faith. The Labor Party wants to create this culture of good faith industrial negotiations, and that is why the member for Barton moved amendments to the legislation in the other place to create `bargaining in good faith' provisions.
In the metals case, Justice Munro made it clear that such commonality of bargaining is a well-established practice. He said:
A common set of demands for conditions of employment, or for timing of negotiating rounds and outcomes is not sufficient in itself to establish that a negotiating party is not genuinely trying to reach agreement with the counterpart party. I do not use the expression `pattern' to describe such demands. The notion of pattern demands or pattern bargaining lacks precision. It also has a partisan pejorative content.
Justice Munro rightly recognised that the industrial strategy of pursuing common outcomes across workplaces is practised as much by employer negotiators as those of employees. As my colleague Senator Sherry observed, the Commonwealth government itself often engages in such an industrial strategy. I have indicated that this bill ignores basic industrial relations realities in this country.
As my colleague Senator Hogg said, in the retail industry it is not uncommon for a letter of demand and a log of claims to be served on thousands of employers at one time. In its submission to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association outlined how this legislation would severely hinder genuine enterprise negotiations. In July 1998, the SDA served letters of demand and logs of claims on approximately 35,000 employers as part of a campaign to improve the wages and conditions of employees. The mere service of the letters of demand and logs of claims on more than one employer would be interpreted by the commission, should this bill be successful, as pattern bargaining. This is simply because the union has initiated a course of conduct in which common claims for improved wages and conditions of employment are sought from more than a single employer.
Unions such as the SDA have been at the forefront of seeking to make workplaces more family friendly by negotiating such matters as parental leave for casuals and improved maternity leave provisions. A number of employers in the retail industry have been prepared to agree to such matters. The making of these types of claims when seeking enterprise agreements with more than one employer displays a course of conduct in negotiations that extends beyond a single business. Notwithstanding the obvious social benefits of these claims and the desire of workers to have these claims made on their behalf, it is clear that, should this bill be enacted, the commission would find such conduct to be contrary to law. The passage of this bill would make enterprise negotiations in a wide range of industries both more difficult and cumbersome. Even where claims are socially desirable and economically reasonable, they could fall foul of the provisions of this act. 
The Labor Party is committed to creating an environment of good faith bargaining. As Senator Sherry noted, a number of the factors contained in proposed section 170MW(2A) do reflect the principles of good faith bargaining. Yet, under this bill, such factors only apply if and when an application has been made to the commission to suspend a bargaining period in order to curtail or prevent industrial action. The effect of this would be that, in practice, such a requirement for good faith bargaining would apply only to unions and only in cases where the union was considering or taking protected action.
Labor's amendments to this bill seek to restore the commission's power to order all parties to bargain in good faith. These amendments will re-empower the commission to direct parties to negotiate in good faith and to reach agreement before industrial disputation occurs. Good faith bargaining encompasses a range of procedural requirements, including that the parties meet face to face, attend organised meetings, comply with agreed negotiating procedures, disclose relevant information, state their position on various matters, consider and respond to proposals, and adhere to commitments made. These are all reflected in the amendments proposed by the opposition.
The duty to bargain in good faith is a duty that is shared by all parties and is a duty that focuses on developing a relationship between employers and unions which is based on trust and confidence. These are not unreasonable requirements. They are requirements that parties to any corporate takeover negotiation would expect. The government would be happy to support companies to negotiate in good faith, yet they will not support Australian workers and their elected representatives having the same right to negotiate in good faith with their employers. The previous Labor government introduced the requirement for parties to bargain in good faith in 1993. This requirement was repealed by the coalition government upon taking office in 1996. Both Western Australia and New Zealand have introduced good faith bargaining laws and such provisions also exist in New South Wales and Queensland legislation.
In the time remaining, I wish briefly to address proposed section 170MWB, which provides for cooling-off periods. The introduction of cooling-off periods in this legislation is designed to lessen industrial stoppages, which in itself is a laudable objective. Enterprise outcomes without stoppages are what all parties should be attempting to achieve. But, instead of encouraging the commission to bring the parties to the negotiating table and forcing a resolution, this legislation has the effect of encouraging the commission to walk away from difficult disputes. The difficulty here is that simply directing a cooling-off period without any requirement being imposed on the parties during that cooling-off period as to how to conduct themselves during that time will have limited effect. Instead of directing the commission to introduce cooling-off periods, the government should be strengthening the role of the commission so that it gets involved earlier on in the process so as to ensure that the bargaining process is conducted in good faith and industrial stoppages are avoided. This provision makes clear the government's intention to promote measures that will continue to erode the role of the commission as the independent umpire. This will have the effect of hindering the fair and efficient settlement of industrial disputes in this country.
In conclusion, the government is attempting to introduce legislation for the third time that seeks only to undermine good faith enterprise negotiations. The government has not made any significant modifications to its two earlier bills. In recycling this legislation, all the government seeks to do is to continue its attack on unions and the people they represent—the working people of Australia. The government does not seek to do anything constructive for enterprise negotiations, it does not seek to do anything for Australian workers and it certainly does not advance genuine bargaining.
This government needs to start listening to the workers of this country and even to the employers, because they will tell you that commonality of bargaining does not necessarily mean that there is an absence of bargaining in good faith. In its amendments, the opposition seeks to empower the commission to invoke its procedures and use its expertise to assist and facilitate the parties in reaching an agreement in respect of the particular enterprise concerned. Clearly, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has this expertise, and it should be recognised as having a legitimate and important role in the enterprise bargaining process. I urge senators to support the opposition's amendments which improve what is otherwise a fundamentally flawed bill.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I rise to talk on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002, which is part of a larger package of antiworker, antiunion bills, in line with this government's passion for the dismantling of Australia's industrial relations system. This particular bill articulates one of this government's major obsessions. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stipulated in his second reading speech, it is designed to ensure that what is often referred to as pattern bargaining is no longer permitted under the Workplace Relations Act. An obsession it definitely is, when you consider that the Senate has already rejected the ideology and intent behind this bill in both 1999 and 2000. Yet, in 2002, the government has chosen to pursue it again, this time disguised as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill.
This year's model is dressed up as a more moderate version of the bills already rejected, but it brings with it the same intent and the same probable outcomes. While the bill in 2000 sought to outlaw union initiated pattern bargaining altogether, this bill does not expressly prohibit that. What it does instead is seek to interpret pattern bargaining as being, prima facie, not genuine bargaining and therefore regard it to be in contravention of the Workplace Relations Act. This bill is simply a different path to achieve the same outcomes as those bills that were initiated in 1999 and 2000. As such, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 should be abandoned on the same basis as those that have been in the past.
This bill, along with those in 1999 and 2000, is unjustified and iniquitous. The words `genuine bargaining' in the title of this bill are nothing more than Orwellian doublespeak. It is a typical ploy of this government to use ambiguous language and euphemisms to disguise its real agenda. This bill is no different. There is nothing in this proposal that promotes genuine bargaining at all, despite its title. In fact, it seeks to stamp out particular kinds of bargaining altogether and to tie the hands of the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, when determining whether or not parties to an industrial negotiation are in fact genuinely bargaining.
This bill, like most workplace relations bills we have seen from this government since it came to office, seeks to tinker with the industrial relations system in a way that stifles collective bargaining and the ability of workers to negotiate pay and working conditions with their employers on some sort of equal footing. This bill seeks to limit the capacity of ordinary workers to seek better standards of living and to share in the benefits delivered by improved productivity over the past two decades by even further tilting the industrial relations power scales in favour of employers and away from ordinary workers and their unions.
This government seeks to abandon any framework for cooperative workplace relations that support fair and effective agreement making in support of the interests of its core constituency: big business employers. We only have to go to the Australian Industry Group, the AIG, to find out why. This is what Roger Boland from the AIG had to say about the state of our industrial relations system in a speech entitled `A critical assessment of progress in enterprise bargaining':
Where employers have adopted a bargaining strategy, in many instances it is driven by an exclusive desire to cut costs rather than pursue innovation. Now that is completely understandable in today's competitive environment. But it is a blinkered approach to achieving competitiveness through workplace change and is creating a backlash amongst workers manifested in intense feelings of job insecurity, disillusionment, lack of trust, “reform fatigue” and a shift to greater militancy. The isolated bargaining approach is leading to competition on the basis of labour exploitation rather than on the basis of innovation and quality of skills. 
With the Australian Industry Group itself recognising that a more decentralised bargaining system is creating a backlash amongst workers, is it any wonder that this government would like to see this bill pass through the parliament to protect big business from a problem of their own making?
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 seeks to prohibit the use of pattern bargaining—a process by which common claims are sought across an array of workplaces within the same industry. It is a bargaining strategy currently utilised by many employers, union members and even the federal government itself. Pattern bargaining has been responsible for the setting of industry-wide standards of occupational health and safety, comparative wage justice, equal pay for men and women, parental leave, the 38-hour week and superannuation. In recent years, industry-wide bargaining has seen the introduction of income protection insurance and improvements to long service leave. Moreover, it sets standards across industries that provide consistency and stability for employers and workers alike on issues such as the use of casual labour, outsourced contracting and redundancy standards. Could this be the reason the government is seeking to forbid it? I suggest it probably is.
This government supports a race to the bottom for wages and conditions and rejects fairness and equity within industry sectors. What is so unreasonable about suggesting that what one group of workers receives in pay and conditions in one workplace should be mirrored in another workplace where that group of workers undertakes the same work using the same skills? Take the education sector, for instance. Isn't it reasonable to suggest that what one teacher receives in pay and conditions teaching a group of grade 6 students in one school should be the same as a grade 6 teacher in another school, teaching the same syllabus to a similar group of students? Surely, it is in the public interest that there is a general consistency across the nation in wages and conditions for Australia's school teachers. I think most people would believe so, and I believe so. But this government plans to outlaw this approach.
Employers in the non-government education industry agree. In fact, these employers support and engage in pattern bargaining and have not expressed any concerns about common outcomes or any desire for different outcomes across schools and educational institutions. As the Australian Catholic Commission for Employment Relations stated in its submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000:
It may be unnecessarily time consuming and costly for similar enterprises, undertaking similar work, to establish separate enterprise agreements, especially where the organisation seeks to bargain on a industry wide level to ensure equity in its outcomes to its employees and in its delivery of services. For example, this is found in parts of education, where a large number of schools may act in cooperation with each other and not in competition, as they are not equipped to bargain individually and they seek to achieve mutual outcomes.
The same could be said for many areas in the health sector and the public sector, to name just two. This bill, if supported, would have the effect of rewarding those businesses that are most unscrupulous in respect of negotiating wages and conditions with their work force and, as such, it will render those companies that do not undercut their employees uncompetitive.
Industry-wide bargaining has the effect of protecting businesses that do not seek to exploit their employees by undercutting decent workplace standards. Many small businesses use multiple employer agreements on the basis that they are the only way in which they, as small businesses, can effectively bargain and apply in an affordable way their limited resources to the process of making an enterprise agreement. Industry-wide bargaining removes the instability created for end users when every one of their suppliers potentially has an industrial dispute during the life of their agreements, each expiring at different times. Can you imagine the car industry, which may have over 500 different suppliers, potentially having a dispute every couple of weeks that could shut down their industry? Can you imagine a large construction site that may proceed for two years or more having a dispute at some time during the course of construction with each and every subcontractor, with each dispute causing delays and cost blow-outs? 
As I mentioned earlier, the use of pattern bargaining is currently a strategy embraced by the federal government itself in relation to negotiating the pay and conditions of workers within the public sector. For instance, the federal government has just recently required universities to achieve specific outcomes in enterprise agreements in order to be eligible for supplementary salary funding. In this situation, the federal government has realised the benefits of industry-wide bargaining. It realises that it is often a more efficient and cost-effective way of undertaking its negotiations and achieving industry-consistent outcomes.
But, while the government sees fit to use pattern bargaining in its negotiations, it seeks to impose unequivocal restrictions on use by trade unions of the same procedure. The bill is just another example of an antiworker government. The government would have us believe that this bill has been inspired by the decision of Justice Munro in Australian Industry Group v. Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union.Justice Munro seems to be a most unwilling accomplice to the government's agenda. In his decision, Justice Munro said:
A common set of demands for conditions of employment, or for timing of negotiating rounds and outcomes is not sufficient in itself to establish that a negotiating party is not genuinely trying to reach agreement with the counterpart party. 
It is for this reason that the government is pursuing the bill: quite simply, because it is the opinion of the independent umpire that pattern bargaining is not necessarily in itself a display of thwarting the bargaining process. This government has chosen to legislate in order to declare that it is and to outlaw it. Justice Munro demonstrated during the Metals case that the commission's discretion to determine whether or not a party is genuinely trying to reach an agreement is available to be used in a wide range of circumstances. Justice Munro used section 170MW(2)(b) of the Workplace Relations Act, which specifically empowers the commission to suspend or terminate bargaining periods where a party is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the other negotiating parties. Justice Munro terminated bargaining periods against numerous employers because the relevant trade union was not believed to be signifying a genuine approach to the negotiation.
This legislation is not about empowering the commission to ensure that parties approach bargaining in a genuine fashion, because it already has that power. It is simply about outlawing a bargaining process that may afford workers across a number of enterprises similar outcomes which may be to their benefit. Likewise, the introduction of a new cooling-off period does not have much merit, as the commission already has the relevant power to order informal cooling-off periods under section 170MW. It has that power now if it is in the public interest and if it is to be of benefit to the negotiation.
If cooling-off periods were to have any relevance, they could be of use only where the commission itself has formed the opinion that it would genuinely assist the parties for this to occur. The last thing negotiating parties need is further bureaucratic systems of cooling-off periods that in many cases will simply not assist the negotiation or may even prolong it more than necessary. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission does not require a set of ideological rules with which to operate; it requires the power to compel parties to bargain in good faith. That is what is fundamentally lacking in our industrial relations system, certainly not the contents of this bill.
The Australian Labor Party is committed to an industrial relations system that embraces the notion of bargaining in good faith. That means empowering the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to require that parties meet face to face; attend meetings that have been organised; comply with negotiating procedures; disclose relevant information to allow for an informed negotiation, subject to confidentially agreements; state their position on various issues; explain their position on issues; consider and respond to proposals made by the other side; and adhere to commitments given to the other negotiating party as to how they would progress matters. These are practical measures and commonsense. They are designed to reach agreement, not to make it more difficult to resolve, as this bill would have it. 
In an increasingly global world and global economy, we must also be extremely mindful of our international obligations when we consider new laws. While the act as it stands does not comply with existing ILO conventions to which Australia is a signatory, the bill before us defiantly seeks to contravene those conventions even further. This government's proposal to outlaw multi-employer bargaining is unprecedented throughout the developed industrialised world. Nowhere are there restrictions on industry-wide agreement making like those that would exist in Australia if this bill were to pass the test of parliament.
This proposal and those of the past have been criticised by the International Labour Organisation and its Committee of Experts, a group of internationally eminent independent jurists. In fact, the Workplace Relations Act as a whole, as it stands unamended at the moment, has been condemned by the Committee of Experts for breaches of conventions 87 and 98 of the International Labour Organisation because of the excessive restrictions it places on industrial action in pursuit of multi-employer or industry-wide bargaining. It is important to note that the right to strike, to bargain collectively and to engage in and take industrial action at any level, be it national, industry or workplace, are now considered basic human rights and core labour standards. This bill clearly impedes those rights.
This bill is an unnecessary and unfounded attack on the rights of employees and unions, and it has a potentially detrimental effect on numerous industries and employers. There is no legitimate reason for the bill. There are no industrial circumstances that warrant such proposals. In fact, the passage of this bill would make enterprise negotiations more difficult and cumbersome. Even where employers agreed that claims were socially desirable and industrially and economically reasonable, they could fall foul of the act. It is ill thought out and it should be rejected.
In the few moments I have left I want to address one thing that I have heard during this debate. A number of speakers have talked about the success of the current industrial relations environment and how all workers seem to have participated in the increases in wage levels. While that may be the case on average, it does not describe the full story. What we actually have in the case of an industrial relations negotiation is a power system where some people, predominantly organised labour, can in fact do quite well under a system that promotes individual enterprise bargaining but where those who do not have organisational power or who have no power at all for negotiating with their employer have been left behind.
—No, they've got a choice!
—They have a choice to go onto the poverty line. I know that is where you would like to have them. Cheap labour is what you would like to support and promote. It exists in and works for some countries, but it is not what Australian workers and our community want here.
—Feudal relations in Gippsland, that's what he wants!
—That is what he wants. He wants a number of servants to put the silver spoon in and out of his mouth. Let us have a look at the metal manufacturing industry. It is worth taking a closer look at it, because it provides an interesting case study of the impact of enterprise bargaining on earning dispersions within occupations. During the 1980s, wage relativities remained almost constant. In 1983, for example, process workers under the metal industry award earned 82 per cent of the fitter's rate, a proportion that remained virtually unchanged in 1991. In the 1990s, however, this situation began to change as a growing disparity in earnings between those on agreements and those reliant on safety net increases began to emerge. Since 1991, the cumulative growth in wages for the former has been in the range of 27 to 31 per cent, while the cumulative outcome for the latter has only been in the order of eight per cent in total. 
In the decade from 1986 to 1995, male trades workers improved their wages by about 56 per cent in nominal terms, but this outcome favoured the more highly paid workers. Those in the lowest quartile gained only a 49 per cent increase, while for those in the top quartile the increase was 66 per cent. A similar pattern was evident amongst both male and female labourers, with the starkest difference occurring amongst the women. The difficulty with this is that we have a growing disparity between those who have and those who do not. There is more and more evidence being displayed every day in our communities that we have this underclass of working poor.
—But they're not getting poorer!
—How would you know?
—You would not know, because I do not think you really come across many workers every day, Senator McGauran.
—Not in Collins Street, you don't!
—And certainly not down on the farm, where he comes from. I really do not think that he ought to get up in this chamber and suggest that he has the interests of workers at heart when his government introduces what is clearly antiunion and antiworker legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (GENUINE BARGAINING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-09-24,"—Once again, we find ourselves debating legislation introduced by this government to pursue its ideological agenda to restrict the role of trade unions and deny workers the opportunity to collectively bargain. As we know, this has been an ideological obsession of the current Prime Minister from times well before he became Prime Minister, and it is an obsession that has been pursued by the government since it came to office in 1996.
This is not the first time that the contents of this legislation have been before this parliament. I will deal first with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. On two previous occasions the government has attempted to introduce similar legislation, namely, the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 and the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000. One of the things that we note about this government's continuing attempts to wind back the entitlements of employees and the ability of trade unions to represent their members is the way in which it endeavours to create inventive, cuddly titles for its legislation. As we have seen, it once had the More Jobs, Better Pay bill, which did absolutely nothing of the sort.
—Fewer jobs, worse pay!
—It was about fewer jobs and worse pay. It also at one stage endeavoured to reduce the right of employees in small business to have access to unfair dismissal legislation. When that was defeated it brought the bill back again. It changed the title to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002.
The first bill that I want to talk about in this cognate debate is called the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002. When you see a title like that in legislation introduced by this coalition government, the first thing you can pretty well predict is that it is going to have absolutely nothing at all to do with genuine bargaining and, further, that it is actually going to try and ensure the very opposite. Of course that is what this bill does. It has three key features. The bill seeks to place more and more emphasis on enterprise bargaining by making it harder and harder for employees to obtain access to protected bargaining under the act. The major thrust of this proposed legislation is to try and outlaw what has become known as pattern bargaining or industry wide bargaining.
The bill also seeks to give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission new powers to suspend bargaining periods for a specified time. That proposal will remove the statutory protection available to persons engaged in industrial action in pursuance of a new workplace agreement. The irony of that last point is that the government—having spent the last six years taking away the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission, progressively stripping it of its powers and its ability to resolve industrial disputes by a number of means—now want to give the commission extra powers. But this time the extra powers that they want to give the commission are coercive powers; they are powers that the commission will be able to use to restrict the ability of workers to actually do what this government say they should be able to do—that is, to freely negotiate with their employers. I will come back to that in a minute. 
The genuine bargaining bill provides, in particular, for the Industrial Relations Commission to consider whether industrial action during a bargaining period shows an intention to reach agreement with other persons in the industry. The bill specifies that such an intention would indicate that the organisation is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the other negotiating parties. This is what is otherwise known in the law as a strict liability offence. This bill says that, if the commission can determine that an organisation of employees is pursuing claims against a number of employers seeking agreement on the same claim—it is these days regarded, as I said, as pattern bargaining—those employees at that workplace do not have a legitimate intention to genuinely negotiate an agreement. Because somebody else might be seeking the same terms and conditions, the claim cannot be genuine.
The genuine bargaining bill will give the commission the discretion to order that a party who terminates the bargaining period may not initiate a new bargaining period in relation to the matters dealt with under the proposed agreement or may only initiate a new bargaining period on certain conditions. Further, the bill establishes what has been referred to as a `cooling-off period'. I note that Senator Marshall, in his excellent speech, previously dealt with that aspect in some detail. I said earlier that it is ironic but it is actually really hypocritical for this government—having taken away a lot of the powers and the ability of the commission to intervene in industrial disputes, to conciliate and arbitrate on issues to resolve industrial disputes—to now say, `Let's give the commission the power to suspend a bargaining period and call it a cooling-off period.' What is going to happen in the cooling-off period in those circumstances? It is all about endeavouring to frustrate the ability of the unions and the employees to negotiate their terms and conditions.
The Labor Party is opposed to the genuine bargaining bill and will be moving a series of amendments, as has been indicated, to seek to ensure that the right to bargain in good faith is recognised in this industrial relations legislation. We oppose the bill because it seeks to manipulate the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and limit its powers to resolve industrial disputes but at the same time give it powers which could be used in a coercive way to prevent employees and unions from pursuing their legitimate demands. The bill also sets up a situation where the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with industrial disputes in the most appropriate way is further reduced.
Further on the genuine bargaining bill before I turn to the second bill we are debating, it is absolutely clear that this is just another political attack upon the trade union movement. The genuine bargaining bill does not have any underlying sense of fairness. It is one more initiative by a government seeking to find more and more ways to place impediments in the way of workers and their organisations to negotiate. Let us take this issue of pattern bargaining. The government says that we have to have a system of enterprise bargaining. This means that if employees at X company are seeking to negotiate certain claims and employees at Y company are also seeking to negotiate the same claims and they are all members of the same union, that cannot possibly be true enterprise bargaining and, therefore, should be outlawed. That of course attacks the collective nature of trade union representation in industries and across various employers.
Of course, that is not an ability that this government seeks to restrict for employers. Constantly, in this country, employers and their organisations adopt positions uniformly across the industry, or even nationally, to oppose certain initiatives and certain claims in the industrial relations field. We are seeing that this government itself encourages employers and their organisations to do this. The minister is out there saying, `You won't have paid maternity leave.' It will be over his dead body. He is saying to the employers of this country, `Do not agree to paid maternity leave; don't negotiate it.' He is saying that that should be the policy position of the employers. 
Organisations such as the National Farmers Federation adopt national policies with respect to their approach to particular industrial issues. In my former career in a trade union, I experienced it in negotiating with the NFF. They had a position that was the same for every single employer in this country, whether they were the poorest farmer or the wealthiest grazier. It did not matter. As far as their policy was concerned, no employee should ever get a wage increase. They had a policy which said, `There shouldn't be any superannuation across the industry,' and they continue today to have policies and positions that are industry wide. It is a pattern across employers. Apparently this government believes it is all right for employers to adopt uniform positions, to go out there and argue and be supported by the government to oppose claims, but when unions seek to pursue initiatives across an industry that has to be outlawed. That is the great hypocrisy of this government's approach. There is one rule for unions and employees and an entirely different rule for employers. For employers, it is open slather.
In the remaining time I turn to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002, the second bill before us. This bill basically provides that anybody proposing to take industrial action must apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for a secret ballot after a bargaining period has commenced. The application must contain the questions to be put in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed industrial action. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission must, if practical, determine the application within two working days, and parties may make submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission about the application. The AIRC must not allow the application unless it is satisfied that the applicant has been and is genuinely trying to reach agreement with the employer. The commission has a discretion to refuse a ballot on certain grounds, and the commission may order a ballot. Applicants are liable for the cost of the ballot. The legislation also provides that, for industrial action to be protected, 40 per cent of eligible voters must vote. This is the quorum requirement, and a majority of valid votes cast must authorise the action. I note that the quorum that is required in these secret ballots is more than the quorum that is required for this parliament to function. Forty per cent of eligible voters must vote for any decision to be valid. So this government is seeking to set a higher benchmark, a higher hurdle, than this parliament has set for itself.
Once again, this is simply legislation that is trying to frustrate the role of registered organisations—democratic trade unions—in being able to carry out their legitimate responsibilities of representing their members and of representing workers. It never ceases to amaze me that this government constantly attacks the very existence of the trade union movement. The minister responsible for this legislation in the Senate, Senator Alston, who is at the table, constantly vilifies the trade union movement. I will always keep reminding him that he may not like trade unions and he may not like the fact that they are associated with the Labor Party—and that is probably his real problem—but trade unions are a fundamental, inherent part of any democratic system. It is ultimately the dictators who attack collective bodies— whether it be trade unions, churches or political parties—to get their way. I would at least hope that one day this government might recognise that trade unions play a very constructive role in democracies around the world, and indeed are often fighting for the restoration of democracy.
This legislation is in line with a promise made by Robert Menzies in the 1949 campaign. He proposed to introduce similar measures to wind back the rights of employees at that time. So one thing, at least, is consistent about the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard—that is, Mr Howard is always looking back at past days. 
Again, I contrast these proposals, which would put severely onerous and indeed unworkable prescriptions on workers and trade unions and their members, with the system that exists in the business community. First of all, trade unions are democratic registered organisations, and their members vote for their officials. That does not happen necessarily with employers. Indeed, where votes do take place, such as at annual general meetings of companies, you often find that the chairman holds thousands and thousands of proxies. The shareholders who do attend the annual general meeting may have a vote but they are probably not going to carry the day if the chairman is holding all the proxies that he or she has been given to exercise.
—That is democratic; they just didn't turn up.
—Senator Alston says that that is democratic; they did not turn up. Senator Alston, why is it then that this government is proposing that there has to be a minimum of a 40 per cent quorum in the vote in a secret ballot of trade union members, or employees, before it can have effect? Why is that the case? That is your proposal. You are putting an onerous condition on workers that does not in any way exist for companies.
Furthermore, as we know, there is no provision for requiring secret ballots when the major corporations in this country make decisions that can affect the lives of all Australians and affect the economy, that can have a far greater impact on the national interest than an industrial dispute at one workplace can. Those sorts of decisions can be made in the boardrooms and have huge impacts, as we have seen in recent times in this country and in America. They can have catastrophic consequences on the economy. But where is this government putting extra control and extra regulation on the way those corporations exist?
My point here is that I am not in any way engaging in an attack upon the corporate world. Contrary to the belief of some members of the government, we support and encourage business, because it is ultimately through the existence of vibrant small business and large business and the private sector as a whole in this country that more people will be employed. But there has got to be consistency, and it is about time that this government stopped focusing on trying to find more and more ingenious ways to attack trade unions and their members and workers in this country and maybe started addressing some of the real issues that affect employees and their families in this country, issues such as the huge corporate collapses that have been brought about by maladministration and, indeed, corruption and other practices in some of our major corporations.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to take note of the Productivity Commission's report on the Job Network tabled today. I draw the attention of senators to the recommendations of the review and the important issues that are raised within the review about servicing the long-term needs of our unemployed people in Australia. The overview of the report identifies many aspects of unemployment that are often forgotten. It states:
Unemployment increases poverty and inequality, it erodes people's skills and reduces social capital, economic output and national income. Many unemployed people feel demoralised and socially alienated.
It continues:
Young people with unemployed parents have worse educational and work outcomes compared with their peers.
The feelings of frustration and depression that many unemployed people experience are aptly summarised in the following quote from a young unemployed person:
You lose respect, you lose dignity, you're humiliated, you're in despair, you're embarrassed, you're angry, you're frustrated and finally you just don't care. You just don't care. All this stuff leads to loneliness, alienation, feeling of inadequacy. You get very suicidal. I tend to. I am very angry. 
That is certainly the experience that I had in the long period of time I spent working with the long-term unemployed in regional New South Wales. It is obvious that unemployment is a very complex issue and that labour market assistance needs to be flexible and responsive.
Australia was one of the first OECD countries to introduce market-type mechanisms into its employment services. The Job Network started in May 1998 and involved opening up public employment services to full contestability, involving private and community providers tendering to participate in the system. It uses a purchaser-provider model to deliver active labour market programs that include job matching, job search training and intensive assistance. The job matching service is open to nearly all unemployed people. Generally, those who have been unemployed for some time are referred to job search training. Others are referred to intensive assistance if they have significant difficulty in gaining employment.
The Productivity Commission report has called for incremental reforms to the Job Network, highlighting that, among other things, many job seekers participating in the intensive assistance strand are receiving significantly less support than they should receive and recommending that a system that better targets the needs of job seekers must be established. The review refers to this and advocates an active participation model which has a strong potential to address what is known in the labour market assistance world as the `parking' problem.
An active participation model, or milestone program, is directed at a select group of job seekers who have a particular set of obstacles to work. The program tackles each set of identified obstacles to work—for example, poor literacy skills—with payments to service providers and allows the individual's obstacles to be overcome stage by stage as opposed to the current practice of parking those job seekers without assisting them to improve their skills. A second significant recommendation addresses the issue of Job Network providers being able to re-refer their parked clients to other programs if they think they cannot help them. This is quite a significant shift which will allow new risk categories to be developed or for more appropriate referrals to be made in the first place.
The important option for rural and regional communities that is referred to in the report relates to the opportunity for people to participate in community work or with Green Corps as an alternative to intensive phases of assistance. The competitive tendering aspect of the Job Network is referred to as expensive for providers and disruptive of services, and the recommendation about licensing is a very sensible one. I urge the government to adopt the recommendations of the review and to continue to provide a range of options, particularly for the long-term unemployed. While it is a very heavy tome, with 550 pages, I commend the report to all senators as a very valuable piece of work.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission</title>,Documents,18,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I would also like to take note of the Productivity Commission report on the Job Network. As mentioned by Senator Stephens, the Job Network commenced in May 1998 and involved the opening up of the provision of employment services to the private sector as well as to the government and community based sector. However, it seems to me that in its quest to save money the government has lost sight of the people who most desperately need the assistance of Job Network—that is, the long-term unemployed.
A recent OECD report about the Job Network, released last year, highlighted the fact that, although the network has apparently saved the government money, glaring structural problems still remain. Job seekers are often unable to choose which provider they would like to use; indeed, many employers have insufficient awareness of how the Job Network works. The implementation of the network has also greatly disadvantaged people from my state of Western Australia, particularly in regional Western Australia. Because of our smaller market, job seekers in, say, Kalgoorlie or Merredin do not have the same access to services as job seekers in Perth. Where employment services are available in regional WA, they do not provide the range of services required, simply because it is not cost effective for a private operator to provide them. 
Looking at the role of competition within the provision of employment services, it seems to me that competition only works when all markets are equally contestable. That is clearly not the case in places like regional Western Australia. In fact it is absolutely not the case: Perth is far more attractive not only because of its geographical position but also because of its population size. Perth is far more attractive to a provider than, say, the wheat belt area of Western Australia. It also seems to me that the government's plan means that, regardless of a person's individual barriers to employment—whether they be language difficulties or simply the tyranny of distance, as is often felt by people in Western Australia—the same solution is offered across the board by the Job Network. I am sure that is of great concern to all Western Australians.
The government has also neglected the unemployed by providing financial incentives to assist only those people who do not have a job at all. Therefore, people who work fewer than 15 hours a week are effectively excluded from the government's definition of an `eligible job seeker'. So people who have taken part-time work because it pays the bills or because there was nothing else available at the time are unable to access the service to try to find something better. This was not the case when it was a government or community based service provision model. So it is not surprising that the long-term unemployed also have an increased feeling of being abandoned by the government. Indeed, under the employment services contract No. 3, access to substantial outcome payments is deferred until the job seeker has been out of work for two or three years. By that time, the job seeker has gone from being unemployed to being long-term unemployed and is significantly worse off in every sense of the term.
These people need help now, and they should not be forced to wait until the problem has been allowed to deteriorate to an almost irretrievable position. The resultant barriers facing these job seekers are so severe and the likelihood of success in finding a job so low, particularly if they are in regional Western Australia, that it is not economically viable for Job Network providers to help them. Emphasis has always been placed on outcome payments since the establishment of this supposed solution of the Job Network. Once a job is found a payment is made by the government to the provider for a `job well done.' So where is the incentive to help those for whom it is much harder to find work, such as the long-term unemployed? More incentives need to be given to providers to deliver programs that better reflect the needs of the long-term unemployed. This is also true for the plight of the more mature Australians who, once out of work, are almost guaranteed never to find work again. At least that seems to be the view of this government, as it refuses to invest in the needs of these people. The Job Network effectively neglects the long-term unemployed, the underemployed, anyone from a non-English-speaking background and anyone who lives outside a metropolitan area. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Productivity Commission</title>,Documents,18,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-09-24,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I congratulate you on your rise to high office. I rise tonight to speak on Singapore's position in relation to information technology and education. I recently met with top Singaporean information technology experts and school and library officials to discuss their approaches to tackling the roll-out of the information age. Senators will recall that the Senate currently has two inquiries into information technology under way—the first into information sources and the second into information transmission. Hearings will take place later this year, and the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee will report back to the Senate around Easter 2003. It was therefore timely to examine Singapore's approach, which provides us with an excellent model for consideration when we discuss Australia's future direction in this information age. 
Singapore is a major IT hub for the whole of Asia. The whole island being so small, it is very easy to wire up, and Singaporeans are very keen for outside cables to come in and link them to nearby countries. This highlights Singapore's desire to be the IT hub of Asia. Two years ago it introduced a legislative regime allowing a more liberal foreign investment system, and there are now 35 carriers and over 300 service providers in Singapore. It has also installed infrastructure that is ahead of demand and it is leading the world in wireless technologies such as m-commerce—mobile commerce. It has made a determined effort to overcome the digital divide between the rich and the poor. There is a pervasive computing goal to apply technology as widely as possible across Singaporean society. E-literacy rates are already at 55 per cent, and the national goal is to push these to 65 per cent by 2005. An example of the pervasive technology that will be developed is the smart house, with very advanced types of applications enabling you, for instance, to make your home fridge cooler from the office.
Such high-level applications are being developed not only in the home but also in schools and libraries. They have a master plan to fast-track the use of IT in the curriculum, in teaching and in the administration of schools. All schools now have one terminal to every two pupils and one notebook to every two teachers. Pre-service programs have been coordinated with in-service training resources being put into this system. They have also integrated IT systems across their schools, they have contractors to develop IT solutions in each school and each school has an IT assistant on top of that. They have put strategies in place that will actually solve the problem of the lack of `withitness' on IT issues that often exists in schools. They envisage that up to one-third of the curriculum will be available using IT by 2005. They are also rolling out a number of demonstration schools for IT at the moment and they hope that this will flow right across the school network.
The National Library of Singapore is playing a very impressive role in the roll-out of the information age. It started as the Raffles Library in 1871. Over the following 90 years there was not very much change, but in the last 30 years there have been some dramatic changes, particularly with a very extensive and comprehensive library network across Singapore which is trying to reach out to all people right across society and bring them into the information age. The system includes one of three university libraries, a professional library and 36 branch libraries, including one located in a shopping mall, which I visited. This lifestyle library is pitched to the 18- to 35-year age group. In the mall you enter the library through a coffee shop where a lot of young people were studying and drinking coffee. This provides a much more user friendly entrance than the traditional library.
The Prime Minister of Singapore has decreed the development of a `take it to the people' approach which should also be extended to those not so well-off living in the big high-rise housing estates. An interesting strategy has been developed for children, in which 40 of the tower blocks people live in have children's libraries on the ground floor which include not only play areas, reading rooms and your normal library but also up to 20 computer screens where children as young as four can start down the path of e-literacy at a very early age—initially by playing games, but moving up from that.
Also being created across Singapore is a string of learning spaces. Often these are in rented places in shopping malls and, as well as books, they have up to 120 computer screens for adult and community education. Education, especially retraining, is going to be a major underpinning of the future development of the Singaporean economy. These learning spaces will play a major role in retraining and upskilling the work force, and extending IT skills to those that are still on the wrong side of the IT divide. 
Through the library outreach spaces, they are driving e-literacy on five levels. The first level is basic IT; the second is information and computing; the third is business uses; the fourth is e-careers, for example helping people develop the skills to be a web master; and the fifth is specialist IT applications, such as Cysco engineering. From the bottom to the top, through this adult education approach people can plug in at whatever level they are up to and advance their IT skills. With this very advanced community education model, people can develop all levels of IT training. This is all driven out of the extended library structure of Singapore. They feel this approach will work because libraries are perceived as being non-threatening education environments. 
I also had the opportunity to observe how smart IT technology is revolutionising the workplaces in Singapore. For example, there is a very large emphasis on efficiency in the library. By using this new technology in clever ways, they have managed to improve efficiency by 30 per cent. But they did not fire 30 per cent of their staff; they extended the reach and services of the library and developed the skills of all their staff. Some of the devices they have are quite neat: the use of smart cards and tagging systems for checking books in and out. You do not actually interact with people when you do that in the Singapore libraries. All the fines are also distributed automatically, and queues have disappeared. They have actually abolished form-filling at the National Library of Singapore. Staff used to fill out about 70,000 forms a year, for sick leave and all sorts of other things. That has now all gone. Everything is done with smart cards and entering data on the computer. As I have stated in this place before, education and access to information can have a major effect on economic development and the efficient way in which our economy works, particularly in this developing information age. We should take these lessons from Singapore into account when we plan for Australia's IT future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Information Technology: Singapore</title>,Adjournment,19,1
