"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo—Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (12:01):  by leave—I would like to report to the parliament on the Australian government's progress on improving road safety. This is the third such statement since the National Road Safety Strategy was inaugurated in 2011, in collaboration with the states and territories.


As we all know, road safety is a complex and emotive issue. Almost everyone has been, or will be, affected by a death or serious injury on our roads. Every road casualty impacts on the lives of victims' families, their friends and their communities. And it also places a great burden on our hospitals and healthcare system.




Road trauma report



At the last election, the government made a commitment to commission a report on the impact of road trauma. The report, released today, shows that road trauma remains a huge cost to the nation, at an estimated $27 billion per year. This is the equivalent of 18 per cent of health expenditure and 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product. While these figures are confronting, we are making significant progress. Each year we are seeing a steady reduction in road deaths. For the first time since national statistics began in 1925, the population rate of road deaths in Australia has fallen to five deaths per 100,000 people. This is the lowest rate on record—a major milestone when you consider that the number of vehicles on our roads has increased from 300,000 to over 17.6 million.


While these figures are encouraging, they will mean very little to a family member, or a friend, of someone who has died or been seriously injured on our roads. The reality is that almost 1,000 people have died on our roads so far this year. Every life lost on our roads is a tragedy and the government is committed to doing more to further reduce the road toll.


The National Road Safety Strategy champions the vision that no person should be killed or seriously injured on Australia's roads. Everyone has a role to play in this vision—from each level of government to every road user. While state governments carry core responsibility for road safety, the Australian government can make a valuable contribution by building better roads, improving vehicle safety, and driving a coordinated approach.




Building safer roads



When we talk about infrastructure investment, we tend to focus on the productivity benefits, overlooking the safety outcomes often. The safety benefits generated from better roads should not be underestimated. For instance, the duplication of the Hume Highway has reduced annual fatalities by 85 per cent, and cut annual crashes from 2,499 in 1976 down to 1,062 in 2013. Similarly, fatalities have been halved on the Pacific Highway since upgrades began in the mid-1990s. The New South Wales government has estimated that upgrading the Pacific Highway to dual carriageway will prevent 1,000 deaths and 7½ thousand injuries.


The government's record $50 billion investment in infrastructure will deliver new corridors in all major cities, making a massive difference to road safety. The Perth Freight Link in Western Australia is expected to remove tens of thousands of vehicles a day from the surrounding road network. Similarly, the WestConnex project in New South Wales is expected to remove 3,000 trucks a day from Parramatta Road. Each of these investments will save lives and reduce road trauma, not only on these major highways, but also on nearby local road networks. Road safety benefits will also flow from our investments in the North South Corridor in Adelaide, the Gateway Motorway North in Brisbane, the East West Link in Melbourne and the Midland Highway in Tasmania.


Our additional investments also recognise that small changes can go a long way in delivering safety outcomes. That is why we have allocated $229 million to establish the National Highway Upgrade Program. This new program will improve Australia's key national highway networks by funding the types of minor works recommended by today's report on road trauma.


We are also investing an additional $200 million in the Black Spot Program, bringing our total commitment to $500 million over the next five years. This program has been incredibly successful since its introduction in 1996. A recent evaluation of the program found that fatal and casualty crashes are reduced at treated sites by 30 per cent, equalling one life per year for every 84 projects. I am pleased to say that the government has updated the program's eligibility criteria, making it easier for local communities to secure funding. These changes will ensure that black spot funding reaches our most dangerous roads, with at least 50 per cent of black spot funding earmarked for regional Australia, where more than 60 per cent of road deaths occur. The government has also updated the program to encourage the treatment of known hot spots, before they cause accidents and take lives.




Improving vehicle safety



Advances in vehicle technology will play a pivotal role in reducing road trauma. Globally, vehicle technology is on the edge of major transformations which will reduce the road toll exponentially. For instance, autonomous emergency braking systems are expected to save over 1,200 lives and prevent 54,000 hospitalised injuries by 2033. Critically, these improvements will be of key benefit to cyclists and pedestrians—some of our most vulnerable road users who are over represented in road toll figures. While this progress is being driven by industry, the government will have a key role in promoting this technology in Australia. Although the Australian government has no direct control over road rules, we do determine which new vehicles enter the Australian fleet under the Motor Vehicles Standards Act.



Motor Vehicle Standards Act



In recent years, sections of the act have become outdated as significant changes in vehicle technology and vehicle manufacturing have taken place. We need an efficient regulatory system that encourages innovation, improves productivity and provides for competition. That is why I announced a major review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act earlier this year.


The review is focused on reducing regulatory burdens on business and ensuring that consumers have access to the safest cars at the lowest possible cost. I released a discussion paper earlier this year and have been working closely with stakeholders to refine the options for reform. The Productivity Commission's proposal to reduce restrictions on second-hand imports was one of many ideas canvassed in the discussion paper. While such a move might reduce the cost of second-hand cars, the evidence from New Zealand suggests that it would certainly increase the age of our fleet and therefore diminish safety. As I have said before, and will repeat now, the government is not inclined to open the Australian market to second-hand imports.


However, given the move to international standards and changes in Australia's manufacturing industry, it is worthwhile to look at options for the personal importation of new cars. Consideration of this reform will be underpinned by a commitment to provide Australian consumers with access to the lowest cost, safest and youngest fleet possible. I welcome an open debate on all options for reform, and have invited all stakeholders to put forward their ideas for change.



Harmonising with international s
tandards



Pending the outcome of this review, I have initiated a process to accelerate harmonisation of Australian Design Rules with international standards. Harmonisation will keep our standards in line with international best practice. This move will provide consumers with access to the safest new vehicles from the global market immediately and at the lowest possible cost. The automatic adoption of UN regulations will also remove unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, reducing red tape for the longer term. And by reducing meaningless red tape, we will have more time to work with the international community as UN regulations are developed. In this regard, the Australian government will continue to make a vigorous contribution to improving vehicle standards internationally.



Heavy vehicle s
afety



The need for a national approach to heavy vehicle regulation has been highlighted by a recent spate of devastating accidents right across the country. This includes a number of fatal accidents and near misses on the South Eastern Freeway just outside my own electorate. I am working closely with the South Australian government to deliver the right safety solution for the South Eastern Freeway. Similarly, the Australian government is working with every jurisdiction to improve heavy vehicle safety through the establishment of a Heavy Vehicle National Law and a National Heavy Vehicle Regulator.


The new laws are important because they provide a consistent set of rules across key areas, including road access, driver fatigue and vehicle safety. It provides users and operators with greater confidence and certainty of their obligations. This landmark reform will continue to develop over time and will deliver ongoing reductions in the red tape encountered by heavy vehicle operators who work across multiple jurisdictions.



Coordinating e
ffort



A third area of focus for the Australian government is the setting of national road safety goals, objectives and action priorities. As I have noted, road deaths have been on a downward trend in recent years. However, the gains have not flowed equally to all road users. The latest statistics show that deaths of cyclists are only increasing. While the overall road toll has decreased by 3.7 per cent per year, cyclist deaths have risen by 7.4 per cent year on year over the past five years. It is vital that governments work together to turn this trend around.


Transport ministers in all states and territories have agreed to consider implementing a minimum one-metre overtaking distance for cars passing cyclists, informed by the outcome of Queensland's current trial. I welcome this commitment, and the ACT government's recent decision to make this change more immediately. I commend the Amy Gillett Foundation for having so vigorously campaigned for the 'a metre matters' message and cycling safety more broadly—a contribution well recognised by the Australasian College of Road Safety which recently awarded the foundation its highest honour in road safety.


I would like to welcome the ongoing effort of various groups who champion road safety across Australia. The tireless work of these stakeholders—too many of them to mention today—will remain integral to preventing tragedies on Australian roads.



Road Safety Action Plan



The government recently led a major, mid-term review of the National Road Safety Strategy, culminating in a new three-year action plan endorsed by all state transport ministers. The action plan sets a number of priorities which will refocus effort on delivering road safety outcomes. This includes a number of actions for the Australian government. Key amongst these are several actions which will improve vehicle safety.


First, the government is pursuing improved side impact protection—a significant reform which Australia led through the United Nations. The government is also committed to mandating anti-lock brake systems for new motorcycles and electronic stability control for new heavy vehicles. Combined, these actions will save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of injuries. The current national strategy is aiming to achieve at least a 30 per cent reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries by 2020. National fatality numbers are now 17.4 per cent below the strategy baseline, putting us well on track to achieving this reduction target. But with a concerted effort I believe we can achieve much more than a 30 per cent reduction.



Conclusion



Australia has a commendable record on road safety achievement stretching back over four decades. But we cannot afford to be complacent.


As I said at the recent National Road Safety Forum held here in Canberra, road safety is not 'owned' by the Australian government or by governments collectively. As a government, we set the rules where they are needed and ensure business settings are right for innovation.


Manufacturers can implement new safety technology, and governments can improve roads and road rules. But there is no substitute for responsible and safe driving. Road safety is, and will continue to be, everyone's responsibility. With Christmas almost upon us, this is a timely reminder for everyone to drive safely and take extra care during this busy period. Too often the festive season turns into tragedy. If you are planning travel over the holiday period, please take care. By being responsible we can all remember this Christmas as a time of togetherness and not tragedy. Thank you, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  If you would present a copy of your statement to the Clerk. 




Mr BRIGGS:
  Madam Speaker, I present a copy of the statement to the House and I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Perth to speak for 13½ minutes.


Leave granted. 




Mr BRIGGS:
  by leave—I move:


That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Perth speaking in reply to the Minister's statement for a period not exceeding 13½ minutes.


Question agreed to.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (12:15):  Can I commend the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development for bringing forward this road safety report. It is important to recognise that there has been a great deal of bipartisanship in this area. We all recognise that it is a great tragedy for so many Australian families each year that we still have so many deaths on our roads. I do think there has been a very sincerely felt joint commitment from both state and federal governments to get on top of these issues and do what we can to reduce this annual carnage that occurs on our roads. I do concur with many of the conclusions that the assistant minister has come forward with today.


Of course, we have a slightly different perspective on some of these factors. There is no doubt that investment in roads—and well-designed roads—can certainly improve the safety of those roads. But I do think it is very important to understand that research quite clearly shows that investment in public transport and, indeed, investment in rail is even more effective in improving the safety on our roads. Some interesting statistics have come out of the World Health Organization showing that, after investment in rail, thereby taking people off the roads, there has been a marked decline in the number of road accidents and fatalities in a number of cities. We need to look at these things more holistically than simply focusing on the construction of roads. 


I note that the assistant minister made reference to the building of the East West Link. I put it to the minister that the decision by the Andrews government to invest in the Metrolink will enable many more trains to run on the Melbourne system and that the increment that that can deliver to road safety is likely to be greater than that which would have been generated by the construction of the East West Link.


I do note and we commend the government for the increase in funding in black spot areas, which at this stage is scheduled to take place in 2016 and 2017. We do hope that that survives the various travails—




Mr Briggs:
  This year and next year.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  The extra $200 million in Black Spot funding?




Mr Briggs:
  Correct.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  That is interesting.




Mr Briggs:
  I can send you all the documents.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  In the Black Spot?




Mr Briggs:
  And the Roads to Recovery—the extra money there as well.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  It is positive to hear that. I am sorry; I was operating on advice on that. I do note that we have changed the BCR ratios for the black spot funding from two to one, to one to one. We support that, provided that it does not mean that projects that do deliver a two to one or something in excess of one to one will not be given less preference than those that are given the one to one.


There has been form in the past where Roads of National Importance became 'roads of National Party importance.' The Black Spot Program is a very important program. As I said, we commend the government for increasing the funding to it. But it must be very much focused on delivering to areas of greatest need. We would be very concerned if we had projects that were achieving a BCR of two or more that suddenly found themselves not being funded because the ratios had been expanded. Obviously, we will be monitoring that.


In relation to the personal importation of new cars, notwithstanding the fact that we do not agree that the Australian motoring industry is necessarily dead and that it may well be possible if we get back into government in 2016 to keep this industry alive, we are certainly open to reviewing the rules on the personal importation of new cars. However, we do note that this should be subject to the caveat that came with the report to the minister earlier this year that regulation would need to include an appropriate enforcement regime that was rigorous enough to detect identified hazards with vehicles being imported.


We do note and we agree with the assistant minister that there has been a lot of technology that has driven improvements in road safety. We agree that we need to ensure that we have mechanisms in place so that we can incorporate those as quickly as possible. We note that it is quite possible that within the next decade, or two decades, we may even see the ultimate safety: the development of the driverless car. That technology is now becoming quite seriously entertained.


But we note that there was a recent report from the World Health Organization that made the point that we have, since the 1970s, been looking at a range of developments of vehicle standards that very much focus on making the persons within that car safer and that really we now need to be doing more to focus on making vehicles safer for the non-car road user. This picks up some of the comments and concerns made by the assistant minister about the safety of cyclists. There are new global standards for pedestrian safety that focus around the design of vehicles. So, it is not just about protecting the people who are inside; within those standards there is innovative technology, such as bonnet airbags. And I think the minister did acknowledge autonomous emergency braking, which really offers an improved prospect of safety for vulnerable road users. The bonnet airbags are certainly one thing that we should be investigating.


I note and understand the minister's expressions of support for the Amy Gillett Foundation and the understandable concern that many cyclists have about their safety on our roads. Within the cycling community there is a lot of concern that the one-metre rule has now become the focus of cycling safety and there is really not that much evidence that, of itself, that is an answer to the problem for cyclists or is even achievable on many of our roads, particularly narrow roads in inner-city areas. It is being trialled; I understand that. But I guess this takes us to another point, and a point that was made by transport safety personnel from Monash University, that unfortunately in the overall spend on road safety research the area of funding of research into cycling safety is massively underdone. And I would say to the assistant minister—if I could get his attention for a moment here—that we really do need to be doing some more-detailed research on what actually works in cycling safety. There is certainly a lot of emotion surrounding the work of the Amy Gillett Foundation, and I totally understand that. But many in the cycling community and in the road safety area say that this is an area where we have to do more research and that we have not focused enough on the most reliable way to protect the safety of cyclists.


I note with some concern the assistant minister's apparent view of the Australian Design Rules as meaningless red tape. The minister has said that he wants to harmonise the Australian Design Rules for vehicles with the UN rules. Now, there is no doubt that there has been a long-term bipartisan government objective to, where possible, align the ADRs with the UN regulations. That has gone back to 1999, and we have made significant progress towards that. But the minister's own review of the motor vehicle standards earlier this year did in fact say that there was cause for concern. The report said:


While there are opportunities to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance cost by minimising the unique characteristics of the ADRs, this should not be at the cost of lowering road safety in Australia or constraining productivity. … Australian regulators are contributing to development of updated UN Regulations but the ADR should not be made less rigorous in the meantime.


They point to the 12 ADRs that are not aligned to the UN regulations, and in each case the Australian regulations are either more stringent or there is no UN coverage for that requirement. And that relates particularly to the area of heavy vehicles, where we have many unique combinations—combinations that are not found in Europe or in North America. So I think we have to be very cautious here. For example, our child restraint standard is much more stringent than the UN regulations, and I think we have to be very, very cautious that we are not allowing a fetish on red tape to take us down the wrong path.


We note the minister's concern about heavy vehicle safety—a very major area of concern. I would like the assistant minister to let us know and let the Australian public know whether or not they are seriously continuing with their review of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. We know that the work of that tribunal is very much focused on addressing this core problem of driver fatigue and of drivers being required by commercial considerations to work hours and in a manner that is simply unsafe. So, we would urge the minister that his concern for heavy vehicle safety transmutes into a commitment to allowing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to do its very important work in continuing to protect not only the truck drivers but also all those other people who are sharing the roads with our truck operators.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (12:29):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, which enacts amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Intelligence Services Act. With respect to the latter act, the bill makes explicit the statutory duty of ASIS to assist the ADF in overseas military operations and it also addresses some limitations in emergency ministerial authorisations which apply variously to ASIS, ASD and AGO.


The contribution I wish to make today will deliver some observations regarding the amendments in this bill to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Essentially, the bill amends the control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code to allow them to be obtained in a new set of circumstances. I want to make three observations in the time available. First of all, I want to note what this bill effects in terms of changes to the present control order regime. Secondly, I want to provide some consideration of what the control order system in the Commonwealth Criminal Code is—that is, provide a brief examination of the mechanics of what the control order system does. Thirdly, I want to provide a brief assessment on who in this parliament and in our civic society are opposed to these changes and why. To anticipate the conclusion of this third observation, in a time when bipartisanship is rare—this does have bipartisanship support—the opposition that is presently provided in and outside of this parliament to these changes, and indeed to the control order system per se, I would describe as representing a fringe element of Australian society. I also want to make some comments about why it is that the reasons they offer for opposing these changes to the control order system are wrongheaded, completely ill informed and represent a laziness that should not be delivered to the level that it has been in this parliament.


Firstly, with respect to the changes to the control order system, control orders can be sought in a number of circumstances and, to receive one, certain things have to be shown to a certain standard. What this bill does in essence is slightly but importantly broaden the bases upon which you can seek and eventually receive a control order, should you be able to prove to the requisite standard certain things. The extension is with respect to two possible scenarios. Firstly, the AFP member can seek the Attorney-General's consent, or indeed a court can issue a control order, in circumstances where it can be shown that the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act. The second broadening is that the AFP can seek, and a court can issue, a control order if it can be shown to the relevant standard that the control order would assist in preventing the provision of support or facilitation of a terrorist act or engagement in a hostile activity. So there are two extensions—showing that it can assist in preventing the provision of support or facilitation, or showing that it can prevent engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country. The reason that has become necessary is clear to bipartisan members of the coalition and the Labor Party, and it is simply that those two things are now occurring with greater frequency than they did in the past. So there has become a need to add to the list of things that form the basis of a control order those two phenomena that we are now encountering.


Those are relatively modest changes to the extent that they expand the control order regime, but they are very important for the fact that they represent the ability of the government to adapt and improvise and overcome new phenomena in the execution of terrorism and terrorist acts. That brings me to my second point, which is a description of what control orders do. Perhaps there is no better simple description of what they do than in the 2008 publication by the Australian Human Rights Commission A Human Rights Guide To Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws. It says:


A control order can allow a variety or obligations, prohibitions and restrictions to be imposed on a person for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act. For example, a control order can require a person to stay in a certain place at certain times, prevent a person from going to certain places or talking to certain people, or compel the person to wear a tracking device. These restrictions can impact on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the rights to liberty, privacy, freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of movement.


That is a relatively simple, crisp and fair description provided by the Human Rights Commission. Control orders place obligations or restrictions on a person—most often attaching to that person's freedom of movement and, obviously, their liberty—based on something that has been shown to a civil standard of proof. That something is set out in the act, and what we are debating here today is whether that something should be extended to those two things I mentioned—that is, showing that the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or facilitation of, a terrorist act or engagement in a hostile activity.


It is worth noting that being able to go before a court as a law enforcement officer on behalf of a law enforcement organisation and convince a court to some civil standard that something has happened or that something is likely to happen and thereby you need an order to prevent that thing from happening is an often used mechanism across all jurisdictions in Australia and all common law jurisdictions. There is nothing radical, novel or new about that type of provision. I would also make the point that there are a whole range of things that fall into this category, this type of mechanism. Bail is one of those things. Restraining orders in domestic violence circumstances are another example. It also includes prohibited behaviour orders, which exist in the Western Australian jurisdiction; anti-social behaviour orders, which exist in the UK; control orders in a range of legislation aimed at outlaw motorcycle groups throughout Australia; and dangerous sex offender legislation that exists in a range of jurisdictions throughout Australia. These all engage this fundamental mechanism that is also engaged in in the control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which is to require a law enforcement authority to show to a civil standard that something may happen. If they can do that, certain consequences will flow—orders issued by the court which, if breached, have penalties attached.


The standards for all of those things I have mentioned—bail, VROs, PBOs, ASBOs, bikie legislation and dangerous sex offender legislation—often vary but they are all civil standards. So, in the most serious of circumstances—for instance, the continuing detention of a dangerous sex offender—you will likely find that the civil standard will be a high probability, or more likely than not. In the case of control orders, it is a balance of probabilities—so, if you like, crudely, a 50 per cent prospect of the thing argued to be likely to happen actually happening. But there are also lower standards that are often used in things like bail and so forth, which are reasonable belief or reasonable suspicion. All of the standards that apply to these types of civil orders fall significantly beneath the criminal standard, which is the highest standard known to the law: beyond reasonable doubt.


Thereby, in summary, they are civil orders; they are decided by a court on a civil standard and, in the case of control orders, balance of probabilities. They have been held by a succession of High Court decisions to be protective, not punitive orders in terms of their legal definition. That is to say that they protect the public and indeed in many instances protect the interests of the subject, often protecting them from themselves and their own proclivities. Finally, they have been found on a number of occasions to breach no principle of our Constitution. They do not confound the role of the executive with that of the judiciary; they do not breach the Kable principle, as has been shown in cases like Thomas and Mowbray; nor do they breach any constitutional principle applying in Australia to the procedural fundamentals of a fair trial. They are used very often; they are constitutional in every given respect. What they do is provide a system which assesses a person's future risk of doing a certain thing which society views as incredibly dangerous, unwarranted or unwelcome and then make certain restrictions on a person's liberty based on that assessment of risk—the prospective assessment of risk.


The point that I would then go on to make, which is the second point of this contribution, is that those people in this parliament and outside it who are opposed to these changes to control orders are also opposed consistently to the control order regime itself and in many instances explicitly show their opposition to all of those other types of civil based orders that I have described or indeed, by logical inference, have to be opposed to those types of things.


I will give one example from Senator Leyonhjelm in the other place. He said:


… something, in and of itself, obnoxious because it confounds the basic principle that people should not be deprived of their liberty without a finding of guilt..


This is in reference to this very bill. He goes on to say:


Finally, control orders are civil orders—the grounds for one need only be made out on the balance of probabilities—yet to breach one attracts a penalty of five years' imprisonment. The idea of sending someone to jail for five years for something he says, on a balance of probabilities, should not be entertained in a liberal democracy.


I must say that is wrong, inconsistent, confused and a gross misapprehension of the actual situation that exists in criminal and civil law.


With regard to arguing that this confounds some basic principle that people should not be deprived of their liberty without a finding of guilt: if what is being proposed is that such a principle should exist, that is one thing. If what is being proposed is that such a principle does exist, it is completely and utterly wrong. The real fact is that, in a whole range of circumstances, people in Australia are jailed for breaching civil orders which are given on balances of proof well beneath the criminal standard. The mistake that is being made here is to confuse the jailing with the breach of the order, with the standard that is required for the delivery of the order itself. And, again, what it misunderstands is the fact that these types of orders exist everywhere in Australia in a whole range of circumstances. 


The reality is—I will provide this example—that, if you oppose a control order on the types of bases that Senator Leyonhjelm does, you must also by necessary inference oppose a violence restraining order as a matter of system and principle. A violence restraining order is applied for, often by local police on the basis that they say there is a balance of probabilities risk that certain behaviour will occur in future based on patterns of behaviour in the past, and the person is given a civil order which restricts their liberty—they should not go to certain residences or addresses, notably that of the partner, at certain times. If breached, that carries a criminal penalty, but the order itself is civil. If you find that obnoxious then you cannot equally support that in the context of domestic violence. 


Again, there is a whole range of opposition to this which is absolutely and completely inconsistent. We had Senator Wright say:


Control orders can be applied to people who have not been charged with a criminal offence and even to people suspected of harbouring a criminal intent.


First of all, that is not entirely correct. What has to be shown is that there is a balance of probabilities likelihood that something in the future will happen—in this case there could be material support for terrorism or engaging in support for hostile activities abroad. Further, the person has in fact provided support for or otherwise facilitated a terrorist act or hostile activity in a foreign country. It is said by Senator Wright:


As drafted, the bill allows control orders to be sought if reasonably suspected to be necessary to prevent the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, the engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country and preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act. This is a very slippery slope.


It is not. These things exist right across Australia in every jurisdiction that we have. The reality remains that in a whole range of circumstances we allow for civil orders which if breached carry penalties of imprisonment. Perhaps the best example of this is in dangerous sex offender legislation. As I have said, there have been many cases—Fardon in Queensland is a case. At the level of the United Nations Human Rights Committee there was an assessment that Mr Fardon should not have been detained or indeed placed on prohibitive orders after he was detained in prison because of the risk. The High Court of Australia said that he could and that the parliament was well within its rights to issue legislation which said that the person could be detained. So, if you do not support it here, it is inconsistent to support it elsewhere. It should be supported in all of the places in Australia where it exists.


I go back to that initial document that I read from, which is the Human Rights Guide to Counter-Terrorism Laws, the major difficulty with the Australian Human Rights Commission's view on these matters, if I might gently say so, is that that report commences with a bold statement that human rights may be infringed by counter-terrorism laws but neglects also at any point to note that human rights might also be protected by counter-terrorism laws. They note that the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom from arbitrary detention and arrest and the right not to be subject to torture might be abridged—and I will take some measure of difficulty with that based on High Court decisions. But, in any event, other ICCPR rights, which are seen as non-derogative, such as the right to life and the right to freedom of expression, will be protected by these orders, and that is why they should be supported.

Mr BROUGH
 (Fisher) (12:44):  I do not intend to canvass in detail the specific measures within the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. They have been more than adequately covered by the numerous speakers who have come before me, and none more eloquently than the member for Pearce. I want to reflect a little bit about why we are at this point, how we have got here and what has changed since we, as a parliament, started to canvass these issues back in 2001.


I entered this parliament back in 1996 for the first time. Just to take people's minds back, the forecourt of this parliament was considerably different then. In those days, the traffic flowed two ways around the parliament. The road itself had to be amended at the front of the parliament to push the traffic further away from the forecourt and the front of the building. My understanding is that that extension was not for some good traffic purpose. It was actually so that if a bomb was blown up in front of the parliament the pressure from the explosion would not penetrate the front of the building. I recall in my early days in this place there were no bollards. You went and parked out the back of the House of Representatives. You left your car, without gates, underneath the parliament. In other words, there were great freedoms that were just taken for granted in this, the people's palace, the Parliament of Australia.


We took it for granted because we are a very lucky country. But the reality is that, since 2001, our world has changed. To have men—and perhaps some women—with rifles in front of our parliament is something that I would not possibly have considered. It would have been a figment of someone's wild imagination. I take us on this journey for us to reflect, as a people and as a parliament, as to why we have got here.


Terrorism is not new. Terrorism is thousands of years old. Modern terrorism began with, from my limited research, a hijacking of an aircraft in Brazil, I think it was, in the 1930s. My understanding was that it too was to do with politics—constitutional revolution. There was the Munich Olympics massacre of the Jewish team in 1972, which brought this into stark relief for the public, and, of course, September 11.


I recall precisely, as I am sure many people do in this place, where I was on 11 September. I was in Sydney in a hotel room and I remember I was watching Muhammad Ali in Rumble in the Jungle, and along the bottom of the screen came this little ticker tape saying a plane had hit the Twin Towers. Initially I just thought, 'What a fool! How the hell could you miss those!' or, 'Why didn't you miss them?' Of course, sometime thereafter, when the enormity of the situation dawned on me, I recall ringing my wife, getting her out of bed and just saying—and I remember the words precisely—'Turn on the TV. The world's gone mad. The world has gone mad.' And it really has in many respects because the things that we have taken for granted—the freedoms that we have enjoyed in this country and that we just take as our birthright—have actually been impinged in many ways by this parliament reacting to an ever-changing world of terrorism.


I asked the Parliamentary Library today to list for me the number of legislative changes since 2001. Today we hit No. 54. There have been 54 changes, and almost every one of those will be in some way impinging the rights of an Australian who means no-one any harm, who goes about their business in a law-abiding, free manner. We had the proceeds of crime bills, the border security legislation, the suppression of finance of terrorism bill, the security legislation amendment, the criminal code amendment—and, of course, we are amending the criminal code again today—all the way through to maritime transport security and aviation transport security bills. On it goes, all the way through. There were 48 in the time that I was last in parliament, a further two changes in the Gillard-Rudd years and then another four changes now.


There are two things about them. One is that they do restrict Australians' liberties—things that many Australians have fought and died for. But, as the member for Pearce said, there are those who will champion your rights to maintain your freedoms, and I, like many members here, would, no doubt, have had correspondence from members of the public about the metadata retention legislation and the intercept laws, and I do not want to see those things in place. But I recognise, as a former soldier, that when your enemy continues to change, when your enemy continues to innovate, when your enemy continues to want to destroy you, if you to stand still and not to react you will fail the people that we are here to support: the general public.


All of these measures, introduced by Liberal and Labor, have had one purpose: to strengthen our intelligence and our capacity to gather intelligence, to be able to detain people who may be a risk to our fellow Australians, to support our Defence forces and out police forces and to protect people when they are flying or in their normal work. They not only come at a cost to our liberties, they come at a financial cost. Over that period of time, these measures, which have been foisted upon us because others want their ideologies jammed down our throats and want us to pay the penalty—that penalty being the loss of our liberty—have also cost, it is estimated, something in the order, in today's money, of $16 thousand million to $17 thousand million. So the next time you walk through an airport and you go through a scanner or you see the bollards out the front here and the extra security guards that are in so many places,you should realise that it does not actually add to productivity. It does not add to the wealth of our nation and to who we are and what we want to be. It does not put another teacher at a school or at a desk. What it does is give us some level of protection from those who seek to destroy who we are and what we are.


I would just like to make some comments about my philosophy on this. I have said it in the Federation Chamber and I would like to repeat it today. We have made mistakes in the past in the Middle East where we declare full-time, we declare that the game is over when the game is not over, because most people living in the Western world wish to live free. They do not want their sons and their daughters going to war. They do not want to spend money and they do not want to see the carnage that is caused by war. However, if we decide when the game is over, there are those with extremist views who do not hold to those rules. They will, like a flickering flame, die down and become hard to identify, but be assured that with the right oxygen—money, opportunity—they will rise again, they will burn brightly and they will attract to them moths from around the world. 


At the time of the second reading speech by the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis—and I commend the job that he has been doing—it was estimated that there were some 50 Australians fighting overseas. That number has not lessened; it has grown since that time. The threat to Australia has grown since that time. Hence, we have to continue to remain vigilant. The word 'containment' is bandied around. This is not something that can be contained. This is a scourge on the world that must, with every effort, be eliminated. The Islamic population of Australia is and will play an important role in ensuring that occurs.


I have a message to some in my own electorate. There is in Maroochydore at the moment an Islamic church wishing to purchase a spot to worship in. I support their right to do so. I am sure my uncle, who fought with the 2/25th Battalion in both New Guinea and the Middle East, would also have fought for their right. He may not have been a Muslim and he may have disagreed with many of the more extreme positions of that church, but he would have supported their right to be able to worship how, when and whom they wish. And I support that right. I think that once we allow fear to overcome our freedoms and our belief in the freedoms of speech, association and worship then we are lesser persons, and the terrorists of this world win.


There are 54 pieces of legislation, including today's. We are aiming to help our Defence Force personnel by ensuring they have the best intelligence available in the most timely fashion. We are removing obstacles—which could be unforeseen—where time is of the essence and where a minister may be not be available and there is no second party who can give that authority. These are simple things, but they are actually important. They are important for ensuring that we give the men and women of Australia who seek to defend us the weaponry, the intelligence, the command structure and the resources they need.


It is not Senator Brandis or the Prime Minister who have come up with these ideas. It is the professionals, the people we entrust with our freedoms. They are the people who put their lives on the line and send others into harm's way. This is the best advice they can give to us about how to help them fight terrorism. We should stand steadfast with them at all times. We should not be second-guessing these things, because none of them seek to remove, withdraw or limit their own freedoms or their families' freedoms. They do it because they believe it is in the best interests of us as a nation and of each individual within our nation.


To that handful of people who seek to destroy our way of life: be under no illusion. Every Australian, bar just a handful, stands against you and we stand as one—despite our religions, despite our political views, despite our cultural backgrounds—because that is what has made us great for our entire existence and will continue to do so into the future. I dream of the day when we do not need men out the front with rifles, when we can again have the freedoms that we had, those days of innocence which seem not that long ago. Maybe I live in a fantasyland, but we have to dream. We have to have a vision of a safer, freer world, and Australia stands ready to play its part. 


To our Defence Force personnel, as they serve overseas today and in the weeks to come over Christmas: on behalf of the people of Fisher and Australia, I thank you for what you are doing. I pray you godspeed. May you return to your families and the bosom of Australia.

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (12:57):  I rise today on behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Petrie in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Fisher. I thought that was an excellent speech and that he hit the nail right on the head with what he had to say. I certainly agree with what the member for Fisher had to say.


It would be ignorant to doubt that Australia faces a serious and ongoing terrorist threat. This legislation seeks to address the urgent operational needs that have been identified by our intelligence, defence and law enforcement agencies. The terrorist situation in Iraq and Syria is only worsening. This has in turn posed serious security issues, even here on the other side of the world. We have seen the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria over the last few months, and it is appalling to see what has been happening there: people being murdered daily, women being raped regularly and people being shot through the back of the head. This is unacceptable. It is out of control.


In Australia, we sit back. We live in a great country with lots of freedom and a great democracy. But what is happening over there is unbelievable. It is relevant here because of who is involved with ISIS. We know that there are over 100 Australians that have been over there, fighting and training and involved with ISIS. We know, as the foreign minister has said, that about 25 per cent of those people were born overseas and have dual passports. The Australian government, where possible, is cancelling their Australian passports so those people cannot return to this country. But 75 per cent of those people were actually born here in Australia. They are Australians. The majority of them are young men under the age of 25 and they are training with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, witnessing these atrocities—murder, rape and crucifixion. If they do not convert to their so-called religion, people are murdered on the spot, including children. Let us not forget that: children from Christian families are being murdered there as well. For the 75 per cent who were born in Australia and are over in Iraq and Syria, we cannot cancel their passports. They are Australians; they were born here. So the bill addresses how to deal with these people when they return, because they are going to come back even more radicalised.


We saw what happened in Britain recently with the UK serviceman who last year was run down and decapitated. We saw what happened in Canada's parliament just a few weeks ago, with a radicalised lunatic over there murdering a guard. We saw a young man in Victoria, just a few weeks ago, attack and try to murder two police officers. This is why this is relevant here in Australia.


The federal government's primary responsibility, of course, is not just to build a strong, prosperous economy but to build a safe and secure Australia. We need to look after our people. As a first-term MP, I have spent much of this past year talking to people from many parts of my electorate, and many views are expressed to me daily. My inbox is constantly blitzed by lobby groups and those with a particular idea about what they believe would make Australia better. Many of those writing to me are concerned by the images they see in the daily newspapers or on the evening news broadcasts. They are concerned for their safety and for the safety of our community. This bill seeks to address some of those concerns.


This bill is part of the government's comprehensive response to the current situation we find ourselves in—in particular, the challenges we will have dealing with those Australians participating in and supporting foreign conflicts. Here in Australia, our intelligence agencies have identified issues. Our law enforcement agencies and defence personal need the legislative framework to be able to deal with the threats posed by those wanting to harm Australia and Australians' way of life. This legislation is not the result of any ideologically driven aims; it is simply the result of instances of operational needs identified by law enforcement agencies. The bill was subjected to review and scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its 20 November 2014 report. I note that the government has accepted, or accepted in principle, all of the committee's recommendations.


I want to also acknowledge some of the comments in newspapers about these amendments. Firstly, the fact that we can debate issues should be celebrated. We live, as I said earlier, in a strong democracy where we have freedom. I assure those who have some concerns that this legislation gives excess powers to the ASIO and ASIS chiefs in respect of 'emergency authorisations' that I believe these concerns have been fully alleviated by the Attorney-General's second reading speech. However, this government takes its responsibility very seriously, and the powers contained in these amendments are vital to address the threat of terrorism. Our laws cannot be static. We live in a changing environment, but these amendments have been drafted with the appropriate checks and balances. We cannot be a reactive government, acting only after a serious act of terrorism occurs on our soil. We must be a proactive government—and we are. We are strengthening existing pieces of legislation that do not adequately address current domestic security threats.


As I noted, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill has been introduced to address urgent operational needs identified by our intelligence, defence and law enforcement agencies. The amendments address three key areas: (1) enhancing the control order regime to allow the Australian Federal Police to seek control orders in relation to a broader range of individuals of security concern, and to streamline the application process (2) better facilitating the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, which supports and cooperates with the Australian Defence Force on military operations, and (3) making it easier for intelligence agencies to gain emergency ministerial authorisations to undertake activities in the performance of their statutory functions.


To look closely at enhancing the control order regime, the existing control order regime is already subject to significant safeguard and oversight mechanisms, including through the need to obtain both the Attorney-General's consent and a court order, which will continue to apply. But the current capacity of law enforcement agencies to protect the public from terrorist acts can and should be enhanced. This bill provides these enhancements to the control order regime through amendments to the Criminal Code. This includes expanding the ground upon which a senior AFP member can, with the Attorney-General's consent, request an interim control order to circumstances where the order would substantially assist in preventing support for or the facilitation of a terrorist act, or an individual's engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country. In short, enhancements like this will enable our security forces to function faster and more effectively, which is fantastic news.


On facilitating the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, a key role of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service is to provide intelligence support to our Australian Defence Force, which is currently providing military support to Iraq in the fight against terrorist organisations. In using any intelligence provided by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Defence Force is bound by its rules of engagement.


I must say that the Australian Defence Force is doing a fantastic job. Earlier this year, I had the chance to travel to Afghanistan as part of the parliamentary military exchange program with three of my parliamentary colleagues.


It was fantastic to see the men and women in the Australian Defence Force, and experience their confidence and professionalism and the passion with which they carry out their work. They really are doing a wonderful job. We had the chance to sit in on some of the briefings for the rules of engagement in Afghanistan.


The government will continue to invest in the Australian Defence Force. Recently we have seen more of our budget committed to military hardware and equipment that is cutting edge, which the ADF need in order to carry out the work. This is in stark contrast to Labor, who cut $16 billion from the ADF in their six years of government. 


These rules of engagement are developed in consultation with the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department to ensure compliance with Australia's international law obligations. Without information like the intelligence that ASIS provides, the ADF is not only hindered, but also potentially put in danger. There is no point in having a defence force if the defence force is not in the best position to defend its nation and its personnel. By allowing ASIS to better support and cooperate with the ADF, we can ensure our defence force is adequately informed and fully understanding of new developments.


I stress again that all of the existing safeguards and oversight mechanisms in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 will continue to apply. These include the statutory thresholds for the granting of authorisations, ministerial reporting requirements, and the independent oversight of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Likewise, strong oversight mechanisms will apply to the provision of emergency ministerial authorisations.


At this point in time, when we know that terrorism is a threat to Australians; it is paramount that we act, because typically in these kinds of situations, governments have only two options: acting early or too late. I am all for freedom. As many of my colleagues will agree, we simply cannot let terrorist threats change our lives or scare us out of being ourselves. If we do so, terrorism has won us over.


But we cannot turn away from the fact that terrorism is a very real threat. My constituents know that. I know that. The government of Australia knows that. Even when I am in Canberra participating in the debates in this place I am very conscious of how this legislation is viewed by those meeting at the coffee shop in North Lakes, by the mums and dads taking their children to school in Bracken Ridge, or at the pensioners' meetings in Redcliffe. This is all about the safety of Australians. These amendments give those mums and dads, grandmothers, grandfathers and pensioners comfort knowing that their security agencies, law enforcement agencies and our Australian Defence Forces are looking after their community and knowing that the safety of their children and grandchildren are paramount. They can plan their future in the knowledge that the hard decisions are being made by their government.


Importantly, I stress again that the appropriate checks and balances are in place. Members of parliament representing communities all across Australia know that there is a threat and that we have to do something to address it. As the Prime Minister the Hon. Tony Abbott said, 'We can't guarantee that there will never be a terrorist attack. All we can guarantee is we are as well prepared as possible.'

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (13:11):  I would like to thank members of parliament for their contributions in this debate on what is a critically important piece of counterterrorism legislation. In particular, I would like to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, who have made such important contributions that have resulted in recommendations that the government has been pleased to implement through the government amendments that have been moved in the Senate. These amendments are now reflected in this bill, which the House is dealing with today.


As you would be aware, and as noted in the media, we are living in a heightened security threat environment as a result of the continued conflict in Iraq and Syria, and in particular, the threat posed by Australians participating in and supporting these foreign conflicts and Australians who go to these war zones and undertake training with extremist groups.


Sadly, we are also aware that this is not just an Australian problem. It is one shared by many of our partners. We have certainly been very alive, as we have created and crafted our response to this issue in Australia, to what has been happening overseas. 


Currently, Australia's domestic counterterrorism legislation has concentrated on those intent on committing acts of terrorism but this bill, very importantly, expands the preventative purposes of the control order regime to counter this threat to allow the Australian Federal Police to seek control orders in relation to a broader range of individuals of security concern—namely, those who support or facilitate terrorists and foreign fighters.


These amendments respond to law enforcement advice that there are individuals of very serious security concern who are not covered by the existing grounds for making a control order. Some of these people are not directly carrying out acts of terrorism in Australia or hostile activities overseas, but they are providing the necessary support for terrorists and foreign fighters, and their activities facilitate others to engage in terrorism or to fight with these extremist organisations overseas. 


I will just turn to some of the specific points that have been made in this debate that I would like to counter—in particular some of the comments that have been made by the member for Melbourne, who noted that this bill will allow controls to be placed on individuals without going through long-standing processes in criminal law. But the control order regime has actually been in place for 10 years, and this regime responds to extraordinary circumstances of threat to Australia's national security interests. 


The expansion of the grounds for obtaining a control order responds to advice from law enforcement that some Australians have taken on roles of supporting and facilitating others to engage terrorism offences or to travel to conflict zones and then to return to Australia with the capabilities acquired from fighting or training with these evil terrorist groups. 


From a public safety perspective, the threat posed by these individuals is just as great as the risk posed by those who would directly engage in terrorist acts or foreign incursions. To counter this particular threat, it is therefore rightly appropriate that we expand the preventative purposes of the control order regime.


In his misrepresentation of the control order regime the member for Melbourne linked control orders and the bill to Australia authorising detention of a person, without that person committing an offence. Firstly, control orders do not authorise detention. Secondly, it is astounding that the member for Melbourne and the Greens, if they had their way, would only allow action to be taken after a terrorist act had taken place. It is the first priority of any government to keep its people safe, and this means providing our law enforcement and security agencies with the tools they need to prevent terrorist acts. Control orders, which have only been used twice since 2005, provide the government with such a mechanism.


The bill also amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, to streamline procedural authorisation requirements for agencies governed by that act to collect intelligence on Australians overseas. This will ensure that our agencies are as agile as they need to be within the contemporary security environment, particularly in emergency circumstances.


A key amendment will be to enhance the ability of ASIS to provide timely assistance to the Australian Defence Force, in support of military operations. After introducing this bill into the Senate, on 29 October, the Attorney-General referred it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, under the very able chairmanship of the member for Wannon, Mr Dan Tehan. They tabled their report on 20 November, and the committee made 16 recommendations, including—and I think very importantly—that this bill be passed. The government has accepted in principle all of the recommendations that were made by the parliamentary joint committee. We recognise the valuable bipartisan work that this committee does. It is a committee that works very well. Again, I acknowledge the very able chairmanship of the member for Wannon, and I thank all of those members on the committee who participated in that inquiry.


I wanted to respond to a couple of other comments that have been made in the course of this debate. I welcome the Labor Party's support for it, but I was disappointed to hear in the debate some inaccurate and misleading comments, particularly in relation to the fact that we had failed to engage the community on some of this legislation. This is simply not true. There has been a very extensive amount of community consultation that has been undertaken by the Prime Minister, by the Attorney-General, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. They have engaged with senior leaders of the Muslim community in Australia. It has also happened on a more informal level when members of our party room were encouraged to go out and talk directly to Muslim communities in their electorates. That is something I certainly did. I know that many other members also took advantage of that opportunity. So I completely reject the idea that we have not effectively consulted with the community. As the Attorney-General has previously said, the purpose of these meetings was specifically to engage the community on the government's intention—to engage with them in a way that makes them partners with the government in seeking to protect their youngsters from being enticed into the snares of terrorist organisations that are engaged in war-fighting in the Middle East. We have certainly been pleased to partner with the community to do all we can to explain the government's intentions here. I think that engagement has been very effective.


This is actually probably a greater level of engagement than would be usual when it comes to government legislation. But of course this is not an ordinary issue. We cannot possibly be effective in our fight against terrorist organisations in snaring our youngsters to go to the Middle East and fight without working in partnership with the community. So we have been very mindful that we need to do that. I think those meetings have been very productive. I am very pleased that the community leaders we met with in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra actually expressed to the government their appreciation for that level of consultation. They let us know that they wanted to work effectively with us on these difficult issues, and they shared with us their belief that they want the government to keep Australia safe.


I was also disappointed to hear opposition comments about our Countering Violent Extremism program and some allegations that there has been a delay in the rollout of this program. Again, that simply is not true. We do not want to rush the design of this program. It is important that we get it right. The focus of the new CVE program is the $13.4 million investment. We are designing it to intervene to stop young Australians from being radicalised to violent extremism. This is a new program. It builds on research we have undertaken. It has used our experience. Also, very importantly, it has used experience gained overseas, because these are not issues that are unique to Australia. The radicalisation to violence process is unique to each person that undergoes it. This is why we need to design a program that is flexible as well as being effective. It is important that the interventions we undertake through this program actually respond to the individual's needs, and we need to identify the best way to help them.


The Attorney-General's Department has been engaged with world-leading experts and practitioners at both the federal and state level. We have worked very effectively with our partners in this important work. Considerable effort has been undertaken, including extensive consultation with key community stakeholders, state and territory governments and the professional and community sectors.


The next phase of our engagement will be with key communities in the coming weeks. Further information will be made available on the web site livingsafertogether.gov.au, and via an email to those who advise us of their interest.


Other core elements of the government's program include addressing online radicalisation and reducing the impact of terrorists' use of social media, by helping people to develop the digital skills needed to critically assess terrorists' claims and promote alternative and then positive messages online.


I thank all of my colleagues who have participated in this debate and recognise the need for these important reforms. The Abbott government is undertaking a comprehensive review and reform of our national security architecture to ensure that our counterterrorism framework is effective and targeted to our current national security threat, and to make sure that our agencies are supported by the legislative framework we have that enables them to respond to emerging and future security threats. This bill has a direct impact on the ability of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to support our defence force in particular, so that they can continue to protect Australia and Australians. I therefore commend the bill to the House as another part of the arsenal we are providing our agencies with to keep our community safe.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (12:29):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, which enacts amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Intelligence Services Act. With respect to the latter act, the bill makes explicit the statutory duty of ASIS to assist the ADF in overseas military operations and it also addresses some limitations in emergency ministerial authorisations which apply variously to ASIS, ASD and AGO.


The contribution I wish to make today will deliver some observations regarding the amendments in this bill to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Essentially, the bill amends the control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code to allow them to be obtained in a new set of circumstances. I want to make three observations in the time available. First of all, I want to note what this bill effects in terms of changes to the present control order regime. Secondly, I want to provide some consideration of what the control order system in the Commonwealth Criminal Code is—that is, provide a brief examination of the mechanics of what the control order system does. Thirdly, I want to provide a brief assessment on who in this parliament and in our civic society are opposed to these changes and why. To anticipate the conclusion of this third observation, in a time when bipartisanship is rare—this does have bipartisanship support—the opposition that is presently provided in and outside of this parliament to these changes, and indeed to the control order system per se, I would describe as representing a fringe element of Australian society. I also want to make some comments about why it is that the reasons they offer for opposing these changes to the control order system are wrongheaded, completely ill informed and represent a laziness that should not be delivered to the level that it has been in this parliament.


Firstly, with respect to the changes to the control order system, control orders can be sought in a number of circumstances and, to receive one, certain things have to be shown to a certain standard. What this bill does in essence is slightly but importantly broaden the bases upon which you can seek and eventually receive a control order, should you be able to prove to the requisite standard certain things. The extension is with respect to two possible scenarios. Firstly, the AFP member can seek the Attorney-General's consent, or indeed a court can issue a control order, in circumstances where it can be shown that the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act. The second broadening is that the AFP can seek, and a court can issue, a control order if it can be shown to the relevant standard that the control order would assist in preventing the provision of support or facilitation of a terrorist act or engagement in a hostile activity. So there are two extensions—showing that it can assist in preventing the provision of support or facilitation, or showing that it can prevent engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country. The reason that has become necessary is clear to bipartisan members of the coalition and the Labor Party, and it is simply that those two things are now occurring with greater frequency than they did in the past. So there has become a need to add to the list of things that form the basis of a control order those two phenomena that we are now encountering.


Those are relatively modest changes to the extent that they expand the control order regime, but they are very important for the fact that they represent the ability of the government to adapt and improvise and overcome new phenomena in the execution of terrorism and terrorist acts. That brings me to my second point, which is a description of what control orders do. Perhaps there is no better simple description of what they do than in the 2008 publication by the Australian Human Rights Commission A Human Rights Guide To Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws. It says:


A control order can allow a variety or obligations, prohibitions and restrictions to be imposed on a person for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act. For example, a control order can require a person to stay in a certain place at certain times, prevent a person from going to certain places or talking to certain people, or compel the person to wear a tracking device. These restrictions can impact on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the rights to liberty, privacy, freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of movement.


That is a relatively simple, crisp and fair description provided by the Human Rights Commission. Control orders place obligations or restrictions on a person—most often attaching to that person's freedom of movement and, obviously, their liberty—based on something that has been shown to a civil standard of proof. That something is set out in the act, and what we are debating here today is whether that something should be extended to those two things I mentioned—that is, showing that the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or facilitation of, a terrorist act or engagement in a hostile activity.


It is worth noting that being able to go before a court as a law enforcement officer on behalf of a law enforcement organisation and convince a court to some civil standard that something has happened or that something is likely to happen and thereby you need an order to prevent that thing from happening is an often used mechanism across all jurisdictions in Australia and all common law jurisdictions. There is nothing radical, novel or new about that type of provision. I would also make the point that there are a whole range of things that fall into this category, this type of mechanism. Bail is one of those things. Restraining orders in domestic violence circumstances are another example. It also includes prohibited behaviour orders, which exist in the Western Australian jurisdiction; anti-social behaviour orders, which exist in the UK; control orders in a range of legislation aimed at outlaw motorcycle groups throughout Australia; and dangerous sex offender legislation that exists in a range of jurisdictions throughout Australia. These all engage this fundamental mechanism that is also engaged in in the control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which is to require a law enforcement authority to show to a civil standard that something may happen. If they can do that, certain consequences will flow—orders issued by the court which, if breached, have penalties attached.


The standards for all of those things I have mentioned—bail, VROs, PBOs, ASBOs, bikie legislation and dangerous sex offender legislation—often vary but they are all civil standards. So, in the most serious of circumstances—for instance, the continuing detention of a dangerous sex offender—you will likely find that the civil standard will be a high probability, or more likely than not. In the case of control orders, it is a balance of probabilities—so, if you like, crudely, a 50 per cent prospect of the thing argued to be likely to happen actually happening. But there are also lower standards that are often used in things like bail and so forth, which are reasonable belief or reasonable suspicion. All of the standards that apply to these types of civil orders fall significantly beneath the criminal standard, which is the highest standard known to the law: beyond reasonable doubt.


Thereby, in summary, they are civil orders; they are decided by a court on a civil standard and, in the case of control orders, balance of probabilities. They have been held by a succession of High Court decisions to be protective, not punitive orders in terms of their legal definition. That is to say that they protect the public and indeed in many instances protect the interests of the subject, often protecting them from themselves and their own proclivities. Finally, they have been found on a number of occasions to breach no principle of our Constitution. They do not confound the role of the executive with that of the judiciary; they do not breach the Kable principle, as has been shown in cases like Thomas and Mowbray; nor do they breach any constitutional principle applying in Australia to the procedural fundamentals of a fair trial. They are used very often; they are constitutional in every given respect. What they do is provide a system which assesses a person's future risk of doing a certain thing which society views as incredibly dangerous, unwarranted or unwelcome and then make certain restrictions on a person's liberty based on that assessment of risk—the prospective assessment of risk.


The point that I would then go on to make, which is the second point of this contribution, is that those people in this parliament and outside it who are opposed to these changes to control orders are also opposed consistently to the control order regime itself and in many instances explicitly show their opposition to all of those other types of civil based orders that I have described or indeed, by logical inference, have to be opposed to those types of things.


I will give one example from Senator Leyonhjelm in the other place. He said:


… something, in and of itself, obnoxious because it confounds the basic principle that people should not be deprived of their liberty without a finding of guilt..


This is in reference to this very bill. He goes on to say:


Finally, control orders are civil orders—the grounds for one need only be made out on the balance of probabilities—yet to breach one attracts a penalty of five years' imprisonment. The idea of sending someone to jail for five years for something he says, on a balance of probabilities, should not be entertained in a liberal democracy.


I must say that is wrong, inconsistent, confused and a gross misapprehension of the actual situation that exists in criminal and civil law.


With regard to arguing that this confounds some basic principle that people should not be deprived of their liberty without a finding of guilt: if what is being proposed is that such a principle should exist, that is one thing. If what is being proposed is that such a principle does exist, it is completely and utterly wrong. The real fact is that, in a whole range of circumstances, people in Australia are jailed for breaching civil orders which are given on balances of proof well beneath the criminal standard. The mistake that is being made here is to confuse the jailing with the breach of the order, with the standard that is required for the delivery of the order itself. And, again, what it misunderstands is the fact that these types of orders exist everywhere in Australia in a whole range of circumstances. 


The reality is—I will provide this example—that, if you oppose a control order on the types of bases that Senator Leyonhjelm does, you must also by necessary inference oppose a violence restraining order as a matter of system and principle. A violence restraining order is applied for, often by local police on the basis that they say there is a balance of probabilities risk that certain behaviour will occur in future based on patterns of behaviour in the past, and the person is given a civil order which restricts their liberty—they should not go to certain residences or addresses, notably that of the partner, at certain times. If breached, that carries a criminal penalty, but the order itself is civil. If you find that obnoxious then you cannot equally support that in the context of domestic violence. 


Again, there is a whole range of opposition to this which is absolutely and completely inconsistent. We had Senator Wright say:


Control orders can be applied to people who have not been charged with a criminal offence and even to people suspected of harbouring a criminal intent.


First of all, that is not entirely correct. What has to be shown is that there is a balance of probabilities likelihood that something in the future will happen—in this case there could be material support for terrorism or engaging in support for hostile activities abroad. Further, the person has in fact provided support for or otherwise facilitated a terrorist act or hostile activity in a foreign country. It is said by Senator Wright:


As drafted, the bill allows control orders to be sought if reasonably suspected to be necessary to prevent the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, the engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country and preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act. This is a very slippery slope.


It is not. These things exist right across Australia in every jurisdiction that we have. The reality remains that in a whole range of circumstances we allow for civil orders which if breached carry penalties of imprisonment. Perhaps the best example of this is in dangerous sex offender legislation. As I have said, there have been many cases—Fardon in Queensland is a case. At the level of the United Nations Human Rights Committee there was an assessment that Mr Fardon should not have been detained or indeed placed on prohibitive orders after he was detained in prison because of the risk. The High Court of Australia said that he could and that the parliament was well within its rights to issue legislation which said that the person could be detained. So, if you do not support it here, it is inconsistent to support it elsewhere. It should be supported in all of the places in Australia where it exists.


I go back to that initial document that I read from, which is the Human Rights Guide to Counter-Terrorism Laws, the major difficulty with the Australian Human Rights Commission's view on these matters, if I might gently say so, is that that report commences with a bold statement that human rights may be infringed by counter-terrorism laws but neglects also at any point to note that human rights might also be protected by counter-terrorism laws. They note that the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom from arbitrary detention and arrest and the right not to be subject to torture might be abridged—and I will take some measure of difficulty with that based on High Court decisions. But, in any event, other ICCPR rights, which are seen as non-derogative, such as the right to life and the right to freedom of expression, will be protected by these orders, and that is why they should be supported.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr BROUGH
 (Fisher) (12:44):  I do not intend to canvass in detail the specific measures within the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. They have been more than adequately covered by the numerous speakers who have come before me, and none more eloquently than the member for Pearce. I want to reflect a little bit about why we are at this point, how we have got here and what has changed since we, as a parliament, started to canvass these issues back in 2001.


I entered this parliament back in 1996 for the first time. Just to take people's minds back, the forecourt of this parliament was considerably different then. In those days, the traffic flowed two ways around the parliament. The road itself had to be amended at the front of the parliament to push the traffic further away from the forecourt and the front of the building. My understanding is that that extension was not for some good traffic purpose. It was actually so that if a bomb was blown up in front of the parliament the pressure from the explosion would not penetrate the front of the building. I recall in my early days in this place there were no bollards. You went and parked out the back of the House of Representatives. You left your car, without gates, underneath the parliament. In other words, there were great freedoms that were just taken for granted in this, the people's palace, the Parliament of Australia.


We took it for granted because we are a very lucky country. But the reality is that, since 2001, our world has changed. To have men—and perhaps some women—with rifles in front of our parliament is something that I would not possibly have considered. It would have been a figment of someone's wild imagination. I take us on this journey for us to reflect, as a people and as a parliament, as to why we have got here.


Terrorism is not new. Terrorism is thousands of years old. Modern terrorism began with, from my limited research, a hijacking of an aircraft in Brazil, I think it was, in the 1930s. My understanding was that it too was to do with politics—constitutional revolution. There was the Munich Olympics massacre of the Jewish team in 1972, which brought this into stark relief for the public, and, of course, September 11.


I recall precisely, as I am sure many people do in this place, where I was on 11 September. I was in Sydney in a hotel room and I remember I was watching Muhammad Ali in Rumble in the Jungle, and along the bottom of the screen came this little ticker tape saying a plane had hit the Twin Towers. Initially I just thought, 'What a fool! How the hell could you miss those!' or, 'Why didn't you miss them?' Of course, sometime thereafter, when the enormity of the situation dawned on me, I recall ringing my wife, getting her out of bed and just saying—and I remember the words precisely—'Turn on the TV. The world's gone mad. The world has gone mad.' And it really has in many respects because the things that we have taken for granted—the freedoms that we have enjoyed in this country and that we just take as our birthright—have actually been impinged in many ways by this parliament reacting to an ever-changing world of terrorism.


I asked the Parliamentary Library today to list for me the number of legislative changes since 2001. Today we hit No. 54. There have been 54 changes, and almost every one of those will be in some way impinging the rights of an Australian who means no-one any harm, who goes about their business in a law-abiding, free manner. We had the proceeds of crime bills, the border security legislation, the suppression of finance of terrorism bill, the security legislation amendment, the criminal code amendment—and, of course, we are amending the criminal code again today—all the way through to maritime transport security and aviation transport security bills. On it goes, all the way through. There were 48 in the time that I was last in parliament, a further two changes in the Gillard-Rudd years and then another four changes now.


There are two things about them. One is that they do restrict Australians' liberties—things that many Australians have fought and died for. But, as the member for Pearce said, there are those who will champion your rights to maintain your freedoms, and I, like many members here, would, no doubt, have had correspondence from members of the public about the metadata retention legislation and the intercept laws, and I do not want to see those things in place. But I recognise, as a former soldier, that when your enemy continues to change, when your enemy continues to innovate, when your enemy continues to want to destroy you, if you to stand still and not to react you will fail the people that we are here to support: the general public.


All of these measures, introduced by Liberal and Labor, have had one purpose: to strengthen our intelligence and our capacity to gather intelligence, to be able to detain people who may be a risk to our fellow Australians, to support our Defence forces and out police forces and to protect people when they are flying or in their normal work. They not only come at a cost to our liberties, they come at a financial cost. Over that period of time, these measures, which have been foisted upon us because others want their ideologies jammed down our throats and want us to pay the penalty—that penalty being the loss of our liberty—have also cost, it is estimated, something in the order, in today's money, of $16 thousand million to $17 thousand million. So the next time you walk through an airport and you go through a scanner or you see the bollards out the front here and the extra security guards that are in so many places,you should realise that it does not actually add to productivity. It does not add to the wealth of our nation and to who we are and what we want to be. It does not put another teacher at a school or at a desk. What it does is give us some level of protection from those who seek to destroy who we are and what we are.


I would just like to make some comments about my philosophy on this. I have said it in the Federation Chamber and I would like to repeat it today. We have made mistakes in the past in the Middle East where we declare full-time, we declare that the game is over when the game is not over, because most people living in the Western world wish to live free. They do not want their sons and their daughters going to war. They do not want to spend money and they do not want to see the carnage that is caused by war. However, if we decide when the game is over, there are those with extremist views who do not hold to those rules. They will, like a flickering flame, die down and become hard to identify, but be assured that with the right oxygen—money, opportunity—they will rise again, they will burn brightly and they will attract to them moths from around the world. 


At the time of the second reading speech by the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis—and I commend the job that he has been doing—it was estimated that there were some 50 Australians fighting overseas. That number has not lessened; it has grown since that time. The threat to Australia has grown since that time. Hence, we have to continue to remain vigilant. The word 'containment' is bandied around. This is not something that can be contained. This is a scourge on the world that must, with every effort, be eliminated. The Islamic population of Australia is and will play an important role in ensuring that occurs.


I have a message to some in my own electorate. There is in Maroochydore at the moment an Islamic church wishing to purchase a spot to worship in. I support their right to do so. I am sure my uncle, who fought with the 2/25th Battalion in both New Guinea and the Middle East, would also have fought for their right. He may not have been a Muslim and he may have disagreed with many of the more extreme positions of that church, but he would have supported their right to be able to worship how, when and whom they wish. And I support that right. I think that once we allow fear to overcome our freedoms and our belief in the freedoms of speech, association and worship then we are lesser persons, and the terrorists of this world win.


There are 54 pieces of legislation, including today's. We are aiming to help our Defence Force personnel by ensuring they have the best intelligence available in the most timely fashion. We are removing obstacles—which could be unforeseen—where time is of the essence and where a minister may be not be available and there is no second party who can give that authority. These are simple things, but they are actually important. They are important for ensuring that we give the men and women of Australia who seek to defend us the weaponry, the intelligence, the command structure and the resources they need.


It is not Senator Brandis or the Prime Minister who have come up with these ideas. It is the professionals, the people we entrust with our freedoms. They are the people who put their lives on the line and send others into harm's way. This is the best advice they can give to us about how to help them fight terrorism. We should stand steadfast with them at all times. We should not be second-guessing these things, because none of them seek to remove, withdraw or limit their own freedoms or their families' freedoms. They do it because they believe it is in the best interests of us as a nation and of each individual within our nation.


To that handful of people who seek to destroy our way of life: be under no illusion. Every Australian, bar just a handful, stands against you and we stand as one—despite our religions, despite our political views, despite our cultural backgrounds—because that is what has made us great for our entire existence and will continue to do so into the future. I dream of the day when we do not need men out the front with rifles, when we can again have the freedoms that we had, those days of innocence which seem not that long ago. Maybe I live in a fantasyland, but we have to dream. We have to have a vision of a safer, freer world, and Australia stands ready to play its part. 


To our Defence Force personnel, as they serve overseas today and in the weeks to come over Christmas: on behalf of the people of Fisher and Australia, I thank you for what you are doing. I pray you godspeed. May you return to your families and the bosom of Australia.

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (12:57):  I rise today on behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Petrie in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Fisher. I thought that was an excellent speech and that he hit the nail right on the head with what he had to say. I certainly agree with what the member for Fisher had to say.


It would be ignorant to doubt that Australia faces a serious and ongoing terrorist threat. This legislation seeks to address the urgent operational needs that have been identified by our intelligence, defence and law enforcement agencies. The terrorist situation in Iraq and Syria is only worsening. This has in turn posed serious security issues, even here on the other side of the world. We have seen the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria over the last few months, and it is appalling to see what has been happening there: people being murdered daily, women being raped regularly and people being shot through the back of the head. This is unacceptable. It is out of control.


In Australia, we sit back. We live in a great country with lots of freedom and a great democracy. But what is happening over there is unbelievable. It is relevant here because of who is involved with ISIS. We know that there are over 100 Australians that have been over there, fighting and training and involved with ISIS. We know, as the foreign minister has said, that about 25 per cent of those people were born overseas and have dual passports. The Australian government, where possible, is cancelling their Australian passports so those people cannot return to this country. But 75 per cent of those people were actually born here in Australia. They are Australians. The majority of them are young men under the age of 25 and they are training with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, witnessing these atrocities—murder, rape and crucifixion. If they do not convert to their so-called religion, people are murdered on the spot, including children. Let us not forget that: children from Christian families are being murdered there as well. For the 75 per cent who were born in Australia and are over in Iraq and Syria, we cannot cancel their passports. They are Australians; they were born here. So the bill addresses how to deal with these people when they return, because they are going to come back even more radicalised.


We saw what happened in Britain recently with the UK serviceman who last year was run down and decapitated. We saw what happened in Canada's parliament just a few weeks ago, with a radicalised lunatic over there murdering a guard. We saw a young man in Victoria, just a few weeks ago, attack and try to murder two police officers. This is why this is relevant here in Australia.


The federal government's primary responsibility, of course, is not just to build a strong, prosperous economy but to build a safe and secure Australia. We need to look after our people. As a first-term MP, I have spent much of this past year talking to people from many parts of my electorate, and many views are expressed to me daily. My inbox is constantly blitzed by lobby groups and those with a particular idea about what they believe would make Australia better. Many of those writing to me are concerned by the images they see in the daily newspapers or on the evening news broadcasts. They are concerned for their safety and for the safety of our community. This bill seeks to address some of those concerns.


This bill is part of the government's comprehensive response to the current situation we find ourselves in—in particular, the challenges we will have dealing with those Australians participating in and supporting foreign conflicts. Here in Australia, our intelligence agencies have identified issues. Our law enforcement agencies and defence personal need the legislative framework to be able to deal with the threats posed by those wanting to harm Australia and Australians' way of life. This legislation is not the result of any ideologically driven aims; it is simply the result of instances of operational needs identified by law enforcement agencies. The bill was subjected to review and scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in its 20 November 2014 report. I note that the government has accepted, or accepted in principle, all of the committee's recommendations.


I want to also acknowledge some of the comments in newspapers about these amendments. Firstly, the fact that we can debate issues should be celebrated. We live, as I said earlier, in a strong democracy where we have freedom. I assure those who have some concerns that this legislation gives excess powers to the ASIO and ASIS chiefs in respect of 'emergency authorisations' that I believe these concerns have been fully alleviated by the Attorney-General's second reading speech. However, this government takes its responsibility very seriously, and the powers contained in these amendments are vital to address the threat of terrorism. Our laws cannot be static. We live in a changing environment, but these amendments have been drafted with the appropriate checks and balances. We cannot be a reactive government, acting only after a serious act of terrorism occurs on our soil. We must be a proactive government—and we are. We are strengthening existing pieces of legislation that do not adequately address current domestic security threats.


As I noted, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill has been introduced to address urgent operational needs identified by our intelligence, defence and law enforcement agencies. The amendments address three key areas: (1) enhancing the control order regime to allow the Australian Federal Police to seek control orders in relation to a broader range of individuals of security concern, and to streamline the application process (2) better facilitating the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, which supports and cooperates with the Australian Defence Force on military operations, and (3) making it easier for intelligence agencies to gain emergency ministerial authorisations to undertake activities in the performance of their statutory functions.


To look closely at enhancing the control order regime, the existing control order regime is already subject to significant safeguard and oversight mechanisms, including through the need to obtain both the Attorney-General's consent and a court order, which will continue to apply. But the current capacity of law enforcement agencies to protect the public from terrorist acts can and should be enhanced. This bill provides these enhancements to the control order regime through amendments to the Criminal Code. This includes expanding the ground upon which a senior AFP member can, with the Attorney-General's consent, request an interim control order to circumstances where the order would substantially assist in preventing support for or the facilitation of a terrorist act, or an individual's engagement in a hostile activity in a foreign country. In short, enhancements like this will enable our security forces to function faster and more effectively, which is fantastic news.


On facilitating the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, a key role of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service is to provide intelligence support to our Australian Defence Force, which is currently providing military support to Iraq in the fight against terrorist organisations. In using any intelligence provided by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Defence Force is bound by its rules of engagement.


I must say that the Australian Defence Force is doing a fantastic job. Earlier this year, I had the chance to travel to Afghanistan as part of the parliamentary military exchange program with three of my parliamentary colleagues.


It was fantastic to see the men and women in the Australian Defence Force, and experience their confidence and professionalism and the passion with which they carry out their work. They really are doing a wonderful job. We had the chance to sit in on some of the briefings for the rules of engagement in Afghanistan.


The government will continue to invest in the Australian Defence Force. Recently we have seen more of our budget committed to military hardware and equipment that is cutting edge, which the ADF need in order to carry out the work. This is in stark contrast to Labor, who cut $16 billion from the ADF in their six years of government. 


These rules of engagement are developed in consultation with the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department to ensure compliance with Australia's international law obligations. Without information like the intelligence that ASIS provides, the ADF is not only hindered, but also potentially put in danger. There is no point in having a defence force if the defence force is not in the best position to defend its nation and its personnel. By allowing ASIS to better support and cooperate with the ADF, we can ensure our defence force is adequately informed and fully understanding of new developments.


I stress again that all of the existing safeguards and oversight mechanisms in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 will continue to apply. These include the statutory thresholds for the granting of authorisations, ministerial reporting requirements, and the independent oversight of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Likewise, strong oversight mechanisms will apply to the provision of emergency ministerial authorisations.


At this point in time, when we know that terrorism is a threat to Australians; it is paramount that we act, because typically in these kinds of situations, governments have only two options: acting early or too late. I am all for freedom. As many of my colleagues will agree, we simply cannot let terrorist threats change our lives or scare us out of being ourselves. If we do so, terrorism has won us over.


But we cannot turn away from the fact that terrorism is a very real threat. My constituents know that. I know that. The government of Australia knows that. Even when I am in Canberra participating in the debates in this place I am very conscious of how this legislation is viewed by those meeting at the coffee shop in North Lakes, by the mums and dads taking their children to school in Bracken Ridge, or at the pensioners' meetings in Redcliffe. This is all about the safety of Australians. These amendments give those mums and dads, grandmothers, grandfathers and pensioners comfort knowing that their security agencies, law enforcement agencies and our Australian Defence Forces are looking after their community and knowing that the safety of their children and grandchildren are paramount. They can plan their future in the knowledge that the hard decisions are being made by their government.


Importantly, I stress again that the appropriate checks and balances are in place. Members of parliament representing communities all across Australia know that there is a threat and that we have to do something to address it. As the Prime Minister the Hon. Tony Abbott said, 'We can't guarantee that there will never be a terrorist attack. All we can guarantee is we are as well prepared as possible.'

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (13:11):  I would like to thank members of parliament for their contributions in this debate on what is a critically important piece of counterterrorism legislation. In particular, I would like to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, who have made such important contributions that have resulted in recommendations that the government has been pleased to implement through the government amendments that have been moved in the Senate. These amendments are now reflected in this bill, which the House is dealing with today.


As you would be aware, and as noted in the media, we are living in a heightened security threat environment as a result of the continued conflict in Iraq and Syria, and in particular, the threat posed by Australians participating in and supporting these foreign conflicts and Australians who go to these war zones and undertake training with extremist groups.


Sadly, we are also aware that this is not just an Australian problem. It is one shared by many of our partners. We have certainly been very alive, as we have created and crafted our response to this issue in Australia, to what has been happening overseas. 


Currently, Australia's domestic counterterrorism legislation has concentrated on those intent on committing acts of terrorism but this bill, very importantly, expands the preventative purposes of the control order regime to counter this threat to allow the Australian Federal Police to seek control orders in relation to a broader range of individuals of security concern—namely, those who support or facilitate terrorists and foreign fighters.


These amendments respond to law enforcement advice that there are individuals of very serious security concern who are not covered by the existing grounds for making a control order. Some of these people are not directly carrying out acts of terrorism in Australia or hostile activities overseas, but they are providing the necessary support for terrorists and foreign fighters, and their activities facilitate others to engage in terrorism or to fight with these extremist organisations overseas. 


I will just turn to some of the specific points that have been made in this debate that I would like to counter—in particular some of the comments that have been made by the member for Melbourne, who noted that this bill will allow controls to be placed on individuals without going through long-standing processes in criminal law. But the control order regime has actually been in place for 10 years, and this regime responds to extraordinary circumstances of threat to Australia's national security interests. 


The expansion of the grounds for obtaining a control order responds to advice from law enforcement that some Australians have taken on roles of supporting and facilitating others to engage terrorism offences or to travel to conflict zones and then to return to Australia with the capabilities acquired from fighting or training with these evil terrorist groups. 


From a public safety perspective, the threat posed by these individuals is just as great as the risk posed by those who would directly engage in terrorist acts or foreign incursions. To counter this particular threat, it is therefore rightly appropriate that we expand the preventative purposes of the control order regime.


In his misrepresentation of the control order regime the member for Melbourne linked control orders and the bill to Australia authorising detention of a person, without that person committing an offence. Firstly, control orders do not authorise detention. Secondly, it is astounding that the member for Melbourne and the Greens, if they had their way, would only allow action to be taken after a terrorist act had taken place. It is the first priority of any government to keep its people safe, and this means providing our law enforcement and security agencies with the tools they need to prevent terrorist acts. Control orders, which have only been used twice since 2005, provide the government with such a mechanism.


The bill also amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, to streamline procedural authorisation requirements for agencies governed by that act to collect intelligence on Australians overseas. This will ensure that our agencies are as agile as they need to be within the contemporary security environment, particularly in emergency circumstances.


A key amendment will be to enhance the ability of ASIS to provide timely assistance to the Australian Defence Force, in support of military operations. After introducing this bill into the Senate, on 29 October, the Attorney-General referred it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, under the very able chairmanship of the member for Wannon, Mr Dan Tehan. They tabled their report on 20 November, and the committee made 16 recommendations, including—and I think very importantly—that this bill be passed. The government has accepted in principle all of the recommendations that were made by the parliamentary joint committee. We recognise the valuable bipartisan work that this committee does. It is a committee that works very well. Again, I acknowledge the very able chairmanship of the member for Wannon, and I thank all of those members on the committee who participated in that inquiry.


I wanted to respond to a couple of other comments that have been made in the course of this debate. I welcome the Labor Party's support for it, but I was disappointed to hear in the debate some inaccurate and misleading comments, particularly in relation to the fact that we had failed to engage the community on some of this legislation. This is simply not true. There has been a very extensive amount of community consultation that has been undertaken by the Prime Minister, by the Attorney-General, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. They have engaged with senior leaders of the Muslim community in Australia. It has also happened on a more informal level when members of our party room were encouraged to go out and talk directly to Muslim communities in their electorates. That is something I certainly did. I know that many other members also took advantage of that opportunity. So I completely reject the idea that we have not effectively consulted with the community. As the Attorney-General has previously said, the purpose of these meetings was specifically to engage the community on the government's intention—to engage with them in a way that makes them partners with the government in seeking to protect their youngsters from being enticed into the snares of terrorist organisations that are engaged in war-fighting in the Middle East. We have certainly been pleased to partner with the community to do all we can to explain the government's intentions here. I think that engagement has been very effective.


This is actually probably a greater level of engagement than would be usual when it comes to government legislation. But of course this is not an ordinary issue. We cannot possibly be effective in our fight against terrorist organisations in snaring our youngsters to go to the Middle East and fight without working in partnership with the community. So we have been very mindful that we need to do that. I think those meetings have been very productive. I am very pleased that the community leaders we met with in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra actually expressed to the government their appreciation for that level of consultation. They let us know that they wanted to work effectively with us on these difficult issues, and they shared with us their belief that they want the government to keep Australia safe.


I was also disappointed to hear opposition comments about our Countering Violent Extremism program and some allegations that there has been a delay in the rollout of this program. Again, that simply is not true. We do not want to rush the design of this program. It is important that we get it right. The focus of the new CVE program is the $13.4 million investment. We are designing it to intervene to stop young Australians from being radicalised to violent extremism. This is a new program. It builds on research we have undertaken. It has used our experience. Also, very importantly, it has used experience gained overseas, because these are not issues that are unique to Australia. The radicalisation to violence process is unique to each person that undergoes it. This is why we need to design a program that is flexible as well as being effective. It is important that the interventions we undertake through this program actually respond to the individual's needs, and we need to identify the best way to help them.


The Attorney-General's Department has been engaged with world-leading experts and practitioners at both the federal and state level. We have worked very effectively with our partners in this important work. Considerable effort has been undertaken, including extensive consultation with key community stakeholders, state and territory governments and the professional and community sectors.


The next phase of our engagement will be with key communities in the coming weeks. Further information will be made available on the web site livingsafertogether.gov.au, and via an email to those who advise us of their interest.


Other core elements of the government's program include addressing online radicalisation and reducing the impact of terrorists' use of social media, by helping people to develop the digital skills needed to critically assess terrorists' claims and promote alternative and then positive messages online.


I thank all of my colleagues who have participated in this debate and recognise the need for these important reforms. The Abbott government is undertaking a comprehensive review and reform of our national security architecture to ensure that our counterterrorism framework is effective and targeted to our current national security threat, and to make sure that our agencies are supported by the legislative framework we have that enables them to respond to emerging and future security threats. This bill has a direct impact on the ability of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to support our defence force in particular, so that they can continue to protect Australia and Australians. I therefore commend the bill to the House as another part of the arsenal we are providing our agencies with to keep our community safe.


Question agreed to.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (13:30):  Today I rise to condemn this government's higher education changes that are currently before the Senate. What we will see is $100,000 degrees occurring across our higher education sector. Just to give one example about what this would mean to people accessing higher education, I would like to share with the House my mother's story.


My mother grew up in Western Sydney in Mount Druitt. Because of family circumstances—her father was dying of cancer—she had to leave school, give up the scholarship she had received under Whitlam to go to university, to work to help pay the bills. My mother then decided, later on in life, because her cleaning job had become difficult because she had had several workplace injuries, to go to university. She enrolled at the age of 47. Not only did she do an undergraduate degree; she went on to do her honours and then her PhD. Today she is an academic at the University of Canberra. Tonight I will see her for the first time in a month because she will have just returned from overseas where she was presenting two papers at two conferences in Europe. That is a higher education success story. That is my mother's story.


But my mother would not have enrolled to go to university under these changes, because a woman of 47 would not have earnt enough in her working life to pay back a degree costing anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000. This is the problem with these reforms, and this is why they should be voted down in the Senate. (Time expired)

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:16):  In November of last year we proposed a matter of public importance that the government was not the government they had promised to be before the election, as shown by their actions afterwards. It was true in November 2013 and it is even truer today. There is a big gap, growing bigger, between what this government said before the last election and what they do every day. We have seen an unfair budget, friendless and built upon lies. We have seen the cuts to the ABC and SBS, where this Prime Minister expects to get a medal for telling Australians that he lied to them before the election. We already know that, Prime Minister. He talks about the Australian Defence Force pay. Before the election and, indeed, since the election, this government say they love our defence forces but then put in a proposition which would see the wages of our defence forces fall behind cost of living. Yesterday this Prime Minister said, 'What a good fellow I am, because I am going to hand back the leave entitlements that the defence forces already had.' This is a man who makes his own parsimony a virtue. He is still cutting the wages of defence forces, and they are not keeping pace with the cost of living. 


Of course, we have the debacle over the submarines. Before the last election, the hapless Minister for Defence said that he would build the submarines at the ASC, and now he will not and he will not even have a competitive tender. We have the euphemistically named 'Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs', yet there is half a billion dollars being cut from Indigenous affairs in Australia. There is the misnomer—the complete passing off of himself—where he calls himself the 'Prime Minister for Women', yet he is putting a new $500 tax on the superannuation of over two million working women. Before the last election, this Prime Minister made a hero of himself by tackling former Prime Minister Gillard. He said that he would be a Prime Minister who would be more honest than any we have ever seen in Australian history, but he governs on lies, nasty surprises and pathetic excuses. 


They know they have a problem in the government, because they are leaking like sieves, complaining about each other. They know they have a problem. What is worse is that Australians know that they have a problem, because they have got a government who is not adding up to what it said it would be. What is the strategy we get from the Prime Minister? It is a 46-minute therapy session. He has read what John Howard did in 2001 and has said, 'Oh, the book says I must go out and pretend to be contrite.' So he goes out for 46 minutes, does his first press conference on domestic matters in months and expects Australians to be sufficiently grateful that the Prime Minister has turned up for work on one 46-minute period in the last two months and said: 'Oh, that must be a reboot. We must have reset the government.' 


When we thought that the government were willing to try to reboot, we never predicted that they would deploy the secret weapon of the government—Christopher Pyne on the text. That is the latest reset strategy. They have had the barnacle removal—the barnacle debacle—reset. They have a council of war. Goodness only knows what that group of older white Australian men are doing in their council of war. Maybe they might want a second woman in their cabinet. No, no; I get ahead of myself. Instead, we have the Prime Minister deploying Christopher Pyne texting, and we have as our evidence for this Senator Glenn Lazarus—a man who knows no fear on the playing field. The government have deployed a secret weapon—which makes such a skilled and powerful athlete slightly annoyed at the very least. We have a Minister for Education who is doing more texting than Shane Warne! The problem he has is that the Senate know exactly what they are voting for. No amount of text messages from Christopher Pyne—and he still has to explain how he got Senator Lazarus's phone number, because Senator Lazarus says that he did not give it to him—no amount of unsought attention from the Minister for Education and no amount of 'demon dialling' from the worst Minister for Education in the history of Federation changes a bad and rotten set of proposals. It is not the message that is the problem; it is not even the text messages that are the problem—annoying as they are; it is the plan to slug Australians with a debt sentence and make it harder for ordinary kids to go to university. 


They have not changed their policies. The Prime Minister thinks he can turn up and say that he is 'not in compliance'—the man mangles the English language—'with what he said before the election.' This means he lied to people. What he does not get is that changing your tactics does not actually change the substance. The Australian people do not want a GP tax on the sick and the vulnerable. The Australian people do not want $100,000 university degrees holding back young people and older people from fulfilling their potential. The Australian people do not want a petrol tax increase—which they were promised before the election would not occur—pushing up their cost of living. The Australian people do not want the indexation rate on pensions cut, robbing older Australians of up to $80 a week over the next 10 years—demonstrating what this government really thinks about pensioners. They do not want cuts to schools and hospitals, stopping us from being smarter and healthy. 


Fixing the budget will take more than texts from Christopher Pyne. It will take more than some angry messages from the former Victorian Liberal government to the Abbott government. Why on earth did they introduce a petrol tax, member for Aston, in the first week of the election? It is a good question, isn't it? We will get to the bottom of that one day. Apart from all of these matters, where we have a government of broken promises, implementing their unfair budget, desperately pretending that the problem is not their unfair budget but just the way they are selling it, there is a greater problem underway in this country a year and a quarter into the administration of the Abbott government. We are at a tipping point on the question of trust. During question time this week, the Prime Minister has loved saying, 'You can trust me.' He puffs his chest up, swaggers around and says, 'I can be trusted. Even if I haven't actually kept my word, I can be trusted.' He thinks the simple repetition of the word 'trust' makes him trustworthy.


On the contrary, there is a gap of unprecedented size emerging in Australian politics between the trust that is given by the people who are governed to those that they elect and there is a gap between the trust which is given by the Australian people and the delivery on that trust by the government that they elected. This failure of trust, this emerging gap, which is the real reason for the growing unpopularity of the government, arises from the paucity of principles and persuasion of a government that lacks leadership and lacks commitment. The lesson from Victoria, in which a first-term government was voted out—and which we know the Prime Minister wants to pretend had nothing to do with the Abbott government—is in part that they told the teachers of Victoria that they wanted them to be the highest paid and then attacked them, they said they respected education and then attacked the institution of TAFE and they said they respected the work of the paramedics and then attacked the ambulance officers and turned their back on them. That is the same problem that lies at the heart of the Abbott government. Those opposite say one thing before an election and then do something else straight after getting elected.


Before the election the Liberal and National parties sloganeered. Led by the Prime Minister, they sloganeered, they simplified, they promised the world. Indeed, many on the backbench must have wondered why Prime Minister Tony Abbott made so many promises, because now they are a noose around the neck of the government. The problem is that the government knew that once they got elected they were not going to keep the promises they made. They knew that. They were always just going to do what their right-wing ideology wanted them to do, which is cut and slash and wreck the nature of this country. The problem is that when the government breaks the trust of the Australian people our democracy pays a price for it. The problem is that the government is traducing the political process in this country. The government is leaving the Australian parliament a more diminished place.


The  Prime Minister loves to complain about the opposition. The problem is that it is the Prime Minister's own conduct, his own inability to concede error, his own unwillingness to keep the faith with the Australian people that is damaging the Australian economy and is damaging Australian political processes. They complain about the Senate. If they just stuck to what they said they were going to do they would not have to worry about the vagaries of individuals and with the way they chase them. We have heard the stories from the crossbench about the reckless desperation of the government lobbying. The government says to the crossbenchers, 'What do you want?' There is a tone now of begging in the government's approach to the Senate. The government put itself in the position of being dependent on a hostile crossbench because it insists on breaking its promises and wrecking the Australian people. The tendencies of the centre of Australian politics are being damaged by the move to the extremities by a government that is sadly adrift. This is a government in search of a compass to find out what it should do.


Those opposite are debasing and dividing this country with their unfair budget. Never in political history have we seen a budget still being debated in December. That is the truth and they know it. This is not a government seeking to improve this country; this is a government seeking to grovel in its own low level of mediocrity. Labor will do better than this. Next year Labor will not only be fierce in our resistance to the government, we will not only hold this government to account but, as we approach the next election, provide a better alternative to Australia than a list of Tony Abbott's lies, as long as that is.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:26):  It takes a lot of courage for members of the most incompetent government in Australian political history to come in here and lecture us on policy and budget failure, on wrecking the country and on losing faith with the Australian people. The Labor Party in the Rudd-Gillard years was the most incompetent and most inept government that Australia has ever seen. I know that there have been bad Labor governments in the past. We could look at the Keating government and the recession that we had to have. We could look at the Whitlam government and see economic vandalism on an epic scale. But nothing matches the Rudd-Gillard years for the sheer waste, sheer incompetence, sheer ineptitude and sheer tragedy that they inflicted on the Australian people.


The Leader of the Opposition was not just the great assassin of two prime ministers under the former government he was one of the key architects of all of the policy disasters that they oversaw. The member for McMahon, who is in the chamber, was not just the Treasurer for some of that time but also the immigration minister, who oversaw one of the great disasters. The member for Ballarat, who also sits on the front bench, was a frontbencher during the time of the previous government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Sydney, sitting opposite me now, was a senior member of that government. Half of the shadow cabinet today were key architects of the disasters that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government inflicted on the Australian people.


We should never let the Australian public forget the incompetence, disaster and waste that those opposite inflicted. I would like to outline three categories in relation to the former Labor government that we should never forget. The first is the human tragedy of the former government's policy failures. The greatest human tragedy occurred in relation to boat policy and border protection. I am glad that we have the former immigration minister, the member for McMahon, sitting in the chamber, because he was one of the architects of their policy. Their border protection policy is arguably the greatest policy failure in Australian political history. When the Labor government came to power in 2007 there were no boats coming, there were only four people in detention, there were no people drowning at sea and there were no children in detention. They decided to unravel the Howard Pacific solution, which policy worked. What did we see as a result of their policies? We saw 800 boats and 50,000 people arrive on our shores, an $11 billion blowout, 1,300 people drown at sea and almost 2,000 children in detention centres where there had been none beforehand. This is the raw human tragedy of the failure of the Labor governments in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. We have had to deal with this mess and we have dealt with this mess to stop those human tragedies.


The boats have now stopped coming. There are fewer children in detention now than there was at the end of the Labor years. Almost half the number of children are in detention. There are no people drowning at sea anymore because of the work which this government has done in fixing up the absolute disaster which the Labor government inflicted and the human tragedy that they inflicted. They should be utterly ashamed for that policy failure. It is one of the greatest policy failures in Australian political history. They should never forget that. But the tragedy is that they have not learned from it, because they are still determined to go to the next election and not proceed with our policies, which are working. They have still not committed to turning boats around when it is safe to do so. That is one of the key measures that have saved children from drowning at sea and saved the boats from arriving on Australian soil. That is one of the great tragedies also.


The other policy failure on a monumental scale, which is an enormous human tragedy as well, is the pink batts disaster. This pink batts idea came out during the GFC. I do not know whose idea it was to think, 'We have got a GFC, a global financial crisis, so I know what we will do: we will put pink batts in everybody's roofs.' What an idea! It was not just the policy idea that was the great failure but the implementation of that idea which again had financial consequences and had enormously tragic human consequences. We know that as a result of that pink batts disaster—which the Labor Party oversaw and members who are sitting there now, the deputy leader and the member for Swan, oversaw—that 220 houses burnt to the ground. It saw four tragic deaths. They are lives that we will never get back.


That is the human consequence of epic policy failure, which the Labor Party has never faced up to. There was a royal commission into the pink batts debacle. The royal commission said, after considering the full policy failure here:


The reality is that the Australian government conceived of, devised, designed and implemented a program that enabled very large numbers of inexperienced workers - often engaged by unscrupulous and avaricious employers or head contractors, who were themselves inexperienced in insulation installation - to undertake potentially dangerous work. … It should have done more to protect them.


It goes on:


In my view each death would, and should, not have occurred had the HIP been properly designed and implemented.


I do not raise this for any other reason than to point out that when you have policy failure, it can literally lead to deaths. It has done so. It did so in relation to border protection and it did so in relation to the Home Insulation Program.


The next category of policy failure is waste. I could go on for hours and hours, if not days, talking about the policy failures of waste. I think perhaps the very greatest one of them all was Labor's NBN, which Malcolm Turnbull is now slowly getting back in control of. In 2007, they promised the NBN and they costed it to be $4.7 billion. That was their policy: $4.7 billion in 2007. Then on the back of a napkin on a plane, they redesigned it and it came up to being $43 billion. An independent study found that actually it probably would cost $73 billion to be fully implemented. That is only a $68 billion difference between their initial proposal! After six years of promising they were going to have fibre to every single home, how many people actually had it? Fewer than 0.5 per cent of households actually achieved it. They only achieved less than 20 per cent of their initial rollout target and they only achieved less than seven per cent of their target for paying customers. That is just one where we saw waste on an epic scale.


We all know about the school halls. It was $16.2 billion program. We know that between $6 billion and $8 billion was basically wasted because of over costs. School halls were built in schools that were closing down. We know about the $900 cheques that were sent to backpackers and 27,000 Australians living overseas. Those $900 cheques were sent to 21,000 dead people. This is waste at an absolutely epic scale. We are not going to be lectured to by members of the front bench who were the key architects of this waste and oversaw these things. They had $67 million to administer a set-top box program. They had the live animal exports, which they shut down after seeing a television program. They then had to spend $100 million dollars to try to get the industry going back up again.


This is the type of waste which they oversaw. This is the type of waste that has led to tragic human consequences, and has led to financial mismanagement on an absolutely epic scale. This is exactly the type of thing that we are getting back on top of. (Time expired)

 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:36):  Every now and again, I walk into the kitchen at home and I find a four-year-old there who was got melted ice cream all around his mouth, a few little chips of chocolate hanging out of the corners of his mouth and a little wooden stick in his hand. I say, 'Louis, have you helped yourself to a mini Magnum?' He stands there, with the stick in his hand and the chocolate falling out of the corners of his mouth, and says, 'No, mum. No.' I say, 'Louis, it is very bad to help yourself to a mini Magnum, but it is much, much worse to lie about it.' He says, 'No, mum, I didn't.' Then he waits a bit and he shifts from foot to foot. He then bursts into tears and he says, 'Yes, mum. I did it.'

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

Ms PLIBERSEK:
  They are mini Magnums; they would not satisfy you at all! He says, 'Yes, mum, I did it.' And there is relief on his face when he tells me he did it and we have a little cuddle, and I say, 'It is all right, Louis. The most important thing is you told the truth when it mattered.' I can tell you that it is kind of endearing in a four year old—the struggle with the truth. 'Have I done the right thing? Have I been caught? What happens now?' It is not so endearing when you are talking about the Prime Minister of our nation. The lie is bad enough, but the lying about lying is phenomenal. There is not an Australian who does not remember that famous election-eve quote:


No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST, and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


There is no-one who does not now know that quote. And yet we still have this persistence from the Prime Minister and the government: 'No, no, nothing to see here.' We had it again today. After spending three-quarters of an hour yesterday telling journalists about the reboot—'We are going to reboot; it is all new and fresh from here on in.'—we had the same old question time today of denial and dissembling.


It actually reminded me that it is not so much a reboot as a complete rewind to opposition. Instead of a government prepared to stand up, argue its case, put a positive vision for the nation, talk about the things they are achieving or that they would like to achieve, what do we have? We had minister after minister talking about us and when we were in government. We just had the last speaker talk about us and when we were in government. Even more bizarrely, we had the health minister, who never asked a question as a shadow minister, now getting up and not answering any questions as the health minister. It is just this kind of generic rant about what the Labor Party has done. We have not seen a reset; we have seen a complete rewind to their time of opposition. 


What is even worse than this? You would expect a prime minister not to lie—of course you would expect a prime minister not to lie. But this particular prime minister made so much of being purer than Caesar's wife when he was the opposition leader—when he said things like, 'It would be a government of no surprises and no excuses; a government that accepts it will be judged more by its deeds than its mere words; I want to be known as a prime minister who keeps his commitments.' He said, of course—there are so many quotes—that:


… Australians are sick of leaders who play politics ahead of governing the country and who blame everyone but themselves when things go wrong and the numbers do not add up.


We have had from this Prime Minister a series of broken promises and a wall of dissembling about those broken promises. And when that does not work and he presses the reset button, they do not reset but they rewind right back to the negativity of opposition—to the petty, complaining, whingeing, blaming of their period in opposition.


This government promised to make things better for Australians. All they have done is make things worse. They have cut health; they have cut education; they have cut pensions. They will be judged by their deeds. (Time expired)

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (15:41):  As we have said before—and this MPI sums it up again—whilst those on the other side have some differences, there is one thing that unites them all: they are all great pretenders. They pretended right through their period in government that the budget did not matter. They pretended they could spend more than they were bringing in. Then they even pretended, as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pointed out today, that they were back in surplus. And today they continue to pretend.


The Leader of the Opposition has moved this matter of public importance on the budget. It is obviously important to him. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke second. That is a bit of a surprise. We thought the shadow Treasurer might be speaking at some point, but no. The leaders moved this. And there is not a word of concession about Labor's fiscal failure over all those years. They inherited a surplus; they inherited $45 billion in the bank. They spent all of that and then they ran us into an incredible amount of debt over those six years. After forecasting and promising surpluses on more than 500 occasions, when they did not get there they just pretended they were there. The Leader of the Opposition—and all of them—told the electorate that we were back in surplus when we were not. This is the gall of those opposite. And now that they are in opposition, they are voting against every attempt to fix their mess. They are not only voting against our proposals; they are voting against their own. They are voting against $5 billion worth of savings that they announced and announced they would legislate. So they do not just vote against our budget; they vote against their own when they are in opposition. This takes some gall.


Those opposite have a united position on forgetting their period in office. From 8 September, they have forgotten everything they did. It goes right through their approach to policy. Not only did they predict a surplus and then promise they had a surplus when none existed, on so many other policy measures they have done the same thing. The shadow Treasurer, who is not here, of course, is the architect of their alternative budget. What a wonderful track record from the shadow Treasurer! During his time in government—he actually started back in 2007 as the Assistant Treasurer—he established Fuelwatch and he established GroceryWatch.




Mr Sukkar:
  How did that go?




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Well, he became the fool of Fuelwatch; he became the goose of GroceryWatch. Then he went on, in the 2009 budget, to wipe out employee share ownership in this country.


Swannie gets a lot of blame for a lot of things—and so he should. But I know for a fact that this is one measure he left in the hands of the then Assistant Treasurer. He left him with one revenue measure, and he snap-froze employee share ownership in this country. Then, earlier this year, as the architect of the destruction of employee share ownership, he had the gall to welcome our restoration of what he wrecked, and not only that, but to say:


… Labor of course welcomes the … decision to ease restrictions on employee share schemes—


his restrictions that he implemented! And then he went on to say:


In March, Labor called for changes to … better support new ideas and innovation and we are pleased the Government has listened—


pleased the government has listened to a call he made to reverse a disastrous policy change he implemented when in government. What utter hypocrisy and falsehood!


He changed from Assistant Treasurer to immigration minister, as we well know. But then, if he felt any sense of guilt at all for his employee share debacle, you would think he would have rectified it at the first opportunity—which is not now, as shadow Treasurer; it was when he became Treasurer. You would have thought it would have been one of the first things he did when he became Treasurer under the former member for Griffith. But, no; this MPI from the Leader of the Opposition and from those opposite is another exercise in pretending—pretending they never wrecked the budget; pretending it does not matter. And in opposition they will go on pretending just as they did in government, but what they will not ever do is to offer a solution to Australia's problems.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:46):  The former Governor of New York Mario Cuomo was famous for saying that you campaign in poetry and you govern in prose. Unfortunately, with this government that we have, they campaigned on honesty and they govern in lies. They started this year all puffed up—they had the smell of ministerial leather in their nostrils; they had the electoral wind at their backs—and now they end it with a whimper, broken down and busted up as a government, limping towards Christmas but determined to deny Australians the festive season that they deserve.


There has never been a bigger gulf between promise and delivery than what we have seen in the first year of the Abbott government. Tony Abbott promised that there would be an adrenaline charge of confidence in the economy, and we get a note today from Commonwealth Bank economists saying that confidence is the missing ingredient in the economy—not an adrenaline charge, but a lack of confidence in the economy.


The Prime Minister had the nerve to say that it has been a year of achievement. They said that they would make the budget better; they have made it worse. They said that they would make living standards better; they have made them worse. They said that they would make the cost of living better, and they have made it much, much worse. They said they would be part of the solution, and instead they have turned out to be the problem.


The Prime Minister also said today that the budget this year and the government this year have changed people's lives—and I agree with him. He has damaged the aspirations of people who want to go to university. He has jacked up the price of petrol. He has jacked up the price of medicine. He has introduced a GP tax to attack universal health care in this country. All of these things will change people's lives, for the worse. He has pulled $80 billion out of schools and hospitals, as their own budget documents demonstrate. So he has changed people's lives.


He puts this down, of course, to a change in the atmospherics. It is not the atmospherics that need to change; it is the government and their budget. But there is a stink in the air, and that stink is that carcass which was described by those opposite: the budget hanging around their neck. They say that they need to reboot the message, but what they actually need to do is to restart the budget—to redo the budget—because the judgements that they have made are damaging the Australian economy. In getting things so badly wrong, this hopeless Treasurer is damaging the economy.


The Australian people do not want better spin; they want their country back. They want our nation to be a place where the fair go thrives, and where people look after each other and look out for each other. They want to recognise in our country one of the great civilisations in the world. They want these things advanced not trashed. They want the fair go advanced not trashed. They do not want better talking points; they want a government with better values. They want a government with values consistent with the best of our nation and not the worst of our nation.


Australians want a new government for Christmas but, in the absence of that, they would settle for a new budget. The government should start again in this mini-budget—the Treasurer should start from the beginning and come up with a budget that is fair to Australians.


I was reading Ross Gittins who said in The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday:


The first and biggest reason the government is having to modify or abandon so many of its measures is the budget's blatant unfairness. In 40 years of budget-watching I've seen plenty of unfair budgets, but never one as bad as this.


Even The Australian is getting into Joe Hockey for his performance in this budget. Even The Australian says:


The key player here must be the Treasurer but he has been all but invisible in past weeks and only a sporadic performer since the budget.


It is little wonder that Campbell Newman is saying that Tony Abbott is not needed in Queensland for the election that is coming up in Queensland—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Box office poison!




Dr CHALMERS:
  As the member for Hunter says, he is box office poison in Queensland, just like he was in Victoria.


So the Abbott government ends the year not waving but drowning. And all of us on this side of the House end the year doing what we do best: we end the year standing up for people in our communities and right around the country—standing up for people against the unfair attacks being made by those opposite. And we will continue to stand up for people. We will continue to look out for people and look after people. We will continue to defend the fair go. But we will do another thing on top of that, as important as it is that we defend the fair go in this country—we also want to advance it.


So, as to all of the terrible things being done to people on low and middle incomes in this country, as the year ends, all of us on this side of the House commit to never rest while those opposite are attacking people in our communities, but also to come up with policies for the future that do not just defend the fair go in this country but advance it.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (15:51):  On this matter of public importance it is really hard to know where to start. Regrettably, there is an inexhaustible reservoir of Labor incompetence and mismanagement to draw from. The opposition is in no position to lecture the government on budgetary management and policy failures. The whole premise of this MPI is the equivalent of taking marital advice from Hugh Hefner. Some of the outlandish claims in the last six years have included promising a surplus in 2012-13 on no less than 500 occasions and they delivered not a single surplus, not one. Labor's incompetency allowed gross debt to rise to $667 billion.


Nothing could better highlight the difference between the government and the opposition than this. We are responsible for the tough but fair fix; Labor is responsible for the problems. Labor left a budget position that will not return to surplus within the next decade unless urgent remedial action is taken. No-one ever said it was going to be easy to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. 


Some staggering examples of non-existent service delivery from the Labor Party include these: those wonderful GP superclinics in cow paddocks! When in government Labor promised 64 superclinics and only delivered a measly 33. A local example was the Redcliffe Superclinic. It was built seven years after it was promised at a staggering cost of $15 million. Imagine the medical services that that could have provided—the hundreds of mammograms and the hundreds of doctors services that could have been provided. 


There were the non-existent child care centres. Labor promised 260 child care centres when in government and delivered only 38, a shortfall of 222 centres. That is a delivery rate of just over 14 per cent said—a pathetic result even by Labor's standards. That is 222 communities across Australia that do not have a child care centre as a result of Labor's broken promises.


Labor made a mess of just about everything they touched. A typical example is Labor's regional development grant mess. An Auditor-General's report has revealed that the Rudd-Gillett-Rudd Labor government went out of its way to abuse taxpayers' money under the regional development grants. Today we have heard that of the 42 grant recommendations, Labor overturned 34 of those recommendations.




Mr Nikolic:
  Shameful!




Ms GAMBARO:
  It was another Labor shame, that is right, and Labor should apologise. Once again we see the extent of Labor's inability to responsibly handle precious—and they are—taxpayer dollars. What we see here is Labor's typical practice of treating Treasury like a union slush fund. Unless we take action debt will rise to $667 billion within 10 years. That will leave Australia with a debt of around $23,000 per person.


Under the previous Labor government more than $16 billion was stripped from the defence budget. This included a 10.5 per cent cut in 2012-13, the largest single cut to the defence budget since the end of the Korean conflict. This resulted in the share of GDP spent on defence falling to 1.56 per cent, the lowest since 1938.


Who can forget these fantastic contributions to Labor's greatest hits of budgetary calamities? The Rudd-Gillard government's six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement delivered higher taxes, record boat arrivals and debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. Labor turned $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt of well over $200 billion, the fastest deterioration in debt in dollar terms and as a share of GDP in modern Australian history. Labor's debt is already costing $1 billion a month in net interest payments, and that is all borrowed money.


We have a government that is turning this around. We did not cause the problem but, unlike Labor, we are committed to fixing this problem. I would like to just say that all of my election commitments have been delivered, particularly the commitment on the new gate at Enoggera Barracks. We are about delivering. We are about turning budgets into surpluses. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (15:56):  Given that the topic for today's matter of public importance is the Prime Minister's policy failures, one does feel spoiled for choice. There is no doubt that the unfairness and broken promises that have characterised the government's actions in its first year of office played a significant role in the defeat of the Liberal Party in Victoria on Saturday. Voters took the opportunity to take a swing at a Prime Minister who talked up a storm about trust and integrity and keeping your word when he was opposition leader, then forgot about all of those things once he was elected.


But given the time constraints I will confine myself to just three policy failures. First, the proposal to deregulate student fees. I appeal as loudly as I can to the Senate crossbenches not to let the government increase student fees. I find it indecent that my generation, beneficiaries of all the career opportunities that came through Gough Whitlam's abolition of student fees, can pull the rug out from under this generation and deprive them of the same opportunities. Frankly, young people deserve better. A tertiary education is important for young people, as is technical and further education. But it is also important for the nation. We need to educate and train and skill our young people. It is unspeakably short sighted for the government to make tertiary education opportunity a function of parental wealth.


Second, the hostility to public transport. The Prime Minister should accept the verdict of the Victorian people on the weekend and abandon the East West Link tollway. Melbourne's never-before-seen rate of population growth—200 people per day, 1,500 per week, 75,000 each year—is creating massive traffic congestion. But study after study shows that the better way to deal with traffic congestion is public transport infrastructure, not more freeways. The Prime Minister should not incite the new Labor Premier to break his election commitments. He should not blackmail the Victorian people by threatening them with a loss of billions of dollars in federal funding. He should work with the Victorian Premier to build the Melbourne Metro and underground the level crossings like Glenroy and Coburg in my electorate of Wills, which are a daily source of traffic congestion.


Third, the hostility to science. Under this government scientists working in institutions such as the CSIRO are seeing the results of their work denounced, their livelihoods threatened and their funding withdrawn. This government sees no value in modern instruments such as the Mopra radio telescope, near Coonabarabran, that is being shut down, at the same time as funding cuts have put the world-renowned Parkes radio telescope at risk of being abandoned as hundreds of professional scientists lose their jobs.


Equally damaging to Australia's international reputation, the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope, part of a scientific collaboration of over 20 nations, has no government support beyond the next two years and it appears that the government expects the private sector will somehow provide ongoing funding. Perhaps the government hopes to see this important international telescope renamed 'The Big Mac.'


 Just like Galileo was punished for speaking the truth, CSIRO scientists are being punished, with one quarter of the organisation's staff facing dismissal for, evidently, producing documents such as Climate change: science and solutions for Australia, a factual report that directly contradicts the government's endless fraudulent claims on this matter.


Given the Prime Minister's status as an authority figure hostile to science it is not surprising that, according to the Australian Science Teachers Association, enrolments in senior secondary science and maths subjects are continuing to decline. Since taking office this government has done nothing to reverse that trend, even though the Chief Scientist, Professor Chubb, in 2012, warned: 


We need a growing pool of science graduates to ensure Australia will be able to continue to compete on the international stage and develop scientific solutions to problems facing our nation …


There is no evidence that the government has given any regard to Professor Chubb's concerns. Michael Faraday, the English scientist, whose early 19th century electrical investigations led to what has been called the second industrial revolution of electricity, steel and chemicals, worked at a time when science was regarded as an excellent hobby for a gentleman but a miserable career choice.


Under this government, science in Australia appears to be returning to the lowly status that it held in England during the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. (Time expired)

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2014-12-02,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia) (16:01):  It is a joke that the opposition today is whining about so-called failed policies and budgets. If anyone knows about failure, it is the Australian Labor Party. 


They had two failed Prime Ministers who were so distracted by their own catfight, they led the nation over a cliff. The debt Australians are now paying off is a debt left by the Australian Labor Party. Let us take a look at some of Labor's so-called policy achievements. Labor's failed roof insulation policy, tragically and sadly, led to the deaths of four young Australians, one in my own electorate, that of young Reuben Barnes.  Labor's failed fiscal policies drove up national debt to historic levels. The result is an interest bill of $1 billion a month.


Under their stimulus package, Labor wrote stimulus cheques out to 21,000 dead people! In fact, the Australian Labor Party's fiscal policies are akin to a teenager using grandma's stolen cheque book. However, I do not want to dwell on them and their failures.


Let me tell you about some really positive things this government is working hard to achieve in regional Australia. It is regional Australia that creates the real wealth for our nation, because this country relies on the export of agriculture and mineral resources to feed our GDP. That is why it is significant that the Abbott coalition government continues to push for the development of dams and water infrastructure in regional Australia.


In the electorate of Capricornia we want the    Connors Dam, between Sarina and Moranbah; the Fitzroy Corridor's Eden Bann and Rookwood weirs near Rockhampton; and the Urannah Dam that would benefit the struggling town of Collinsville. These projects are now listed in the green paper on agricultural competitiveness. Such projects would create economic diversity and set up the region for a brighter future and provide more jobs. This is a policy that Labor never talked about. Labor had no vision for regional Australia and no long-term policy to secure its future.


Let me outline some of our successful policies for rural and regional Australia. Our coalition government has, so far, abolished the carbon tax, an impost round the neck of small business, families and industry, which drives job creation. We abolished the mining tax, saving around $50 billion over the next decade. We negotiated free trade agreements, to stimulate trade and therefore jobs, with South Korea, Japan and China. We have given environmental approval for more than $1 trillion worth of projects to boost the economy and have provided a $320 million drought support package for our nation's farmers. We are investing $2.5 billion to help local councils fix streets and roads under our Roads to Recovery program. We are spending $300 million over the next five years through our Bridges Renewal Program to help repair or replace old bridges across the nation. Our government is spending $100 million to fix mobile telephone black spots. We are developing a future for Northern Australia. We are fixing roads, under the largest infrastructure investment in Commonwealth history including: $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway and up to $1.3 billion for the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. Next year our $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund will be rolled out to provide the infrastructure that regional communities need for families and businesses.


Under this program, several key projects have been submitted for funding in Capricornia, including construction of a convention centre for Rockhampton city and stage 4 of a revitalization project on Yeppoon's beachfront. Both projects aim to attract tens of thousands more visitors to both cities, visitors who will spend money and stimulate the local economies, leading to greater job creation.


Our government is getting on with the job of sensible policies to help regional Australia realise its full potential.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:06):  This matter of public importance relates to this Prime Minister and this government's many, many failures and also to its very unfair and cruel budget. In fact, here we are, months after the budget, still talking about how unfair and how cruel it is. It has been the government's year of broken promises and policy failures across a whole range of different issues. It has indeed impacted everyone across Australia but, in terms of the broken promises, these have been very severe for those in rural and regional Australia. 


Before the election we had the Prime Minister and all the members of the Liberal and National parties out there, saying, 'There'll be no cuts, no new taxes—none of this will happen.' I know that in areas like mine, the North Coast of New South Wales, we had those members of the National Party out there running around and saying that to everyone. That is why no-one trusts the National Party in my area now, because there they were, saying, 'No cuts; no new taxes,' and that is precisely what happened after they got into government.


And if we look at some of those measures, the really cruel and unfair measures, we see things like the GP tax, which is a tax on the sick and vulnerable. We see the $100,000 university degrees stopping kids, particularly from regional and rural areas, getting to university. We see the petrol tax pushing up the cost of living. We see cuts to age pensions—how cruel is that?—robbing our older Australians of $80 a week. We see cuts to family payments, cuts to schools and hospitals, cuts to the ABC. And remember, before the election, we had the Prime Minister on the SBS news saying, 'No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST, no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' And since that time, what has the government done? They have cut more than $500 million from the ABC and SBS. And of course for regional Australia this is indeed another betrayal by the National Party, because these cuts will be devastating to regional areas like mine on the New South Wales North Coast.


So, you can call it what you like. You can call it a lie, you can call it a broken promise, you can call it deception, or you can call it an untruth. But one thing is very, very clear: this Prime Minister and the Liberal and National parties just cannot be trusted. That is the reality. And what do they do now? They lie about lying—it gets even worse. Let us have a look at another one of their massive broken promises, and that of course is their $7 doctor tax. In this budget, the Abbott government's first budget, they essentially declared war on Medicare and universal health care, and I think that is one of the worst broken promises—again, particularly for regional and rural areas. We have the doctor tax plus the PBS hike. It really is devastating, because introducing a $7 GP tax for all patients will cost over $1.4 billion to communities living outside of metropolitan areas. Indeed, Department of Health data shows that people in these regional and rural areas will be the hardest hit by the Abbott government's more than $1 billion hike in PBS medicines. And the top 12 electorates that will pay for the highest out-of-pocket expenses for PBS medicines are in regional and rural areas; that is a fact. So, they are getting a double whammy: the cost of the GP tax and the PBS increases will increase total out-of-pocket costs to patients. It is unfair that those patients get charged out of pocket when they go to see the doctor—they are charged $7—and then when they need to fill their prescriptions or have scans or X-rays they also have those increases, and when they go for blood tests. So, it will be particularly devastating for people in regional areas.


Let us move to the petrol tax, which is incredibly unfair—a harsh tax that will hit people in the regions. Indeed, in my area they call it the National Party petrol tax they are so angry about it. The reason it is so unfair is that people in regional and rural areas have to drive so much further in order to access activities. Remember the Treasurer said, in relation to that, 'Poor people don't drive.' That shows how out of touch they all are. They do not understand people in regional and rural areas one bit. People are incredibly angry about the petrol tax, just as they are about the $100,000 degrees. A university degree should depend on hard work and good marks, not on your parents' bank balance. But what people tell me in regional areas like mine, the electorate of Richmond, is that it is just out of reach for their kids to be able to get to university. That is what this government has done when it comes to their unfair and cruel budget—measures like the GP tax; $100,000 for university degrees; the petrol tax; the cuts to age pensions, which is so incredibly unfair to our elderly Australians, those who have served our nation; and the cuts to family payments. You can look across any area and see these severe cuts that are impacting our community.


And now they are saying, 'We've got to reboot, reset.' That does not change the substance of what they have done, it does not change the cruelty and the unfairness of it. The problem is that they said one thing before the election and then did something else. That is why people do not trust them: because they did exactly the opposite when they got into government.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-12-02,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (16:11):  It is a privilege to address the House in the last sitting of the year. As we wind down our parliamentary business and take stock of the year that has been, it is timely to reflect on the legacy left to us by Labor after six years in office and celebrate the new legacy we are writing after a year in office. Just over a year ago, Australia had had a gutful of the chaotic dysfunction that the populace had come to expect of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd leadership. Live export shipments were halted overnight, throwing our trade relations into chaos. Labor's commitment to slugging the people with the world's biggest carbon tax consistently outranked its promise to honour its commitments. Surpluses were promised, falsely announced, and hastily recanted. Prime ministers were deposed overnight. Portfolios were switching hands like hot potatoes. Prime ministerial planes were diverted at the passing whim of every prime ministerial thought bubble. The legacy that was left to Australians by this level of chaos, paucity of ideas and severe lack of respectable governance is dire. Labor's legacy to Australia is 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, and $123 billion in cumulative deficits.


Today, over a year after the coalition team was given a mandate to take the reins and get the nation into order, we look back upon an action-packed year of challenges and achievements. In our first year in office we repealed the world's biggest carbon tax, saving the average Australian family $550 per year and reducing the cost of electricity for small businesses by up to 10 per cent. Small business is the engine room of the economy, and the family budget is the document that provides the most meaningful reflection upon the state of the nation's finances. By easing the pressure on both these institutions with our tax-repealing and red-tape-cutting measures, the coalition is delivering for the Australian people where it matters most. We repealed the mining tax, giving our natural resources sector room to grow and prosper. And we are a government that unequivocally supports the mining sector, because we want to see a strong Australia and a strong economy that produces jobs for Australian workers.


We have seen major infrastructure wins right across this country: a $50 billion infrastructure program that includes major projects in every state that will save Australians time and money. Groundbreaking projects such as the WestConnex are on track to make a real difference to the everyday lives of Australians. We have put our country back to work, with key policies like the Restart program and the comeback of work for the dole, injecting life back into the economy and restoring confidence and opportunity to senior and young Australians alike. In this vein, we have seen a massive equalisation of opportunity with policies such as our trade support loans—a measure that has particularly benefited the young people in the St George area, which I represent, many of whom pursue technical vocations. We have stopped the boats. It is incredible to me that just over a year on from a complete surrender of our borders to people smugglers, a failure that saw the tragic deaths of thousands at sea, those on the other side of this chamber have the nerve to speak of policy failure. What better example of a resounding policy success than to re-establish trust with the people on the matter of securing Australia's borders?


Looking back over these major milestones, we can see clear evidence of public progress right across the portfolios of government. However, the task which underpins all others, the biggest task facing the government yet, is undoubtedly that of budget repair. Ultimately, the difference between the two sides of this chamber is the coalition team's willingness to take on the task of budget repair and to take responsibility for the state of the nation's economy. We were given a mandate by the people of Australia to lift the nation's economy and bring the budget back into the black. The people of Australia asked us to make the tough decisions necessary to create a secure future for all of us and our children. This year the government has delivered on key milestones of the mandate given to us by the Australian people.


Those on the other side will pontificate about unfairness and failure, but what could be more of a failure than refusing to face up to the task at hand? What could be more unfair than to saddle future generations with a mountain of intractable debt? We refuse to shirk the task assigned to us by the Australian people. We refuse to shy away from the tough but fair decisions and are absolutely determined to repair the budget. The truth is that there is only one team in this place with the mettle, the resolution and the plan to acknowledge and tackle the task at hand. The coalition team has reached key milestones of progress in this first year in office and our resolve is absolutely unshakeable as we approach the year ahead.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2014-12-02,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (16:16):  As I was saying before the interruption, the primary genesis of the proposals in this bill was a statutory review undertaken by Anthony Blunn AO, Mr Ian Govey and Professor John McMillan AO—all of course eminent individuals. There were 46 recommendations made in that report. What I would like to focus on in the bill before us is the proposal that the First Parliamentary Counsel be given powers to make editorial changes and other changes.


A Senate inquiry looking into this bill is in fact due to report today. I do not think the report has been released yet but, if the minister knows otherwise, I am happy to be corrected. I would like to turn to the submission made to that inquiry by the Clerk of the House, Mr David Elder. Mr Elder made some salient points that I think the House should be aware of. I would like to acknowledge the exemplary quality of parliamentary officers in this chamber and the value of Mr Elder's comments. He said:


Proposed new section 15V(6) specifically prohibits the First Parliamentary Counsel from making a change to an act or instrument that would change the effect of the act or instrument, and proposed new section 15X clearly defines editorial change. These provisions would appear to ensure that no changes of a substantive nature could be effected to legislation without passing through the established parliamentary processes.


In terms of the parliament's role in correcting errors in bills before the bills are presented for assent, the bill does not appear to have any effect on current practice. At present, if an error is discovered in a bill before parliament the usual practice is first to determine whether the required correction is editorial or substantive. In the case of editorial changes the Deputy Speaker or Deputy President authorises the responsible department to make the necessary change in preparing the bill for transmission to the other House or for assent by the Governor-General.


Fair enough, I think the comments about section 15V(6) and 15X are absolutely correct. But I do believe we need to turn to paragraph 2 and the logical steps which Mr Elder identified. If there is an error, there are two options: if it is an editorial error, the Deputy Speaker or Deputy President authorises the department to make changes; if it is a substantive error, corrections are made via amendment during the passage of a bill or subsequent to the bill coming into effect.


At this stage, I would like to turn to the definition of 'editorial change'. As the shadow Attorney-General alluded to in his comments, the notion of reporting back to the parliament on any actions that the First Parliamentary Counsel may have taken in relation to these provisions would probably not be seen as novel; it is the principle that agencies report to parliament on circumstances in which their powers exercised outside the parliament. Surely, this is not seeking to undermine the principle. We are the law-makers in this place and we should know when a piece of statute law has been changed, however slight that change may be. There is no intention in this bill to do anything contrary to that. The reason I raise it is in terms of understanding the context and the importance of us being here today looking at this bill to ensure that there are no unintended consequences arising from that exercise.


I will now turn to the two new concepts within the scope of powers of the First Parliamentary Counsel in the bill. The first is about the power to make editorial change and the second is about what precisely an editorial change is. In relation to the powers contained in proposed section 15V, the explanatory memorandum states:




Making changes in this way
—





that is, editorial and presentational changes to a compilation of an act or instrument—





will conserve limited parliamentary time and other resources.



In other words, among other things it would not necessarily need to be presented to the parliament and debated—that is one way of reading this. I believe it is important to be clear on two things. Firstly, we should recognise that the proposed powers of the First Parliamentary Counsel apply to preparing a compilation of an act—and that is contained in section 15V(1). That is supported by the following comment at page 46 of the explanatory memorandum:




Editorial changes can only be made to a compilation
—
the original version ‘as made’ by the Parliament o
r rule-maker cannot be changed.



The second point I want to make is to again reinforce the confidence we have in the skill and dedication of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I am on the record on many occasions in this place on the issue of statute law and other legislative reform expressing precisely that sentiment, and I am happy to do so today.


It is instructive to note, however—and this is the reason why I raise this—that these proposals go precisely to the wording being advanced in section 15X(2)(a), because often minor editing can change the meaning of a bill. Here I am talking about the definition of editorial change, in section 15X subparagraph 2: 'An editorial change to an act, legislative instrument or notifiable instrument is a change made by the first parliamentary counsel that, a) goes only to a matter of spelling, punctuation, grammar or syntax and the use of conjunctive and disjunctives.' The I raise this provision is because this can precisely make a difference in judicial interpretation. Issues of punctuation, as have been shown in judicial interpretation and, specifically, case law tell us so. I think it would be prudent for the parliament not only to be made aware of when these powers are invoked but also to closely examine the findings of the Senate report and any consequential recommendations for any amendments that arise from that.


I did allude to specific cases where punctuation has made a difference. Again, as I did in my Statute Law Revision Bill contribution on 22 August 2012, I do want to highlight what I think is probably one of the most instructive cases on this point. That is the case of a comma in a contract being capable of being interpreted in such a way that it can make millions of dollars of difference. I believe this is relevant, so I am happy to quote exactly as I did on that occasion. 


This was a case from 2006. A headline in The New York Times reported on 25 October 2006, describing it as a case of 'The comma that cost $1 million'. The issue at stake was a 14-page contract between Rogers Communications of Toronto, Canada's largest cable TV provider, and Bell Aliant, a telephone company in Atlantic Canada. The question of whether a single comma was placed in the right position led to a difference of Can$1 million. I will quote from the New York Times summary: 'Citing the rules of punctuation, Canada's telecommunications regulator recently ruled that the comma allowed Bell Aliant to end its five-year agreement with Rogers'—this was about the use of telephone poles—'at any time with notice.' The dispute was over this sentence: 'This agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five-year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.' The regulator concluded that the second comma, after 'successive five-year terms' meant that the part of the sentence describing the one year notice for cancellation applied to both the five-year terms as well as its renewal. Therefore, the regulator found, the phone company could escape the contract by as little as one year. Following this, Rogers commissioned a 69-page affidavit as part of its case—mostly about commas—from Kenneth Adams, a lawyer from Garden City in New York who is apparently the author of two books on contract language. You can see, as I am sure the shadow Attorney-General does, the impact of punctuation and judicial interpretation. I have a genuine constructive point for the minister at the table who introduced this and will be wrapping it up shortly: I would be very interested in knowing what other jurisdictions do this and confer such power on their equivalent Office of Parliamentary Counsels. In what other legislatures does this practice occur, in what circumstances does it occur and what are the lessons and safeguards that we should put in place?


Again, as I said, I make these comments in the absence of knowing the outcome of the Senate inquiry. Perhaps it is the case that the reservations I have mentioned could be alleviated by reporting to parliament about whether these provisions are editorial and whether these amendments are activated.


In the short period of time that I have left I would like to mention, since we are talking about statute law, the fact that Justice Susan Crennan, Justice of the High Court, is in fact going to retire on 3 February 2015, which is before parliament resumes. Justice Crennan was the second woman appointed to the court after Justice Mary Gaudron replaced Justice Michael McHugh. From her official biography on the High Court website:


Susan Maree Crennan AC was appointed to the Court in November 2005. At the time of her appointment she was a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, having been appointed to that office in February 2004.


…   …   …


Justice Crennan AC was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1979 and joined the Victorian Bar in 1980. She was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 1989. Justice Crennan AC was President of the Australian Bar Association 1994–95, Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council in 1993–94, and a Commissioner for Human Rights in 1992. Justice Crennan AC was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2008.


I think it is very opportune and instructive on this occasion, since we are discussing issues of statute law interpretation, so I took the time to have a look at one of Justice Crennan's illuminating articles which she wrote in February 2010: the Statute Law Society paper entitled 'Statutes and the contemporary search for meaning'. She said, regarding statutory interpretation: 'Contemporary approaches to statutory interpretation preclude sacrificing meaning to inflexible theories or principles.' She discusses, very interestingly, three factors that go towards statutory interpretation: the will of the parliament, context and purpose, and the principle of legality. I think that, in the context of discussing the will of the parliament here and to ensure that we, as representatives and the statute makers in this place, do not have any unforeseen consequences arising from this bill, it is most pertinent to have a look at Justice Crennan's comments which she makes there. I would encourage all members to visit it. There are some fundamental issues that she raises here about the separation of powers, the will of the parliament and how courts interpret that will. They are certainly very wise words. I wish to place on record thanks to Justice Crennan for her service to the law and I wish her well. She has been an adornment to the court and will continue to be so until her actual retirement.


In conclusion, I have commended the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for their most instructive operation. I think all members would also be well advised to read, over the break—I know they will print this off!—the revised Legislative Instruments Handbook, which is most illuminating, and, as I have referred to previously, the OPC's Guide to Reducing Complexity in Legislation. Both of those documents lend themselves to a quote by Nick Horn, who did a paper on 'Legislative Drafting in Australia, New Zealand and Ontario: Notes on an informal survey'. He noted that our Office of parliamentary Counsel's Plain Language Guide is 'the most detailed practical legislative counsel manual currently available'. I commend them for that and support the bill, subject to those reservations which both the shadow Attorney-General and I have mentioned.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (16:29):  I thank all honourable members for their contributions to debate on this bill. I particularly admire the member for Greenway's enthusiasm for acts and instruments, which I was unaware of until her contribution. We are very pleased to facilitate and support the passage of the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Bill 2014. The bill provides an opportunity for significant reforms to align the legislative frameworks for Commonwealth acts and instruments. Importantly, this bill will promote the principle of access to justice by enhancing the accessibility of Commonwealth laws. It will also create administrative efficiencies and help reduce beige tape for government agencies. It will also facilitate efforts to reduce red tape. I would like to thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for its significant commitment to preparing this bill and for seeking to improve the clarity and operation of the legislative instruments regime. I therefore commend the bill to the House.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (16:16):  As I was saying before the interruption, the primary genesis of the proposals in this bill was a statutory review undertaken by Anthony Blunn AO, Mr Ian Govey and Professor John McMillan AO—all of course eminent individuals. There were 46 recommendations made in that report. What I would like to focus on in the bill before us is the proposal that the First Parliamentary Counsel be given powers to make editorial changes and other changes.


A Senate inquiry looking into this bill is in fact due to report today. I do not think the report has been released yet but, if the minister knows otherwise, I am happy to be corrected. I would like to turn to the submission made to that inquiry by the Clerk of the House, Mr David Elder. Mr Elder made some salient points that I think the House should be aware of. I would like to acknowledge the exemplary quality of parliamentary officers in this chamber and the value of Mr Elder's comments. He said:


Proposed new section 15V(6) specifically prohibits the First Parliamentary Counsel from making a change to an act or instrument that would change the effect of the act or instrument, and proposed new section 15X clearly defines editorial change. These provisions would appear to ensure that no changes of a substantive nature could be effected to legislation without passing through the established parliamentary processes.


In terms of the parliament's role in correcting errors in bills before the bills are presented for assent, the bill does not appear to have any effect on current practice. At present, if an error is discovered in a bill before parliament the usual practice is first to determine whether the required correction is editorial or substantive. In the case of editorial changes the Deputy Speaker or Deputy President authorises the responsible department to make the necessary change in preparing the bill for transmission to the other House or for assent by the Governor-General.


Fair enough, I think the comments about section 15V(6) and 15X are absolutely correct. But I do believe we need to turn to paragraph 2 and the logical steps which Mr Elder identified. If there is an error, there are two options: if it is an editorial error, the Deputy Speaker or Deputy President authorises the department to make changes; if it is a substantive error, corrections are made via amendment during the passage of a bill or subsequent to the bill coming into effect.


At this stage, I would like to turn to the definition of 'editorial change'. As the shadow Attorney-General alluded to in his comments, the notion of reporting back to the parliament on any actions that the First Parliamentary Counsel may have taken in relation to these provisions would probably not be seen as novel; it is the principle that agencies report to parliament on circumstances in which their powers exercised outside the parliament. Surely, this is not seeking to undermine the principle. We are the law-makers in this place and we should know when a piece of statute law has been changed, however slight that change may be. There is no intention in this bill to do anything contrary to that. The reason I raise it is in terms of understanding the context and the importance of us being here today looking at this bill to ensure that there are no unintended consequences arising from that exercise.


I will now turn to the two new concepts within the scope of powers of the First Parliamentary Counsel in the bill. The first is about the power to make editorial change and the second is about what precisely an editorial change is. In relation to the powers contained in proposed section 15V, the explanatory memorandum states:




Making changes in this way
—





that is, editorial and presentational changes to a compilation of an act or instrument—





will conserve limited parliamentary time and other resources.



In other words, among other things it would not necessarily need to be presented to the parliament and debated—that is one way of reading this. I believe it is important to be clear on two things. Firstly, we should recognise that the proposed powers of the First Parliamentary Counsel apply to preparing a compilation of an act—and that is contained in section 15V(1). That is supported by the following comment at page 46 of the explanatory memorandum:




Editorial changes can only be made to a compilation
—
the original version ‘as made’ by the Parliament o
r rule-maker cannot be changed.



The second point I want to make is to again reinforce the confidence we have in the skill and dedication of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I am on the record on many occasions in this place on the issue of statute law and other legislative reform expressing precisely that sentiment, and I am happy to do so today.


It is instructive to note, however—and this is the reason why I raise this—that these proposals go precisely to the wording being advanced in section 15X(2)(a), because often minor editing can change the meaning of a bill. Here I am talking about the definition of editorial change, in section 15X subparagraph 2: 'An editorial change to an act, legislative instrument or notifiable instrument is a change made by the first parliamentary counsel that, a) goes only to a matter of spelling, punctuation, grammar or syntax and the use of conjunctive and disjunctives.' The I raise this provision is because this can precisely make a difference in judicial interpretation. Issues of punctuation, as have been shown in judicial interpretation and, specifically, case law tell us so. I think it would be prudent for the parliament not only to be made aware of when these powers are invoked but also to closely examine the findings of the Senate report and any consequential recommendations for any amendments that arise from that.


I did allude to specific cases where punctuation has made a difference. Again, as I did in my Statute Law Revision Bill contribution on 22 August 2012, I do want to highlight what I think is probably one of the most instructive cases on this point. That is the case of a comma in a contract being capable of being interpreted in such a way that it can make millions of dollars of difference. I believe this is relevant, so I am happy to quote exactly as I did on that occasion. 


This was a case from 2006. A headline in The New York Times reported on 25 October 2006, describing it as a case of 'The comma that cost $1 million'. The issue at stake was a 14-page contract between Rogers Communications of Toronto, Canada's largest cable TV provider, and Bell Aliant, a telephone company in Atlantic Canada. The question of whether a single comma was placed in the right position led to a difference of Can$1 million. I will quote from the New York Times summary: 'Citing the rules of punctuation, Canada's telecommunications regulator recently ruled that the comma allowed Bell Aliant to end its five-year agreement with Rogers'—this was about the use of telephone poles—'at any time with notice.' The dispute was over this sentence: 'This agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five-year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.' The regulator concluded that the second comma, after 'successive five-year terms' meant that the part of the sentence describing the one year notice for cancellation applied to both the five-year terms as well as its renewal. Therefore, the regulator found, the phone company could escape the contract by as little as one year. Following this, Rogers commissioned a 69-page affidavit as part of its case—mostly about commas—from Kenneth Adams, a lawyer from Garden City in New York who is apparently the author of two books on contract language. You can see, as I am sure the shadow Attorney-General does, the impact of punctuation and judicial interpretation. I have a genuine constructive point for the minister at the table who introduced this and will be wrapping it up shortly: I would be very interested in knowing what other jurisdictions do this and confer such power on their equivalent Office of Parliamentary Counsels. In what other legislatures does this practice occur, in what circumstances does it occur and what are the lessons and safeguards that we should put in place?


Again, as I said, I make these comments in the absence of knowing the outcome of the Senate inquiry. Perhaps it is the case that the reservations I have mentioned could be alleviated by reporting to parliament about whether these provisions are editorial and whether these amendments are activated.


In the short period of time that I have left I would like to mention, since we are talking about statute law, the fact that Justice Susan Crennan, Justice of the High Court, is in fact going to retire on 3 February 2015, which is before parliament resumes. Justice Crennan was the second woman appointed to the court after Justice Mary Gaudron replaced Justice Michael McHugh. From her official biography on the High Court website:


Susan Maree Crennan AC was appointed to the Court in November 2005. At the time of her appointment she was a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, having been appointed to that office in February 2004.


…   …   …


Justice Crennan AC was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1979 and joined the Victorian Bar in 1980. She was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 1989. Justice Crennan AC was President of the Australian Bar Association 1994–95, Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council in 1993–94, and a Commissioner for Human Rights in 1992. Justice Crennan AC was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2008.


I think it is very opportune and instructive on this occasion, since we are discussing issues of statute law interpretation, so I took the time to have a look at one of Justice Crennan's illuminating articles which she wrote in February 2010: the Statute Law Society paper entitled 'Statutes and the contemporary search for meaning'. She said, regarding statutory interpretation: 'Contemporary approaches to statutory interpretation preclude sacrificing meaning to inflexible theories or principles.' She discusses, very interestingly, three factors that go towards statutory interpretation: the will of the parliament, context and purpose, and the principle of legality. I think that, in the context of discussing the will of the parliament here and to ensure that we, as representatives and the statute makers in this place, do not have any unforeseen consequences arising from this bill, it is most pertinent to have a look at Justice Crennan's comments which she makes there. I would encourage all members to visit it. There are some fundamental issues that she raises here about the separation of powers, the will of the parliament and how courts interpret that will. They are certainly very wise words. I wish to place on record thanks to Justice Crennan for her service to the law and I wish her well. She has been an adornment to the court and will continue to be so until her actual retirement.


In conclusion, I have commended the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for their most instructive operation. I think all members would also be well advised to read, over the break—I know they will print this off!—the revised Legislative Instruments Handbook, which is most illuminating, and, as I have referred to previously, the OPC's Guide to Reducing Complexity in Legislation.

He noted that our Office of parliamentary Counsel's Plain Language Guide is 'the most detailed practical legislative counsel manual currently available'. I commend them for that and support the bill, subject to those reservations which both the shadow Attorney-General and I have mentioned.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (20:59):  I want to take this opportunity this evening to refer to the Victorian election result and reflect on what an Andrews-led Labor government will now mean for the people of my electorate. First, I would like to congratulate Daniel Andrews and his team on their wonderful victory on Saturday night, and I certainly look forward to working with them for the benefit not only of Victorians but also of my electorate in particular.


The Victorian state election was as much a judgement on the federal budget as it was on the four years of a state coalition government which effectively saw policies and measures taken that hurt Victorians generally and provided little or no support to the many people and families who live in my electorate. In fact, I well remember that, upon coming to office four years ago, the now former coalition state Liberal government stripped away from my electorate $30 million that had been allocated and budgeted for by the previous Brumby Labor government for the redevelopment of the Broadmeadows train station centre. This was a bad omen indeed for my constituents, and, unfortunately, it did not get any better for them, as our local families and communities were largely ignored by the Baillieu and Napthine governments.


At a time when families were already experiencing difficulties and facing further stresses, we saw very little government investment in health and education services, or, more importantly, in the vital area of job creation. In the city of Hume, unemployment has increased since June 2013 from 6.9 per cent to 10 per cent in June 2014. In Broadmeadows in particular, unemployment has risen from 21.9 per cent to 26.4 per cent, and unemployment in the suburbs of Campbellfield and Coolaroo has risen from 18.8 per cent to 22.9 per cent, and unemployment in Meadow Heights has risen from 18.6 per cent to 22.9 per cent. These are very worrying figures, and they also show that unemployment in Melbourne's inner north is now higher in some cases than in the unemployment crisis currently facing Europe.


Of course, we are yet to fully absorb the effects of the hollowing out of local manufacturing industry, not assisted, unfortunately, by the Abbott government's decision to abandon manufacturing and the Napthine government's failure to defend it, particularly through the closure of Ford's manufacturing plant in Broadmeadows. Thankfully, however, and despite inaction, my electorate is set to benefit—and I welcome this—from the former Rudd-Gillard Labor government initiatives that were put in place when Ford announced it would cease manufacturing in Broadmeadows by 2016. The then federal Labor government did not blame the workers. Instead, we had the foresight to create far-reaching initiatives to assist employment by setting up the $24.5 million Melbourne's North Innovation and Investment Fund, to encourage local businesses to diversify and to create jobs in the region. I am pleased to say that an Andrews state Labor government will invest an additional $10.5 million into this fund, and it will help create some 100,000 jobs across Victoria by investing in the industries of the future and encouraging companies to hire retrenched workers and unemployed youth.


Fourteen grants to date have been allocated from the Melbourne's North Innovation and Investment Fund, to a total value of $17 million, and they are said to leverage some $81.9 million in private sector investment. They are expected to create more than 580 new full-time equivalent jobs. I am very pleased at the announcement made by the federal Minister for Industry Ian Macfarlane in October that $1.1 million from this fund would assist a very important food manufacturer in my electorate, Colonial Farm, to establish a food production line and new manufacturing and warehouse plant, and this will create 23 new jobs.


There are many other businesses in my electorate that have received money under this fund. I realise I only have time to mention a few, but I would like to single out Top Cat's Kitchen Innovations unit, in Campbellfield, which has received $600,000 to expand on its operations to service the market for stone top kitchen benches, and that is expected to create some 15 jobs. The Sparkling Beverages company in Campbellfield has received $993,000 to upgrade its production lines for glass bottle and canned beverage production and to create 27 jobs. Cottage Cheese Farm in Broadmeadows has received funding— (Time expired)
