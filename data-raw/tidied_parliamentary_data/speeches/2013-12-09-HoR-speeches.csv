Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (10:01):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Afghanistan from 28 April to 1 May 2013. This visit was the first official delegation of Australian parliamentarians to be received by the National Assembly of Afghanistan. The visit to the seat of government in Kabul represented a historic shift in Australia's bilateral relationship with Afghanistan. The main aim of the delegation's visit was to strengthen the relationship between the parliaments of Afghanistan and Australia and, as part of this, a long-term commitment to friendship between our nations and to regional security and development. The aims were to obtain a greater appreciation of Afghanistan's governance and development challenges, something we heard a lot about; to assess the effectiveness of Australia's current trade and aid related programs and supports; and to establish a firm bond of trust for future parliamentary and intergovernment engagement for the future.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am pleased to be introducing the first private member's bill of the 44th Parliament.


Nation building requires forward thinking.


Governments that take nation building seriously look well beyond the electoral cycle to contemplate the big infrastructure projects that will benefit future generations.


For many years now, it has been suggested that Australia should develop a high-speed rail line linking Brisbane and Melbourne via Sydney and Canberra.


That is why I commissioned a study in two parts that involved extensive consultation with industry, including international operators of high-speed rail as well as significant community input to maximise the effectiveness of the study.


It was completed in two parts so that transparency could be maximised. It was published in full, including the business case for the project, consideration of environmental issues, projections of patronage, proposed route, proposed stations and proposed time lines. There are detailed maps available, indeed, whereby people can see exactly what the proposed route is.


It found that high-speed rail down the east coast of Australia is a viable proposition but that it does face challenges.


It is a nation-building project—a track covering 1,748km and passing through four major cities.


It is visionary, requiring consideration of where our society and its transport needs will be decades from now.


High-speed rail will almost certainly run up against political hurdles. It would be delivered over decades under the stewardship of multiple parliaments in Canberra and the other four jurisdictions involved.


It would also be an engineering challenge, requiring at least 80km of tunnels, including 67km in Sydney alone.


Despite all these challenges, high-speed rail also has huge potential, particularly if we consider where our society is headed over coming decades. We can anticipate that an increasing population and the growing need for a carbon constrained economy will drive the economics of this project ever more positively over time.


The study I released in April this year, which I commissioned as minister, found that high-speed rail would return, for the Sydney to Melbourne section, $2.15 in economic benefit for every dollar invested. It would be a major regional economic development initiative.


A challenge of this scale needs serious forward planning.


The first step is to begin to secure the corridor.


That is why this bill seeks parliament's support for the High-Speed Rail Planning Authority.


This bill will establish the structure across governments to ensure we maintain the momentum generated by the recent strategic studies.


The bill would establish the High-Speed Rail Planning Authority as a vehicle for long-term Commonwealth leadership to progress this project. This is critical. Without Commonwealth leadership, high-speed rail will never happen.


The Commonwealth has to bring together the state governments, local councils, landholders, potential private sector investors and others to guarantee a cross-jurisdictional approach. And we need to develop that process now.


Inaction now means years will pass and, by the time market conditions shift to the point of supporting high-speed rail, the complex challenges I listed before could have grown insurmountable.


I am hopeful, therefore, that this bill will win support across this parliament—given the rhetoric of people across this parliament.


Planning is not a political issue. It is just common sense.


I must say I had been concerned about the future of high-speed rail given the decision of the Prime Minister in November to wind up the High-Speed Rail Advisory Group. The members of this committee included former Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, Business Council of Australia Chief Executive, Jennifer Westacott, and Australasian Railway Association chief executive, Bryan Nye. It was chaired by the deputy secretary of my former department, Lyn O'Connell. The aim of this private member's bill—to formally create a planning authority—is in accordance with its recommendations.


Last year Mr Fischer told The Border Mail the link would be 'a huge leap forward' for decentralisation and that long-term planning was vital to prevent the corridor from being absorbed by urban sprawl.


I agree.


It would be a shame to lose the momentum from the major strategic studies of the last three years.


That momentum has built up over successive phases.


Under this private member's bill, an 11-person high-speed rail authority would bring together all affected states as well as rail and engineering experts to progress planning and, critically, focus on the corridor. The 11 members of the board are outlined in the bill. They would include:


one member from each of the states affected—Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory;


one member representing the Local Government Association;


one member nominated by the Australasian Railway Association; and


five members appointed by the minister for infrastructure on the basis of qualifications or expertise—


to make sure that you got that engineering expertise on the authority.


The authority's roles would include consideration of:


land use planning relating to the corridor;


safety;


measures to minimise environmental impact; and


public consultation.


The states, councils and landholders along the possible route have a very direct interest in ensuring that, if this project is viable, an orderly process is in place to bring it to fruition.


Big ideas do not happen without leadership.


If we do not start planning now, our lack of foresight could ensure high-speed rail cannot happen.


High-speed rail exists in every continent other than Australia and Antarctica. It is globally recognised as an extremely effective mode of transport and a driver of economic productivity.


Society is always changing.


What might seem unlikely now could be a necessity in the future, particularly when we consider the need to reduce carbon emissions to deal the effects of climate change.


It might seem convenient now to just take a wait-and-see approach—to sit on this idea for a few years.


But I am into nation building and nation building requires planning.


Earlier I referred to the high-speed rail study phase 2 report, which I released on 11 April this year.


It said population and employment growth along the east coast of Australia in coming years would challenge the capacity of our existing modes of transport.


Travel on the east coast of Australia was forecast to grow about 1.8 per cent per year over the next two decades and to increase by 60 per cent by 2035.


The report said that east coast trips will double from 152 million trips in 2009 to 355 million trips in 2065. It is simply not possible to accommodate that growth on existing road and existing air links. That is why we need to make sure that we act now by setting up this authority.


The report found that once the line was fully operational from 2065 across the Brisbane to Melbourne corridor, high-speed rail could carry approximately 84 million passengers each year.


People would be able to travel from Melbourne to Sydney in less than three hours—the same duration of an express trip from Sydney to Brisbane.


The report found the optimal staging would involve building the Sydney to Melbourne line first, starting with the Sydney to Canberra corridor.


Later, building would continue from Canberra to Melbourne, Newcastle to Sydney, Brisbane to the Gold Coast and the Gold Coast to Newcastle.


The entire project would cost $114 billion in 2012 dollars.


The report found that fares would produce only a small investment return and that governments would need to fund most of the capital costs.


However, over time, the system could generate sufficient revenue to meet operating costs without ongoing public subsidy. And that is important.




Conclusion



High-speed rail represents a major challenge for our country.


Although there is a significant cost involved, it does have the potential to revolutionise travel in this country and to reduce carbon emissions.


And I am not just talking about travel between the big state capitals.


Consider the benefits to the regions through which the train would travel.


Consider the jobs involved in construction, the boost to tourism and to opening up dozens of communities to fast, easy high-speed transport.


Vision is important in governing nations.


Nation builders need the ability to both anticipate and create the future.


To those who are doubtful as to whether high speed rail will ever go ahead I would urge you to look long and hard at this bill.


If we do not act now, we are closing off options for future generations.


It is another way we can look at the precautionary principle.


I support this legislation. It is consistent with the reports and the independent advisory council recommendations. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (10:13):  I move:


That this House notes that:


(1) the Government is delivering on its promise to build a stronger Australia with its $1.5 billion commitment to the WestConnex project in Sydney;


(2) WestConnex is part of a long term vision for Sydney's future and is needed to cater for the additional 1.3 million people calling it home over the next 20 years;


(3) the 33 kilometre motorway linking Sydney's west and south-west with the CBD, Sydney Airport and Port Botany, will return some $20 billion to the NSW economy; and


(4) the project will create thousands of jobs including new apprenticeships.


As I made my way around the electorate of Reid over the past 18 months, I met many people and had many conversations. There were not many conversations that at some stage did not turn to local traffic—both neighbourhood streets and, of course, Parramatta Road. In Reid you will find the end of the M4 Motorway. We are the proverbial 'end of the line'. The roads that once belonged to us and our families are now home to traffic 'rat running' in an attempt to avoid Parramatta Road. The electorate of Reid has lived with the lack of vision of state and federal governments for the last 40 years.


But this was not always the case. Our forebears always intended a motorway from Sydney's greater west to the city. That is why they had retained ownership of land that would allow future governments to build it when required. In what could only be described as an act of political short-sightedness, the Wran state government sold this corridor in 1977.


When it comes to infrastructure, not only the people of Reid but all in NSW have been let down for too long. Poor infrastructure investment decisions over the past decade have contributed to a $30 billion infrastructure backlog. This has led to the poor economic performance of New South Wales compared with the rest of Australia during that time. Currently, congestion costs the New South Wales economy an estimated $5.1 billion every year or nearly $1,100 for every resident of Sydney. By 2020, the cost of congestion is expected to rise to $8.8 billion, as Sydney's population grows and travel demand increases.


Western Sydney is home to Australia's third biggest economy, and with Sydney's population expected to grow by 1.3 million people over the next 20 years, it is only going to get bigger and be more important to Australia's economic success. It deserves first-class infrastructure. With the WestConnex, it will have it. The M4, which begins at Penrith and terminates in the electorate of Reid at North Strathfield, creates unreliable travel times through the inner west to the city and the airport. As drivers reach the end of the motorway, they either head up Concord Road and turn into Gipps Street, spreading traffic through the back streets of Concord West, Concord, Five Dock and Rodd Point. Or they head down Parramatta Road, turning off at Wentworth Road, Strathfield, then through Burwood and Croydon. Our once quiet back streets—home to our children—have now become home to a large number of vehicles attempting to avoid the nightmare that is Parramatta Road.


Parramatta Road is heavily congested, with traffic speeds reduced on average to 21 kilometres per hour as trucks, vans, cars and buses fight for space on a crowded corridor interrupted by 25 sets of traffic lights. Our community in Reid has effectively been cut in half, with local residents doing all they can to stay on their side of Parramatta Road and avoiding the battle that goes on there. As a result, large sections of Parramatta Road have become an eyesore characterised by failing retail businesses, heavily-congested, polluting traffic and an absence of pedestrians. In some places all that is missing are the tumbleweeds rolling down the street.


The WestConnex is what the people of Reid are crying out for. WestConnex is the largest integrated transport and urban revitalisation project in Australia, linking Sydney's west and south-west with the CBD, the airport and port in a continuous 33-kilometre motorway that is completely free of traffic lights. WestConnex will be the trigger for urban revitalisation along the Parramatta Road corridor. Streetscapes will be beautified; green corridors and parkland added; it will be a better place to live, work and socialise.


According to experts, the WestConnex will cut forecast travel times between Parramatta and Sydney Airport by up to 40 minutes. I think this is conservative, because I, as a lifelong resident, can, like all in Reid, tell you horror stories of taking 20 minutes to travel a distance that should take two minutes. And with clearway restrictions eased on weekends, we now have the crazy situation where weekend traffic is worse than weekdays. Travel speeds have fallen to as little as 21 kilometres per hour for morning and afternoon peak periods and the M4 is congested 13 hours a day. Secondly,    bus travel times between the inner west and the CBD will be halved; again , I believe, this is very conservative estimate. Thirdly, it will create 10,000 jobs during the construction phase, including hundreds of apprenticeships. With unemployment in double digits in Reid, especially amongst our youth, we could sure use these. Fourthly, it will bypass up to 52 sets of traffic lights. 


Fifthly, it will remove 3,000 trucks a day from Parramatta Road and put them underground, leading to revitalised neighbourhoods on the surface. This is an important point, Madame Speaker: whilst there is concern about the impact the WestConnex tunnel ventilation will have on local air quality, I was amazed to attend a briefing only a few weeks ago at which an expert explained there would be a vast improvement in air quality, as trucks in particular would be driving through the tunnel at a continually higher average speed—not stopping and starting, using low gears, and spewing black smoke into the air. 


Sixthly, north-south travel times across Parramatta Road for cars and public buses accessing the western rail line at Burwood and other stations will improve. This relates to the point about allowing the two halves of Reid to come back together—a situation we do not currently enjoy. Seventhly, it will provide the environment for 25,000 new jobs and 25,000 residences to be created over the next 20 years along Parramatta Road. In consultation with councils and communities, sections of the Parramatta Road corridor will be rezoned to encourage construction of new apartments and homes, commercial and retail space, recreational space, civic and government buildings. All this will result in a 20-kilometre urban revitalisation corridor developed progressively between Camperdown and Parramatta over the next 20 years. All told it is projected the WestConnex will deliver more than $20 billion in economic benefits to New South Wales, and, hopefully, we will get rid of those tumbleweeds. 


This project will mean different things to different electorates at different stages of the construction. Whilst we have a responsibility to represent our electorate, we must also balance the short and the long term and govern for majorities, not minorities. One of the most common criticisms of politicians is that they have a lack of vision, that they govern by electoral cycle and find short-term issues to create political advantage, and that they seek to hold power above all else. WestConnex is the perfect example of a government not doing that.


I note with interest that I will be followed by the members for Kingsford Smith, Chifley and Parramatta. They may talk about tolls, compulsory acquisitions, moving bottlenecks, ventilation shafts, the role of public transport and a number of other things. These are issues they can play politics on. I challenge them to think about Sydney, particularly Western Sydney, when this project is finished in 10 or 20 years time and we will have an additional 1.3 million people calling our city home. With any major infrastructure project there will always be points of contention. But we must govern with long-term vision and for the needs of the many versus the needs of the few.


I applaud Prime Minister Mr Tony Abbott and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss for taking a long-term view and working with Premier Barry O'Farrell and the New South Wales government to deliver WestConnex for the people of Reid, the people of Western Sydney and the people of New South Wales. Prime Minister Abbott went to the electorate promising us the roads of the 21st century. His first order of business the day after he was sworn in was to deliver on the promise. On behalf of the people of Reid I thank him and I commend this motion to the House.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (10:21):  It is with great pleasure that I second the motion by the member for Reid. I know this is a motion that is also close to your heart, Madam Speaker, as you have contributed much to the people of Western Sydney throughout your entire political career. WestConnex is the largest road transport project in Australia. It will provide a new way of travelling across Sydney, ensuring quick trips for commuters to the airport and Port Botany from Western Sydney. I would like to connect myself with the statements made by the honourable member for Reid and reiterate his sentiments about the disruption to his community in Strathfield, Cabarita and Canada Bay, the congestion that makes life for his community challenging every day—particularly on weekends—when getting kids to and from sport and school. I also look forward to the beautification projects for Parramatta Road, which has become an eyesore. It is about time we beautified this region and took pride in our inner west. I also reiterate my disappointment in those opposite who are determined to politicise these issues with narrow-minded small points.


Building WestConnex is proof that federal and state governments can work together and deliver better infrastructure to the people of Sydney. The Abbott government's investment in the WestConnex project is proof that we are getting serious about getting on with the job of delivering the roads of the 21st century. For too long, successive governments have shirked the responsibility of providing vital infrastructure to the people of Western Sydney. We all remember that it was the former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr who stated 'Sydney is full'. Such statements are most unhelpful to the people of my region. As an outer metropolitan electorate in the Sydney basin, we often find ourselves at the back of the queue of overcrowded infrastructure. When travelling to the city we must fight the bottlenecks of Strathfield, Concord, Homebush, Parramatta and Blacktown and then in our own region of the greater Nepean Valley. This knock-on effect of not investing in infrastructure right through Western Sydney causes great frustration to the people living in my electorate and travelling from it. I believe WestConnex is a vital brick in the road to decongesting these bottlenecks.


Every day, two-thirds of the Lindsay workforce must leave the region for employment opportunities. Our region is one of the fastest growing in Australia, and it is projected that over the next 20 years an additional half-million people will make Western Sydney their home. In essence, for the people of my region, that is akin to constructing a Canberra to the north and a Canberra to the south of Penrith. My region of Western Sydney must ready itself not only for the challenges of providing existing infrastructure to meet the demands of the current population but also for the needs of future generations. I look forward to working with the infrastructure Prime Minister not only in the master-planning process that is essential to providing the vital roads and rail demanded by the people of Western Sydney but also on providing an infrastructure pipeline crucial in meeting the future needs in connecting our regions.


I acknowledge the legacy of Prime Minister John Howard and his achievement of delivering the M7 under budget and ahead of schedule. As the M7 has already demonstrated, key roads in Western Sydney are an essential catalyst for future investment and are sure to create more local jobs. We need only look at Norwest, Erskine business park, and Dunheved Business Park and we will see the opportunities that have been created in those regions. Look also at what is happening at the Light Horse Interchange. These are exciting for the people of Western Sydney. It is about time we brought jobs to where the people live.


WestConnex will allow our local residents to bypass 52 sets of traffic lights and save 40 minutes on their trip to the city. It will, finally, connect the M5 and M4 corridors. WestConnex will enable the people of Lindsay to spend more time with their families and less time on the road. It will save businesses time and money, allowing deliveries to be received and sent more efficiently. It will give heavy vehicles real choices about how to travel across Sydney without clogging up local roads and needing to stop at countless traffic lights. Currently, we see a massive backlog in freight, with links to the airport and the port not able to cope with demand. More than half—13 hours—of any 24-hour period sees the M4 strangled, with more than 170,000 trucks and cars. This costs the state and national economies billions of dollars. Estimates put the cost to Sydney of this congestion as high as $8.8 billion by 2020. Therefore, I am pleased to note that WestConnex will return some $20 billion to the New South Wales economy. Not only will WestConnex deliver that economic benefit to New South Wales but it will help create 10,000 jobs during construction, including hundreds of apprenticeships.


The O'Farrell government breaks WestConnex into three stages. Stage 1 is the concept design from Parramatta to Homebush. The O'Farrell government has already commenced holding public information sessions along this corridor. In many cases these have been held by my very good friend the member for Penrith, the Hon. Stuart Ayres MP—it is great to be able to call him 'the honourable'. I congratulate him on his ascension into the New South Wales ministry. Stage 1 also involves widening the M4 into four lanes in each direction between Church Street, Parramatta, and Homebush Bay Drive, then further extending the M4 via a tunnel along Parramatta Road through to the City West Link at Haberfield. I am sure that that is the part that the member for Reid is very anxious to see. Clearing this bottleneck allows us in the outer suburbs of Western Sydney a huge opportunity, because it is this bottleneck that sees traffic banked back as far as St Marys every single peak hour. Work is due to commence on this in 2015.


Stage 2 focuses on the M5 east corridor, widening the M5 to four lanes in each direction between King Georges Road and Bexley Road.




Mr Coleman:
  Hear, hear!




Ms SCOTT:
  It is nice to see that the member for Banks is very excited about that. Further, there will be a six-kilometre tunnel to join this section of motorway to the St Peters area, as well as a surface link to Sydney Airport. Stage 3 will see an 8.5-metre tunnel linking stages 1 and 2 via the Camperdown area with three lanes in each direction. Together, the New South Wales and Australian governments are contributing $3.3 billion to WestConnex with the whole 33-kilometre corridor to cost around $11 billion. In addition to the motorway, urban revitalisation will take place along the Parramatta Road corridor. WestConnex will take around 3,000 trucks a day off Parramatta Road—and that will be great for Strathfield families—and put them into a tunnel allowing for around 25,000 new homes and 25,000 new jobs over the next 20 years. We are removing the burden that has been placed on Australian businesses.


I am pleased to second the motion of the member for Reid and am proud to be part of a government that will continue providing real solutions to the people of Western Sydney. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:30):  I speak in opposition to this motion. Labor is not opposed to the WestConnex project but we are opposed to short-term planning and political fixes, which this project and this motion appear to be. Deputy Speaker, if you drove to Sydney Airport this morning, the one thing that you could guarantee after 5.30 am is a traffic jam. On every business day, after 5.30 am in my electorate, at Kingsford Smith Airport you are guaranteed a traffic jam. Less than a kilometre away from our nation's largest and busiest airport is our nation's largest and busiest port, Port Botany. The port is currently being expanded to cater for additional shipping that will see more and more trucks on the roads around Sydney Airport and the streets of Kingsford Smith. At the moment, around Mascot train station there are 10- to 15-storey residential apartments being built, which will see additional residents move into the airport precinct and, of course, additional cars on our roads. This is putting massive pressure on the roads in my electorate of Kingsford Smith.


As I said, Labor is not opposed to the WestConnex project, but we are opposed to elements of it in its current form. In its current form, WestConnex will simply make the situation worse around pinch points in the Sydney traffic network—in particular, around Sydney Airport and Port Botany. The current proposal for WestConnex proposes exits at Canal road, at Qantas Drive and at General Holmes Drive. That will see thousands of additional vehicles come onto the roads around Sydney Airport. The people who use WestConnex from the western suburbs to come to the airport will end up on ordinary two-lane roads around the airport and the port. There is no plan as part of the WestConnex project to upgrade those important roads that feed on to the WestConnex around Sydney Airport and the port. Importantly—and the great shame about this proposal and this motion—there is no link from the WestConnex to Port Botany. There is no link at all from Foreshore Road, which goes directly onto Port Botany—the existing port and the new one—and the WestConnex project. It is one of the biggest and most important road infrastructure and planning projects in the state's history, and yet there is no link at all to the port which carries the freight that travels west on our roads. It is our nation's largest port and there is no link between WestConnex and the port, which is literally 800 metres away. It is not as if it would take a massive expansion of WestConnex to link it into the port. It is a great symbol of poor planning. And that is why we have a problem with this motion that is before the House today. Element (3) of the motion states:


(3) the 33 kilometre motorway linking Sydney's west and south-west with the CBD, Sydney Airport and Port Botany, will return some $20 billion to the NSW economy …


It does not link to Port Botany. That is the problem with the motion. The 33-kilometre motorway does not link to Port Botany. It does not link to our nation's biggest port, which sees the largest amount of freight on our roads in Sydney. In that respect, this motion is deceptive, and it is pure politics over substance.


That will see additional freight and traffic from our port. Additional traffic from the WestConnex at the airport will be deposited on the roads around Kingsford Smith; in particular, General Holmes Drive, which is the major thoroughfare that takes people from the shire—from Cronulla, Sylvania and those places—into the city, into the CBD. It is the major road, and it is getting busier and busier. Now we are going to deposit all that additional traffic from the WestConnex and the port and the airport, with no link to this road project. That is the concern that Labor has with this project and this motion.


And it is not simply Labor that is opposed to this and has these concerns. Indeed, the Australian Logistics Council, the body responsible as the voice of the transport industry in this country, has similar concerns. Michael Kilgariff, the managing director of the ALC, called for the economic benefits of the WestConnex to be maximised because, in his view, in the current proposal they are not being maximised. He said:


I appreciate that there are some significant logistical issues having the motorway run via the Port, not to mention the cost … but ideally, the ALC would have liked to have seen the motorway run further into the port area.


There you have it. That is the view of the Australian Logistics Council—those that are involved on a day-to-day basis in transport.


I said at the beginning that Labor is not opposed to the WestConnex project—indeed, Labor allocated $1.8 billion towards WestConnex in the 2013-14 budget. But we made that on certain conditions, and those conditions are that the final proposal must provide direct links to get people to the city and the freight to the port. That is an important element of any proposal. Secondly, there should be no new tolls on old roads. This proposal will toll people from the western suburbs of Sydney for using existing roads, most notably the M4. And there needs to be a finalisation of a detailed business case for assessment by Infrastructure Australia, something that is sadly lacking in this proposal and this motion that comes before the parliament.


There is nothing in this project about integration. The current proposal does not integrate with the port. That is a far cry from Labor's approach to important projects such as this when we were in government. That approach is in evidence in Labor's investment in roads and urban transport projects throughout the country. Labor doubled the road budget during our period in office. We increased it to $46.5 billion. We upgraded 7½ thousand kilometres of roads throughout the country.


The Abbott government's approach is a refusal to accept integration, a refusal to back urban transport projects, and that is the great shame about this proposal and this investment. Labor, particularly in New South Wales in terms of federal infrastructure spending, more than doubled the amount that has been invested in infrastructure projects in Australia—the largest amount in our nation's history. In financial year 2013-14, Labor injected $1.7 billion into infrastructure projects in New South Wales.


Let us look at Labor's record in government on infrastructure in New South Wales. We committed $5.5 billion to road and rail transport projects servicing Sydney over six years. They include $840 million for the northern Sydney freight line upgrade; $800 million for the Moorebank intermodal terminal, an important project that will take some of that freight off the roads around my electorate and put it on rail out to Moorebank intermodal from the port, to be transported via truck; $980 million for the southern Sydney freight line; $405 million for the F3 to M2 missing link; $300 million to upgrade the Greater Western Highway; $172 million for Port Botany rail improvements; $98 million to widen the F5 at Campbelltown; $75 million for the upgrade of Port Botany rail line; $40 million for the Port Botany upgrade program; and $1.8 billion to deliver the M4 and M5 extensions, in partnership with the New South Wales government.


That is the way that you invest in transport infrastructure, with integrated proposals, and that is why this motion must be opposed.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:40):  I stand to oppose the motion. Like my colleague from Kingsford Smith, I support the development of infrastructure in Western Sydney, but it has to be the right infrastructure. When I see motions like this before the House, I wonder how many ways the current government can be a different government from the one they said they would be in the election campaign. They said they were a government with a plan and, if this is an example of their planning capacity, it is not a very good one. They said they would be an infrastructure government and, again, if this is an example of the quality of the infrastructure planning that we will see from the government, we are not looking forward to a particularly good decade ahead as the plans they put in place in this early stage come to fruition.


The WestConnex project is a nice announcement. We in the Parramatta area and further west know that we have a fabulous piece of infrastructure in the M4, but, like many of the pieces of infrastructure in our area, it is not complete. I have said quite often in my community that one of the things we would like to see in Parramatta is a piece of our infrastructure actually finished. If you look around you can see the Parramatta to Chatswood rail line, which stops at Epping, and the current state government and this federal government are withdrawing the funding from that, so that will not be finished. It just needs to be finished—you can almost see Epping railway station from Carlingford. The line to Richmond has been doubled to Schofields but then goes single, again putting extra cars on the road through Parramatta. The M4 stops at Strathfield, and this project moves that problem elsewhere but does not solve it. You cannot get from Parramatta to Bankstown or Blacktown across Western Sydney with any great ease. Of course, the M5 needs to be widened, the M3 needs to be finished and the freight corridors, which were funded and in large part completed by the Labor government, still need to be completed. So, when you look around the area of Parramatta, you can see lots and lots of infrastructure projects that were started at some point but were never actually finished. Strangely enough, as the second CBD, Parramatta seems to be ignored in most of those infrastructure projects, as with this one.


There are three ways you can get traffic off the road—three ways you can deal with traffic congestion. You can build public transport to get the cars off the road in the first place. Again, we have seen the current state government and this federal government walk away from that in a major way in the Parramatta to Epping rail line. That project, by the way, if it had started on time would have been finished in early 2015—it would have been finished before this project even begins, and they walked away from that.


You can look at finding ways to use both sides of a road. When the member for Lindsay talked about the M4 being chockers in the morning, she is right—going into the city it is chockers, but going out of the city we have an extraordinary piece of infrastructure that can move people but is essentially empty. Using both sides of a road requires that you plan your infrastructure to move people in two directions, and I will get to some of the flaws in the design of WestConnex as it relates to Parramatta as a major CBD in a minute.


But if you are going to build a piece of infrastructure as expensive as WestConnex, as expensive as all of our major freeways, any sensible planning requires that you find ways for people to use those freeways in both directions in both the morning and the afternoon. This is about moving people from the west to the city in the morning and from the city to the west in the afternoon, and not about two-way travel at all. The third way you can do it, which is probably the most expensive way, is just to accept that there will be cars on the roads and build bigger and bigger, and fatter and fatter, roads to move them around. WesConnex attempts to do that, but it does it in a way that only moves the congestion and the bottlenecks from one place to another.


I want to get into the detail of that. Stage 1, which you heard about from the member for Lindsay, deals with the section of road from Church Street to Haberfield, the section of road from Parramatta to the beginning of the City West Link. It is a really important stretch of road. At the moment, the M4 stops at Strathfield and you end up on Parramatta Road, which is a major choke point until you get to Wattle Street, a two-lane road that starts to move a little better. As you get closer to the city it too is essentially a car park. Stage 1 widens the M4 to Strathfield. It widens the bit of the M4 that we currently have to four lanes and puts a toll on it, and it finishes that in 2019. So, between now and 2019, we will see the widening of the M4 to four lanes. It will be three lanes until you get to Parramatta and then it will be four lanes from there until you hit Strathfield, where it will go into a tunnel and back to three lanes. So that is the first new choke point—four lanes to three lanes for the tunnel, and then as you come out of the tunnel at Haberfield you go to two lanes. So it fools you into thinking, as you enter the freeway just after Parramatta, that you are on a nice road into the city, but then as more traffic joins it you go to three lanes and then as more traffic again joins it you go to two lanes. I mean, it is almost backwards from what a decent plan would be, which would actually widen the road according to the amount of traffic that is entering it.


It also creates some interesting new choke points within Parramatta. We are very critical in Parramatta of the WestConnex design because it actually ignores Parramatta completely—the second CBD is ignored completely, except that there are a couple of extra ways to get out of Parramatta. You can get out of Parramatta, heading into the city, at Bridge Road, which is already an incredible choke point. It goes over a very narrow two-lane bridge across a railway station, a major choke point that people in the area are already critical of, and turns it into a bigger choke point. It also introduces a western lane out of Church Street. Again that is a good thing but Church Street also is a car park coming through Parramatta—the only way to get there is to go through the Parramatta CBD if you want to get onto the M4 at that one—and it turns what is already a major choke point into an even bigger one.


It is also worth looking at the time frames for this. By 2019 we will have a nice wide M4 that funnels down into three lanes just as more traffic joins it after Strathfield and then down to two lanes as you approach the city. One would have to question how that is going to cause traffic to flow in a better way. It bypasses the second CBD altogether. It does not provide extra access points into Parramatta. It does not provide any encouragement for traffic to flow the other way, only from the west into the city. Again, it is an extraordinary waste of half a resource for half a day. I doubt that a business would make a decision to build such an expensive piece of infrastructure and only use half of it at any given time, when both sides are available.


Stage 2, which will be completed by 2020, deals with the M5 motorway from St Peters to the airport. Again, it is incredibly important that the M5 motorway be widened. It was on the Labor government's plans and it is quite appropriate that it be widened; it is, in fact, too narrow. But the bit between those two, from Haberfield to St Peters, will not be complete for another 10 years. So it will be 10 years before people in the west will be able to use the motorway from Parramatta, through the four lanes and the three lanes, and then through the tunnel heading around to the M5 and back to the airport. It is at least a 10-year wait for that.


Between now and then, we have what can only be described as a project which will encourage more cars onto a road before funnelling them down into narrower bits. It is a plan which ignores the second CBD. It ignores it completely. It is a plan which worsens the choke points that are already in that CBD. It essentially, in a very short period of time, will leave us with the same sort of car park morning traffic and afternoon traffic flows that we have now. It is hard to imagine this WestConnex, given the way it is designed and the way it funnels into narrower and narrower roads as it approaches the city, will do anything other than encourage more cars into the car park which is currently the M4. Without encouraging traffic to flow the other way, without finding a way to get cars off the road through a better public transport system, without investing in infrastructure which gets cars off the road, this is just going to make the situation worse.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (10:51):  It is not really the politics of hope, is it, Mr Deputy Speaker, from the member for Parramatta? It is not, 'Yes, we can'; it is, 'No, we can't.' You can understand why the last Labor governments federally and in New South Wales were so atrocious on delivering infrastructure projects for metropolitan Sydney. In my electorate we were promised up to five times over a decade that the north-west rail line would be constructed. Signs went up saying, 'Coming soon: the north-west rail line.' But over 12 years those five promises were broken. It was never started. It took the election of a Liberal state government to actually start construction of a major public transport infrastructure project in Australia. The north-west rail line is a major public transport infrastructure upgrade. Over 12 years Labor did nothing in Sydney.


We also saw under the last federal government six years where not a single dollar of infrastructure money was spent in metropolitan Sydney. Nothing was done. Of course, $100,000 was put into the New South Wales state government for a study. There was $100,000 for a study on a metro line. But when the metro line was cancelled by that state government, the Commonwealth had a windfall. The money was paid back. So the only money that was allocated by the federal government for a study had to be paid back by the state government to the Commonwealth. That is the embarrassing record of Labor in office with infrastructure in the biggest city in our country. It is the biggest driver of economic activity in our country, and there were no infrastructure projects underway under Labor.


This is an excellent motion from the member for Reid, highlighting the fact that from day one the Tony Abbott government, a Liberal government, will be very different on the delivery of infrastructure in Australia. This is not about being road technicians. I question the qualifications of the member for Parramatta to tell us about her design input into the lanes or the gradients of the tunnels. I really question her input. I know we have frustrated car executives on that side who want to run car companies. They want to run airlines. They also now want to tell us about the gradients of tunnels and about lanes. Is it only me who finds this extraordinary?


We are putting in funding from the Commonwealth—actual dollars. That is what we do at a Commonwealth level. We provide the funding. The best piece of infrastructure built by a Commonwealth government in recent memory was the M7, funded by the Commonwealth under the Howard government in partnership with the state government. It is an excellent motorway. I never get a single complaint about it. People do not mind paying the toll, member for Parramatta, because they get a great service from that toll. It is unrealistic in a modern construct to expect infrastructure to be built by government without some form of user-pays charge. It is unrealistic. It is unprofessional for members of parliament to come into this House and say, 'It is possible.' Simply put, the infrastructure backlog that exists in all of our major cities around Australia is so substantial that it is unrealistic and blatantly politically flawed to come in here and suggest that there can be no user-pays input into major infrastructure projects. There needs to be, there must be and there should be. That is the reasonable way to construct the financing of this project.


We know that with the state government there will be a reasonable toll put on this motorway. It needs to happen so we can get Sydney moving again. Given everything we know about infrastructure financing in Australia, it is fantastic that we are keeping our commitment to go through with such an important project in a major city to get Sydney moving again.


Just on the weekend, you could pick up reports which showed that our city has ground to a halt. The papers are asking, 'Why does one truck hitting a tunnel stop the whole city?' The answer is, because we have relied solely on government to fund motorways and other infrastructure projects in Sydney. Design has been missing.


Coming to office as a new government with a new start, we are starting on the front foot. We are building the most important project—that is, connecting Sydney with the west, the biggest economic driver in our city: Western Sydney and its millions of people, millions of businesses, and all of the economic drivers that will make our city prosperous. We have to get it moving with a major infrastructure project. We know this will create 10,000 jobs. Of course we can get this right. We do not have to have a debate in here about the technical grading of the tunnelling, or how many lanes it needs to be; that is the opposition looking for a cause. It is just simple negativity—relentless negativity. This is the most negative opposition I have ever seen! They are relentlessly negative about everything. But the reality is that the populations of the member for Chifley's electorate, and of the member for Kingsford Smith's electorate and of the member for Parramatta's electorate will be cheering the Abbott government on as this project is commenced and as road projects actually get underway—not studies, not money allocated in the last year of the government—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr HAWKE:
  And there are lots of claims over there; they say, 'on the final year of the forward estimates we put some money in'—well, we are actually putting the money in up front and getting the real construction underway. This is a fantastic motion by the member for Reid. I absolutely commend it to the House. And I say to those members opposite: please, the politics of hope—yes we can.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:56): The member for Reid gets breathless behind the vision of the way that those opposite are funding WestConnex. He just gets excited; he gets cheap thrills. I do not want to ask him to fill out a shopping list in case I give him a heart attack! I cannot get over the vision behind this $1.5 billion cash splash that underwrites WestConnex—it tells me that you are into cheap thrills that someone else is paying for. Because all those members opposite have their noses pressed up against the thought bubble that we will see the coalition infrastructure wish list put out on parade. It is nothing more than a sort of amateurish smudge of credibility on coalition talking points. It is not good enough. In opposition, the coalition wanted a cost-benefit analysis on a fridge opening. And now they write on the back of confetti, put up a cheer, and pat themselves on the back, and they think that is good enough—it ain't.


We set up Infrastructure Australia with a specific purpose: to de-politicise these issues. We wanted to ensure that the politics is taken out of these issues and that the independent experts are put in. Infrastructure projects from across the country are put in by state governments. We then backed those projects up with funding, after the experts had been through them—nearly $47 billion on roads nationally and $13.6 million on rail—and we saw results. I challenge the member for Mitchell when he says that in Sydney we saw no funding. We saw $5.5 billion on the road and rail transport service in Sydney over six years, including nearly $2 billion for the northern Sydney freight line and the southern Sydney freight line upgrades; $405 million for the F3 to M2 missing link; and $93 million to widen the F5 at Campbelltown that you and I no doubt drive down to get here. We also have the $300 million to upgrade the Great Western Highway and $300 million for Port Botany rail improvements and associated upgrades. Depoliticised, independent, evidence-based, fully-funded quantified results—that is methodical. It is the kind of infrastructure planning process that those opposite dream about. The contrast is embarrassing, because we have heard from the member for Reid—the chief cheerleader proposing this motion—a terrible proposition being put forward about the financing of WestConnex.


As a Western Sydney MP, I never want to take a backward step in representing people in my area. Yes, people in our area spend way too much time in traffic. Yes, they do want to see better funding for public transport infrastructure. But they should get properly funded, well-designed roads that they should not have to pay for twice. They are paying for this M4 upgrade twice with the retolling of the M4. In government, we set aside $1.8 billion in the 2013-14 budget for WestConnex on three simple conditions: first, that the proposal had to provide direct links to get people to the city and freight to the port; second, no new tolls on old roads; and third, finalisation of a detailed business case for assessment by Infrastructure Australia. And what did Mr Abbott do? He blasted out $1.5 billion at the end of an election promise megaphone, smack into the coffers of the New South Wales government, but then flicked the bill to Western Sydney motorists. The cheer squad here for retolling the M4 is made up of the member for Reid, the member for Banks, the member for Mitchell and the member for Lindsay—all of those members should tell their constituents that they support retolling the M4, and that they support paying for old roads out of their constituents' pockets. Every single one of you should be doing it. The average toll, member for Reid, on the initial Parramatta-to-Homebush M4 widening is about $3 in current dollars, but it will be higher when the stage opens in 2017, at the earliest.


There are serious shortcomings. Jacob Saulwick of the Sydney Morning Herald gave the example that those opposite have set up the WestConnex Delivery Authority. He asked: 'What are these people doing?' In his article of 2 November he pointed out:


None of them seem to be raising what is quite a large elephant in the room: that WestConnex is the biggest urban infrastructure project in the country—with $3.3 billion of taxpayers' money already committed to it—and hardly anything is known about it.


Taxpayers do not know how many cars are expected to use this motorway. They do not know its estimated impact on local roads. They are yet to be told its precise route. They're in the dark on construction methods.


When they did get around to advising people, they told people, on the day of the announcement, that their homes would be resumed. The article continued:


Even the need for the WestConnex is not known. It is certainly true Sydney's roads are inadequate. But this does not mean that the precise model of WestConnex is the solution.


When you look at it, this matter has a lot of questions that need to be answered. But the worst thing is that they are re-tolling the M4.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:01):  I am thrilled to speak on this tremendous motion moved by my friend the member for Reid and seconded so eloquently by the member for Lindsay. This is a terrific motion for a terrific project. This is the first time I have spoken in this House on a contested motion. I am wondering if this is, effectively, what normally happens in the sense that the government puts forward a constructive motion, a project that is clearly in the interests of the people of my electorate and of Sydney more generally, and then the opposition comes along and says that it is a bad idea. I can tell you that for the people of the electorate of Banks this is a very good idea and a very, very important project.


The reality of Sydney roads is that Labor's legacy, in both the state government and in its failure to contribute at a federal level, is one of congestion—and everyone in Sydney knows that to be the case. It seems to me that, on the one hand, Labor proposes job-killing taxes and, on the other hand, we on this side propose job-creating infrastructure. I certainly know which side I would rather be on.


For my electorate WestConnex is particularly important because of the duplication of the M5 East tunnel. Anyone who has driven from Beverly Hills in my electorate—or from Hurstville, or from Mortdale or from any of the suburbs that access the M5 for the drive into the city—know how bad the M5 East tunnel can be. There are frequent delays and lots of congestion to the point where some people have abandoned using the road altogether. It is only two lanes at present, which is inadequate. One of the great outcomes of this project is that the M5 East tunnel will be increased to four lanes in each direction. That is going to provide much-needed relief for the people of Banks.


The trip from King Georges Road at Beverly Hills into the CBD is now estimated to take about 55 minutes in peak hour. A very substantial reduction of around 25 minutes on the journey is expected with the completion of this project. Imagine what that saving means in time. It means that people can get to their business meetings on time. It means that they can get more done during the working week. It also means that families can spend more time together. People who drive home from work in the city, and who are confronted by huge traffic delays on the M5 East, are going to get home to their families more quickly with the building of the WestConnex. That is obviously a good thing not just for the economy but also for family life in general. It is certainly a tremendous development for my area.


It is also important to think about some of the roads where congestion will be eased. There is a lot of congestion at the moment on roads like the River Road, Fairford Road, Belmore Road North and, of course, King Georges Road, which can be a real bottleneck in my electorate of Banks. At the moment, when you merge onto the M5 at Beverly Hills, you have to merge into the existing traffic. One of the important developments in the WestConnex project is that there will now be a dedicated lane for that merging at Beverly Hills so that traffic will not have to merge into the existing traffic. The member for Reid and others would understand how tremendous not having to face that merge will be for my electorate.


The contrast is very, very clear. Premier Nathan Rees was one of a number of premiers in New South Wales over a relatively short period of time. Back in 2009 he and his transport minister put in place plans for the M5 East duplication which were removed three months later. The M4 East was first promised by Bob Carr back in 2002, which I think is 11 years ago, and it did not happen. The government is committed, through its contribution to the WestConnex, to improving infrastructure in the city, and I commend the motion to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:06):  I understand that this is the first time the member for Reid has brought a motion before the House. That is understandable, as he is a new member, and I congratulate him for his courage. But I think we are going to have to chalk this one down to a beginner's error, because it is a very, very rare member of parliament on either side of the House who will bring a motion before the House which does nothing but put the spotlight on a fundamental error—a big problem, a broken promise, a policy backflip—by their own leader. Let us have a think about what we have witnessed over the last couple of years.


It is little surprise that the member for Wentworth is not in here to speak on this motion, because he has entertained us, up hill and down dale, for the last three years on the importance of cost-benefit analysis when putting in place important infrastructure projects. Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you sat in the last parliament and you would have witnessed some often very entertaining contributions from the member for Wentworth on the importance of cost-benefit analysis. We have set up a body whose single job is to ensure that large infrastructure projects in this country are subject to a cost-benefit analysis, and that body is known as Infrastructure Australia.


I would not have been surprised if the member for Sturt came in here and spoke on this motion, because he can speak on anything on any given day of the week, even if his contributions contradict what he said the day before. He has that capacity, but many others on the other side do not. Let me remind the member for Reid what his leader said prior to the federal election. When talking about large infrastructure projects, he said that in government they would require all Commonwealth infrastructure expenditure exceeding $100 million to be subject to analysis by Infrastructure Australia to test cost-effectiveness and financial viability, yet here we have the member for Reid celebrating the fact that they are bringing this project on without a cost-benefit analysis, without it coming within cooee of Infrastructure Australia and with serious flaws—as the member for Chifley and the member for Kingsford Smith have pointed out.


On this side of the House we are not opposed to building roads. We put record amounts of funding into roads and into urban transport infrastructure in New South Wales, right around Australia and in Sydney itself—$5.5 billion over the last four years, and that amount is 15 times greater than that spent by the previous, Howard government on Sydney transport infrastructure. We were willing to fund the WestConnex project, and $1.8 billion was put towards it in the 2013-14 budget; but it was subject to conditions. The first was that it would be toll-free—as the member for Chifley, the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Parramatta have pointed out—and that there would be no new tolls on old roads, because that amounts to just a new tax on old infrastructure for motorists.


So the member for Reid is celebrating, and others have spoken in favour of his motion: a new tax on old roads for motorists. That is not the only problem with it. The second problem is that, because it has not been properly planned, we are shifting transport bottlenecks from one part of Sydney to another. As a result of this project—because all the planning has not been put in place and because it is not properly integrated with road, port and rail—we are going to see a shift of bottlenecks and Sydney is going to become a car park. That is what this project was going to amount to because it is not being properly planned.


There are two ways to do transport infrastructure: you can do it on the back of a beer coaster, as those opposite are celebrating, or you can put in place the proper planning process, which was established by the former government through Infrastructure Australia, and ensure that it is all done properly. Infrastructure Australia has looked at this. It did not punt it; it said that it is definitely a project that needs to be considered and that further planning is needed. It suggested that it was at the early stage of conception. If this were integrated with rail, those on this side of the House would find it a lot easier to support this motion.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt) (11:54):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill today. There are two key elements of this bill, and I will only briefly mention the first. I disagree with the previous speaker in that it seeks to make a technical amendment to the EPBC Act to ensure that past decisions cannot be exposed to legal challenges. I was pleased to hear that despite media reports to the contrary the amendment does not reduce the level of protection provided for threatened species and ecological communities under the act. Australia has incredibly diverse native species, many of which are under threat as a result of human activities, and relevant conservation advice must always be considered.


I intend to focus on the second key element, and part of that is the increasing of penalties under the EPBC Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act for killing and injuring turtles and dugongs. On 15 August I was proud to stand next to the then shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, Greg Hunt, and local conservation legend Jennie Gilbert of the Cairns Turtle Rehabilitation Centre when we launched our $5 million plan to provide greater protection for dugongs and turtles along the Great Barrier Reef. It came as a result of ongoing community concern about illegal poaching and the need for greater care for our dugong and turtle population. The plan included a commitment to treble the financial penalties for poaching and illegal trafficking of turtle and dugong meat, and these are certainly significant increases. Under the EPBC Act 1999 the maximum fine will increase from $170,000 to $510,000 for the offences of killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving a dugong or a turtle in a Commonwealth area. Where these penalties relate to strict liability offences—for example, used to deter potential offenders rather than to impose punishment—the maximum financial penalty will increase from $85,000 to $255,000. Maximum financial penalties for injuring or taking turtles or dugongs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 will increase from $340,000 for aggravated criminal offences to $1,020,000 and for strict liability offences from $10,200 to $30,600. These increases will be a significant deterrent to those individuals who are doing the wrong thing. We certainly must get the message out that we will be imposing criminal convictions and larger fines. This is not mere rhetoric. These animals are too important for that.


Getting back to our $5 million plan, in addition to the focus on the threats of poaching and illegal hunting, it also has other key elements, including    $2 million for specialised Indigenous Ranger Programs for marine conservation along the Far North Queensland Coast and into the Torres Strait and for strengthened enforcement and compliance. This will be done through supporting additional officers on the water and on land to crack down on dugong and turtle poaching and the illegal trade in dugong and turtle meat. We will certainly be working with the Queensland government on the potential for extending the authority of select Indigenous rangers to take action to stop illegal poaching. This is a very important element of this, because while we do have ranger programs in place, in many cases they have absolutely no authority whatsoever. For example, I have known of a ranger standing on a beach with a large number of turtles that had been turned on their backs while they were being butchered, and he did not even have the authority to ask the names of those involved. We need to change that. That badge cannot just be a mickey mouse badge; it actually has to mean something. The rangers have to have the authority to take evidence, to take names, to confiscate equipment that is used in relation to these types of activities and to provide that evidence in a court of law that will see those individuals prosecuted for these illegal activities.


We have an added challenge up there that also needs to be addressed, and this is in the shared zone between Australia and Papua New Guinea, where we need to be working in collaboration with the villages, particularly those in the Western Province area of Papua New Guinea, so that we can work together, because it is as critically important for those villages as it is for the Torres Strait that these turtle and dugong populations are preserved. We are also looking at places like Raine Island, where the turtle breeding area is seriously under threat. It is collaborative work that could be done by the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre, which is headed by Sheriden Morris in Cairns. She has a wonderful relationship with the villagers in Papua New Guinea and also works well with the Torres Strait community. She would be a great way of bringing both of these together. This would make sure that we are able to get the necessary enforcement and education to make it happen. But it is not going to work unless the Indigenous rangers themselves have the authority to identify and challenge any activities.


The $2 million for the Australian Crime and Misconduct Commission to investigate the practice of illegal killing, poaching and transportation of turtle and dugong meat is another very important initiative. I know that the other side have accused us of being high-handed, but, as they rightfully said, there has never been a prosecution in this area. There is a good reason for that: there are just too many jurisdictions involved, and nobody wants to take responsibility. You have Queensland Fisheries, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Queensland Police and the Federal Police. It just goes around from one to the other. It is little wonder that these activities continue without being punished, because no jurisdiction takes full responsibility for them. By putting them through to the crime commission, at least you have a chance of starting to get some prosecutions.


The $700,000 towards cleaning up marine debris along the Far North Queensland coast, the Torres Strait Islands and the Coral Sea is a very important initiative, particularly in relation to ghost nets, which pose a huge risk for turtles and dugongs as well as other marine species. There are a couple of great organisations that deal with this. Heidi Taylor is the co-founder and director of the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, which carries out a program of beach clean-ups all along the Far North Queensland coast, as do the Mapoon Land and Sea Rangers, who do great work collecting ghost nets on Western Cape York. During a beach clean-up at Mapoon in July, members of the Mapoon Land and Sea Rangers, a team from Conservation Volunteers Australia, and volunteers from GhostNets Australia and Tangaroa Blue covered 11 kilometres of beach and removed just under 3,700 kilograms of debris, including 7,154 rubber thongs, 877 cigarette lighters and 2,663 gill net floats. So you can see the extent of the problem, and that is on just 11 kilometres of beach. It is a critical initiative.


There has also been $300,000 set aside to support the Cairns and Fitzroy Island turtle rehabilitation centres. This will certainly help with capital works and help the hospital achieve a permanent and sustainable future. The Cairns and Fitzroy Island rehabilitation centres do some fantastic work with a large group of volunteers. Doug Gamble, who is the owner of the Fitzroy Island Resort, generously donated the land for the Fitzroy Island centre earlier this year, and Jennie Gilbert, who I mentioned earlier, works tirelessly on behalf of these creatures. The funding will be well-utilised in rehabilitating turtles and returning them to the sea.


There are other issues that also need to be addressed. I have been speaking with the minister on these, and I am very keen that we continue to pursue these if we are going to deal with looking after the turtles and dugongs in the longer term. I certainly have major concerns with the illegal trading of meat. I know that it does happen in my electorate. Unfortunately, this turtle and dugong meat is cryovaced, frozen and transported through airports. In my view, there should be a prohibition on the transport of this meat. I am in absolute, total support of native title and of ensuring that native title rights for traditional hunting are protected. However, I am very much of the opinion that it is not in the spirit of native title for individuals to go out there and slaughter large numbers of turtles and dugongs, cryovac them up into plastic, freeze them and then send them all around Australia. At the moment they can do that quite legally if they claim it is for domestic use. It is my view that these creatures, if they are going to be slaughtered in traditional ways for cultural purposes and ceremonies, should be consumed and used in the area in which they were taken, because a very important part of the cultural use of these animals is respect for the animal. Quite frankly, I see no respect in having them sent in cryovac bags around Australia just so somebody can enjoy a little bit of turtle and dugong in Canberra or Sydney or Melbourne. That is an area that I think we need to address.


Another area that concerns me immensely is to see the images on Facebook of individuals going out there boasting of their slaughter of juvenile animals and what have you, and making all sorts of inappropriate comments. Again, it gets back to respect for the animal and blatant abuse of it. These activities are certainly ramping up public support for a total ban on the right to hunt endangered and vulnerable species. Around the country there is very serious momentum for a proposal that would see the total banning of hunting of these creatures for any reason. I would like to congratulate Colin Riddell from Save Australian Dugongs and Turtles, in conjunction with Bob Irwin, for his outstanding and passionate efforts. They have certainly rallied organisations, such as Animals Australia, and others too, such as the RSPCA, to call for an urgent change to the Native Title Act.


This is understandable and, unfortunately, this decision will not be made in our area, but rather it will be made in the metropolitan areas of Sydney or Melbourne. Make no mistake, if it continues, particularly with the Facebook images, there is a high probability that these guys will be successful. While I admire the work that Bob Irwin and Colin Riddell are doing, they know that I have a real issue with the extinguishment of native title rights. I urge the Indigenous communities to take control of this so that we do not lose this opportunity. That means that we have to deal with those individuals who are blatantly abusing the rules and posting on Facebook et cetera. While I disagree totally with Colin and Bob in this area, I can understand why they continue to pursue it. If we do not get something done there and in regard to the transporting of the meat, I do believe it just opens things up for abuse. It certainly is not in the spirit of native title.


Another area that I have great concern about is the activities of a few individuals who are getting involved in taking creatures from green zones in our region.


I have many examples there. One family in particular is going to a place in Green Island and, in front of horrified visitors, slaughtering turtles—which are seen as being like pets—and large fish. These animals have lost all fear of humans. These individuals weave amongst tourists swimming at Green Island and spear fish and turtles. They drag the turtles onto the beach, rip them open, pull the eggs out of them and cut them up, with maybe 50 or 60 absolutely horrified overseas tourists standing there watching them. They take what they want from the turtles and leave the mess for the national park rangers to clean up, and the rangers have absolutely no authority to stop this from happening. Michaelmas Cay is an area that has been protecting sea birds. The same group goes out there and, in front of horrified tourists, clubs to death large numbers of sea birds and takes them away, and nothing is done.


You can see why people are asking the question, 'Why on earth aren't we doing something about that, when we are making such a noise about the whales?' It would be better to make green zones, particularly those where there is human interaction with these creatures, no-go areas rather than having this senseless slaughter. It is no different to walking into somebody's house and beating their pet kitten to death, quite frankly, because these creatures have no fear of people. I congratulate Steve Davies, who has been very involved in trying to stop this, for raising the issue.


I think where we are going is a good start. I certainly support the initiatives that we see here today. As I said, I urge the minister to consider further claims on this. At the end of the day, the only way we are going to be able to comprehensively deal with this is to give the authority to the Indigenous rangers, to the Indigenous elders—who know what is traditional and know what is and is not appropriate—to deal with this. I commend this bill to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (12:07):  The remarks of the member for Leichhardt were very interesting, and I have taken note of them, but I wish to direct my remarks to a different section of the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. The House will be aware that bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is, unsurprisingly, the conservation of Australia's biodiversity—our unique and beautiful birds, plants, and animals.


It is therefore timely to ask: how well is the act performing in achieving this outcome? Sadly, it is failing badly. According to BirdLife Australia, there are currently 392 different kinds of fauna listed as threatened under the act, including no fewer than 112 different types of birds. Nineteen of these species are listed as critically endangered. There are many different examples of how Australian wildlife is in decline, but one of the most striking was covered in a report in Australian Birdlife magazine in September this year by Sean Dooley and Samantha Vine titled 'Parrots in Peril'. It reports that no fewer than 12 of Australia's around 60 parrots and cockatoos are listed as either endangered or critically endangered. That is around 20 per cent of our most loved and highest profile fauna at imminent risk of extinction.


The Norfolk Island green parrot has a current population of between 50 and 100, with possibly as few as 11 breeding females. The western ground parrot population is around 100 birds, in two separate populations in Western Australia. That population has declined by over 80 per cent in the last three generations. The orange-bellied parrot migrates between coastal Victoria and Tasmania. They are now down to around 45 birds. The night parrot population is unknown—it is an inland Australian species—but the best guess is that it is around 250 birds.


The Coxen's fig-parrot, which is a rainforest bird of Southern Queensland, has been estimated at 100 breeding birds, but there are surveys that suggest that fewer than 50 may remain. The eastern regent parrot of inland Victoria and South Australia comprises around 1,500 adult birds. The population has declined in some parts of South Australia by 66 per cent in the last 20 years. The golden-shouldered parrot of Cape York Peninsula nests in tunnels that it excavates into termite mounds. Its current population is probably about 2,500 birds—1,500 around the Morehead River and around 1,000 around the Staaten River. The swift parrot migrates between Tasmania and Victoria and New South Wales. There are approximately 1,000 breeding pairs of this bird, with a maximum of 2,500 individuals.


Four types of black cockatoo are also endangered. The Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo adult population is 350 birds. The south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo population is approximately 1,500, and that is declining. The Baudin's black cockatoo of south-west Western Australia has a current population of 10,000 to 15,000. The Carnaby's black cockatoo has a population of approximately 40,000, and that is also declining.


Penny Olsen had a lengthy report on the sad history of the orange-bellied parrot in the Australian Birdlife publication. She writes that conservationists have struggled to keep the orange-bellied parrot going. It is precarious to say the least to maintain a species once it has sunk to such low numbers. There is no resilience left in the population to combat the inevitable challenges nature throws at it: fire, flood, famine and other upheavals, not to mention inbreeding. As a final blow, climate change may be shifting the bird's climatic envelope south and off the southern edge of the continent, carrying with it the unfortunate parrot. Orange-bellied parrots are breeding in captivity, so, instead of a thriving wild population, we may be left with institutionalised orange-bellied birds. Extinction in the wild, I think, is a very dreary prospect. As Penny Olsen laments, there was a time when politicians feared an extinction on their watch, but that seems to have lapsed over the years.


What does BirdLife Australia say needs to be done? They say that we need to have a national threatened bird recovery fund to implement recovery plans for critically endangered birds, supported by federal funding of $25 million per annum. They also say that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires strengthening. In particular, they say the act requires a mechanism to account for cumulative impact and the ongoing loss of threatened species habitat. I think they are 100 per cent right.


The Australian Conservation Foundation also urges that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act be strengthened. They say that the act needs to be changed so that Commonwealth decision powers under environmental law can never be devolved to the states. They also express concern that the act allows the federal minister a wide discretion as to how the EPBC Act is implemented. This can lead to decisions based on political expediency rather than environmental standards.


The Australian Conservation Foundation says that the EPBC Act should specify objective, science based, mandatory standards by which ministerial decisions under the act are made, and impose a duty on the minister to protect the environment. Improving third-party access to merits reviews of decisions taken under the act is critical, allowing civil society to help enforce compliance and increase public confidence in the act.


What does the bill before the House do? It takes us in exactly the opposite direction. This amendment marks the beginning of efforts by the Liberal government to deconstruct all the good work done by previous governments, both Labor and Liberal, in protecting the environment, which the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act helps ensure. For this Liberal government it is all about paving paradise to put up a parking lot—whether on issues such as reversing action on climate change and protecting the Great Barrier Reef or this amendment, they have nailed their colours to the mast of environmental vandalism and the trashing of this country's beautiful and unique national heritage.


The first part of this bill effectively removes any need for the minister to consider certain environmental advice when approving things such as ports, mines and housing developments. With many of our most loved species on the brink of extinction—including the Leadbeater's possum, the Tasmanian devil and bilbies—we should be strengthening their protection, not undermining it. The bill before the House adds a clause to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act which states that a decision to approve a development will not be invalid merely because the minister failed to receive relevant approved conservation advice. This bill effectively removes the legal requirement for the minister to consider threatened and endangered species when approving projects. It is not just about the federal minister, though. If and when plans to delegate environmental approval powers to Queensland and New South Wales come into effect, the Newman and O'Farrell governments will also be relieved of the duty of considering conservation advice before approving projects.


Labor is opposed to weakening approval powers and, like many in the community, we simply do not trust Queensland Premier Campbell Newman to protect environmental assets such as the Great Barrier Reef. This bill drastically weakens the EPBC Act's protection of threatened and endangered species. Although the minister is still notionally expected to consider formal advice about how to protect these species—the so-called 'conservation advice'—the bill removes any capacity to legally challenge an approval on the basis that advice was not properly considered. Even worse, it does this retrospectively. Current legislation ensures that the minister takes into account all the relevant advice before approving a decision on a new mine, on a port expansion or on a significant new housing development. Depending on the type and location of a project, this advice could include information about a native species that is threatened or endangered. So what we have here is a bill that, on the one hand, weakens protection for threatened species such as the Tasmanian devil whilst, on the other hand, increases penalties for illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. Weakening environmental laws is environmental vandalism. It is regrettable, but I think the Newman government will never protect the environment and cannot be trusted to protect our natural heritage, including the Great Barrier Reef.


The changes in the first part of this bill will not only mean that the federal minister does not have to consider expert advice but also that state ministers will not have to consider this advice. There is a serious question around our international obligations that needs to be posed in this debate. As a good global citizen Australia has signed a number of treaties. Those treaties include: the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat; the Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage; the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals; the International Tropical Timber Agreement; and the Convention on Biodiversity.


Schedule 1 of this bill seems to have been precipitated by the recent Tarkine case, which saw an approval decision overturned because advice was not provided to the then minister by the department. In that case the court found that the decision to approve the mine was invalid because the minister had failed to consider the approved conservation advice for the Tasmanian devil, a threatened species under the act. Unlike the previous Labor government, which did not seek to change the law as a result of this challenge, the Liberal government have apparently decided that if the law does not suit their agenda they will simply change it—take their bat and ball and go home. 


This change would mean that legal challenges such as this one would fail. There are now ten mines proposed for the Tarkine over the next five years. I understand that nine of these mines are Pilbara-style, open cut mines. The Tarkine is home to the last disease-free population of the Tasmanian devil. The Tasmanian devil, as the House would be aware, is being pushed to extinction by the fatal devil facial tumour disease. This disease has been estimated to have killed 80 per cent of the Tasmanian devil population in the past decade. As such, the habitat of the Tarkine is critical to the survival of this iconic species in the wild. 


The Tarkine contains an extraordinary expanse of temperate rainforest—one of the world's greatest remaining tracts of temperate rainforest. Running continuously for more than 70 kilometres and reaching beyond the Arthur and Pieman rivers, this magnificent rainforest includes the Rapid, Keith, Donaldson and Savage river systems. This tract of rainforest is Australia's largest single tract of rainforest wilderness. Globally, it is one of the most significant remaining tracts of temperate rainforest left on the planet. Given that more than three-quarters of Australia's rainforest have already been permanently destroyed, I believe that it is critical that we protect the fragments that are left. 


This bill is just further evidence of a government that quashes debate and refuses to listen to the experts. They have been shutting down bodies providing advice on climate change, and now they want to ignore conservation advice as well. The conservationists have also said that the amendment before the House would stymie a challenge to the Maules Creek mine in NSW, which they say was approved based on erroneous information.


Whitehaven Coal, the mine's developer, was allowed to clear 544 hectares of endangered box gum woodland as well as further habitat that contains threatened species such as the swift parrot, which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and the greater long-eared bat. The Minister for the Environment is being urged by conservation groups to revoke the approval. Jess Abrahams, the healthy ecosystems campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, has said: 


Review and recourse from third parties to government decisions is an essential part of democracy, so it's very worrying this is being removed. 


… … …


Environmental protection is suffering a death by a thousand cuts at the moment. Laws are being weakened and approvals are being handed over to the states, which have a questionable record of protecting the environment.


… … …


We should be strengthening laws but instead we are watering them down.


She is absolutely right. Conservation advice is fundamental to making the best decisions on projects that have potentially harmful impacts on listed species. The objective of the act is to protect the environment. This amendment removes ministerial accountability and weakens environmental protection.


The government is already in the process of attempting to devolve federal approval powers to state governments, a move that would see state conservative premiers in charge of some of our country's greatest natural assets. The laws that protect Australia's most significant environmental assets—our World Heritage areas, precious water resources, internationally significant wetlands and threatened species—are not 'green tape'. The areas are priceless assets for all of us to find tranquillity and enrichment of the soul—much more important than wealth foregone for miners and developers. I urge the House to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for the environment.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (12:24):  It is a privilege to speak on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I note that it is really the English cricket team that has become an endangered species in this country, with the final fall of wicket in the second test heading our way. Congratulations to Harris on the last wicket—fantastic result!


On a more serious matter, it is more impressive to follow the member for Leichhardt on the first component of this bill, which I totally support, on turtles and dugongs, and to hear his stories about what is going on in his electorate and at the Great Barrier Reef. It is a great keeping of our election commitment that we are increasing the penalties. It is something we said we would do and is yet another tick for the coalition's environmental credentials on improving the situation in a way that will practically assist in an outcome on the illegal pouching of dugongs and turtles. It is done in a way that will not impact upon Indigenous rights to hunt in native-title areas but will increase criminal and civil penalties for the killing, injuring and taking, trading, keeping or moving of a turtle or dugong in a Commonwealth marine area or within the Great Barrier Reef marine park. It is something that is a worthwhile endeavour: keeping our election commitments.


We are moving an important amendment to the second component of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that if the Minister for the Environment does not have relevant approved advice it will not invalidate the decision under the act. This follows the court case that the member for Wills referred to, and I do want to take him up on one point that he argued: we are not making a case about a particular issue about a parrot or possum or other serious issues around the country; this is a legal issue about the separation of powers and about which jurisdiction will have the ability to make decisions that relate to serious approvals for major projects and could potentially affect past projects.


The member for Wills missed a very important point, and I was disappointed to see that he missed this. It is on raising the matter of the court case that led to the amendment being put into the House. It is in regard to the mining case of the Tarkine approved by the then environmental minister, Tony Burke, and re-approved by Labor. So, in terms of outcomes, the member for Wills really does not have cause for complaint. If he is trying to suggest this amendment would have altered the situation or is somehow a profoundly bad thing to do, the previous Labor government went ahead with the mine approval anyway. That may be completely appropriate; there may be nothing wrong with that. But the member for Wills, in avoiding that issue, is not necessarily representing the case in a fair way. 


It was okay for the previous Labor government to continue to approve this mine in the Tarkine, although the Commonwealth was exposed to serious legal action on a fairly oblique point on this advice. Think about all of the green regulations at both a state and federal level; all of the regulations that cover approvals which you must qualify for in Australia to get an approval for a mine underway. We know that they are substantial, we know that they are comprehensive and we know that the advice received from a state and federal level is detailed. All of these considerations are taken into account. But to expose the Commonwealth and these projects to retrospective problems with their approvals does not assist anybody. 


Hence the amendment we see before us today. The member for Wills skirts around saying that since 7 September there has been some dark pall cast over the environment in Australia and that concrete manufacturing is something that—as stock has gone up in Australia—we are using to concrete wilderness. 'Paved paradise' is his phrase from a famous song. I do not think that the climate has changed since 7 September or that things have got warmer or that possums and birds have more things to fear from with this government than they did from the previous government. Let us be serious and realistic about this. We do need to protect our environment and we do need to proceed with projects that are important to our economy and our society. Legally speaking, it is a better situation for the parliament to approve this bill and so to ensure that an act of the minister is not subject to that uncertainty for a major project or major approval once it has gone through all of the considerable regulatory hoops that you must go through in this country.


It is why we have a green-tape agenda to reduce green tape in Australia. That is an unnecessary duplication at state and federal level. We think green tape is probably one of the biggest impediments to getting business moving in this country and one of the main contributors to making our businesses less competitive on the international stage. By removing many of these many duplicate layers of green tape we can get things done and protect the environment. That is, of course, the best way for human beings to coexist with the natural world we live in.


It really is not a great idea for the members opposite to come in here and say that we are against this particular parrot, or that particular possum or that bird. That is not the case. We take seriously the conservation advice delivered to the government. But it is not a good legal case, when we have a separation of powers, to have the Commonwealth exposed—or to have the minister, via the Commonwealth—exposed to his decisions being second guessed every step of the way. We are literally at the very end of a very substantial process that anyone must go through to get a mine approved in this country.


I fully support this amendment and those technical amendments that address the risk make this legislation retrospective. That is, we will not now see a flurry of legal action taken in response to previous decisions. The member for Wills should look pretty carefully at that part of the bill which we are debating here today. We are making this retrospective—not the decisions of former Liberal Party or National Party environment ministers over the past six years but the decisions of the previous government that could be subject to legal exposure. That is appropriate and proper and an adult approach to government. The opposition comes and suggests that, somehow, we have a dark and evil agenda in relation to the environment when we are simply saying that the processes that we have gone through are rigorous, the green standards that have to be met are high in Australia by anybody's benchmark and the minister has had the appropriate advice and has had the chance to consider that advice. We believe that, once all of that has been gone through, it should not be subject to particular legal action specifically in relation to the nature of the advice received by the Minister for the Environment.


I do not believe that the member for Wills made a very compelling case. He may have had some good things to say about protecting various sections of flora and fauna in our country, but he did not make a compelling case. He conveniently overlooked that in the particulars of this legal matter the Tarkine mine was ultimately approved by the then environment minister anyway. So the outcome was the same, but the legal challenge that was gone through is an unnecessary impediment to doing business that we can remove by passing this piece of high-quality legislation and ensuring that we do not expose the Commonwealth unnecessarily to this risk.


I fully support this bill, and I hope that members opposite start to tone down their approach of accusing us of wanting to concrete every piece of environment in the country. It simply is not the case. It is overblown rhetoric. It is not really necessary. Frankly speaking, it is the case that too many of our projects, which are so important to our economy and to Australia's prosperity, are being wound-up in too much duplication and green tape, and it is something that this government will look at.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:33):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. For the benefit of listeners, the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to address the implications arising from the Federal Court's decision in Tarkine National Coalition Inc. v Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, otherwise known as the Tarkine case, which the previous speaker referred to. It also provides additional protection for turtles and dugongs by increasing the financial penalties for various offences and for civil penalty provisions, and it amends the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 by providing additional protection for protected species under that act.


Protecting our natural environment is important as economic development to this country because it is about creating jobs and prosperity, and both are of equal importance to the nation and to government. The two are in fact compatible if managed responsibly. To this government the environment appears to be expendable whenever it is pitted against economic development. In fact, not just for this government but also for conservative state governments across the country, we are now seeing a clear track record where the environment seems to come off second best whenever it in any way impedes money-making ventures and development.


Sadly, what is not very well understood by many is that damaging the environment has, indeed, substantial economic consequences. The preamble to the Australian government response to the report of the independent review of theEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, otherwise known as the Hawke review, said:


… ecosystems deliver essential services worth between US$21 trillion and US$72 trillion a year, which is comparable with the 2008 World Gross National Income of US$58 trillion.


So around the world we can see that the economic value of maintaining and sustaining our natural environment is on par with the gross national income that is generated through economic development right throughout the world. In fact, it is a fool's gain to profit at the expense of a degraded environment.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Australia has experienced the largest documented decline in biodiversity of any continent over the last 200 years. Australia's rate of species decline is amongst the world's highest and is the highest amongst OECD countries. This is a matter I spoke about in June of this year when addressing a private member's motion that I raised in this place, criticising the conservative state governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria for allowing land clearing, cattle grazing, logging, prospecting and tourist activities in conservation areas where those activities presented a serious risk to the environment.


The Abbott government now seeks to reverse the World Heritage Listing of some 100,000 acres of Tasmania's Tarkine. As the shadow minister for the environment on our side—the member for Port Adelaide—quite properly alluded to, it has probably never occurred previously within this parliament that we have seen a reversal of the international listing of a World Heritage area.


The government is now going to defer some $650 million of Murray-Darling Basin water buybacks and is creating uncertainty about the additional 450 gigalitres of water that was to be returned to the system under the previous Labor government. I note that this decision will particularly affect the state of South Australia. I also note that, since the 7 September election, the Liberal members from South Australia have hardly said a word about this issue. Yet prior to the election and in the months leading up to the September federal election they were happy to wear the 'I love Murray' T-shirts in order to promote themselves as being champions of the cause of restoring water to the River Murray so that South Australia could receive its fair share of that water and so that the Lower Lakes in South Australia would not be left in the degraded state that they were in at the height of the drought a few years ago. So you take a particular stand before the election because you know that is what the people in South Australia expect from you, but, after the election, when you have been re-elected, you walk away from the commitments that you made leading up to the election—you backtrack on them, you start to withdraw the money that is required to create the water returns and you withdraw the money that is required to restore the additional 450 gigalitres which South Australians fought very hard for because it was so important and made so much difference to the final amount of water that flows into South Australia.


In fact, this agreement was reached after almost 100 years of bickering between all the states. It took the best part of six years of the Labor government's being in office to finally sign off on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I will give credit to the opposition—the plan was initiated under the national Water Act 2007, under the Howard government. It started then, and it took us six years to finally get an agreement. We finally did get an agreement, and then we saw the new government walking away from it. It is all about an environmental matter. It is all about ensuring that the environment is treated as importantly as every other aspect of this country.


I have concerns about this legislation because it seems to be going down the path of walking away from environmental responsibilities. Firstly, the minister is no longer required to take into consideration certain environmental advice when approving ports, mines and housing developments. That in itself is concerning, because if the minister is not required to take into consideration certain environmental advice then, effectively, he has no particular accountability to the environmental standards that we set. In other words, the environmental consideration can become irrelevant to the minister's decision. There is no accountability mechanism if the minister is not required to take into account certain environmental considerations. Secondly, I have concerns because the minister is likely to rely on environmental assessments carried out by the state governments, who, in my view, have already displayed very poor form in protecting our environment. Last week the Prime Minister, in answer to a question without notice in this place, said that since coming to office his government had, in the previous eight weeks, given environmental approval for projects worth $160 billion. I have no idea which projects the Prime Minister was referring to, but I hope that the environmental assessments required for the approval of those projects were thorough and that the minister did not ignore any of the environmental consequences of those approvals which might have been brought to his attention.


I certainly welcome decisions where we get on with projects that have the necessary approvals, but I hope that they are done in a way that is consistent with the environmental obligations of any government and that we have not simply fast-tracked on the basis that this legislation is going to get through and that the minister is no longer required to take into consideration certain environmental advice when granting those approvals. It would be of interest to know exactly who provided the assessments to the minister on those approvals worth $160 billion. Was it done through the Commonwealth, was it done through state governments or was it done through the proponents? Whose advice did he rely on?


I believe the minister knows that this legislation is a backward step in managing our environment. The way he has gone about bringing it into this House is interesting. He brought in legislation, which I suspect he very much expects to be criticised for by the environmental groups around Australia, and he has done so by simultaneously connecting it to a bit of environmental legislation that protects turtles and dugongs. He is trying to sweeten the legislation or dress it up in an environmentally positive way by adding the protection for dugongs and turtles. I totally support any legislative aspects that go to the protection of dugongs and turtles. There is no question about that at all. However, if the minister were serious about the protection of dugongs and turtles, he could equally have come into this place with separate legislation focusing on and dealing with those two matters only.


Secondly, if he was serious about protecting the dugongs and turtles he would provide more resources to those very authorities and community bodies that currently exist to enable them to enforce greater compliance with the laws, because the problem with the dugongs and turtles is not that we do not have laws in place but that they are not being in any way policed by anyone. So simply increasing the penalties, as he has done, without providing the additional resources to monitor the laws becomes meaningless. I note that, in drawing up the additional legislation, the minister at no time consulted with the traditional owners: with the land and sea councils or with the Indigenous groups of the area who know best how to protect dugongs and turtles.


Putting $2 million into the Australian Crime Commission, as the minister has done, to investigate the illegal killing of turtles and dugongs is not the answer. A better answer would be to put that kind of money into supporting the local groups. One of the lessons that we learned through the Senate Standing Committees on Environment and Communications, of which I have been a member for the last six years, was that if you want to best manage local environmental assets you do so by empowering the local community groups that have the expertise, the knowledge and the commitment to manage the very things that you want looked after. They are the people who are on the ground, they know what works best and they are the people that care the most. Yet that is not what this government seems to be doing.


Our environment around Australia and around the world is increasingly under threat from climate change—a matter I have spoken about on other occasions—from mining, from farming, from residential and commercial growth, from fishing, from construction and even from tourism. Wherever human activity occurs, the environment is always under threat. That is not to say that we cannot work compatibly with it; we can. But we need standards, and we need to ensure that those standards are complied with and met. We are working with the state governments to try to streamline the processes that are required to ensure that those proper environmental standards are achieved. I welcome the fact that we are working with the states, and I welcome the opportunity to try to streamline the processes and make them more efficient. What I do not want to see is streamlining coming into effect at the expense of good policy and at the expense of the environment.


A couple of years ago the Labor government commissioned a review of the EPBC Act. It was referred to as the Hawke review. Of the 71 recommendations put up by the Hawke review, none included the legislation that we are debating today. The most thorough review of that legislation did not incorporate the changes to the legislation that the minister is now proposing. For those reasons, I support the amendments moved by the opposition.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (12:48):  The member for Makin talked about the environment being under threat. Let me educate the member for Makin about who is in fact under threat in my state, in my electorate. It is the worker, the investor and the general community on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I would ask the member for Makin, the member for Wills and the member for Port Adelaide: how many mines are being developed in your electorates? How is the unemployment rate going in your electorates? How is investor confidence going in your electorates?


The reality is that the members opposite, having now moved the amendment—which, I understand, they have foreshadowed—just do not get it. Is nigh on 50 per cent of their state locked up? No, it is not. We are sick and tired in our state, and certainly in my electorate of Braddon, of being treated as some social, political and environmental experiment. The reality here is that we need this amendment to ensure that, in future, confidence can be gained by those people who go through the approval process and who do everything that they need to do.


I will not be spending any time speaking on the first part of the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. As you would expect, I want to use my time to focus on the second part. This bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act to ensure that if the Minister for the Environment does not have regard to and relevant approved advice, it will not invalidate a decision under the act. That section of the bill is of particular interest, as I said, to many constituents, to small and medium-sized businesses and to mining operations in my electorate of Braddon. The questions here are: do we want to continue to stand in the way of development or not? Do we want to continue to add to the list of endangered species by adding that of the worker? I do not think so. I would hope that members opposite would also agree that that is not what we want.


It was only last week in this chamber that I delivered my maiden speech. As anyone who has done it over the last few weeks and those yet to come will know, it is a very special moment in an elected member's time. What they speak about often indicates the priorities of the particular member. In my maiden speech I made the point very strongly that mining companies need certainty in the application process, and this amendment is certainly timely for me to speak about. I said I have a vision of a mining industry that is not only finally confident in the processes of approval that they undertake but also confident that the process optimises environmental outcomes while being efficient, fair, reasonable, dependable and free of opportunistic political intervention. I went on to say that Australian mines of the 21st century know well their environmental responsibilities. It is high time we got off their backs and let them once again stimulate our economy; the members opposite want to get back on their back. They have not got off. They will stay on the back of development in Tasmania. As I said last week, enough is enough.


If you were to believe what has been coming from that side over the last hour, you would think that there is some sort of deep, evil conspiracy that somehow or other attaches to this amendment. But I can say that this amendment is about finally shining some sunlight on the inconsistencies and vagaries of this act and the way in which it opens loopholes for groups such as the Save the Tarkine coalition in my electorate. I believe that this amendment is in fact the first step towards achieving many of the goals that we have set in re-opening Tasmania for business.


The conservation advice amendment is a technical amendment that addresses a risk so that past or future decisions made under the EPBC Act will not be invalidated if the minister does not meet the requirement to have regard to any relevant approved conservation advice. We need to understand what this means. It means that—after the process has been gone through and everything has been considered that could be considered—if suddenly something pops up from somewhere, it does not open the door to it's being something the minister did not give consideration to. The amendment that we see before us is vital for Braddon, for my state and for other parts of the country, as it is currently the case that the EPBC Act decisions could be challenged and overturned if a court rules that a minister has not given due consideration to relevant conservation advice, which potentially exposes a series of past project approvals to possible legal challenge.


I believe it is important to note here that this amendment does not reduce or alter the level of protection for the environment. It just does not. The conservation advice amendment does not reduce the level of protection provided for threatened species and ecological communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The amendment is technical and designed to ensure the validity of decisions made under the act.


If the members opposite want to continue to stand in the way of development in the electorate of Braddon and in Tasmania and across the country, be that on their heads. They just do not get it. The former members who were in this place obviously did not represent sufficiently the interests of my state and my electorate, because, if they had, the previous parliament, the 43rd Parliament, would have dealt with this and would have given the confidence that is required. The perfect example of this obviously goes to the matter that has already been raised, and that is the issue of Shree Minerals, who, in July of the year just gone, had their application for an iron ore mine overturned by the courts following a challenge by the Save the Tarkine organisation.


I will digress just for a moment to say that—and this is breaking news, I suspect—they are up to it again. The Venture Minerals proposal has been going along reasonably swimmingly as another great job-creating investment in my electorate, but the Save the Tarkine coalition are up to it again. They have been back to the High Court with a further intervention in that process. With only a week to go for the case to be heard, it obviously has not given enough time for that matter to be considered properly without damaging the prospects of the court case. And now what have we got? We are coming into Christmas. How beautiful is their timing! They are a bunch of geniuses! We will not get this matter heard until, probably, February, and, as is too often the case, more than likely jobs will be at risk over the next two months through the Christmas-New Year period. What a disgrace! They are up to it again: working with lawyers who just want to attack development in Tasmania and who continue to use my state and my electorate as some sort of political experiment, working pro bono to make a name for themselves—a group that sits around a kitchen table for its committee meetings, or perhaps meets in a phone box, because that is how many of them there are! But they are up to it again.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr WHITELEY:
  You can laugh, but you should know better. My state is in deep trouble.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr WHITELEY:
  You should know better too, and you should know and understand what this is all about. 


Shree Minerals have since had their application approved—thank goodness—and I can say here today that their Nelson Bay mine, located about 70 kilometres south-west of Smithton, has increased production at the mine and is now on the verge of having its first shipment of iron ore out of the Burnie port. It is about jobs, to me. That is why I am here; that is why I got elected. We are about development—acceptable and approved through the processes—and this amendment now goes to protecting these applications in the future from any past or future disputes.


What is going on at Shree Minerals in my electorate is momentous not only for that company but also for that community—a community that has been in a very awkward spiral of job losses over the last few years. It is telling that, on the day that Shree Minerals finally began work on the mine and so bringing employment to a hurting community, this group, which could meet in a phone box, said—when jobs have been made available to people in my electorate and they wander into their workplace with pride in anticipation of a pay cheque to feed their family—'It is a shameful day.' But I will tell you what is a shameful day. It is when such a minority group can have such a negative impact on a community. That is what they are up to. They are economic vandals. There is no doubt about that. They never accept the reality. They will never accept the umpire's decision. They do not care if jobs are lost; they want to keep their name in the press. They ought to go somewhere else. Maybe they should go to the electorates of you over there—the ones who are not supporting this amendment today. Maybe then you would get a taste of what it is like to have people continually trying to lock up even more of your state. We have nearly 50 per cent—just get that: 50 per cent—of my state locked up so that you cannot do any development, and they want more. They will never be satisfied with what they get. In the very area that they protest in, over the last 150 years, hundreds of mines have been mined in my electorate, and thousands upon thousands of jobs and thousands upon thousands of families' lifestyles have been sustained through that activity.


This just cannot go on. So I welcome this amendment and I cannot believe that members opposite will stand in the way of this amendment. In the months leading up to the campaign, they all of a sudden found their conscience and, together with the Deputy Premier in Tasmania, Mr Green, put their hands up to say: 'We are pro mining. We will do what we have to do. They are a bunch of nerds,' and other words you would not want to say in this parliament, to distance themselves from these people. No, you are not. Your words are hollow. You are not distancing yourself from the Greens, the minority groups or from the Save the Tarkine coalition. You are back in bed with them today through trying to knock back this amendment and put forward your own amendments to withhold schedule 1. So do not dare tell people in my electorate and in my state that you are on their team. You are anything but on their team. You are with the enemy on this. You need to support this amendment.


Mining is so important an industry in Tasmania and in my electorate and it has to be a part of the economic recovery. The mining industry's current value-added contribution to Tasmania is about $1.3 billion, or approaching six per cent of the state's GDP. This is not to be frowned at. This is a huge part of what the economy of Tasmania is about. I cannot stand here in this place today and not urge members opposite to have some sense of justice for the people of Tasmania. Do not try to play these political games. I can see what you are up to. It is absolutely transparent. You just want to be stoppers and hinderers. The people of my electorate of Braddon and the people of Tasmania have had enough. Do not dare put up your hand in my electorate and say you are on the team of the developer, of the miner, of the worker or of the families when you sneak up here into Canberra—hardly with a member of the Labor Party now represented in this place, other than the member for Franklin—a week or two out from Christmas and stand in the way of getting legislation through this House that will ensure what happened to Shree Minerals will not happen to someone else.


To suggest for one moment that the environment in this country or in my state is under threat could be nothing further from the truth. This country has a proud environmental record. Have we made mistakes? Are there things we wish we had not done back then? Of course there are. But obviously the intelligence and the research was not available back then. It is now our job to get research and intelligence and accumulate it, and we do. Every assessment and proposal has to jump through hoop after hoop. And even when you get to the end of the hoops and it has been approved, unless we change this legislation it will always be possible for someone, some group, meeting in a phone box somewhere to decide it is time to put another spanner in the works, to chuck another wobbly, and try to stop development in my state. That time should be over. I plead with members opposite to reconsider their position and support this legislation as it stands and as is required to give certainty in my electorate of Braddon.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:02):  The former speaker started strongly for two or three minutes, where he quoted himself, but as soon as he got into other territory he really started to flounder. The Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 on one level is about protecting turtles and dugongs, which everyone supports. But on another level it is a stalking horse. It is about protecting the ability of the Minister for the Environment to effectively ignore recommendations about developments. It removes the legal requirement for the minister to consider threatened and endangered species, but it does increase penalties for illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs.


As a Queenslander—I married someone from Cairns and all of my in-laws are up in North Queensland—I understand the importance of the Great Barrier Reef and of turtles and dugongs, which come all the way down to Brisbane. All six species of marine turtles are listed under the EPBC Act as threatened: the loggerhead, the leatherback and the olive ridleys are actually endangered, and the green, hawksbill and flatback are vulnerable. So, obviously, we should do all we can to make sure they are protected. The same applies to dugongs, for which there are all sorts of problems, because they are migratory. Also, there are lots of threats to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where dugongs do a lot of their breeding. Some of the populations have not recovered from Cyclone Yasi—in terms of the flow-off—and there are all sorts of challenges. I commend the Minister for the Environment for that part of the legislation.


But, as I said, this is not about turtles and dugongs. This is actually about a stalking horse. Why would an environment minister still continue to draw pay if they propose that the decision maker will not have regard to approved conservation advices when they make a decision? Why would an environment minister abrogate their right to run their ruler over the environmental advice provided to them? Unless the Minister for the Environment comes in here and says, 'I should have my pay cut in half,' then he has no credibility at all when it comes to this.


Let us be realistic. The mining industry of 2013 is a completely different industry to the mining industry of 100 years ago that created moonscapes in parts of Tasmania. Those days are long gone. Mining industries now get big ticks for making sure they protect the environment. The rehabilitation they carry out is world class. We are world leaders when it comes to rehabilitation. I say this after having worked as an adviser to the Queensland Resources Council. I know the peak body in Queensland quite well and I know the great work that has been done when it comes to rehabilitation. I do not know mines in Tasmania, but I do know mines in Queensland. I know Queensland has a lot of things going for it that are not dissimilar to Tasmania in that we have a brand that says we are clean, green and a great tourism destination. We also have some of the best resources in the world.


How do we balance those? I can tell you, Member for Braddon, what we do not do. We do not throw out the rule book when it comes to the environment, because that effectively is what we are doing here. This stalking horse that those opposite are carping about is all about saying that the environment minister does not have to have regard to the conservation advice provided to them.




Mr Whiteley:
  It is not a stalking horse.




Mr PERRETT:
  That is exactly what this legislation is about. If those opposite had the foresight to look through this legislation they would see that that is what they are advocating. The Labor Party is the party of jobs, jobs for everybody and jobs that are sustainable, not short-term jobs. Let us be realistic about this. We have seen a few things take place. For a start, the environment minister has said to every state: 'You make decisions about the environment. We trust you.' That will lead to a potted patchwork approach to decision making.




Mr Whiteley:
  That is not what he said.




Mr PERRETT:
  The legislation has already been agreed at COAG. The environment ministers in the states will now make decisions about projects. And we have seen it in Queensland and I am particularly worried about the Queensland government. Before the election—back in March last year—they hardly said anything about the environment; in fact, they even put out a letter to the environment groups saying: 'You can trust us. We will do the right thing by you.' Then after the election—and I mean the morning after the election—the first statement made by the Deputy Premier elect, Jeff Seeney, was not a visionary statement about what Queensland will look like in 30 years time. No, the first thing that he said was, 'The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is too big.' That is what a Queensland Deputy Premier said the morning after the election. There was no mention of that before the election, but that was the first thing that he said afterwards. I am a big believer in people carrying out after the election what they promise before an election.


The reality is that the Premier of Queensland, in an environment in which income is constrained, is likely to be blind when it comes to mining approvals. If they are going to effectively be told, 'You don't have to pay attention to the approved conservation advice,' that is going to completely tip the balance between sustainable mining and a sustainable environment. That is going to tilt it too far in favour of mining companies.


As I said, the Labor Party has a strong presence in the mining industries. We take notice of the jobs in the mining industry. But it must be a balanced and sustainable industry. We need to remember—and anyone from Tasmania would know this—what happens when you have unchecked mining and when mining companies do not have an obligation to consider the environment before they put a shovel in the ground. That can be a recipe for disaster.


These amendments are important. They need to be seen in the context of the planet overall, because that is fundamentally what those opposite do not get. Obviously, the prism through which we should consider things is our approaches to putting a price on carbon. We understand that it is a cost to people and that it means that they have to readjust. We understand that it involves them putting their hand in their wallets or changing their lifestyles. Why do we ask them to do this, something that is tough to retail to people at the polling booth? The reason that we do it is because we care about the future. Unless we have the capacity to look our children in the eye and say, 'I am more important than you'—and that is something that I cannot do to my four-year old and my eight-year old—we need to get this right. The people sitting on green seats now need to get it right; the people sitting on red seats over in that other place need to get it right. History will judge us harshly for how we approach the future of the globe.


Australians put their trust in the Abbott government to do what is best for our nation. Obviously, I did not agree with their policies. But they continue to make misleading and destructive statements and now some of those opposite have gotten into groupthink so much that they have started to convince themselves that it is the actual truth. The carbon price legislation is a classic example.


In my home state of Queensland, environmental protection and the conservation of biodiversity is exceptionally important. We are a very diverse state. We have deserts, rainforests and mulga; we even have Antarctic beach. We have the biggest sand island in the world, Fraser Island. Ironically, that became protected through the actions of Campbell Newman's dad when he was environment minister under Malcolm Fraser. Queensland is incredibly diverse, but we also have these incredible resources that can create the jobs and the exports that will keep people employed for the next 30, 50, 100 or 200 years. We want to see our economy grow and prosper but we cannot do so by sacrificing our environment. That way madness lies. If you look at China, you can see what happens if you have unchecked development with people not considering the environment. That can create riots and health problems and the like.


Queensland had a tourism campaign with the slogan, 'Beautiful one day, perfect the next.' That is something that we need to consider. Yet in the last couple of weeks I have seen the Queensland government talk about mining and exporting uranium. I even heard the processing of uranium floated the other day. There was no mention of it during the election. In fact, when I raised this during my election campaign in September there was a strong response from my opponent saying, 'No, that's a fear campaign; there is nothing like that being considered.'


The reality is that we need to look at uranium and nuclear power stations not just through the prism of Fukushima and how things can go wrong or Kakadu, where we saw some problems over the weekend. We need to consider what it would mean to that brand of, 'Beautiful one day, perfect the next,' if you have barrels of yellowcake going through the Great Barrier Reef or, if they decide not to go through the Great Barrier Reef, up through the Northern Territory to the accredited port or down to South Australia. If they go through South Australia, that would mean that they would be trucking it through my home town of St George. I know the current member for New England has deserted St George, but I would love to have that conversation in the pubs in St George: 'We've got some yellowcake coming through here and going down those country roads.' I believe you have to get the balance right. Surely listening to the conservation advice provided to a mining company is a logical pre-step to any big mining operation.


I campaigned about marine parks at the end of the 43rd parliament, when we had votes on the marine parks that Labor had created—a system of marine parks that are the envy of the world; a system of marine parks such that we see people come to Australia to learn what we have done. But, sadly, those opposite in the 43rd parliament voted against that—we only won the continuation by one vote. I am sure the member for Melbourne would remember that one vote with which we won. In fact, we even saw the member for Wentworth vote against the park that he had created when he was the environment minister! That was the political power play that we saw in the 43rd parliament.


The reality is this bill is nobbling an environment minister's ability to make decisions about mining projects. As I said, all power to his arm when it comes to protecting turtles and dugongs—although I think there could have been greater consultation with Indigenous groups around Queensland, and that that clearly illustrates why this is a stalking horse rather than a fair dinkum approach to looking after those species.


UNESCO's World Heritage committee has had a look at our reef and assessed it as being in danger—already under threat. We have mining projects set to come online in Queensland over the next few years. There are pressures coming from the miners in terms of the suggestion that they put sludge out into the reef. I have been going to North Queensland for about 25 years. When you see the changes you can see that there are challenges for the reef, challenges for the tourism industry and the nearly 60,000 jobs that hang off the biggest living organism in the world. We need to get the balance right. Those opposite are not doing that.


There was a time, when it came to the environment, when Australia was a world leader. We saw that with our marine park proposal under former Minister Burke in the Labor government. We have a history of punching above our weight as a middle power. This step is a retrograde step. This step takes us back to the bad old days that I remember, with Joh Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland, where the white shoes were out from under the desk wandering around dictating how things were done.


Ironically, mining companies have moved on. They have world's best practice and they should be recognised for such. If the project is so dodgy that it cannot even get an approved conservation advice then perhaps we should not be doing it. We need to be sensible when it comes to the environment and jobs.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (13:18):  The Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 pulls in two different directions. On the one hand it is taking away part of the legal requirement that applies to environmental approvals processes involving the Commonwealth minister, and on the other it is putting in place what are said to be greater protections for some particular species. I have to say that it is consistent with what we have seen from a range of coalition state governments that have been elected in Australia in recent years. We are seeing here, in this first piece of environmental legislation from the new coalition government at the federal level, a taking away of protections of the environment.


The Minister for the Environment can seek to dress up what is occurring in this bill however he likes—and sought to do so, in fact, in his second reading speech—but what is actually occurring is the taking away of legal protection that is presently there for the environment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. That legal protection requires the Commonwealth minister, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, to take into account conservation advice. The minister would have it that that conservation advice is still going to be taken into account but then says that what this act does is makes sure that no decision taken by the minister that fails to take into account that conservation advice will be invalid. In the next breath he would have this parliament and the people of Australia believe that that is not a lessening of environmental control.


Anybody at all, whether or not they have any legal expertise, can immediately see that if you take away the right to go to a court and have a decision by a Commonwealth minister declared invalid then the force of a legal requirement on a Commonwealth minister to take into account conservation advice is a great deal less than if the capacity exists to go to a court or tribunal and point correctly to the fact that a minister has not taken conservation advice into account properly and for that decision to be declared invalid.


I am not sure what the minister thinks is going to be the force of this particular part of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act if this bill passes the House and passes the Senate, but it is pretty clear to us that it will greatly lessen the force of the environmental approvals process as it presently stands. Make no mistake: this bill lessens the force of Commonwealth environmental law. It weakens Commonwealth environmental law. And, as I said at the outset, it is consistent, regrettably, with what we have come to see so often from the conservative parties when they get to power either at the state or the Commonwealth level. At the state level, in my home state of Victoria we saw as almost the first act of the newly elected Baillieu government the reintroduction of cattle to the alpine regions of Victoria against all the known science and all the known research, fulfilling a promise that had been made to their supporters in the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. And they persisted for some months with the pretence that there was some actual scientific basis for this proposed returning of cattle to the high country. It needed the then minister for the environment, Tony Burke, to step in before that short-lived attempt to put back the clock, in an environmental sense, was stopped in Victoria.


It is important to keep the context of the cattle in the high country in mind. There have been no cattle in the high country on the New South Wales side of the Victoria-New South Wales border since the mid-1960s. But, regrettably, cattle continued to persist in the alpine regions of Victoria right into the early 2000s, when the then Labor government was able to bring that particular activity to an end. It is of course an activity that has no environmental basis. It has been very clearly established for many years that there is tremendous environmental harm, in fact, flowing from grazing cattle in the high country. Tony Burke said at the time, somewhat memorably, that to put cattle into the Alpine National Park was to make a national park into a farm—which of course it is not. But it is emblematic of the attitudes the conservative parties take to environmental protection. They would far prefer to pander to commercial interests, to ignore the science and to ignore environmental advice than to properly protect the environment.


Regrettably, we are seeing again in Victoria in recent weeks talk by the Napthine government about putting cattle into the high country—again, on the pretence of some kind of trial, when, as I said, all the known science has been completely clear now for many years. I fear, given the other kinds of measures that this environment minister and this new federal government have been discussing in terms of preparation to hand back environmental assessment and approval powers to states, that this small piece of legislation is just the precursor to what will be a wholesale attack on environmental regulation and environmental protection in this country. You would have to say that nothing about any of the actions of this new government in relation to environmental matters—in its still less than 100 days of government since the election—gives the people of Australia the slightest confidence that this government is to be trusted on environmental matters. Certainly they are not a government that can in any way be trusted to keep their promises. They are not a government that can in any way be trusted to be the government they said they were going to be before the election. And they are certainly not a government that can be trusted to govern with anything like orderliness or deliberation. Rather, we see, staggering from day to day, decisions made on the run. And of course that is the antithesis of the kind of regulation and governmental activity that you need in the environmental area, where, as has often been said, developers—people wanting to take commercial advantage and people wanting to exploit natural resources—need to win only once, because then the development is underway and the project is up and running.


People seeking to protect the environment—and governments, when they seek to protect the environment—need to win every time in order to ensure that the environment is protected. Sometimes that will mean some considered deliberation. It will mean taking your time, looking at the science, taking into account conservation advice, which is the basis of this bill, and taking the time to make sure that the conservation advice has been considered properly. Sometimes it will mean taking the time to ensure that the environmental effects have been properly considered before rushing to make a decision. What this bill does is take away the consequence that would flow if the conservation advice were not properly taken account of.


Somewhat extraordinarily, in the second reading speech the minister actually referred to a recent Federal Court decision—Tarkine National Coalition Incorporated v Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, which was earlier this year. The Federal Court found that an approval in relation to the Tarkine Forest was invalid because the then minister had not had proper regard to relevant approved conservation advice. The response of this government, far from being to ensure that, in future, proper regard is given to all conservation advice, and far from being to beef up the processes that apply to the obtaining and consideration of conservation advice, has been to rip up the rule book, to take away the legal consequence that has attached up until now—and that should continue to attach—to failing to take into account conservation advice in this way.


It is, as I said earlier, a weakening of environmental laws, just when this government is proposing to hand over to the states a large part of environmental assessment and approval powers. I have given only the single example of cattle in the high country in relation to the conduct of this present state Liberal government, but one could cite a whole range of other examples. The Newman government, since coming to office not all that long ago, has in almost all its decisions sought to put development ahead of the environment. The Newman government certainly cannot be trusted to protect our national heritage, in particular—and the member for Moreton, who spoke before me and who is a Queenslander, spoke eloquently about this—the threat posed to the Great Barrier Reef by the actions of the Newman government. Australia is a signatory to a whole range of environmental treaties. They include the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat, Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. All of these conventions, and Australia's adherence to them, are potentially called into question by the legislative change to the approvals processes which is proposed by this bill. It is regrettable that, as almost its first piece of environmental legislation—because one can hardly count the so-called repeal of the carbon tax set of legislation as environmental legislation—this government has sought to bring forward a decision which takes away the force of the existing provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.


I hasten to say that in this bill the government is also bringing forward provisions that protect turtles and dugongs. For many years it has been very well known that marine turtles and dugongs are impacted by a range of enduring threats, including habitat loss, poor water quality, being part of so-called bycatch, poaching, marine debris and boat strike. In government, as a matter of resourcing, as a matter of departmental organisation and as a matter of particular programs, Labor made addressing these issues effectively a very high priority. All of the work that was put in train by the Labor government continues in close association with state and territory governments, with traditional owners in the north of Australia and with other groups with an interest such as commercial fishers.


This law is one which we support because it is a continuation, with some additional protections, of a range of programs that we put in place while in government. In particular, it is worth noting that the former Labor government invested some $7 million in Indigenous self-management, because that is the very best way to ensure that the sustainable and appropriate management of dugongs and turtles continues. Critically, the approach that we took in government included leadership and advice on the take of marine turtles and dugongs, developing community based sea country management plans and the support of traditional owner involvement in the sustainable use of marine resources and in compliance training.


We have also supported Indigenous ranger teams to remove ghost nets. These are lost or abandoned nets which impact on turtle and dugong populations. As with all of our environmental work while in government, our approach was based on our respect for the customs and traditions of Indigenous Australians and their right, as traditional owners under the Native Title Act, to hunt native species for personal, domestic, non-commercial or communal needs. So we do support a balanced approach. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-09,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:33):  This is an astounding bill. It says that, if you are the Minister for the Environment and someone gives you some advice that something needs to happen to protect a threatened species, you are allowed to ignore them. If a mining company comes in and says, perhaps, 'We want to develop here, right in the middle of a national park,' and someone says, 'You can't do that in that way, because that might affect a threatened species,' this bill says that the minister can completely ignore that advice and side with the mining company. It also means that if you go to court to challenge it by saying that, 'No, look, hang on, there is expert advice that the Tasmanian devil—'or perhaps a species up on the Great Barrier Reef—'is going to be threatened by this and potentially made extinct and wiped off the face of this earth,' there is nothing the court can do about it because the minister is able to hide behind their decision and say, 'No, we've changed the law to say that we can ignore the best conservation advice available in this country.'


That is an astounding proposition to come from someone who says he is the Minister for the Environment. If you were the Minister for the Environment, presumably you would craft laws in this country that gave the environment the maximum possible protection. Instead, these laws are being rewritten by, essentially, mining companies—and that is, ultimately, what this bill is. A couple of weeks before Christmas, this is a nicely wrapped up gift to some of Australia's and the world's biggest companies, at the expense of the environment and at the expense of species that are threatened. It is this parliament's job to stand up for species and the environment that otherwise would not have a voice. Unless we put into law proper protections for the species that we share this planet with, we are going to see a 'let it rip' mentality. Chop it down, dig it up, ship it off—that is the limit of the government's vision for the country.


Our environment laws at the moment are not actually that strong and are nowhere near as strong as they should be. It is astounding that, in the first few sitting weeks of parliament, before the end of the year, the first thing that the government wants to do is weaken them even further so that the minister for the environment does not even have to listen to advice about what it would take to protect threatened species. It is a very cynical attempt to overcome a decision that has been referred to before in the debate, where the previous minister for the environment gave the go-ahead to a mine in a forest in Tasmania without having any regard to advice that said, 'This will impact on the Tasmanian devils in a way that potentially would breach your obligations,' and was found by the court to have not followed the act. This law is now attempting not to strengthen our processes to make sure we are never found in breach of those obligations again but to change the law so that such court cases never happen again—so that, if you ignore a piece of advice about conservation, there is nothing anyone can do about it.


It is very clear why this is happening. We heard why from a couple of speakers before. It is because the country is now open for business, apparently. That does not just include our cities and our rural areas; it includes our parks, too. It seems our parks are now open for business. This is a piece of legislation that the government wants to get through by the end of the year so that it does not even have to listen to advice about how we can protect some of our threatened species in the future. We have seen, in my state of Victoria, what that means in practice. It means, for example, cattle being allowed to graze in Alpine National Park areas—in defiance of the science and in defiance of common sense—so that we can turn the park into a paddock, so that cows can have a free feed. It does not matter what happens to threatened species or the environment!


There is a second part to the bill, which is to increase penalties for those who harm or kill turtles or dugongs. That is something that many people from across the political spectrum, including in this chamber, have been raising as an issue for some time. But, again, the cynicism of this government knows no bounds. At the same time as they modestly increase penalties in this law, they are enthusiastically rolling out the red carpet for the big coal and gas port developments on the reef's coast, developments that pose huge risks to the Great Barrier Reef's dugong and turtle populations. Dredging and dumping of dredge spoil offshore destroys the sea grass where the turtles and dugongs live and feed.


The true test of this minister's commitment to the dugong and turtle populations in the Great Barrier Reef falls due on Friday the 13th. That is when the minister will decide whether or not to approve the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. If he approves it, that will facilitate Abbot Point becoming the biggest coal port in the Southern Hemisphere, facilitating the export of vast amounts of climate-destroying Galilee coal from Queensland. It also involves—which is relevant to this debate—dredging and dumping three million cubic metres of dredge spoil offshore in the reef's waters. That is going to contribute to destroying turtle and dugong habitats. We will see how much the minister really cares about the dugongs and turtles when it comes to the Abbot Point development.


In the few minutes I have left I will foreshadow some amendments that we will be moving in the detail stage. Firstly, we will move to strike out schedule 1 of the bill, because this schedule as it is currently drafted will allow the government to just ignore science and just ignore advice from experts in this country about how to protect the environment. That is anathema to good governance—having no requirement that, in the environment protection legislation of this country, you have to even listen to advice about how to protect the environment. That is anathema to good governance and it must go.


The second amendment that we will move does something fairly straightforward. It will strengthen our national environment laws to ensure that all major decisions about projects that will significantly harm Australia's most precious places and wildlife must be made by our national environment minister. This is crucial. We have seen state governments in operation. We have seen their willingness to trash the environment for the sake of a dollar. For that reason, over time we have developed national environmental protection laws. Those laws which allow the national government to step in and override state governments have meant that, for example, we have not seen dams built in Tasmania—as I am sure many people here know.


What is on the cards with this government—and it was flagged under the previous government—and what this amendment will stop is the federal government saying to the state governments: 'Look, you decide. We will hand over to you, essentially, the responsibility for making a decision about whether or not national environment laws are complied with.' We have seen this government act at the behest of some of the country's and the world's biggest mining and resource companies, and sign MOUs with the New South Wales and Queensland governments to kick-start the process, to essentially hand to Premiers Newman and O'Farrell the federal environment minister's powers. It is rumoured that, at the upcoming COAG meeting, we are going to see more of that. If this proceeds, the federal government will have no power to step in and stop, or even place conditions on, developments that are likely to have a significant impact on some of our most precious national icons. It would mean the federal government could protect neither World Heritage areas from big mines nor threatened species from being sent to extinction by state governments, who would approve—and we have seen them do this—major developments in key habitat. 


As I said, if this procedure had been in place in the past, we could not have stopped the Franklin from being dammed. If it were in place, we would not be able to stop oil rigs in the Great Barrier Reef. We need to stop the Abbott government from creating essentially a one-stop shop for business to sell out our environment. This would be a major step backwards. It would overturn 30 years of gradually increased, and greatly needed, Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection. I do not want to see Premier Napthine in sole control of whether or not to put cows in the Alpine National Park or Campbell Newman in sole control of the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef. That is what is likely to happen unless the amendments that we are going to move are passed. Likewise, unless this House supports the amendments that the Greens are going to move, we will have Barry O'Farrell in sole control or whether or not to send koalas there to extinction. I am pleased to hear the noises from the Labor Party that, although they initially floated this idea, they now understand what it would mean. They understand that the Hawke legacy is fundamentally under threat from this government and, unless we support—

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt) (11:54):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill today. There are two key elements of this bill, and I will only briefly mention the first. I disagree with the previous speaker in that it seeks to make a technical amendment to the EPBC Act to ensure that past decisions cannot be exposed to legal challenges. I was pleased to hear that despite media reports to the contrary the amendment does not reduce the level of protection provided for threatened species and ecological communities under the act. Australia has incredibly diverse native species, many of which are under threat as a result of human activities, and relevant conservation advice must always be considered.


I intend to focus on the second key element, and part of that is the increasing of penalties under the EPBC Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act for killing and injuring turtles and dugongs. On 15 August I was proud to stand next to the then shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, Greg Hunt, and local conservation legend Jennie Gilbert of the Cairns Turtle Rehabilitation Centre when we launched our $5 million plan to provide greater protection for dugongs and turtles along the Great Barrier Reef. It came as a result of ongoing community concern about illegal poaching and the need for greater care for our dugong and turtle population. The plan included a commitment to treble the financial penalties for poaching and illegal trafficking of turtle and dugong meat, and these are certainly significant increases. Under the EPBC Act 1999 the maximum fine will increase from $170,000 to $510,000 for the offences of killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving a dugong or a turtle in a Commonwealth area. Where these penalties relate to strict liability offences—for example, used to deter potential offenders rather than to impose punishment—the maximum financial penalty will increase from $85,000 to $255,000. Maximum financial penalties for injuring or taking turtles or dugongs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 will increase from $340,000 for aggravated criminal offences to $1,020,000 and for strict liability offences from $10,200 to $30,600. These increases will be a significant deterrent to those individuals who are doing the wrong thing. We certainly must get the message out that we will be imposing criminal convictions and larger fines. This is not mere rhetoric. These animals are too important for that.


Getting back to our $5 million plan, in addition to the focus on the threats of poaching and illegal hunting, it also has other key elements, including    $2 million for specialised Indigenous Ranger Programs for marine conservation along the Far North Queensland Coast and into the Torres Strait and for strengthened enforcement and compliance. This will be done through supporting additional officers on the water and on land to crack down on dugong and turtle poaching and the illegal trade in dugong and turtle meat. We will certainly be working with the Queensland government on the potential for extending the authority of select Indigenous rangers to take action to stop illegal poaching. This is a very important element of this, because while we do have ranger programs in place, in many cases they have absolutely no authority whatsoever. For example, I have known of a ranger standing on a beach with a large number of turtles that had been turned on their backs while they were being butchered, and he did not even have the authority to ask the names of those involved. We need to change that. That badge cannot just be a mickey mouse badge; it actually has to mean something. The rangers have to have the authority to take evidence, to take names, to confiscate equipment that is used in relation to these types of activities and to provide that evidence in a court of law that will see those individuals prosecuted for these illegal activities.


We have an added challenge up there that also needs to be addressed, and this is in the shared zone between Australia and Papua New Guinea, where we need to be working in collaboration with the villages, particularly those in the Western Province area of Papua New Guinea, so that we can work together, because it is as critically important for those villages as it is for the Torres Strait that these turtle and dugong populations are preserved. We are also looking at places like Raine Island, where the turtle breeding area is seriously under threat. It is collaborative work that could be done by the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre, which is headed by Sheriden Morris in Cairns. She has a wonderful relationship with the villagers in Papua New Guinea and also works well with the Torres Strait community. She would be a great way of bringing both of these together. This would make sure that we are able to get the necessary enforcement and education to make it happen. But it is not going to work unless the Indigenous rangers themselves have the authority to identify and challenge any activities.


The $2 million for the Australian Crime and Misconduct Commission to investigate the practice of illegal killing, poaching and transportation of turtle and dugong meat is another very important initiative. I know that the other side have accused us of being high-handed, but, as they rightfully said, there has never been a prosecution in this area. There is a good reason for that: there are just too many jurisdictions involved, and nobody wants to take responsibility. You have Queensland Fisheries, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Queensland Police and the Federal Police. It just goes around from one to the other. It is little wonder that these activities continue without being punished, because no jurisdiction takes full responsibility for them. By putting them through to the crime commission, at least you have a chance of starting to get some prosecutions.


The $700,000 towards cleaning up marine debris along the Far North Queensland coast, the Torres Strait Islands and the Coral Sea is a very important initiative, particularly in relation to ghost nets, which pose a huge risk for turtles and dugongs as well as other marine species. There are a couple of great organisations that deal with this. Heidi Taylor is the co-founder and director of the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, which carries out a program of beach clean-ups all along the Far North Queensland coast, as do the Mapoon Land and Sea Rangers, who do great work collecting ghost nets on Western Cape York. During a beach clean-up at Mapoon in July, members of the Mapoon Land and Sea Rangers, a team from Conservation Volunteers Australia, and volunteers from GhostNets Australia and Tangaroa Blue covered 11 kilometres of beach and removed just under 3,700 kilograms of debris, including 7,154 rubber thongs, 877 cigarette lighters and 2,663 gill net floats. So you can see the extent of the problem, and that is on just 11 kilometres of beach. It is a critical initiative.


There has also been $300,000 set aside to support the Cairns and Fitzroy Island turtle rehabilitation centres. This will certainly help with capital works and help the hospital achieve a permanent and sustainable future. The Cairns and Fitzroy Island rehabilitation centres do some fantastic work with a large group of volunteers. Doug Gamble, who is the owner of the Fitzroy Island Resort, generously donated the land for the Fitzroy Island centre earlier this year, and Jennie Gilbert, who I mentioned earlier, works tirelessly on behalf of these creatures. The funding will be well-utilised in rehabilitating turtles and returning them to the sea.


There are other issues that also need to be addressed. I have been speaking with the minister on these, and I am very keen that we continue to pursue these if we are going to deal with looking after the turtles and dugongs in the longer term. I certainly have major concerns with the illegal trading of meat. I know that it does happen in my electorate. Unfortunately, this turtle and dugong meat is cryovaced, frozen and transported through airports. In my view, there should be a prohibition on the transport of this meat. I am in absolute, total support of native title and of ensuring that native title rights for traditional hunting are protected. However, I am very much of the opinion that it is not in the spirit of native title for individuals to go out there and slaughter large numbers of turtles and dugongs, cryovac them up into plastic, freeze them and then send them all around Australia. At the moment they can do that quite legally if they claim it is for domestic use. It is my view that these creatures, if they are going to be slaughtered in traditional ways for cultural purposes and ceremonies, should be consumed and used in the area in which they were taken, because a very important part of the cultural use of these animals is respect for the animal. Quite frankly, I see no respect in having them sent in cryovac bags around Australia just so somebody can enjoy a little bit of turtle and dugong in Canberra or Sydney or Melbourne. That is an area that I think we need to address.


Another area that concerns me immensely is to see the images on Facebook of individuals going out there boasting of their slaughter of juvenile animals and what have you, and making all sorts of inappropriate comments. Again, it gets back to respect for the animal and blatant abuse of it. These activities are certainly ramping up public support for a total ban on the right to hunt endangered and vulnerable species. Around the country there is very serious momentum for a proposal that would see the total banning of hunting of these creatures for any reason. I would like to congratulate Colin Riddell from Save Australian Dugongs and Turtles, in conjunction with Bob Irwin, for his outstanding and passionate efforts. They have certainly rallied organisations, such as Animals Australia, and others too, such as the RSPCA, to call for an urgent change to the Native Title Act.


This is understandable and, unfortunately, this decision will not be made in our area, but rather it will be made in the metropolitan areas of Sydney or Melbourne. Make no mistake, if it continues, particularly with the Facebook images, there is a high probability that these guys will be successful. While I admire the work that Bob Irwin and Colin Riddell are doing, they know that I have a real issue with the extinguishment of native title rights. I urge the Indigenous communities to take control of this so that we do not lose this opportunity. That means that we have to deal with those individuals who are blatantly abusing the rules and posting on Facebook et cetera. While I disagree totally with Colin and Bob in this area, I can understand why they continue to pursue it. If we do not get something done there and in regard to the transporting of the meat, I do believe it just opens things up for abuse. It certainly is not in the spirit of native title.


Another area that I have great concern about is the activities of a few individuals who are getting involved in taking creatures from green zones in our region.


I have many examples there. One family in particular is going to a place in Green Island and, in front of horrified visitors, slaughtering turtles—which are seen as being like pets—and large fish. These animals have lost all fear of humans. These individuals weave amongst tourists swimming at Green Island and spear fish and turtles. They drag the turtles onto the beach, rip them open, pull the eggs out of them and cut them up, with maybe 50 or 60 absolutely horrified overseas tourists standing there watching them. They take what they want from the turtles and leave the mess for the national park rangers to clean up, and the rangers have absolutely no authority to stop this from happening. Michaelmas Cay is an area that has been protecting sea birds. The same group goes out there and, in front of horrified tourists, clubs to death large numbers of sea birds and takes them away, and nothing is done.


You can see why people are asking the question, 'Why on earth aren't we doing something about that, when we are making such a noise about the whales?' It would be better to make green zones, particularly those where there is human interaction with these creatures, no-go areas rather than having this senseless slaughter. It is no different to walking into somebody's house and beating their pet kitten to death, quite frankly, because these creatures have no fear of people. I congratulate Steve Davies, who has been very involved in trying to stop this, for raising the issue.


I think where we are going is a good start. I certainly support the initiatives that we see here today. As I said, I urge the minister to consider further claims on this. At the end of the day, the only way we are going to be able to comprehensively deal with this is to give the authority to the Indigenous rangers, to the Indigenous elders—who know what is traditional and know what is and is not appropriate—to deal with this. I commend this bill to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (12:07):  The remarks of the member for Leichhardt were very interesting, and I have taken note of them, but I wish to direct my remarks to a different section of the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. The House will be aware that bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is, unsurprisingly, the conservation of Australia's biodiversity—our unique and beautiful birds, plants, and animals.


It is therefore timely to ask: how well is the act performing in achieving this outcome? Sadly, it is failing badly. According to BirdLife Australia, there are currently 392 different kinds of fauna listed as threatened under the act, including no fewer than 112 different types of birds. Nineteen of these species are listed as critically endangered. There are many different examples of how Australian wildlife is in decline, but one of the most striking was covered in a report in Australian Birdlife magazine in September this year by Sean Dooley and Samantha Vine titled 'Parrots in Peril'. It reports that no fewer than 12 of Australia's around 60 parrots and cockatoos are listed as either endangered or critically endangered. That is around 20 per cent of our most loved and highest profile fauna at imminent risk of extinction.


The Norfolk Island green parrot has a current population of between 50 and 100, with possibly as few as 11 breeding females. The western ground parrot population is around 100 birds, in two separate populations in Western Australia. That population has declined by over 80 per cent in the last three generations. The orange-bellied parrot migrates between coastal Victoria and Tasmania. They are now down to around 45 birds. The night parrot population is unknown—it is an inland Australian species—but the best guess is that it is around 250 birds.


The Coxen's fig-parrot, which is a rainforest bird of Southern Queensland, has been estimated at 100 breeding birds, but there are surveys that suggest that fewer than 50 may remain. The eastern regent parrot of inland Victoria and South Australia comprises around 1,500 adult birds. The population has declined in some parts of South Australia by 66 per cent in the last 20 years. The golden-shouldered parrot of Cape York Peninsula nests in tunnels that it excavates into termite mounds. Its current population is probably about 2,500 birds—1,500 around the Morehead River and around 1,000 around the Staaten River. The swift parrot migrates between Tasmania and Victoria and New South Wales. There are approximately 1,000 breeding pairs of this bird, with a maximum of 2,500 individuals.


Four types of black cockatoo are also endangered. The Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo adult population is 350 birds. The south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo population is approximately 1,500, and that is declining. The Baudin's black cockatoo of south-west Western Australia has a current population of 10,000 to 15,000. The Carnaby's black cockatoo has a population of approximately 40,000, and that is also declining.


Penny Olsen had a lengthy report on the sad history of the orange-bellied parrot in the Australian Birdlife publication. She writes that conservationists have struggled to keep the orange-bellied parrot going. It is precarious to say the least to maintain a species once it has sunk to such low numbers. There is no resilience left in the population to combat the inevitable challenges nature throws at it: fire, flood, famine and other upheavals, not to mention inbreeding. As a final blow, climate change may be shifting the bird's climatic envelope south and off the southern edge of the continent, carrying with it the unfortunate parrot. Orange-bellied parrots are breeding in captivity, so, instead of a thriving wild population, we may be left with institutionalised orange-bellied birds. Extinction in the wild, I think, is a very dreary prospect. As Penny Olsen laments, there was a time when politicians feared an extinction on their watch, but that seems to have lapsed over the years.


What does BirdLife Australia say needs to be done? They say that we need to have a national threatened bird recovery fund to implement recovery plans for critically endangered birds, supported by federal funding of $25 million per annum. They also say that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires strengthening. In particular, they say the act requires a mechanism to account for cumulative impact and the ongoing loss of threatened species habitat. I think they are 100 per cent right.


The Australian Conservation Foundation also urges that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act be strengthened. They say that the act needs to be changed so that Commonwealth decision powers under environmental law can never be devolved to the states. They also express concern that the act allows the federal minister a wide discretion as to how the EPBC Act is implemented. This can lead to decisions based on political expediency rather than environmental standards.


The Australian Conservation Foundation says that the EPBC Act should specify objective, science based, mandatory standards by which ministerial decisions under the act are made, and impose a duty on the minister to protect the environment. Improving third-party access to merits reviews of decisions taken under the act is critical, allowing civil society to help enforce compliance and increase public confidence in the act.


What does the bill before the House do? It takes us in exactly the opposite direction. This amendment marks the beginning of efforts by the Liberal government to deconstruct all the good work done by previous governments, both Labor and Liberal, in protecting the environment, which the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act helps ensure. For this Liberal government it is all about paving paradise to put up a parking lot—whether on issues such as reversing action on climate change and protecting the Great Barrier Reef or this amendment, they have nailed their colours to the mast of environmental vandalism and the trashing of this country's beautiful and unique national heritage.


The first part of this bill effectively removes any need for the minister to consider certain environmental advice when approving things such as ports, mines and housing developments. With many of our most loved species on the brink of extinction—including the Leadbeater's possum, the Tasmanian devil and bilbies—we should be strengthening their protection, not undermining it. The bill before the House adds a clause to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act which states that a decision to approve a development will not be invalid merely because the minister failed to receive relevant approved conservation advice. This bill effectively removes the legal requirement for the minister to consider threatened and endangered species when approving projects. It is not just about the federal minister, though. If and when plans to delegate environmental approval powers to Queensland and New South Wales come into effect, the Newman and O'Farrell governments will also be relieved of the duty of considering conservation advice before approving projects.


Labor is opposed to weakening approval powers and, like many in the community, we simply do not trust Queensland Premier Campbell Newman to protect environmental assets such as the Great Barrier Reef. This bill drastically weakens the EPBC Act's protection of threatened and endangered species. Although the minister is still notionally expected to consider formal advice about how to protect these species—the so-called 'conservation advice'—the bill removes any capacity to legally challenge an approval on the basis that advice was not properly considered. Even worse, it does this retrospectively. Current legislation ensures that the minister takes into account all the relevant advice before approving a decision on a new mine, on a port expansion or on a significant new housing development. Depending on the type and location of a project, this advice could include information about a native species that is threatened or endangered. So what we have here is a bill that, on the one hand, weakens protection for threatened species such as the Tasmanian devil whilst, on the other hand, increases penalties for illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. Weakening environmental laws is environmental vandalism. It is regrettable, but I think the Newman government will never protect the environment and cannot be trusted to protect our natural heritage, including the Great Barrier Reef.


The changes in the first part of this bill will not only mean that the federal minister does not have to consider expert advice but also that state ministers will not have to consider this advice. There is a serious question around our international obligations that needs to be posed in this debate. As a good global citizen Australia has signed a number of treaties. Those treaties include: the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat; the Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage; the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals; the International Tropical Timber Agreement; and the Convention on Biodiversity.


Schedule 1 of this bill seems to have been precipitated by the recent Tarkine case, which saw an approval decision overturned because advice was not provided to the then minister by the department. In that case the court found that the decision to approve the mine was invalid because the minister had failed to consider the approved conservation advice for the Tasmanian devil, a threatened species under the act. Unlike the previous Labor government, which did not seek to change the law as a result of this challenge, the Liberal government have apparently decided that if the law does not suit their agenda they will simply change it—take their bat and ball and go home. 


This change would mean that legal challenges such as this one would fail. There are now ten mines proposed for the Tarkine over the next five years. I understand that nine of these mines are Pilbara-style, open cut mines. The Tarkine is home to the last disease-free population of the Tasmanian devil. The Tasmanian devil, as the House would be aware, is being pushed to extinction by the fatal devil facial tumour disease. This disease has been estimated to have killed 80 per cent of the Tasmanian devil population in the past decade. As such, the habitat of the Tarkine is critical to the survival of this iconic species in the wild. 


The Tarkine contains an extraordinary expanse of temperate rainforest—one of the world's greatest remaining tracts of temperate rainforest. Running continuously for more than 70 kilometres and reaching beyond the Arthur and Pieman rivers, this magnificent rainforest includes the Rapid, Keith, Donaldson and Savage river systems. This tract of rainforest is Australia's largest single tract of rainforest wilderness. Globally, it is one of the most significant remaining tracts of temperate rainforest left on the planet. Given that more than three-quarters of Australia's rainforest have already been permanently destroyed, I believe that it is critical that we protect the fragments that are left. 


This bill is just further evidence of a government that quashes debate and refuses to listen to the experts. They have been shutting down bodies providing advice on climate change, and now they want to ignore conservation advice as well. The conservationists have also said that the amendment before the House would stymie a challenge to the Maules Creek mine in NSW, which they say was approved based on erroneous information.


Whitehaven Coal, the mine's developer, was allowed to clear 544 hectares of endangered box gum woodland as well as further habitat that contains threatened species such as the swift parrot, which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and the greater long-eared bat. The Minister for the Environment is being urged by conservation groups to revoke the approval. Jess Abrahams, the healthy ecosystems campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, has said: 


Review and recourse from third parties to government decisions is an essential part of democracy, so it's very worrying this is being removed. 


… … …


Environmental protection is suffering a death by a thousand cuts at the moment. Laws are being weakened and approvals are being handed over to the states, which have a questionable record of protecting the environment.


… … …


We should be strengthening laws but instead we are watering them down.


She is absolutely right. Conservation advice is fundamental to making the best decisions on projects that have potentially harmful impacts on listed species. The objective of the act is to protect the environment. This amendment removes ministerial accountability and weakens environmental protection.


The government is already in the process of attempting to devolve federal approval powers to state governments, a move that would see state conservative premiers in charge of some of our country's greatest natural assets. The laws that protect Australia's most significant environmental assets—our World Heritage areas, precious water resources, internationally significant wetlands and threatened species—are not 'green tape'. The areas are priceless assets for all of us to find tranquillity and enrichment of the soul—much more important than wealth foregone for miners and developers. I urge the House to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for the environment.

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (12:24):  It is a privilege to speak on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I note that it is really the English cricket team that has become an endangered species in this country, with the final fall of wicket in the second test heading our way. Congratulations to Harris on the last wicket—fantastic result!


On a more serious matter, it is more impressive to follow the member for Leichhardt on the first component of this bill, which I totally support, on turtles and dugongs, and to hear his stories about what is going on in his electorate and at the Great Barrier Reef. It is a great keeping of our election commitment that we are increasing the penalties. It is something we said we would do and is yet another tick for the coalition's environmental credentials on improving the situation in a way that will practically assist in an outcome on the illegal pouching of dugongs and turtles. It is done in a way that will not impact upon Indigenous rights to hunt in native-title areas but will increase criminal and civil penalties for the killing, injuring and taking, trading, keeping or moving of a turtle or dugong in a Commonwealth marine area or within the Great Barrier Reef marine park. It is something that is a worthwhile endeavour: keeping our election commitments.


We are moving an important amendment to the second component of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that if the Minister for the Environment does not have relevant approved advice it will not invalidate the decision under the act. This follows the court case that the member for Wills referred to, and I do want to take him up on one point that he argued: we are not making a case about a particular issue about a parrot or possum or other serious issues around the country; this is a legal issue about the separation of powers and about which jurisdiction will have the ability to make decisions that relate to serious approvals for major projects and could potentially affect past projects.


The member for Wills missed a very important point, and I was disappointed to see that he missed this. It is on raising the matter of the court case that led to the amendment being put into the House. It is in regard to the mining case of the Tarkine approved by the then environmental minister, Tony Burke, and re-approved by Labor. So, in terms of outcomes, the member for Wills really does not have cause for complaint. If he is trying to suggest this amendment would have altered the situation or is somehow a profoundly bad thing to do, the previous Labor government went ahead with the mine approval anyway. That may be completely appropriate; there may be nothing wrong with that. But the member for Wills, in avoiding that issue, is not necessarily representing the case in a fair way. 


It was okay for the previous Labor government to continue to approve this mine in the Tarkine, although the Commonwealth was exposed to serious legal action on a fairly oblique point on this advice. Think about all of the green regulations at both a state and federal level; all of the regulations that cover approvals which you must qualify for in Australia to get an approval for a mine underway. We know that they are substantial, we know that they are comprehensive and we know that the advice received from a state and federal level is detailed. All of these considerations are taken into account. But to expose the Commonwealth and these projects to retrospective problems with their approvals does not assist anybody. 


Hence the amendment we see before us today. The member for Wills skirts around saying that since 7 September there has been some dark pall cast over the environment in Australia and that concrete manufacturing is something that—as stock has gone up in Australia—we are using to concrete wilderness. 'Paved paradise' is his phrase from a famous song. I do not think that the climate has changed since 7 September or that things have got warmer or that possums and birds have more things to fear from with this government than they did from the previous government. Let us be serious and realistic about this. We do need to protect our environment and we do need to proceed with projects that are important to our economy and our society. Legally speaking, it is a better situation for the parliament to approve this bill and so to ensure that an act of the minister is not subject to that uncertainty for a major project or major approval once it has gone through all of the considerable regulatory hoops that you must go through in this country.


It is why we have a green-tape agenda to reduce green tape in Australia. That is an unnecessary duplication at state and federal level. We think green tape is probably one of the biggest impediments to getting business moving in this country and one of the main contributors to making our businesses less competitive on the international stage. By removing many of these many duplicate layers of green tape we can get things done and protect the environment. That is, of course, the best way for human beings to coexist with the natural world we live in.


It really is not a great idea for the members opposite to come in here and say that we are against this particular parrot, or that particular possum or that bird. That is not the case. We take seriously the conservation advice delivered to the government. But it is not a good legal case, when we have a separation of powers, to have the Commonwealth exposed—or to have the minister, via the Commonwealth—exposed to his decisions being second guessed every step of the way. We are literally at the very end of a very substantial process that anyone must go through to get a mine approved in this country.


I fully support this amendment and those technical amendments that address the risk make this legislation retrospective. That is, we will not now see a flurry of legal action taken in response to previous decisions. The member for Wills should look pretty carefully at that part of the bill which we are debating here today. We are making this retrospective—not the decisions of former Liberal Party or National Party environment ministers over the past six years but the decisions of the previous government that could be subject to legal exposure. That is appropriate and proper and an adult approach to government. The opposition comes and suggests that, somehow, we have a dark and evil agenda in relation to the environment when we are simply saying that the processes that we have gone through are rigorous, the green standards that have to be met are high in Australia by anybody's benchmark and the minister has had the appropriate advice and has had the chance to consider that advice. We believe that, once all of that has been gone through, it should not be subject to particular legal action specifically in relation to the nature of the advice received by the Minister for the Environment.


I do not believe that the member for Wills made a very compelling case. He may have had some good things to say about protecting various sections of flora and fauna in our country, but he did not make a compelling case. He conveniently overlooked that in the particulars of this legal matter the Tarkine mine was ultimately approved by the then environment minister anyway. So the outcome was the same, but the legal challenge that was gone through is an unnecessary impediment to doing business that we can remove by passing this piece of high-quality legislation and ensuring that we do not expose the Commonwealth unnecessarily to this risk.


I fully support this bill, and I hope that members opposite start to tone down their approach of accusing us of wanting to concrete every piece of environment in the country. It simply is not the case. It is overblown rhetoric. It is not really necessary. Frankly speaking, it is the case that too many of our projects, which are so important to our economy and to Australia's prosperity, are being wound-up in too much duplication and green tape, and it is something that this government will look at.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:33):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. For the benefit of listeners, the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to address the implications arising from the Federal Court's decision in Tarkine National Coalition Inc. v Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, otherwise known as the Tarkine case, which the previous speaker referred to. It also provides additional protection for turtles and dugongs by increasing the financial penalties for various offences and for civil penalty provisions, and it amends the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 by providing additional protection for protected species under that act.


Protecting our natural environment is important as economic development to this country because it is about creating jobs and prosperity, and both are of equal importance to the nation and to government. The two are in fact compatible if managed responsibly. To this government the environment appears to be expendable whenever it is pitted against economic development. In fact, not just for this government but also for conservative state governments across the country, we are now seeing a clear track record where the environment seems to come off second best whenever it in any way impedes money-making ventures and development.


Sadly, what is not very well understood by many is that damaging the environment has, indeed, substantial economic consequences. The preamble to the Australian government response to the report of the independent review of theEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, otherwise known as the Hawke review, said:


… ecosystems deliver essential services worth between US$21 trillion and US$72 trillion a year, which is comparable with the 2008 World Gross National Income of US$58 trillion.


So around the world we can see that the economic value of maintaining and sustaining our natural environment is on par with the gross national income that is generated through economic development right throughout the world. In fact, it is a fool's gain to profit at the expense of a degraded environment.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Australia has experienced the largest documented decline in biodiversity of any continent over the last 200 years. Australia's rate of species decline is amongst the world's highest and is the highest amongst OECD countries. This is a matter I spoke about in June of this year when addressing a private member's motion that I raised in this place, criticising the conservative state governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria for allowing land clearing, cattle grazing, logging, prospecting and tourist activities in conservation areas where those activities presented a serious risk to the environment.


The Abbott government now seeks to reverse the World Heritage Listing of some 100,000 acres of Tasmania's Tarkine. As the shadow minister for the environment on our side—the member for Port Adelaide—quite properly alluded to, it has probably never occurred previously within this parliament that we have seen a reversal of the international listing of a World Heritage area.


The government is now going to defer some $650 million of Murray-Darling Basin water buybacks and is creating uncertainty about the additional 450 gigalitres of water that was to be returned to the system under the previous Labor government. I note that this decision will particularly affect the state of South Australia. I also note that, since the 7 September election, the Liberal members from South Australia have hardly said a word about this issue. Yet prior to the election and in the months leading up to the September federal election they were happy to wear the 'I love Murray' T-shirts in order to promote themselves as being champions of the cause of restoring water to the River Murray so that South Australia could receive its fair share of that water and so that the Lower Lakes in South Australia would not be left in the degraded state that they were in at the height of the drought a few years ago. So you take a particular stand before the election because you know that is what the people in South Australia expect from you, but, after the election, when you have been re-elected, you walk away from the commitments that you made leading up to the election—you backtrack on them, you start to withdraw the money that is required to create the water returns and you withdraw the money that is required to restore the additional 450 gigalitres which South Australians fought very hard for because it was so important and made so much difference to the final amount of water that flows into South Australia.


In fact, this agreement was reached after almost 100 years of bickering between all the states. It took the best part of six years of the Labor government's being in office to finally sign off on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I will give credit to the opposition—the plan was initiated under the national Water Act 2007, under the Howard government. It started then, and it took us six years to finally get an agreement. We finally did get an agreement, and then we saw the new government walking away from it. It is all about an environmental matter. It is all about ensuring that the environment is treated as importantly as every other aspect of this country.


I have concerns about this legislation because it seems to be going down the path of walking away from environmental responsibilities. Firstly, the minister is no longer required to take into consideration certain environmental advice when approving ports, mines and housing developments. That in itself is concerning, because if the minister is not required to take into consideration certain environmental advice then, effectively, he has no particular accountability to the environmental standards that we set. In other words, the environmental consideration can become irrelevant to the minister's decision. There is no accountability mechanism if the minister is not required to take into account certain environmental considerations. Secondly, I have concerns because the minister is likely to rely on environmental assessments carried out by the state governments, who, in my view, have already displayed very poor form in protecting our environment. Last week the Prime Minister, in answer to a question without notice in this place, said that since coming to office his government had, in the previous eight weeks, given environmental approval for projects worth $160 billion. I have no idea which projects the Prime Minister was referring to, but I hope that the environmental assessments required for the approval of those projects were thorough and that the minister did not ignore any of the environmental consequences of those approvals which might have been brought to his attention.


I certainly welcome decisions where we get on with projects that have the necessary approvals, but I hope that they are done in a way that is consistent with the environmental obligations of any government and that we have not simply fast-tracked on the basis that this legislation is going to get through and that the minister is no longer required to take into consideration certain environmental advice when granting those approvals. It would be of interest to know exactly who provided the assessments to the minister on those approvals worth $160 billion. Was it done through the Commonwealth, was it done through state governments or was it done through the proponents? Whose advice did he rely on?


I believe the minister knows that this legislation is a backward step in managing our environment. The way he has gone about bringing it into this House is interesting. He brought in legislation, which I suspect he very much expects to be criticised for by the environmental groups around Australia, and he has done so by simultaneously connecting it to a bit of environmental legislation that protects turtles and dugongs. He is trying to sweeten the legislation or dress it up in an environmentally positive way by adding the protection for dugongs and turtles. I totally support any legislative aspects that go to the protection of dugongs and turtles. There is no question about that at all. However, if the minister were serious about the protection of dugongs and turtles, he could equally have come into this place with separate legislation focusing on and dealing with those two matters only.


Secondly, if he was serious about protecting the dugongs and turtles he would provide more resources to those very authorities and community bodies that currently exist to enable them to enforce greater compliance with the laws, because the problem with the dugongs and turtles is not that we do not have laws in place but that they are not being in any way policed by anyone. So simply increasing the penalties, as he has done, without providing the additional resources to monitor the laws becomes meaningless. I note that, in drawing up the additional legislation, the minister at no time consulted with the traditional owners: with the land and sea councils or with the Indigenous groups of the area who know best how to protect dugongs and turtles.


Putting $2 million into the Australian Crime Commission, as the minister has done, to investigate the illegal killing of turtles and dugongs is not the answer. A better answer would be to put that kind of money into supporting the local groups. One of the lessons that we learned through the Senate Standing Committees on Environment and Communications, of which I have been a member for the last six years, was that if you want to best manage local environmental assets you do so by empowering the local community groups that have the expertise, the knowledge and the commitment to manage the very things that you want looked after. They are the people who are on the ground, they know what works best and they are the people that care the most. Yet that is not what this government seems to be doing.


Our environment around Australia and around the world is increasingly under threat from climate change—a matter I have spoken about on other occasions—from mining, from farming, from residential and commercial growth, from fishing, from construction and even from tourism. Wherever human activity occurs, the environment is always under threat. That is not to say that we cannot work compatibly with it; we can. But we need standards, and we need to ensure that those standards are complied with and met. We are working with the state governments to try to streamline the processes that are required to ensure that those proper environmental standards are achieved. I welcome the fact that we are working with the states, and I welcome the opportunity to try to streamline the processes and make them more efficient. What I do not want to see is streamlining coming into effect at the expense of good policy and at the expense of the environment.


A couple of years ago the Labor government commissioned a review of the EPBC Act. It was referred to as the Hawke review. Of the 71 recommendations put up by the Hawke review, none included the legislation that we are debating today. The most thorough review of that legislation did not incorporate the changes to the legislation that the minister is now proposing. For those reasons, I support the amendments moved by the opposition.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (12:48):  The member for Makin talked about the environment being under threat. Let me educate the member for Makin about who is in fact under threat in my state, in my electorate. It is the worker, the investor and the general community on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I would ask the member for Makin, the member for Wills and the member for Port Adelaide: how many mines are being developed in your electorates? How is the unemployment rate going in your electorates? How is investor confidence going in your electorates?


The reality is that the members opposite, having now moved the amendment—which, I understand, they have foreshadowed—just do not get it. Is nigh on 50 per cent of their state locked up? No, it is not. We are sick and tired in our state, and certainly in my electorate of Braddon, of being treated as some social, political and environmental experiment. The reality here is that we need this amendment to ensure that, in future, confidence can be gained by those people who go through the approval process and who do everything that they need to do.


I will not be spending any time speaking on the first part of the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. As you would expect, I want to use my time to focus on the second part. This bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act to ensure that if the Minister for the Environment does not have regard to and relevant approved advice, it will not invalidate a decision under the act. That section of the bill is of particular interest, as I said, to many constituents, to small and medium-sized businesses and to mining operations in my electorate of Braddon. The questions here are: do we want to continue to stand in the way of development or not? Do we want to continue to add to the list of endangered species by adding that of the worker? I do not think so. I would hope that members opposite would also agree that that is not what we want.


It was only last week in this chamber that I delivered my maiden speech. As anyone who has done it over the last few weeks and those yet to come will know, it is a very special moment in an elected member's time. What they speak about often indicates the priorities of the particular member. In my maiden speech I made the point very strongly that mining companies need certainty in the application process, and this amendment is certainly timely for me to speak about. I said I have a vision of a mining industry that is not only finally confident in the processes of approval that they undertake but also confident that the process optimises environmental outcomes while being efficient, fair, reasonable, dependable and free of opportunistic political intervention. I went on to say that Australian mines of the 21st century know well their environmental responsibilities. It is high time we got off their backs and let them once again stimulate our economy; the members opposite want to get back on their back. They have not got off. They will stay on the back of development in Tasmania. As I said last week, enough is enough.


If you were to believe what has been coming from that side over the last hour, you would think that there is some sort of deep, evil conspiracy that somehow or other attaches to this amendment. But I can say that this amendment is about finally shining some sunlight on the inconsistencies and vagaries of this act and the way in which it opens loopholes for groups such as the Save the Tarkine coalition in my electorate. I believe that this amendment is in fact the first step towards achieving many of the goals that we have set in re-opening Tasmania for business.


The conservation advice amendment is a technical amendment that addresses a risk so that past or future decisions made under the EPBC Act will not be invalidated if the minister does not meet the requirement to have regard to any relevant approved conservation advice. We need to understand what this means. It means that—after the process has been gone through and everything has been considered that could be considered—if suddenly something pops up from somewhere, it does not open the door to it's being something the minister did not give consideration to. The amendment that we see before us is vital for Braddon, for my state and for other parts of the country, as it is currently the case that the EPBC Act decisions could be challenged and overturned if a court rules that a minister has not given due consideration to relevant conservation advice, which potentially exposes a series of past project approvals to possible legal challenge.


I believe it is important to note here that this amendment does not reduce or alter the level of protection for the environment. It just does not. The conservation advice amendment does not reduce the level of protection provided for threatened species and ecological communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The amendment is technical and designed to ensure the validity of decisions made under the act.


If the members opposite want to continue to stand in the way of development in the electorate of Braddon and in Tasmania and across the country, be that on their heads. They just do not get it. The former members who were in this place obviously did not represent sufficiently the interests of my state and my electorate, because, if they had, the previous parliament, the 43rd Parliament, would have dealt with this and would have given the confidence that is required. The perfect example of this obviously goes to the matter that has already been raised, and that is the issue of Shree Minerals, who, in July of the year just gone, had their application for an iron ore mine overturned by the courts following a challenge by the Save the Tarkine organisation.


I will digress just for a moment to say that—and this is breaking news, I suspect—they are up to it again. The Venture Minerals proposal has been going along reasonably swimmingly as another great job-creating investment in my electorate, but the Save the Tarkine coalition are up to it again. They have been back to the High Court with a further intervention in that process. With only a week to go for the case to be heard, it obviously has not given enough time for that matter to be considered properly without damaging the prospects of the court case. And now what have we got? We are coming into Christmas. How beautiful is their timing! They are a bunch of geniuses! We will not get this matter heard until, probably, February, and, as is too often the case, more than likely jobs will be at risk over the next two months through the Christmas-New Year period. What a disgrace! They are up to it again: working with lawyers who just want to attack development in Tasmania and who continue to use my state and my electorate as some sort of political experiment, working pro bono to make a name for themselves—a group that sits around a kitchen table for its committee meetings, or perhaps meets in a phone box, because that is how many of them there are! But they are up to it again.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr WHITELEY:
  You can laugh, but you should know better. My state is in deep trouble.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr WHITELEY:
  You should know better too, and you should know and understand what this is all about. 


Shree Minerals have since had their application approved—thank goodness—and I can say here today that their Nelson Bay mine, located about 70 kilometres south-west of Smithton, has increased production at the mine and is now on the verge of having its first shipment of iron ore out of the Burnie port. It is about jobs, to me. That is why I am here; that is why I got elected. We are about development—acceptable and approved through the processes—and this amendment now goes to protecting these applications in the future from any past or future disputes.


What is going on at Shree Minerals in my electorate is momentous not only for that company but also for that community—a community that has been in a very awkward spiral of job losses over the last few years. It is telling that, on the day that Shree Minerals finally began work on the mine and so bringing employment to a hurting community, this group, which could meet in a phone box, said—when jobs have been made available to people in my electorate and they wander into their workplace with pride in anticipation of a pay cheque to feed their family—'It is a shameful day.' But I will tell you what is a shameful day. It is when such a minority group can have such a negative impact on a community. That is what they are up to. They are economic vandals. There is no doubt about that. They never accept the reality. They will never accept the umpire's decision. They do not care if jobs are lost; they want to keep their name in the press. They ought to go somewhere else. Maybe they should go to the electorates of you over there—the ones who are not supporting this amendment today. Maybe then you would get a taste of what it is like to have people continually trying to lock up even more of your state. We have nearly 50 per cent—just get that: 50 per cent—of my state locked up so that you cannot do any development, and they want more. They will never be satisfied with what they get. In the very area that they protest in, over the last 150 years, hundreds of mines have been mined in my electorate, and thousands upon thousands of jobs and thousands upon thousands of families' lifestyles have been sustained through that activity.


This just cannot go on. So I welcome this amendment and I cannot believe that members opposite will stand in the way of this amendment. In the months leading up to the campaign, they all of a sudden found their conscience and, together with the Deputy Premier in Tasmania, Mr Green, put their hands up to say: 'We are pro mining. We will do what we have to do. They are a bunch of nerds,' and other words you would not want to say in this parliament, to distance themselves from these people. No, you are not. Your words are hollow. You are not distancing yourself from the Greens, the minority groups or from the Save the Tarkine coalition. You are back in bed with them today through trying to knock back this amendment and put forward your own amendments to withhold schedule 1. So do not dare tell people in my electorate and in my state that you are on their team. You are anything but on their team. You are with the enemy on this. You need to support this amendment.


Mining is so important an industry in Tasmania and in my electorate and it has to be a part of the economic recovery. The mining industry's current value-added contribution to Tasmania is about $1.3 billion, or approaching six per cent of the state's GDP. This is not to be frowned at. This is a huge part of what the economy of Tasmania is about. I cannot stand here in this place today and not urge members opposite to have some sense of justice for the people of Tasmania. Do not try to play these political games. I can see what you are up to. It is absolutely transparent. You just want to be stoppers and hinderers. The people of my electorate of Braddon and the people of Tasmania have had enough. Do not dare put up your hand in my electorate and say you are on the team of the developer, of the miner, of the worker or of the families when you sneak up here into Canberra—hardly with a member of the Labor Party now represented in this place, other than the member for Franklin—a week or two out from Christmas and stand in the way of getting legislation through this House that will ensure what happened to Shree Minerals will not happen to someone else.


To suggest for one moment that the environment in this country or in my state is under threat could be nothing further from the truth. This country has a proud environmental record. Have we made mistakes? Are there things we wish we had not done back then? Of course there are. But obviously the intelligence and the research was not available back then. It is now our job to get research and intelligence and accumulate it, and we do. Every assessment and proposal has to jump through hoop after hoop. And even when you get to the end of the hoops and it has been approved, unless we change this legislation it will always be possible for someone, some group, meeting in a phone box somewhere to decide it is time to put another spanner in the works, to chuck another wobbly, and try to stop development in my state. That time should be over. I plead with members opposite to reconsider their position and support this legislation as it stands and as is required to give certainty in my electorate of Braddon.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:02):  The former speaker started strongly for two or three minutes, where he quoted himself, but as soon as he got into other territory he really started to flounder. The Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 on one level is about protecting turtles and dugongs, which everyone supports. But on another level it is a stalking horse. It is about protecting the ability of the Minister for the Environment to effectively ignore recommendations about developments. It removes the legal requirement for the minister to consider threatened and endangered species, but it does increase penalties for illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs.


As a Queenslander—I married someone from Cairns and all of my in-laws are up in North Queensland—I understand the importance of the Great Barrier Reef and of turtles and dugongs, which come all the way down to Brisbane. All six species of marine turtles are listed under the EPBC Act as threatened: the loggerhead, the leatherback and the olive ridleys are actually endangered, and the green, hawksbill and flatback are vulnerable. So, obviously, we should do all we can to make sure they are protected. The same applies to dugongs, for which there are all sorts of problems, because they are migratory. Also, there are lots of threats to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where dugongs do a lot of their breeding. Some of the populations have not recovered from Cyclone Yasi—in terms of the flow-off—and there are all sorts of challenges. I commend the Minister for the Environment for that part of the legislation.


But, as I said, this is not about turtles and dugongs. This is actually about a stalking horse. Why would an environment minister still continue to draw pay if they propose that the decision maker will not have regard to approved conservation advices when they make a decision? Why would an environment minister abrogate their right to run their ruler over the environmental advice provided to them? Unless the Minister for the Environment comes in here and says, 'I should have my pay cut in half,' then he has no credibility at all when it comes to this.


Let us be realistic. The mining industry of 2013 is a completely different industry to the mining industry of 100 years ago that created moonscapes in parts of Tasmania. Those days are long gone. Mining industries now get big ticks for making sure they protect the environment. The rehabilitation they carry out is world class. We are world leaders when it comes to rehabilitation. I say this after having worked as an adviser to the Queensland Resources Council. I know the peak body in Queensland quite well and I know the great work that has been done when it comes to rehabilitation. I do not know mines in Tasmania, but I do know mines in Queensland. I know Queensland has a lot of things going for it that are not dissimilar to Tasmania in that we have a brand that says we are clean, green and a great tourism destination. We also have some of the best resources in the world.


How do we balance those? I can tell you, Member for Braddon, what we do not do. We do not throw out the rule book when it comes to the environment, because that effectively is what we are doing here. This stalking horse that those opposite are carping about is all about saying that the environment minister does not have to have regard to the conservation advice provided to them.




Mr Whiteley:
  It is not a stalking horse.




Mr PERRETT:
  That is exactly what this legislation is about. If those opposite had the foresight to look through this legislation they would see that that is what they are advocating. The Labor Party is the party of jobs, jobs for everybody and jobs that are sustainable, not short-term jobs. Let us be realistic about this. We have seen a few things take place. For a start, the environment minister has said to every state: 'You make decisions about the environment. We trust you.' That will lead to a potted patchwork approach to decision making.




Mr Whiteley:
  That is not what he said.




Mr PERRETT:
  The legislation has already been agreed at COAG. The environment ministers in the states will now make decisions about projects. And we have seen it in Queensland and I am particularly worried about the Queensland government. Before the election—back in March last year—they hardly said anything about the environment; in fact, they even put out a letter to the environment groups saying: 'You can trust us. We will do the right thing by you.' Then after the election—and I mean the morning after the election—the first statement made by the Deputy Premier elect, Jeff Seeney, was not a visionary statement about what Queensland will look like in 30 years time. No, the first thing that he said was, 'The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is too big.' That is what a Queensland Deputy Premier said the morning after the election. There was no mention of that before the election, but that was the first thing that he said afterwards. I am a big believer in people carrying out after the election what they promise before an election.


The reality is that the Premier of Queensland, in an environment in which income is constrained, is likely to be blind when it comes to mining approvals. If they are going to effectively be told, 'You don't have to pay attention to the approved conservation advice,' that is going to completely tip the balance between sustainable mining and a sustainable environment. That is going to tilt it too far in favour of mining companies.


As I said, the Labor Party has a strong presence in the mining industries. We take notice of the jobs in the mining industry. But it must be a balanced and sustainable industry. We need to remember—and anyone from Tasmania would know this—what happens when you have unchecked mining and when mining companies do not have an obligation to consider the environment before they put a shovel in the ground. That can be a recipe for disaster.


These amendments are important. They need to be seen in the context of the planet overall, because that is fundamentally what those opposite do not get. Obviously, the prism through which we should consider things is our approaches to putting a price on carbon. We understand that it is a cost to people and that it means that they have to readjust. We understand that it involves them putting their hand in their wallets or changing their lifestyles. Why do we ask them to do this, something that is tough to retail to people at the polling booth? The reason that we do it is because we care about the future. Unless we have the capacity to look our children in the eye and say, 'I am more important than you'—and that is something that I cannot do to my four-year old and my eight-year old—we need to get this right. The people sitting on green seats now need to get it right; the people sitting on red seats over in that other place need to get it right. History will judge us harshly for how we approach the future of the globe.


Australians put their trust in the Abbott government to do what is best for our nation. Obviously, I did not agree with their policies. But they continue to make misleading and destructive statements and now some of those opposite have gotten into groupthink so much that they have started to convince themselves that it is the actual truth. The carbon price legislation is a classic example.


In my home state of Queensland, environmental protection and the conservation of biodiversity is exceptionally important. We are a very diverse state. We have deserts, rainforests and mulga; we even have Antarctic beach. We have the biggest sand island in the world, Fraser Island. Ironically, that became protected through the actions of Campbell Newman's dad when he was environment minister under Malcolm Fraser. Queensland is incredibly diverse, but we also have these incredible resources that can create the jobs and the exports that will keep people employed for the next 30, 50, 100 or 200 years. We want to see our economy grow and prosper but we cannot do so by sacrificing our environment. That way madness lies. If you look at China, you can see what happens if you have unchecked development with people not considering the environment. That can create riots and health problems and the like.


Queensland had a tourism campaign with the slogan, 'Beautiful one day, perfect the next.' That is something that we need to consider. Yet in the last couple of weeks I have seen the Queensland government talk about mining and exporting uranium. I even heard the processing of uranium floated the other day. There was no mention of it during the election. In fact, when I raised this during my election campaign in September there was a strong response from my opponent saying, 'No, that's a fear campaign; there is nothing like that being considered.'


The reality is that we need to look at uranium and nuclear power stations not just through the prism of Fukushima and how things can go wrong or Kakadu, where we saw some problems over the weekend. We need to consider what it would mean to that brand of, 'Beautiful one day, perfect the next,' if you have barrels of yellowcake going through the Great Barrier Reef or, if they decide not to go through the Great Barrier Reef, up through the Northern Territory to the accredited port or down to South Australia. If they go through South Australia, that would mean that they would be trucking it through my home town of St George. I know the current member for New England has deserted St George, but I would love to have that conversation in the pubs in St George: 'We've got some yellowcake coming through here and going down those country roads.' I believe you have to get the balance right. Surely listening to the conservation advice provided to a mining company is a logical pre-step to any big mining operation.


I campaigned about marine parks at the end of the 43rd parliament, when we had votes on the marine parks that Labor had created—a system of marine parks that are the envy of the world; a system of marine parks such that we see people come to Australia to learn what we have done. But, sadly, those opposite in the 43rd parliament voted against that—we only won the continuation by one vote. I am sure the member for Melbourne would remember that one vote with which we won. In fact, we even saw the member for Wentworth vote against the park that he had created when he was the environment minister! That was the political power play that we saw in the 43rd parliament.


The reality is this bill is nobbling an environment minister's ability to make decisions about mining projects. As I said, all power to his arm when it comes to protecting turtles and dugongs—although I think there could have been greater consultation with Indigenous groups around Queensland, and that that clearly illustrates why this is a stalking horse rather than a fair dinkum approach to looking after those species.


UNESCO's World Heritage committee has had a look at our reef and assessed it as being in danger—already under threat. We have mining projects set to come online in Queensland over the next few years. There are pressures coming from the miners in terms of the suggestion that they put sludge out into the reef. I have been going to North Queensland for about 25 years. When you see the changes you can see that there are challenges for the reef, challenges for the tourism industry and the nearly 60,000 jobs that hang off the biggest living organism in the world. We need to get the balance right. Those opposite are not doing that.


There was a time, when it came to the environment, when Australia was a world leader. We saw that with our marine park proposal under former Minister Burke in the Labor government. We have a history of punching above our weight as a middle power. This step is a retrograde step. This step takes us back to the bad old days that I remember, with Joh Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland, where the white shoes were out from under the desk wandering around dictating how things were done.


Ironically, mining companies have moved on. They have world's best practice and they should be recognised for such. If the project is so dodgy that it cannot even get an approved conservation advice then perhaps we should not be doing it. We need to be sensible when it comes to the environment and jobs.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (13:18):  The Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 pulls in two different directions. On the one hand it is taking away part of the legal requirement that applies to environmental approvals processes involving the Commonwealth minister, and on the other it is putting in place what are said to be greater protections for some particular species. I have to say that it is consistent with what we have seen from a range of coalition state governments that have been elected in Australia in recent years. We are seeing here, in this first piece of environmental legislation from the new coalition government at the federal level, a taking away of protections of the environment.


The Minister for the Environment can seek to dress up what is occurring in this bill however he likes—and sought to do so, in fact, in his second reading speech—but what is actually occurring is the taking away of legal protection that is presently there for the environment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. That legal protection requires the Commonwealth minister, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, to take into account conservation advice. The minister would have it that that conservation advice is still going to be taken into account but then says that what this act does is makes sure that no decision taken by the minister that fails to take into account that conservation advice will be invalid. In the next breath he would have this parliament and the people of Australia believe that that is not a lessening of environmental control.


Anybody at all, whether or not they have any legal expertise, can immediately see that if you take away the right to go to a court and have a decision by a Commonwealth minister declared invalid then the force of a legal requirement on a Commonwealth minister to take into account conservation advice is a great deal less than if the capacity exists to go to a court or tribunal and point correctly to the fact that a minister has not taken conservation advice into account properly and for that decision to be declared invalid.


I am not sure what the minister thinks is going to be the force of this particular part of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act if this bill passes the House and passes the Senate, but it is pretty clear to us that it will greatly lessen the force of the environmental approvals process as it presently stands. Make no mistake: this bill lessens the force of Commonwealth environmental law. It weakens Commonwealth environmental law. And, as I said at the outset, it is consistent, regrettably, with what we have come to see so often from the conservative parties when they get to power either at the state or the Commonwealth level. At the state level, in my home state of Victoria we saw as almost the first act of the newly elected Baillieu government the reintroduction of cattle to the alpine regions of Victoria against all the known science and all the known research, fulfilling a promise that had been made to their supporters in the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. And they persisted for some months with the pretence that there was some actual scientific basis for this proposed returning of cattle to the high country. It needed the then minister for the environment, Tony Burke, to step in before that short-lived attempt to put back the clock, in an environmental sense, was stopped in Victoria.


It is important to keep the context of the cattle in the high country in mind. There have been no cattle in the high country on the New South Wales side of the Victoria-New South Wales border since the mid-1960s. But, regrettably, cattle continued to persist in the alpine regions of Victoria right into the early 2000s, when the then Labor government was able to bring that particular activity to an end. It is of course an activity that has no environmental basis. It has been very clearly established for many years that there is tremendous environmental harm, in fact, flowing from grazing cattle in the high country. Tony Burke said at the time, somewhat memorably, that to put cattle into the Alpine National Park was to make a national park into a farm—which of course it is not. But it is emblematic of the attitudes the conservative parties take to environmental protection. They would far prefer to pander to commercial interests, to ignore the science and to ignore environmental advice than to properly protect the environment.


Regrettably, we are seeing again in Victoria in recent weeks talk by the Napthine government about putting cattle into the high country—again, on the pretence of some kind of trial, when, as I said, all the known science has been completely clear now for many years. I fear, given the other kinds of measures that this environment minister and this new federal government have been discussing in terms of preparation to hand back environmental assessment and approval powers to states, that this small piece of legislation is just the precursor to what will be a wholesale attack on environmental regulation and environmental protection in this country. You would have to say that nothing about any of the actions of this new government in relation to environmental matters—in its still less than 100 days of government since the election—gives the people of Australia the slightest confidence that this government is to be trusted on environmental matters. Certainly they are not a government that can in any way be trusted to keep their promises. They are not a government that can in any way be trusted to be the government they said they were going to be before the election. And they are certainly not a government that can be trusted to govern with anything like orderliness or deliberation. Rather, we see, staggering from day to day, decisions made on the run. And of course that is the antithesis of the kind of regulation and governmental activity that you need in the environmental area, where, as has often been said, developers—people wanting to take commercial advantage and people wanting to exploit natural resources—need to win only once, because then the development is underway and the project is up and running.


People seeking to protect the environment—and governments, when they seek to protect the environment—need to win every time in order to ensure that the environment is protected. Sometimes that will mean some considered deliberation. It will mean taking your time, looking at the science, taking into account conservation advice, which is the basis of this bill, and taking the time to make sure that the conservation advice has been considered properly. Sometimes it will mean taking the time to ensure that the environmental effects have been properly considered before rushing to make a decision. What this bill does is take away the consequence that would flow if the conservation advice were not properly taken account of.


Somewhat extraordinarily, in the second reading speech the minister actually referred to a recent Federal Court decision—Tarkine National Coalition Incorporated v Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, which was earlier this year. The Federal Court found that an approval in relation to the Tarkine Forest was invalid because the then minister had not had proper regard to relevant approved conservation advice. The response of this government, far from being to ensure that, in future, proper regard is given to all conservation advice, and far from being to beef up the processes that apply to the obtaining and consideration of conservation advice, has been to rip up the rule book, to take away the legal consequence that has attached up until now—and that should continue to attach—to failing to take into account conservation advice in this way.


It is, as I said earlier, a weakening of environmental laws, just when this government is proposing to hand over to the states a large part of environmental assessment and approval powers. I have given only the single example of cattle in the high country in relation to the conduct of this present state Liberal government, but one could cite a whole range of other examples. The Newman government, since coming to office not all that long ago, has in almost all its decisions sought to put development ahead of the environment. The Newman government certainly cannot be trusted to protect our national heritage, in particular—and the member for Moreton, who spoke before me and who is a Queenslander, spoke eloquently about this—the threat posed to the Great Barrier Reef by the actions of the Newman government. Australia is a signatory to a whole range of environmental treaties. They include the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat, Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. All of these conventions, and Australia's adherence to them, are potentially called into question by the legislative change to the approvals processes which is proposed by this bill. It is regrettable that, as almost its first piece of environmental legislation—because one can hardly count the so-called repeal of the carbon tax set of legislation as environmental legislation—this government has sought to bring forward a decision which takes away the force of the existing provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.


I hasten to say that in this bill the government is also bringing forward provisions that protect turtles and dugongs. For many years it has been very well known that marine turtles and dugongs are impacted by a range of enduring threats, including habitat loss, poor water quality, being part of so-called bycatch, poaching, marine debris and boat strike. In government, as a matter of resourcing, as a matter of departmental organisation and as a matter of particular programs, Labor made addressing these issues effectively a very high priority. All of the work that was put in train by the Labor government continues in close association with state and territory governments, with traditional owners in the north of Australia and with other groups with an interest such as commercial fishers.


This law is one which we support because it is a continuation, with some additional protections, of a range of programs that we put in place while in government. In particular, it is worth noting that the former Labor government invested some $7 million in Indigenous self-management, because that is the very best way to ensure that the sustainable and appropriate management of dugongs and turtles continues. Critically, the approach that we took in government included leadership and advice on the take of marine turtles and dugongs, developing community based sea country management plans and the support of traditional owner involvement in the sustainable use of marine resources and in compliance training.


We have also supported Indigenous ranger teams to remove ghost nets. These are lost or abandoned nets which impact on turtle and dugong populations. As with all of our environmental work while in government, our approach was based on our respect for the customs and traditions of Indigenous Australians and their right, as traditional owners under the Native Title Act, to hunt native species for personal, domestic, non-commercial or communal needs. So we do support a balanced approach. (Time expired)

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-09,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:33):  This is an astounding bill. It says that, if you are the Minister for the Environment and someone gives you some advice that something needs to happen to protect a threatened species, you are allowed to ignore them. If a mining company comes in and says, perhaps, 'We want to develop here, right in the middle of a national park,' and someone says, 'You can't do that in that way, because that might affect a threatened species,' this bill says that the minister can completely ignore that advice and side with the mining company. It also means that if you go to court to challenge it by saying that, 'No, look, hang on, there is expert advice that the Tasmanian devil—'or perhaps a species up on the Great Barrier Reef—'is going to be threatened by this and potentially made extinct and wiped off the face of this earth,' there is nothing the court can do about it because the minister is able to hide behind their decision and say, 'No, we've changed the law to say that we can ignore the best conservation advice available in this country.'


That is an astounding proposition to come from someone who says he is the Minister for the Environment. If you were the Minister for the Environment, presumably you would craft laws in this country that gave the environment the maximum possible protection. Instead, these laws are being rewritten by, essentially, mining companies—and that is, ultimately, what this bill is. A couple of weeks before Christmas, this is a nicely wrapped up gift to some of Australia's and the world's biggest companies, at the expense of the environment and at the expense of species that are threatened. It is this parliament's job to stand up for species and the environment that otherwise would not have a voice. Unless we put into law proper protections for the species that we share this planet with, we are going to see a 'let it rip' mentality. Chop it down, dig it up, ship it off—that is the limit of the government's vision for the country.


Our environment laws at the moment are not actually that strong and are nowhere near as strong as they should be. It is astounding that, in the first few sitting weeks of parliament, before the end of the year, the first thing that the government wants to do is weaken them even further so that the minister for the environment does not even have to listen to advice about what it would take to protect threatened species. It is a very cynical attempt to overcome a decision that has been referred to before in the debate, where the previous minister for the environment gave the go-ahead to a mine in a forest in Tasmania without having any regard to advice that said, 'This will impact on the Tasmanian devils in a way that potentially would breach your obligations,' and was found by the court to have not followed the act. This law is now attempting not to strengthen our processes to make sure we are never found in breach of those obligations again but to change the law so that such court cases never happen again—so that, if you ignore a piece of advice about conservation, there is nothing anyone can do about it.


It is very clear why this is happening. We heard why from a couple of speakers before. It is because the country is now open for business, apparently. That does not just include our cities and our rural areas; it includes our parks, too. It seems our parks are now open for business. This is a piece of legislation that the government wants to get through by the end of the year so that it does not even have to listen to advice about how we can protect some of our threatened species in the future. We have seen, in my state of Victoria, what that means in practice. It means, for example, cattle being allowed to graze in Alpine National Park areas—in defiance of the science and in defiance of common sense—so that we can turn the park into a paddock, so that cows can have a free feed. It does not matter what happens to threatened species or the environment!


There is a second part to the bill, which is to increase penalties for those who harm or kill turtles or dugongs. That is something that many people from across the political spectrum, including in this chamber, have been raising as an issue for some time. But, again, the cynicism of this government knows no bounds. At the same time as they modestly increase penalties in this law, they are enthusiastically rolling out the red carpet for the big coal and gas port developments on the reef's coast, developments that pose huge risks to the Great Barrier Reef's dugong and turtle populations. Dredging and dumping of dredge spoil offshore destroys the sea grass where the turtles and dugongs live and feed.


The true test of this minister's commitment to the dugong and turtle populations in the Great Barrier Reef falls due on Friday the 13th. That is when the minister will decide whether or not to approve the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. If he approves it, that will facilitate Abbot Point becoming the biggest coal port in the Southern Hemisphere, facilitating the export of vast amounts of climate-destroying Galilee coal from Queensland. It also involves—which is relevant to this debate—dredging and dumping three million cubic metres of dredge spoil offshore in the reef's waters. That is going to contribute to destroying turtle and dugong habitats. We will see how much the minister really cares about the dugongs and turtles when it comes to the Abbot Point development.


In the few minutes I have left I will foreshadow some amendments that we will be moving in the detail stage. Firstly, we will move to strike out schedule 1 of the bill, because this schedule as it is currently drafted will allow the government to just ignore science and just ignore advice from experts in this country about how to protect the environment. That is anathema to good governance—having no requirement that, in the environment protection legislation of this country, you have to even listen to advice about how to protect the environment. That is anathema to good governance and it must go.


The second amendment that we will move does something fairly straightforward. It will strengthen our national environment laws to ensure that all major decisions about projects that will significantly harm Australia's most precious places and wildlife must be made by our national environment minister. This is crucial. We have seen state governments in operation. We have seen their willingness to trash the environment for the sake of a dollar. For that reason, over time we have developed national environmental protection laws. Those laws which allow the national government to step in and override state governments have meant that, for example, we have not seen dams built in Tasmania—as I am sure many people here know.


What is on the cards with this government—and it was flagged under the previous government—and what this amendment will stop is the federal government saying to the state governments: 'Look, you decide. We will hand over to you, essentially, the responsibility for making a decision about whether or not national environment laws are complied with.' We have seen this government act at the behest of some of the country's and the world's biggest mining and resource companies, and sign MOUs with the New South Wales and Queensland governments to kick-start the process, to essentially hand to Premiers Newman and O'Farrell the federal environment minister's powers. It is rumoured that, at the upcoming COAG meeting, we are going to see more of that. If this proceeds, the federal government will have no power to step in and stop, or even place conditions on, developments that are likely to have a significant impact on some of our most precious national icons. It would mean the federal government could protect neither World Heritage areas from big mines nor threatened species from being sent to extinction by state governments, who would approve—and we have seen them do this—major developments in key habitat. 


As I said, if this procedure had been in place in the past, we could not have stopped the Franklin from being dammed. If it were in place, we would not be able to stop oil rigs in the Great Barrier Reef. We need to stop the Abbott government from creating essentially a one-stop shop for business to sell out our environment. This would be a major step backwards. It would overturn 30 years of gradually increased, and greatly needed, Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection. I do not want to see Premier Napthine in sole control of whether or not to put cows in the Alpine National Park or Campbell Newman in sole control of the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef. That is what is likely to happen unless the amendments that we are going to move are passed. Likewise, unless this House supports the amendments that the Greens are going to move, we will have Barry O'Farrell in sole control or whether or not to send koalas there to extinction. I am pleased to hear the noises from the Labor Party that, although they initially floated this idea, they now understand what it would mean. They understand that the Hawke legacy is fundamentally under threat from this government and, unless we support—

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:45):  On 10 December 1950, the United Nations General Assembly, presided over by Australia's then foreign affairs minister, Doc Evatt, as president, proclaimed 10 December as Human Rights Day to bring to the attention of the peoples of the world the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations.


It is pertinent to reflect on Human Rights Day tomorrow as we mourn the passing of Nelson Mandela, who devoted his life to the promotion of human rights, to the elimination of racial discrimination and to the affirming of every human being's right to live with dignity. I will speak further about Nelson Mandela in the condolence motion, but I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the wonderful Irish poet and Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, who passed away on 30 August this year. On the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 2008, Seamus wrote a beautiful essay called 'The redress of poetry', in which he observed that, in an unbalanced society, the UDHR adds weight to the lighter side of the scale and contributes to the maintenance of equilibrium—never entirely achieved—between the rights and the wrongs.


I am proud of the human rights achievements of the former Labor government that have contributed to the lighter side of the scale, including, just to name a few, establishing the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, establishing the National Children's Commissioner, legislation to prevent the reintroduction of the death penalty, removing discrimination against same-sex couples in more than 80 Commonwealth laws, endorsing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (14:00):  I move:


That the House record its deep regret at the death on 5 December 2013, of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela AC, former President of the Republic of South Africa, and place on record its acknowledgement of his role in the development of the modern South African nation and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Our parliament pauses today to mark the loss of a great man: a freedom fighter who became a national healer, a prisoner who became a president. Very few leaders in human history have embodied their cause in the way that Nelson Mandela represented a free and equal South Africa. For the 27 years he spent in prison he was the symbol of all that was wrong with apartheid. Today, we use words like racism quite often, but no-one can comprehend the horror and injustice of what apartheid was in a bygone South Africa.


He was imprisoned for taking action against the injustice and prejudice that infiltrated every aspect of his people's lives. Lesser men, when deprived of the energy of their supporters and the exhilaration of the struggle, would have given up the fight in the long and lonely days of their incarceration. Lesser men would have allowed their passion for justice to spill over into a desire for vengeance. In the words of the poem Invictus, of which Mandela was so fond, he remained true, 'bloody, but unbowed', and the 'menace of the years' found him unafraid. He was confident that the tide of history would turn, and turn it did.


As global awareness of the evil of apartheid spread and the international community started to take action against South Africa, Mandela became a beacon of hope, a symbol of what the new South Africa could be: a country were every man, woman and child would be equal under the law; a place where everyone could aspire to high office and be entitled to basic dignity; a nation where freedom was indivisible and a universal right.


Because of Mandela's greatness, South Africa was reborn in a spirit of reconciliation, not retribution. As president he worked to bind up the nation's wounds, to bring truth and healing through the power of his example. He saw the dismantling of apartheid as an act of mutual liberation, a change that conferred new freedom and dignity to the oppressed and the oppressor alike. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Frederik Willem de Klerk, in acknowledgement that his was a struggle to achieve peace.


Now that he is gone, and the tributes are pouring in from across the globe, it is worth remembering that Mandela always espoused modesty and humility. He never wanted to be an icon or a saint. He was, in his own words, just a sinner who kept on trying. Paradoxically, his humility only added to his greatness.


Few of us in public life ever try to encourage criticism, even if our actions might sometimes invite it. But whenever Mandela tried to acknowledge his flaws or mistakes—and like all people he had some—he only brought his qualities and achievements into sharper relief. This as much as anything reveals the measure of the man.


In the days ahead the world will mourn the death of Nelson Mandela, but let us also give thanks for his life. I have noticed in the film and pictures coming from South Africa how much the people are celebrating as well as grieving. We will never see another Nelson Mandela, but in the South Africa he built and the world he leaves behind his example lives on as an inspiration to us all. Now that his long walk to freedom is at its end, may he rest in peace.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:05):  How wonderful it is to hear those words from the Acting Prime Minister. I second the motion. There is a story from Robben Island which speaks to the power of words and art to inspire and sustain the human spirit. The story goes that the political prisoners used to secretly pass around a copy of Shakespeare's collected works, and on one occasion the men marked their favourite passages. Mandela chose one from Julius Caesar:


Cowards die many times before their deaths;


The valiant never taste of death but once.


Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,


It seems to me most strange that men should fear;


Seeing that death, a necessary end,


Will come when it will come.


It has come now for Nelson Mandela. We should be thankful that he lived, fought and led his country, but we mourn the fact that he has now passed from this world.


There was a news report a few nights ago where the presenter remarked that dawn was breaking in South Africa for the first time in 95 years without Nelson Mandela. There is something in that. Such an iconic figure can sometimes take on the stature of being permanent, but the nature of human history is that everything is fleeting: 'a mere brief passing moment in time and space', as Mandela put it. No longer do freedom fighters have the living and breathing Mandela to look to; he belongs to history now, the man who spent more than a quarter of his life—long, lonely, wasted years—imprisoned by a regime which he was prepared to give his life to bring down, only to preach reconciliation on his release.


The man who brought down apartheid without, in the end, a shot being fired now belongs to an echelon reserved for leaders like Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, who first said those words that Mandela repeated on his release: 'Free at last.' The names of these indomitable fighters for the expression and realisation of human dignity will always inspire millions to think, to act and to fight. 


We are all bound by the times we live in. There has been some commentary in the last few days pointing out that Mandela was no saint, as if that is a criticism. Of course, he was not. He was a political leader engaged in a bitter struggle, a political leader reacting to the unpredictability of human events and the grotesque nature of apartheid—or, in his own words, he was a product of the mire that his society was. It is one of those ironies of history which reveals the complexity of the human condition. Men and women created something as repressive as apartheid but the men and women of South Africa and around the world led by Mandela were part of the movement of millions which brought it down. The contradiction of all of this is that, while Mandela's struggle reveals complexity, it also has a perfect moral clarity. Dividing a country based on race and class is wrong. Denying a person his or her inherent rights based on the colour of their skin is wrong. Fighting racism is right, and uniting a troubled country through reconciliation and forgiveness is right. 


We should never forget those millions who fought alongside Mandela. While they were lucky to have a leader of his stature, their struggle should never be forgotten. Mandela and his people's struggle was a touchstone for generations of progressive people around the globe. There would be people in this parliament today who can trace their political awakening to the anti-apartheid movement; it was formative for many of us. I am proud to be a member of a party which supported Mandela's struggle for the decades that he was in prison, and I am proud to be part of a labour movement of party activists and trade unionists which long supported sanctions as one of the fundamental ways the international community united to help bring down the apartheid regime. 


There can hardly be a person who was of age in February 1990 who cannot recall the jolt of excitement as Mandela walked free and likewise the triumph of his 1994 election. We were lucky to share Mandela's times. He said that to overthrow oppression has been sanctioned by humanity and is the highest aspiration of every man. The world is better because he lived and fought. Like the valiant in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, he has now come to the necessary end, which we all will taste. 


Mandela once remarked that the names of only a very few people are remembered beyond their lives. He will be one of those people. Australia mourns his end but gives thanks for his life.

 (Wakefield) (14:12):  My question is to the Treasurer. What is the future of car manufacturing in Australia if the government goes ahead with his half a billion dollar cut to the car industry?

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (14:12):  The future of the car industry is in the hands of the car industry. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is in the hands of the car industry in the same way that it was under Labor. It was February 2008, from memory, when Mitsubishi closed and Labor was in government. It was Ford that announced that it was closing its Australian operation when Labor was in government. Is that a vacuum? Has that gone into the black hole of the six years that never existed? The fact is that, from 2015 onwards, we have committed $1 billion to help the car industry. But, ultimately, the thing that is most going to help the Australian motor vehicle industry is Australians buying their cars. That is what happens. It is about buying Australian cars. I would say to the members opposite: 'Please don't engage in hypocrisy on this. Don't be A-grade hypocrites when it comes to the motor vehicle industry.' 



Mr Champion interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Wakefield has asked his question. The member for Wakefield is warned! 




Mr HOCKEY:
  It was the Labor Party that introduced a fringe benefits tax on motor vehicles—a $1.8 billion hit, which the member for McMahon was so proud of before the election. The best way you can help the Australian motor vehicle industry is impose a $1.8 billion tax on it! That was the Labor way of thinking. Then the Labor Party said that they would have a green car fund and then they cut the green car fund—



A government member: Cash for clunkers.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I forgot cash for clunkers. That was another great initiative from the Labor Party. But the carbon tax itself adds to the cost of producing motor vehicles in Australia—a carbon tax manufacturers do not pay if the cars are built in Thailand or anywhere else. The Labor Party believes the best way you can help manufacturing in Australia is to tax it to death. That is the Labor Party way. I would say to the member for Wakefield: the Australian automotive industry survives today despite the Labor Party, and the best thing that could happen for the Australian motor vehicle industry today is for the Labor Party to help get rid of the carbon tax.

 (Forrest—Government Whip) (14:47):  My question is to the Minister for Education. I remind the minister that the higher education support bill contains $2.3 billion in savings measures nominated by the previous government. Can the minister update the House on the progress of the bill and on what impact its failure to pass will have on the federal budget deficit and the Commonwealth's debt position?

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (14:48):  I can inform the member for Forrest that, unfortunately for the Higher Education Support Act, the bill is stuck in the Senate while Labor and the Greens continue to refuse to pass it. We are in the ludicrous position in the current parliament where Labor are now voting against the savings measures they proposed whilst in government. They are also voting against increasing the debt ceiling limit. So we have the ridiculous situation where Labor had savings measures that they now oppose. They are adding to the debt limit, they are adding to the deficit and they are voting against the bill to increase the debt ceiling limit. That is how economically illiterate Labor have become.


I notice that Paul Keating the former Prime Minister is in Canberra this week to talk to the caucus about economic matters. I am sure he would have some advice for them, because Labor are tremendously confused at the moment. They are very confused economically. They want to have their cake and they want to eat it too. They want to add to the debt, they want to add to the deficit, they want to vote against savings measures they proposed, and they want to also vote against increasing the debt ceiling limit bill.


We have the ridiculous situation where Labor not only are opposing our program and frustrating the abolition of the carbon tax and the mining tax and savings measures but also voting against their own program when they were in office. No wonder Labor voters are confused. First they are told that Kevin Rudd is the Messiah; then he is the monster. Then they are told, three years later, that Julia Gillard is the Messiah; then they are told that Julia Gillard is not the Messiah but a liability, and they have to go back to the monster.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. I call the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, when someone is as far away from direct relevance as that under standing order 104(a), we should not have to rise on a point of order before that sort of nonsense is brought to heel.



The SPEAKER:  I call the honourable the minister and ask him to address his remarks to the question.




Mr PYNE:
  I will, Madam Speaker, and I am trying to explain so that it is easy for the opposition to see how confusing their position is on the debt ceiling limit bill and on the savings measures that they proposed and that they now oppose. This is but a piece of Labor over the last six years. They are so bad economically and so juvenile economically that they are now making the flat-earth Greens look economically literate. I am hoping that Paul Keating this week might be able to give them some good advice, because Paul Keating was a member of a government—the Hawke government—which actually made a difference to the economy in this country. They would never have proposed the savings measures and then opposed those same savings measures. They would never have said that the debt ceiling limit should not be raised but then voted against measures that would reduce Commonwealth debt. When Mr Keating comes I look forward to his pearls of wisdom informing the Labor caucus about how to be a legitimate and economically literate opposition.

2. Broadcast of House of Representatives and Federation Chamber proceedings – House monitoring service


Access to proceedings provided through the House Monitoring Service is subject to compliance with the following conditions:


a. Only the following broadcast material shall be used:


   i. switched sound and vision feed of the House of Representatives, its committees and the Federation Chamber provided by the Parliament that is produced for broadcast, re-broadcast and archiving; and


   ii. official broadcast material supplied by authorised parliamentary staff.


b. Broadcast material shall be used only for the purposes of fair and accurate reports of proceedings, and shall not be used for:


   i. political party advertising or election campaigns; or


   ii. commercial sponsorship or commercial advertising.


c. Reports of proceedings shall be such as to provide a balanced presentation of differing views.


d. Excerpts of proceedings which are subsequently withdrawn may be broadcast only if the withdrawal is also reported.

4. Radio broadcast of parliamentary proceedings by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation – general principles


The House adopts the following general principles agreed to by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings on 19 March 2013:


a. Allocation of the broadcast between the Senate and the House of Representatives


The proceedings of Parliament shall be broadcast live whenever a House is sitting. The allocation of broadcasts between the Senate and the House of Representatives will be in accordance with the standing determinations made by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. It is anticipated that over time, the coverage of each House will be approximately equal.


b. Rebroadcast of questions and answers


At the conclusion of the live broadcast of either House, questions without notice and answers thereto from the House not allocated the broadcast shall be rebroadcast. 


c. Unusual or exceptional circumstances


Nothing in these general principles shall prevent the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings from departing from them in unusual or exceptional circumstances. 


5. This resolution shall continue in force unless and until amended or rescinded by the House in this or a subsequent Parliament. (Notice given 20 November 2013.)


Today I introduce a resolution to replace the existing resolutions of the House for the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The terms of this resolution were developed and endorsed in the previous parliament by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. This resolution authorises the broadcast and re-broadcast of proceedings and excerpts of proceedings of the House, its committees and the Federation Chamber. The resolution allows the sound and vision coverage to be broadcast to the House monitoring service and through the Parliament of Australia website.


There are already resolutions adopted by the House to authorise the broadcast of proceedings. However, these old resolutions need to be updated to take into account new broadcast technologies and platforms, including broadcast via the Parliament House website and through social media. This resolution will do this while still retaining the clear control of the House over access to proceedings broadcast via the House monitoring service. The existing powers of committees to control the broadcast of their public proceedings remain, too.


The new resolution will also remove inconsistencies with the rules for media related activity in parliament house and its precincts. These media rules were revised by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, following a public inquiry, and were designed as part of a package to go with the revised resolution. This resolution will strengthen the nexus between the conditions of broadcasting and the responsibilities of accredited media personnel in Parliament House. An equivalent motion will be moved in the other place. I commend the resolution to the House.


In closing, this was a resolution of the House that the member for Grayndler, then Leader of the House, and I discussed in the dying days of the last parliament. We unfortunately ran out of time to move this resolution in the House. The resolution that I move today was largely agreed with the former Leader of the House before the election. The most significant aspect to it is the removal of the provisions of the House that do not allow the use of the broadcast to satirise and ridicule of members of parliament, which was a rule that was more honoured in the breach than kept by various media outlets, particularly the Daily Telegraph. Who can forget the various occasions on which members in this place have been satirised or ridiculed by the Daily Telegraph? Members of parliament need to have thick skins or develop them if they have not got them already. This resolution of the House brings into place the agreements that have been made between the opposition and the government and that were worked on by the joint parliamentary committee over many months. It updates the House to fit the modern understanding of how the media should broadcast the parliament.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (15:23):  I second the motion and welcome the adoption of the resolution, which reflect the rules for media related activity in Parliament House and its precincts that were adopted by the committee and endorsed and tabled by the presiding officers in late 2012. These will now be in force. I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the members of the Joint Standing Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. I want to begin by thanking the honourable member for Chisholm, who chaired the committee in her capacity as Speaker of the House of Representatives. The member for Chisholm is attending parliamentary commitments overseas in the Cook Islands and is unable to speak here today. But I wish to convey to the House her sentiments. I also want to commend her stewardship of the committee and in particular I want to thank her for her dedication and for the focus she showed as chair during the inquiry that the committee conducted into media related activity at Parliament House.


Given the nature of the inquiry, sensitivity and diplomacy were required, especially when dealing with members of the press gallery and representatives of other media outlets, in particular because we were discussing the parameters of media related activity and the usage of footage taken in Parliament House. As such, I would also like to thank other members of the committee, including no less than Senator the Hon. John Hogg, the President of the Senate. I also want to thank the member for Parkes; the member for Fowler; the Hon. John Murphy, the former member for Reid, who is very well known for his keen interest in media related activity in Parliament House; the member for Longman; Senator Stephen Parry; and Senator Lin Thorp.


The inquiry gave the committee the opportunity to look at issues, take evidence and form recommendations to bring the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in line with the changing nature of modern broadcasting requirements and community expectations. We worked in a collegiate and bipartisan manner with a clear view that all the stakeholders, parliament and media, needed to work together to devise the best possible and most workable rules that effectively work in the public interest.


Many thanks need to also go to the following people who served in the secretariat: Mr James Catchpole, who was secretary from 2 October 2012; Siwan Davies, who was secretary until 2 October 2012; and Sonia Palmieri, who served as secretary until 17 December 2012.


In conclusion, the committee has put together a series of rules that reflect the expectations of the stakeholders and that will provide a workable and fair framework in which we can conduct our procedures and interactions. It is a fair balance between preserving the requirements of dignity and privacy while at the same time giving the appropriate access necessary to the press in their cause of reporting and accountability. I commend the rules to the House.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (16:13):  I move:


That the requested amendment be made.


The government has agreed to the proposed amendments by the Greens to repeal the statutory debt limit and amend the Charter of Budget Honesty Act to improve transparency regarding government debt. We have worked together to resolve this issue and provide certainty to the markets about the government's capacity to finance the budget and ancillary debt. We have done this with no thanks to the Labor Party. They created the debt. They have done nothing to find a credible solution to us approaching a binding debt limit of $300 billion. It is just that their legacy is debt that well exceeds $400 billion. Today we are removing the instrument for parliamentary brinkmanship that was introduced by Labor—in fact, by the member for McMahon back in 2008—when they created a legislative limit on debt of $75 billion. So they created the debt, they created the debt limit and now they are trying to prevent us from dealing with their problem. In fact, they are making it worse.


Labor had to increase the debt limit three times, so they introduced a $75 billion limit and said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $200 billion and they said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $250 billion limit and they said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $300 billion limit and brought down a budget that had peak debt of $370 billion, and then tried to prevent us from dealing with it. It was an artificial construct. It was never intended to be a target, but it did end up being a target under Labor. And congratulations to Labor; they hit the target every time.


We have a clear plan to fix the budget and to start paying down Labor's debt. It involves getting rid of the mining tax and associated expenditure of over $13 billion, and we will take that off the debt. We have a plan to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and that immediately prevents us from proceeding with further debt-raising to finance an operation that involves a total of $10 billion of borrowed money.


Even the Labor Party, which have become pious in opposition—not that they were particularly pious in government—have proven just how hypocritical they are. They are seeking to oppose their own savings, which they took to the last election, including $2.3 billion of savings associated with the higher education proposal to fund the Gonski education initiative. The tax cuts that they announced would not be necessary because they were terminating the carbon tax they now want to proceed with. So Labor are not only asking us not to continue with our initiatives, they are voting against their own initiatives, which are all about trying to live within the means.


Today we have also agreed with the Greens on a number of measures to enhance transparency around government debt reporting in the budget papers. In particular there will be a debt statement published in every budget, every Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and every pre-election economic and fiscal outlook.




Mr Danby:
  In bed with the Greens again.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I will come to that in a moment. These debt statements will include information about Commonwealth stock and securities on issue at the time of the report for the financial year to which the report relates and for the following three financial years. They include: the value of Commonwealth stock and securities, including their market and face value and their value as a proportion of GDP; the total expected interest expenses relating to the stock and securities; and a breakdown by maturity and interest payments of the stock and securities on issue at the time of the report. An additional debt statement will also be published should debt increase by $50 billion or more since the last debt statement or additional debt statement was made. These additional debt statements would set out the reasons for the increase in debt, including the extent to which the increase was caused by lower than expected revenue, higher than expected spending, capital purchases and/or, alternatively, grants to state and territory governments for infrastructure. In addition, debt statements and additional debt statements will facilitate a parliamentary debate on government debt. At a minimum a debate will be held twice a year and more often if debt is increasing at a rapid rate.


We commend the Greens for coming to the table with sensible proposals to enhance transparency. Before the member for McMahon gets up to speak I would just remind him of his own words in relation to dealing with the Greens. When he said on Saturday, 'Sitting down and doing a deal with, of all people, the Greens,' he was criticising us. Madam Speaker, I seek an extension.



The SPEAKER:  Under standing order 1 interventions and speeches are limited to five minutes. You are at liberty to seek the floor again if there is no-one from the other side.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I seek the floor again.



The SPEAKER:  Granted.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The member for McMahon is a cracker. The member for McMahon, in 2010, said: 'The Greens are a party who have a very clear policy objective but also a party that you can sit down and discuss policies with.' That is what he said in 2010. And how about this, he said: 'We go into discussions of a very intense nature with the minor parties and there is often brinkmanship to the last minute, but we have found the Greens accommodative to good policy.' So the member for McMahon is the complete hypocrite in any judgement. He is out there saying that it is absolutely ridiculous—



The SPEAKER:  The minister will withdraw that.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry; I am just giving him a free character assessment.



The SPEAKER:  Just withdraw 'hypocrite'.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Hypocrite? He contradicts himself on a regular basis.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  You just asked the Treasurer to withdraw and he did not do so, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Yes, I did. I would ask the honourable Treasurer to withdraw.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I withdraw. The member for McMahon contradicts himself on a regular basis with no underlying principle. He criticises us for doing a deal with the Greens when, in fact, he has recommended doing a deal with the Greens in the past.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley.




Mr HOCKEY:
  This is the same member for McMahon who does not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. Come on! He was actually Treasurer just for a few days, but he does not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. I thought it was a bit of a slip of the tongue; like the time he came into this place and described the Chinese currency as the yen.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  Yes, he did. I know it is hard to believe, but he did. I thought it was just a bit of a slip of the tongue and I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and he did come into this place and talk about the debt limit applying to net debt, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt. I tried with this man; I really tried. Then, when he wrote to me and said that he was going to distribute it to the whole world and talked about net debt being subject to the debt limit, he did not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. I thought, hang on, this guy is not fit to run a tuckshop let alone to run an economy. And, as we know, the member for Watson is over there preying on him.


What we do know is that when it comes to credibility the Labor Party has none. Do you know why they have no credibility? Because they have no principles. Not only do they vote against our savings, they vote against their own savings. Not only do they not know the difference between net debt and gross debt, they created the problem and they are trying to stop us from fixing it. That is the Labor Party way. Here is a tip for a new opposition: you actually have to be a little bit consistent. You actually have to believe in something. I know you believe in debt. I know the Labor Party believes in debt; I know the Labor Party believes in racking up the credit card.


You save him, Tony—good idea. He needs your help like he needs a bullet in the head.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer should be speaking through the chair. He is making terrible allegations against you, unless he is speaking through the chair.



The SPEAKER:  I think I can avoid the effrontery, but I would ask the honourable the Treasurer to speak through the chair.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I will tell you what: there is no way on God's earth the member for Mackellar would do anything other than act responsibly when it comes to debt, handling debt and paying down debt, because the member for Mackellar knows, like every other member who is mature about this sort of debate, that you do not play Russian roulette with a loaded gun when it comes to debt. The Labor Party has been playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun and it has gone bang in their face, because they have been dealt out of the equation by, of all people, the Greens. Now the Greens are proving to be more middle-of-the-road, more responsible, than the Australian Labor Party who have consigned themselves to somewhere way past the Democrats at the bottom of the garden; they have buried themselves along with their lack of credibility when it comes to handling the economy. I would say to the Labor Party: one day, for just one day, have some integrity, have consistency, have some principles—actually, do us a favour and stick to your election promises, especially when it comes to paying down your debt.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:24):  'Stick to your election promises when it comes to paying down the debt.' The Treasurer just said it himself. Apparently the Australian people got it wrong, because when they heard the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer say, 'We'll pay off the debt,' as one of the three fundamental promises, what they really meant was, 'We'll vote with the Greens to get rid of the debt limit.' Remember the Prime Minister on the Bolt interview—and the Manager of Opposition Business very correctly pointed out to the House that you have to work really hard to get a bad interview as a Liberal Prime Minister on the Bolt show—where he said, 'We'll keep the promises we made, not the promises people think we made.' Apparently a promise the people think the Liberal Party made was to pay off the debt. The promise they really made was to vote with the Greens—the economic fringe-dwellers, as the Prime Minister explained—to actually abolish the debt limit, which the then opposition voted against increasing twice, in 2009 and 2012, despite the Prime Minister of Australia standing at that dispatch box and denying it, saying 'We never voted against increases to the debt limit.' They twice voted against increases to the debt limit in this House and/or the other house.


What we are seeing today is the hypocrisy of a party which is voting with another party, which they described as economic fringe-dwellers—those are not my words; they are the Prime Minister's words—to get rid of Australia's debt limit. This is a Treasurer and a Prime Minister who said before the election, 'We have a budget emergency on our hands.' And what have they done since? The Treasurer has given $9 billion to the Reserve Bank—




Mr Hockey:
  Given!




Mr BOWEN:
  Yes, that is right, Treasurer; that is what you did. He storms out of the chamber, shaking his head. The fact of the matter is that he has given $9 billion to the Reserve Bank, which increases this year's deficit and increases our interest bill by $1 billion over the next four years. He borrowed money and gave it to the Reserve Bank. They watered down Labor's tax integrity measures and made changes to support people with more than $2 million in their superannuation accounts. Those are this government's priorities—all things which increase the deficit and increase the debt. So what do we see? We see the Treasurer asking for an increase in the debt limit, first to half a trillion dollars. That was his first act, and he acted surprised and hurt that the opposition did not just say, 'We know you said you'd pay off the debt, but, if you want half a trillion dollars, that's all right.' No—it does not work that way. What happens is: you have to justify it. On each occasion when the former government asked the House for an increase to the debt limit, it was justified by a budget or an economic statement—on every single occasion. Not once did the member for Lilley, the then Treasurer, come into the chamber and say, 'By the way, I need an increase in the debt limit and I'll show you the figures later'—not once, because that is the wrong thing to do. You justify yourself to the parliament by releasing the midyear economic forecast and a statement, but what we see is the new Treasurer saying, 'I need half a trillion dollars and I'll show you the paperwork later.' Australia's biggest no-doc loan—that is what the Treasurer wants.


The Treasurer found that he could not get that through the parliament because the Greens' position then was that an increase of $200 million was not justified. Now their position is that we do not need a debt limit at all. So the Greens have had a change of position over the last few weeks. That is okay; political parties are allowed to do that. But the biggest change of all is from the government, which told the Australian people solemnly that they would pay off the debt. The Treasurer had a chance to explain. He said, 'You've got to let us fix up the mess,' as he calls it; 'You've got to let us fix the debt.' So his position is: 'We've got to get rid of the debt limit to pay off the debt.' He has not explained the internal inconsistency in that little equation: 'We've got to pay off the debt, so we'll get rid of the debt limit.' Well, I think there are Liberal voters around Australia scratching their heads, thinking: 'Is this really the government we voted for? Is this really the government that promised to pay off the debt and said that we are open for business; the same Treasurer who showed that we are open for business by knocking back a foreign investment application—




Ms Rowland:
  The national interest.




Mr BOWEN:
  in the national interest—and who said, 'We need more foreign investment, so I'm going to knock this one back,' to paraphrase the Treasurer? The Treasurer is a cracker. He said, 'We need more foreign investment, so I'm going to knock one back, and we need to pay off the debt so we'll get rid of the debt limit.' This sort of stuff catches up with you, and it will catch up with the Treasurer, because he seems to think it is a matter of pride that they are voting to get rid of the debt limit. He is very proud of it and the fact that he has done a deal with the Greens. He thinks that is an achievement for him. I beg to differ. I think it shows a complete lack of integrity on behalf of this government. (Time expired)

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-09,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:29):  I rise to speak in support of these amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, which have their genesis in amendments moved by the Greens in the Senate. They will lead to a more sensible discussion about debt in this country. I was listening very closely to what the member for McMahon said. Far too often in this chamber, now and over previous years, we have seen the unfortunate case of Labor trying to out-Liberal the Liberals, sometimes on refugees and in this instance on debt. Every time that Labor try and turn the issue of debt or the issue of refugees to their political advantage, it comes back to bite the progressives. There can be no clearer instance than with the issue of debt.


In the last parliament, every time the question of debt came up we watched the opposition, as they then were, stand up and berate the government about the level of debt that had been incurred. In all of that there was not one single sensible argument about why it was that we had that debt in the first place. Of course there was a thing called the global financial crisis and there was a need to borrow to spend to ensure that Australia did not go into recession. The Greens supported that because it was the right thing to do. As a result, the country incurred debt. Even after incurring that debt, Australia still has a remarkably good position in OECD countries on both net and gross debt.


Separately, if you come from the progressive side of politics then generally you would think it is a good place to mount the argument that governments, especially the Australian government at the moment, should be quite happy to take advantage of the relatively cheap money that is on offer at the moment to borrow to fund the infrastructure that this country needs to set itself up for the 21st century. Maybe instead of having pieces of legislation that say maybe we will or will not do something about high-speed rail in five or 10 years time, we could actually get on with the job of building it—if people were prepared to have a sensible discussion about debt. In part because of the creation of this artificial debt limit which Labor supported, we end up in this situation where we miss having a sensible discussion about debt and, instead, all debt is apparently evil.


Anyone will tell you that there is a difference between the mortgage and the credit card. If you are borrowing to fund some long-term infrastructure, to fund something that at the end of the day is going to be useful to you, or if you are borrowing in the short-term term to meet some speed bumps or some even bigger challenges like we saw in the global financial crisis, then that is a good thing. But if what you are doing is extending the credit card limit just to meet your expenditure, then it is not a good thing. Most people would understand that and that is the discussion we need to have with the Australian people. If we routinely beat each other over the head about a number without any sensible debate over what the money is actually being spent on we are going to get into the worst discussion in this country. Ultimately, if and when Labor gets back into power, it is going to hurt them even more. I suspect there are many on the Labor side of politics who are quietly happy that this has happened because they know that when they get back into power it will make their life easier—if they choose to stop trying to out-Liberal the Liberals and instead say, 'Yes, it is a good thing to borrow to fund the infrastructure that this country needs.'


I am very proud of the transparency measures that we have secured, and they are timely too. As we head towards the budget, what is clear from the national account figures that have been released is that as mining investment comes off the boil there are many places in Australia and sectors in the Australian economy that are now reliant on government spending to keep them going. Now we have removed one of the last hurdles in the way to the Treasurer stimulating the economy, there will be no excuse for savage budget cuts in May, and we will not support them.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:34):  It has become clear this afternoon that the Treasurer bear hugs the Greens that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection rejects. On one day we have on one side of the chamber the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection rejecting the Greens and talking about all the heinous things the Greens do. The minute those opposite need to get a deal through they suddenly welcome the Greens with open arms and cannot believe that they have got the opportunity to do this type of deal. It is unbelievable for the Greens to think that this will lead to a bold new era of transparency. I would hate to actually have them, by their own actions, reinforce the view that that they are economic fringe dwellers—but their own actions will do that if they think this government is committed to transparency.


There was a simple proposition extended by us to those opposite, to those in government, which was we will support an increase in the debt ceiling to $400 billion. If those opposite want to go beyond that then be transparent, table MYEFO and let the public know the state of the books. That was the simple test of transparency that they refused to meet. When will they table MYEFO? They will table it next week. When? After the Australian parliament goes into recess for the break. The Greens are all after transparency but not if it actually involves the most official document, which is MYEFO.


This is not really about transparency, this is not about being upfront, this is not about having a conversation—that well worn phrase—with people about debt; this is about one thing and one thing only. It is about Joe Hockey, the Treasurer, avoiding coming back here to explain that all the bravado and all of the bluster that they engaged in pre-election cannot be matched by post election performance. They are unable to demonstrate why, when they said that if debt is the problem then more debt is not the answer, they cannot deliver a strain of logic that actually says why this is the case.


While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has to sit here on his own, defending the case of the government, it is very hard—and I am sure he could come up with lots of reasons. In fact, I reckon he could come up with 93 reasons that could try and help him justify this deal to the parliament! He is unable to, because they all know, with a red face—



An opposition member:  Don't pick on Barnaby.




Mr HUSIC:
  I will not pick on the agriculture minister. But, frankly, they know what we know and had to deal with for quite some time: national incomes across the globe are contracting. Economies are not growing. Monetary policy is not giving the same kick that it once did. As a result, budgets come under pressure—as ours have for many years, and as they know theirs will, which is why they will not release MYEFO. So, in an effort to avoid actually admitting to people that their bluster before the election on surpluses—because remember, Madam Speaker, those on that side of the chamber made a commitment that they would get to surplus in one year—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  One year, they said, Member for McEwen. They said they would get to surplus in one year. And when did they ditch that promise? They ditched it in the quiet of January this year. When no-one was really paying attention, they moved away.




Mr Bowen:
  They meant 'one year' like 'one day'.




Mr HUSIC:
  One year, one day—




Ms Rowland:
  Like dog years!




Mr HUSIC:
  Exactly—it gets measured in a quantum that we mere mortals cannot understand! But they have been dragged to economic realism, and yet they will not be up-front with people about the reasons they need to increase the debt ceiling. It is outrageous that, in this last-ditch effort, as the shadow Treasurer indicated, their way of getting rid of debt is to lift the debt ceiling. It is preposterous logic. It does not sit at all well with the rhetoric used before the election, and they should be explaining fully why they are going to this position. And they should not just back it up with words. They should back it up with the numbers contained in MYEFO, and they should do it this week.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:39):  It is quite extraordinary to stand in this debate on the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2013 and to have listened to the contributions from Labor members opposite on how debt was a problem under the coalition and how the Australian people needed to be vigilant and on guard, and how it was in the national interest for the Australian Labor Party to stand opposed to the deal that is being done between the coalition and the new economic centrists—certainly, relative to the Labor Party—the Greens! Members of the public up in the gallery were probably scratching their heads as they heard the Australian Labor Party start to lecture the Australian people on the dangers of debt. This is the Australian Labor Party! Let us not ever forget the track record of Labor, because if you had only tuned in to the last 10 minutes you would have thought: 'Well, they seem reasonable. The solution to debt is not more debt—that seems to be a reasonable comment to make.' And if you did not know that the Australian Labor Party was the party that presided over the most significant deterioration in Australia's debt position in our history, and if you did not know that the Australian Labor Party inherited $45 billion of net assets and turned that $45 billion into a mountain of over $400 billion worth of debt, you might think they had a skerrick of credibility. But, in a continuation of form for the Australian Labor Party, we know that they will say absolutely anything if it happens to suit their argument at any given point in time.


I heard the shadow parliamentary secretary turn around and make comments about how the coalition was being dragged to economic realism and I heard him start to criticise the coalition, saying that we promised there would be a surplus. Again, if I cast my mind back, it was only about six months ago that we heard the Australian Labor Party promise, on over 600 separate occasions, that they were going to deliver an economic surplus. We recall the way they completely bastardised the Australian company tax collection system when they turned around and said, 'We're going to change from quarterly PAYG to making sure that it is paid monthly.' Why did they do it? They did it for one reason and one reason alone: the Australian Labor Party did it because it was all part of their phoney campaign to try to get back to surplus. And after Prime Minister Rudd, and Prime Minister Gillard, and Prime Minister Rudd, and Treasurer Swan, and Treasurer Bowen, we saw the Australian Labor Party left in a situation where, after promising on over 600 occasions that they were going to deliver a budget surplus, they actually delivered a nearly $31 billion deficit.


The Australian people are not fools, I am pleased to say. They see straight through this lot opposite. And I am very pleased to stand on the track record of the coalition, time and time again, because our track record—and I say this for the benefit of the members opposite—is a good track record. We have paid down Labor's debt before and we will pay down Labor's debt again. And if that means that we have to take hard decisions, and if that means that we have to make responsible decisions, then the coalition will always step up to the plate. That is the reason the Australian people thoroughly rejected the Australian Labor Party at the last election. They rejected you because they know you will say and do anything, members of the Australian Labor Party. These kinds of silly games from the Australia Labor Party just underscore why the Australian people know that the cupboard is bare when it comes to genuine policy decision making.


So I say to the Australian Labor Party: get with the times. It is a bad strategy, Australian Labor Party, when you are outflanked in the centre ground by the Australian Greens. So if that does not send you a message, members of the Australian Labor Party, I do not know how on earth you are ever going to get the message. But I would say to you: the signs are there. You do not need a crystal ball to gaze in; you do not need to try to read the tea leaves. All the signs are there, members of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian electorate rejected you. You have got a mountain of debt of over $400 billion. And now you have the Australian Greens being the sensible centre. So read those cryptic clues and see what you can come up with. (Time expired)

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:44):  I was loath to raise a point of order while the member for Moncrieff kept failing to refer his remarks through the chair, because I do enjoy that speech from the member for Moncrieff. I enjoyed it the first time I heard it and I have continued to enjoy it on each subsequent occasion that we have heard that speech. The thing that we hear time and time again, in the refrain from everybody on that side, is that they are not doing what they told the Australian people they would do. We went through that debate last week with respect to education. We go through that debate repeatedly in the vast gulf between what the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection promised and what he is doing now.


But I do not think there is an example more clear to the Australian people than when the same people who were railing against debt and railing against deals with the Greens then do a deal with the Greens for unlimited debt. I do not think you can get a quinella quite like that when it comes to what is being done by the government. I heard one of my favourite lines from the member for Moncrieff in his speech and I enjoy it every time he gives it. He says that they have to 'make the hard decisions'. Unlimited debt is hardly a hard decision. Unlimited debt is avoiding future hard decisions. Unlimited debt means they are just going to remove any level of public restraint and debate into the future. Then they say how proud they are that they managed to do a deal with the Greens.


I am disappointed, obviously, to see that they have been so willing to jump in and team up with the Greens. When the House divides on this motion, we will see the Greens sitting side by side with members of the coalition, and that is a decision for them. But for those opposite to pretend that it was really hard to get the Greens to agree with unlimited debt is really missing the point of basically every public debate that we have had on debt issues over the last few years. What is not lost on the Australian people is that the Prime Minister himself said that you should not do cheap and tawdry deals with the Greens. Well, I concede that this one might be tawdry, but it ain't cheap. There is nothing cheap about this deal at all. Those opposite told people that they would turn around the figures and start delivering surplus—they would shift from deficit to surplus. If you go to surplus, what occurs? Debt starts to go down. Yet they, on the economic pathway they have now chosen, know that they are heading down a path where, under their government, debt year on year will become higher. That is the pathway they have chosen and that is why the action they have taken now is for debt to be unlimited. Unlimited debt is the pathway that those opposite have chosen.


They are so desperate to say that, even though it has happened since they have been in office, the continued increases are somehow Labor debt. Those opposite need to recognise: they are in government now, which means what happens on their watch is their responsibility. As debt goes up, it becomes their responsibility. The final record that was the responsibility of those on this side of the House was reflected in the pre-election fiscal outlook. The Charter of Budget Honesty, which Peter Costello used to back in and which those opposite used to support, did not require the figures to go to a half a trillion dollars. But there is nothing like the hypocrisy of going from bringing the debt down, to needing it to go to half a trillion dollars, to then saying, as those opposite do, that they want debt to be unlimited.


As the shadow Treasurer held up that ad last week, I think it struck a chord with people when they could see next to the Prime Minister the words that he would reduce the debt—and now we have the sheer hypocrisy of their not merely saying they will not reduce it and not merely saying they want to take it to a half a trillion dollars but saying the sky is the limit. Unlimited debt is now what those opposite want, which is the exact opposite of what they told the Australian people they would do. On issue after issue, be it education, their handling of immigration issues or debt, they are a government who say one thing and do the exact opposite. (Time expired)

Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (16:49):  The last thing this House needs is a lecture on budgetary matters from fiscal pygmies. That is what those people on the opposite side are: they are fiscal pygmies. They are the group who have taken this country from being in the black to facing an absolute fiscal nightmare after five to six years. We are the ones trying to clean up this mess. Each and every day we open a cupboard to another budgetary skeleton. Those people sit over on the other side of the chamber with a great sense of commitment to their cause, when we are the ones trying to clean it up.


They slid money out of education and spent three to four years of the infrastructure forward estimates in the first year, leaving nothing in the cupboard. They then come to this place and, even after the evidence of officials from Treasury at Senate estimates, refuse to accept the fact that we need to increase the debt ceiling. We would not need to have this debate right now if the Labor Party had decided to do what was in the best interests of the country, upon the advice of senior officials, and taken the debt limit to the $500 billion that was proposed. But, no, they want to take advantage of the political environment. They want to be political opportunists. They want to do absolutely anything they can to be economic vandals. They continue to be economic vandals in this place and it is an absolute disgrace. So do not lecture us on debt. Yours is the party that has taken us into fiscal oblivion.


We are comfortable on this side of the House with the Charter of Budget Honesty and the agreement that has been made between this side of the House and the Australian Greens to get us through this period. We have no qualms with that because we have nothing to hide. When it comes to the Charter of Budget Honesty, we have nothing to hide. You are the guys who are absolutely useless when it comes to managing Australia's finances.


They are the party that after six years took a country with money in the bank and no interest payments on debt to one now with in excess of $400 billion in debt and $10 billion in interest payments. They think it is funny, but it happened on their watch. It happened on their watch in six short years. They need to admit the fact that that is what occurred.




Dr Leigh:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Is the member for Braddon willing to give way?




Mr WHITELEY:
  No. The debt limit is a construct of the Australian Labor Party. Let's not forget that this was brought in in 2008. Let's keep in mind that at that point we had no debt, as a legacy of the Howard-Costello government. We had money in the bank. We were in a super position fiscally. In 2008 the Australian Labor Party came to this place on the back of the perception of a new superhero fiscal conservative in Mr Rudd—and what did we see? The first debt limit was set at $75 billion. Then they asked, 'Mr Bank Manager, can I have more?' It then went to $200 billion. Then they asked, 'Mr Bank Manager, can I have more?' It went to $250 billion. It went on and on. Thank goodness the Australian people spoke so loudly on 7 September and said, 'Enough is enough. We need to get the finances of this country back under control.'


What is absolutely ironic about this is that at the start of this whole process, when this bill was first introduced by the Treasurer, those on the opposite side were offered briefings. They refused to have them. The dead giveaway, when the Treasurer was bringing this matter to a conclusion today with his speech earlier, was that the accused, the shadow Treasurer, could not face the prosecutor. That is always a dead giveaway. He sat there. He twirled in his seat. His eyeballs rolled around in their sockets. He could not look the Treasurer in the eye. The Treasurer nailed him. The shadow Treasurer left a massive black hole. He left skeletons and black spiders in every cupboard. We are here now to declare, 'We will clean up the mess.' But those opposite should not stand in our way. The Greens have come to an agreement with us to make sure that we can continue to pay the bills when the time comes in the very near future. It is about time that those on the opposite side woke up to themselves, because they are nothing but economic pygmies.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:09):  I move:


That the further amendments, including an amendment of the title, be agreed to.


Madam Speaker, if you ever needed a more clear demonstration of how the Australian Labor Party have dealt themselves out of this debate, of how the Australian Labor Party have lost any credibility at all when it comes to this debate, then you just saw it when the Greens and the two Independents walked to this side of the chamber. By walking from there to this side of the chamber, they demonstrated that they were willing to put economic orthodoxy on the table. It stands in contrast to the new economic fringe dwellers, which is the Australian Labor Party. 


I have heard members of the Australian Labor Party claim repeatedly that they could not understand why the debt ceiling of more than $400 billion needed to go. They did not understand why there needed to be a debt ceiling of $500 billion, which was of course the first call that the coalition made. The reason—and it is really not that complicated—is that, as was attested to by members of the Australian Labor Party, peak debt under Labor was forecast to reach $370 billion. We know from the tabled Australian Office of Financial Management minute that you need a $60 billion buffer. Let me go very slowly through it for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party: 370 plus 60 equals 430. I will break it down again: 370 plus 60 equals 430. So there you go, Madam Speaker, there is the great riddle that the Australian Labor Party cannot work out. 


When the Australian Labor Party say with their hands on their heart, 'Oh, we only want it to go up to $400 billion,' let them now understand why. It is because 370 plus 60 equals 430. So I say to the Australian Labor Party that is the reason your $400 billion was nothing other than a political gimmick and that is the reason we walked away from it. When we could not get any agreement from the Australian Labor Party, we spoke to the Greens—and guess what? The Greens were the sensible ones who were willing to recognise the best way forward and what was clearly in Australia's national interest. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  I now hear Labor members opposite repeatedly making remarks, 'But that's not until 2016.' The extraordinary thing is that Labor still does not get it. They still think it is acceptable to simply kick the can down the road. 



Mr Danby interjecting—



Mr Sukkar interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Melbourne Ports will desist. The member for Deakin will also desist.




Mr CIOBO:
  Labor still thinks it is acceptable to say: 'We'll deal with that down the track. We don't want to deal with it now.' I say to members of the Australian Labor Party that that might be how Labor governs but that is not how the coalition governs. That is not our approach. We are not prepared to kick the can down the road. We want to deal with the issue once and we want to deal with it in a way that provides certainty to the economic markets and that does not invite in the kind of Tea Party politics that the Australian Labor Party so warmly embrace. 


I never really thought that the member for Melbourne Ports would necessarily be someone who would embrace Tea Party politics, but he is. Like all the members of the Australian Labor Party, he is willing to jeopardise Australia's national interest on short-term political opportunism. So, for that reason, we were willing to talk to anybody else who was willing to put the national interest first. Lo and behold, the Greens were willing to put Australia's national interest first—and that stands in contrast to the Labor Party. 


What the Senate has proposed and what we have agreed on with the Greens is a number of measures to enhance transparency around government debt reporting in the budget papers—in particular, there will be a debt statement published in every budget, in every Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and in every pre-election economic and fiscal outlook. In addition, the debt statements will include information about Commonwealth stock and securities on issue at the time of the report for the financial year to which the report relates and for the following three financial years; the value of the Commonwealth's stock and securities, including the market and face value and their value as a proportion of GDP; the total expected interest expenses relating to the stock and securities; and a breakdown by maturity interest payments of the stock and securities on issue at the time of the report. An additional debt statement would also be published should debt increase by $50 billion or more since the last debt statement or additional statement was made. 


The amendments that have been put forward are good amendments. The Senate recognises these amendments in a spirit of putting Australia's national interest first, of advancing our national interest and of providing certainty and stability, which stands in contrast to the juvenile approach that we have seen from the Australian Labor Party.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:14):  What an extraordinary contribution from the member for Moncrieff. We have heard it about four times already in this debate. Frankly, taking a lecture from those opposite, particularly from the member for Moncrieff, on political obstruction and opportunism is like taking a lecture from Ronnie Biggs on train safety. It really is. Their approach in the 43rd Parliament was to say no to everything. Even when it was consistent with their own policy, they said no to everything. They said no, whether it was about assisting the government to find savings through measures like putting an indexation on the private health insurance rebate—they talk about debt; well, they could have done some things when we were in government to assist in dealing with the issue of debt—or whether it was, as the member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out so many times, their belligerent approach when it came to the people transfer agreement with Malaysia. So taking a lecture from those opposite on the issue of obstructionism is really a little bit too much to take.


This bill, the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2013, is an extraordinary bill, which is why members on this side of the House cannot support it. It is extraordinary that the members on that side of the House would be speaking in favour of it, because, not three months ago, they were all standing in front of billboards and waving pamphlets around, saying, 'We will reduce the debt.'




Dr Leigh:
  Where is the debt truck now?




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Where is the debt truck now? The government members have gone from being the party of no debt to the party of no debt limit. I cannot understand why they are willing to stand there and speak in favour of this bill. It is Buzz Lightyear economics: 'To infinity and beyond!' We are all looking for Woody to make an appearance in this debate! They have only got themselves to blame. They would like to sheet home all of the blame to us on this side of the House, when we did the right thing by the country and we did the right thing by the parliament during the global financial crisis. Yes, we were willing to put the budget into the red to ensure that businesses stayed open and that people stayed in work. It was the right thing to do by the economy. It was the right thing to do by the nation. We got no assistance from those opposite, yet they come in here and complain to us about obstruction.


We might be able to take them a bit more seriously if, when they came back into government, they had done the right thing by the budget. But what was their first act? What was their first act when they came back into government? It was to give an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank. That is right—an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank, no strings attached. Yet they come in here and they complain about debt. Well, there is a fair bit of debt that was racked up on their own watch. They have only got themselves to blame.


From looking at what is in the chute, we believe the debt is actually going to get worse. What have the government's first acts been, on regaining the treasury bench? They have given a tax hike to low-superannuation earners and a tax cut to high-superannuation earners—an increase for high-superannuation earners. They have denied themselves a revenue stream. They like to take the fun out of the minerals resource rent tax, which is a growth tax: the tax increases when profits increase and decreases when profits are flat. But one of their first acts in government is to bring a bill into parliament to reduce the government's capacity to raise revenue in the future. It would seem that, if you want a tax cut in this country today, you have to own a mine. You can see where their priorities are. In fact, if you want help with your school expenses, your name has to be George Brandis. You can see where their priorities are and who they are looking after.


Those opposite puff up their chests and talk about the great deal that they have been able to do with the Greens. You can see how tough those negotiations must have been, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta! 'Dear Senator, I'm here; I want to ensure that we have no brakes on debt into the future, no debt limit.' You can imagine that that negotiation went on for weeks and weeks! We on this side of the House oppose the legislation. It is the right thing to do by the country.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:19):  In August this year, the then opposition leader, Mr Abbott, launched a stinging attack on the Greens political party. He said they had 'fringe' economic policies. When asked about his decision to put the Greens party last in all Liberal preferences, he said he was making a 'captain's call'. Mr Abbott said:


There is a world of difference between the Greens and as far as I'm aware just about everyone else who is contesting this election … because everyone else in this campaign supports economic growth and supports a more prosperous economy.


He was then asked, if he disliked the Greens so much, whether it had been a mistake to preference the Greens over Labor in 2010, thereby ensuring that the current member for Melbourne won that seat. Mr Abbott waved his hands and said:


That was then, this is now.


And 'that was then, this is now' is a good summation of where we have ended up in this debate. Back then, the Greens were 'fringe economic dwellers' that were on the extremes of Australian politics. Now we see the Greens literally sitting on the front benches in a division moments ago. Back then, if debt was the problem, more debt was not the solution. Now it turns out that an uncapping of the debt limit is exactly what Australia needs; the right medicine for Australia is unlimited debt! We are seeing what I think is best summed up in the words of Mr Abbott himself:


… a litany of betrayals, of broken promises, of disappointed hopes …


If, before the election, the then opposition had gone to the people and said, 'We think that the real problem is debt and our policy is going to be to strike a deal with the Greens to remove the debt limit,' I think people would have voted a little differently.


Of course, it is not the only broken promise that we have seen from this government. They have been in office for only a matter of months, but already we have seen them break their promise to bring down a budget update within 100 days. We might not have needed to have this debate at all if that promise had not been broken by the Treasurer—if that 100-day limit had not been broken. We are now pushing into December, a period well beyond where Labor ever went in releasing the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We have seen the government breaking their pledge that no public servants would be fired, breaking their pledge that there would be no adverse changes to superannuation arrangements, breaking their pledge to the schoolchildren of Australia that they are on a unity ticket in education and breaking the pledge that there would be a boat buyback. It is passing strange that just before the election Mr Abbott said, in an interview with the doyenne of the Press Gallery, Michelle Grattan:


… you should move heaven and earth to keep commitments … and only if keeping commitments becomes almost impossible could you ever be justified in not keeping them … And I suspect the electorate would take a very dim view even in those circumstances.



Let us apply Mr Abbott's test to what has happened today. Is it impossible not to keep the opposition's pledge to bring down debt? Not at all. The Labor Party would have been very happy to support a $400 billion debt cap which allows a $30 billion buffer in 2016-17, when debt is expected to peak. But, if the government believes that the situation has changed—if they believe that debt is peaking higher—then they can bring down the budget update and be very clear with the Australian people about what has shifted. Has the $9 billion to the Reserve Bank—the thimble and pea trick which says, 'We'll give you $9 billion now so that we can pull out a bigger dividend later—had an impact? Has the $17 billion of tax cuts to mining billionaires and big polluters had an impact on the budget? It is important that the people of Australia are not put in the position of Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey suggesting that this is somehow Labor's debt. The people of Australia are entitled to see whether the budget has deteriorated in this government's time in office. We have seen disappointing consumer confidence numbers out today suggesting that all is not well under this government. We have seen closed economy decisions on foreign investment— (Time expired)

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2013-12-09,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (17:24):  In response, I would like to speak about the fact that it is Labor's debt, and I would like to discuss where it came from. It is very clear to me that the money has already been spent. This is the reason the debt cap needs to be increased and, as the amendment has come back, to be deleted—to have no debt ceiling. Quite simply, the money was spent on things like school halls. I have been to many locations, up to 100, where the school hall was replicated side-by-side with one which they already had. When I said, 'Why do you have a second school hall exactly the same as the other one?' they said, 'We were told we had to spend the money; we didn't have a choice.' That is not the way we do business on this side of the House and it is certainly the way business should not be done, but I will give them some credit. In areas like Tara, Miles and St George, where there was absolutely nothing, where there was no local community facility, there was some benefit. But in the many hundreds of coastal locations there were literally thousands of replications, whether they be libraries or other BER projects. The very first school project I went to I said to the construction company, 'Are you sure this cost $2 million?' They said, 'Absolutely: design and construct project,' I said, 'How many do you have?' They said, 'Ten,' I said, 'What do you have to do?' They said, 'Same again.' I asked, 'What about the design component?' They answered, 'That's fine; we covered that in the original quotation, no problems at all.' It cost hundreds of millions of dollars.


Just because somebody sends your credit card in the mail, that does not mean you necessarily have to fill it. Just because we have an option to use the money, that does not mean that we are going to spend it. We are not the United States. This is Australia, and this is the Australian parliament.


I sat in this place in recent weeks as a new member of the House. I continue to hear from those opposite how they represent the union movement. I am more interested to hear what it is that they intend to do for their electorates. Over and over they say that they represent the unions; that they represent the workers. I find it absolutely outrageous that they would indicate to those on this side of the House that they do not fairly represent all people because I am a worker. That is exactly where I come from. I hold a trade qualification. I work on a farm. I also have a degree in engineering. I represent people equally. That is why we are here and that is why I am on this side of the House and sit with the Nationals—because the Nationals are for regional Australia. That is what we are about.


I would like to talk briefly about a gentleman called Craig van Rooyen, who is an immigrant to this country. He came through with the correct process. It took years to arrive and they work hard. They have a lychee farm in my electorate of Hinkler. They were the people who broke the story on backpacker cheques. You may recall a story in The Australian during the election campaign. Mr van Rooyen came to me and said, 'How is it possible that I have a cheque for a backpacker who has not worked at this location for two years, yet they get a cheque for $900?' That is an absolute waste, yet it continues.


The house insulation scheme: as an electrician I think it was criminal. People lost their lives because of that project. They should be very careful about what it is that they put forward because it was clearly poorly-planned. There was evidence provided to people in this place, and they knew that over and over people with no training were put at risk in areas where they should not have been—and some lost their lives. It is time that people on this side of the House recognise that those opposite are not interested in what we do for Australia. What we do here is in the best interests of all people in our electorates—not just union members, not just workers but all people in the electorate. I look forward to the process where this legislation goes through the Senate and we can get on with the business of running this country.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (17:29):  There are many examples of this government saying one thing before the election and doing something completely different after the election. There are plenty of examples we could point to, but nothing is more stark than this, where before the election the government said they were going to reduce debt. They went around telling everyone they were going to be responsible and reduce debt. Then, not more than four sittings weeks in, they are asking this parliament to pass an unlimited cap on debt—no debt ceiling whatsoever.


The now Treasurer said during the election campaign that he would like to ensure there was less debt and that more debt does not reduce debt. It seems kind of odd for him to change his tune within four sitting weeks. I imagine that the Australian people are scratching their heads. Before the election he said, 'Reduce the debt,' but after the election he says, 'Give us a licence to have as much debt as we possibly can.'


I think the Australian people would be scratching their heads not only over that backflip but also about the Liberal Party now courting the Greens for their economic policy. Before the election, there was a lot of criticism on any occasion that the Greens voted with the Labor Party, despite the Liberal Party voting with the Greens on numerous occasions—for example, to trash the Malaysia solution, which was a responsible solution in relation to asylum seekers. In public, with their megaphones, they were saying, 'Don't trust the Greens. The Greens have irresponsible economic policies.' Indeed, Tony Abbott described the Greens as the fringe dwellers of economic policy. But today we see once again the Liberal Party doing a complete U-turn and courting the Greens to support their irresponsible economic policy.


Let us be clear about why we are in a position where the Liberal Party have had to court the Greens. It is because the Greens and the Liberal Party actually do not want to talk about where the debt is coming from. All Labor asked was, 'Just be honest—why do you need this increase?' Since the election, we have had the Liberals spending a lot of money in a lot of areas. They are secretly spending it—in terms of the Reserve Bank—and not wanting to be transparent with the Australian people about where the debt is coming from and why they now need unlimited debt. Into the future, they also want to continue hiding and not come back to this parliament to report on why they need more debt. So it is not surprising now that we see the fringe dwellers—I am talking about what Tony Abbott called the Greens—getting on with the Liberals and voting for this.


But we still see the Liberal Party having an incoherent economic message. We see them wanting to abolish the debt ceiling while at the same time refusing to recognise why the spending was required during the global financial crisis. They fail to recognise that the then Treasurer, the member for Lilley, received the 'world's best Treasurer' award for the way he dealt with the global financial crisis, ensuring that Australians kept on working.


While it was the priority of the previous, Labor government to put jobs at No. 1, over the last few days we have seen constantly that the Liberal Party will refuse to put jobs at No. 1. They are happy to see jobs in my electorate and in my state of South Australia, and indeed in the southern states and right across Australia, go by the wayside. This government has no narrative. Increase debt, but do not focus on jobs. Jobs are not a critical component for this government. They refuse to protect jobs in this economy.


I call on the government to reconsider this. It is irresponsible and the hypocrisy is quite rank in terms of their dirty deal with the Greens. (Time expired)

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2013-12-09,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:34):  It is time that we reflect on financial management. I am not here to cast aspersions across the House about whose fault it is. Let us have a look at where we are and how we got to this point. There was a time not that long ago when Australia was not in debt. We walked into a financial crisis globally, and there was an argument for a legitimate stimulus package. But now the challenge is how we lift ourselves up into the future.


Debt has a place. It has a place in business. I have run a small business and I have used debt. Debt can be constructive, but it can also be an inhibitor. The question is not so much whether we want to increase our debt limit; the question is, 'What are we doing it for?' and then working out what we are going to do into the future. We have a situation where we have to walk a balance between a level of austerity and a level of confidence in the Australian economy. I am a strong believer that debt can play a part, but I am also a strong believer that a government should send a signal to its population that it can live within its means. Our ambition as members of the new government is to live within our means to send a signal to the Australian people that our government can live within its means.


However, in the very short term we find ourselves in a situation where we will need to invest and drive productivity across the country, and doing that is going to require capital. It is going to require capital that is not just going to come from the tax revenues of Australians; it is going to require some foreign capital, and that is the reason we have had to expand the debt limit. To have this argument that somehow the coalition government is not, in the long term, going to live within its means and that, therefore, asking for an increase in the debt limit means the government is going to go from a $300 billion debt to a $500 billion debt and then just keep racking it up, I think, misses the point. The point is that governments need to ambitiously aim to spend the taxpayer revenue effectively. They need to ambitiously aim to live within their means. But there are times when we are turning the corner that we need to keep a level of confidence in the economy and we need to borrow. This is the reason.


When looking at whether the coalition government should have done a deal with the Greens, the situation was this: the argument that we were going to hit the debt ceiling of $300 billion and go through it did not appear to be resonating with the Labor Party. They had a political imperative and saw that they could somehow score some points here. We put the argument to the Greens that there was a practical imperative here and that we needed to borrow more money to keep confidence in the economy and after that we could begin the process of living within our means and eventually paying back that debt. But this is a long-term project. This is not something that is going to happen in one year; it is going to take a number of years. I hope that both sides of the political sphere will see the sense in that.


Anyone in small business knows that there are times that you have to borrow. But there are always times when you have to pay it back. This is a time when we need to cut through that threshold. But our ambition and our stated aim—backed by our past history as a coalition government through the Howard years—is to pay back the debt. But we have to instil confidence in the Australian economy to do that.


This is good fiscal management. It is not about scoring points and playing political games; it is not about saying, 'You racked up debt'; 'We didn't rack up debt'; 'You can't be trusted'; 'No, you can't be trusted.' This is about what is in the best interests of Australia. We have challenges ahead. We have a slowing global economy. We have to make sure that we have a high level of confidence. To do that, we will borrow. But our stated aim is to get back to a situation in which the total expenditure of this government is less than the total tax revenue. Hopefully, some common sense will be seen on both sides of the House, and particularly on the Labor Party side, about the reason we needed to make that deal. The challenge is immense. But with strong fiscal management we can do it. Debt has a place. But ultimately debt has to be paid back.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:39):  The position taken by the government in this debate is utterly bizarre and, I must say, somewhat hypocritical, because some 3½ months ago, those opposite were gallivanting around the country campaigning vehemently against debt. They were saying that the debt level in Australia was much too high. They were driving around with a big truck with numbers ticking over saying that this country's debt was ticking up every minute and every second and it was out of control, when in fact the situation was that Australia had a very reasonable level of debt and one that was the envy of most of the Western world and most advanced nations when comparing it to their fiscal positions.


It is a fact that Australia has a level of debt. But we need to be conscious of why we have a debt position at the moment. It is because in 2007 the world was hit by the global financial crisis. Australia was not immune. We are an open, global based economy. We were affected by the global financial crisis. It affected growth, it affected consumption and, most importantly, it affected projections for growth within our economy. There was a very big risk that Australians would be forced out of work and that small businesses would be affected, as has occurred in Europe—and we have all seen the carnage that has been wrought by debt crises in Europe—and in the United States. But the Australian government acted swiftly and decisively to prime our economy to ensure that demand continued. To do that, we needed to take out a level of debt. That debt was spent on productive infrastructure and on creating and protecting jobs in our economy.


Examples of that productive infrastructure are well known in my state of New South Wales. If you drive up the Pacific Highway, you will go past the Bulahdelah bypass being built. That is a road construction job that will improve the productivity of the Pacific Highway. You will drive through the Kempsey bypass, the world's longest continuous road bridge. That was built during the period of the previous Labor government using a level of debt. You will go past the Ballina bypass. That was again built during the reign of the Labor government using a level of debt. And you will go past the Woolgoolga, which is being built at the moment. They are all good, productive pieces of infrastructure that are building and growing our economy and creating jobs. That is what the debt was devoted to in our economy. While Labor was government, those opposite were saying that that was an irresponsible position to take. They like to airbrush out of history the effect of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy and the job that Labor did in projecting jobs and building productive infrastructure.


The reason Labor is taking the position that it is taking in this debate is that those opposite have done not one thing to justify the increase in the debt and indeed the removal of the debt ceiling. Picture this: a married couple go into a bank to consult their bank manager. They say to their bank manager that they would like to increase their mortgage, not by a small amount but by 65 per cent. The bank manager says: 'Gee, that's a large increase. Can we see some of your figures? Can we see your income? Can we see records of your current level of debt? Can we see records of any personal debt that you may have—credit cards or any personal loans? And can we see some records of any assets that you own that might be collateral?' And the couple say: 'No, we're not going to supply you with any of that. We just want you to provide us with a 65 per cent increase in our mortgage.' That couple would be laughed out of the bank. And that is exactly what the government is asking the Australian people to do by attempting to increase the level of debt without the proper checks and balances.


On the latest figures that were produced by Labor when in government, gross debt was forecast to peak at $370 billion in 2016. That is why Labor has taken a position of supporting $400 billion worth of debt—$370 billion with a buffer. It is up to those opposite to justify the increase that they want to the Australian public, which to date they have not done. That is why Labor has taken this position.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:44):  We have heard some common sense uttered in this chamber in this debate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Moncrieff, certainly had some good comments to make about why we need to increase the debt ceiling. We have just heard from the member for Hinkler and the member for Mallee. Both made some very good, practical and reasonable comments on why we need to increase the debt ceiling.


We have also heard hypocrisy writ large. We heard that from the member for Kingston, who went on about jobs. Nobody in this chamber is not focused on creating more jobs. But in the last parliament all we ever heard about was the Labor Party protecting their own jobs. Their whole focus was on who would be Prime Minister, who was going to stab whom in the back—it became the focus of the whole 43rd Parliament.


We just heard the member for Kingsford Smith talking about the infrastructure projects that Labor allegedly got on with in the 43rd Parliament. I will admit there were some good infrastructure projects but—certainly in my electorate—there was far too much focus on buying back productive water. He also talked about the Pacific Highway. It is my understanding—and I think I am pretty right here—that under previous coalition governments the split between Commonwealth and state governments was 80:20, but under Labor it became fifty-fifty. So there was more emphasis on the state governments providing that fifty-fifty amount of money, whereas we only required a small input from the state government. We should not politicise the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. It is something that we as governments just need to get on with. Whether the split is 80:20 or fifty-fifty, we just need to improve that road so that people can get on with the business of driving from Queensland to New South Wales without the threat of driving on a goat track—and that is what it is.


We are getting on with the job of having a commission of audit, and we are getting on with the job of a strategic review into the National Broadband Network, because they are necessary. It has been 20 long years since we have had a commission of audit, and it is necessary. The commission is going to assess the current split of roles and responsibilities between state and federal governments, and that is necessary to avoid areas of duplication. It is also necessary to look into every way we can save money, because of the debt and deficit left to us as a legacy from Labor. Under its terms of reference:


The Commission is asked to review and report on the extent, condition and adequacy of Commonwealth sector infrastructure and, if found to be deficient, factors that may have contributed to the current situation and possible remedies.


That is necessary. And it is going to report back to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, something that was not done under Labor—there was no consultation; they just went out, squeezed the life out of the money for the Pacific Highway, bought far too much productive water out of the Murray-Darling Basin and held no cost-benefit analysis into the NBN. Who in business goes into a deal without making sure their money is going to be well spent? No-one does that but Labor, because of lot of them have not been in business, a lot of them have never had to worry about where their next income was going to come from because they have had this history of being in trade unions and this history of coming up through the staff ranks. Not that there's anything wrong with that: unions have a place and there have been any number of political staffers who have become good, contributing members of parliament.


But I put it to you, Deputy Speaker, that sometimes it is good to also listen to those with a world of experience—either in having had a job, having been an employer, or having had to sniff the oily rag and not know where the next dollar was going to come from, or having been in business, or actually having had the responsibility of making sure families could have a future next week and the week after. Not too many of the Labor members who I looked across at when they were in government had that experience, and it is so necessary.


It is so necessary also for us to have this debt ceiling of $500 billion, because of the legacy of debt and deficit that we inherited from Labor. With that, I move:

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (16:13):  I move:


That the requested amendment be made.


The government has agreed to the proposed amendments by the Greens to repeal the statutory debt limit and amend the Charter of Budget Honesty Act to improve transparency regarding government debt. We have worked together to resolve this issue and provide certainty to the markets about the government's capacity to finance the budget and ancillary debt. We have done this with no thanks to the Labor Party. They created the debt. They have done nothing to find a credible solution to us approaching a binding debt limit of $300 billion. It is just that their legacy is debt that well exceeds $400 billion. Today we are removing the instrument for parliamentary brinkmanship that was introduced by Labor—in fact, by the member for McMahon back in 2008—when they created a legislative limit on debt of $75 billion. So they created the debt, they created the debt limit and now they are trying to prevent us from dealing with their problem. In fact, they are making it worse.


Labor had to increase the debt limit three times, so they introduced a $75 billion limit and said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $200 billion and they said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $250 billion limit and they said they would never get there, and they did. Then they introduced a $300 billion limit and brought down a budget that had peak debt of $370 billion, and then tried to prevent us from dealing with it. It was an artificial construct. It was never intended to be a target, but it did end up being a target under Labor. And congratulations to Labor; they hit the target every time.


We have a clear plan to fix the budget and to start paying down Labor's debt. It involves getting rid of the mining tax and associated expenditure of over $13 billion, and we will take that off the debt. We have a plan to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and that immediately prevents us from proceeding with further debt-raising to finance an operation that involves a total of $10 billion of borrowed money.


Even the Labor Party, which have become pious in opposition—not that they were particularly pious in government—have proven just how hypocritical they are. They are seeking to oppose their own savings, which they took to the last election, including $2.3 billion of savings associated with the higher education proposal to fund the Gonski education initiative. The tax cuts that they announced would not be necessary because they were terminating the carbon tax they now want to proceed with. So Labor are not only asking us not to continue with our initiatives, they are voting against their own initiatives, which are all about trying to live within the means.


Today we have also agreed with the Greens on a number of measures to enhance transparency around government debt reporting in the budget papers. In particular there will be a debt statement published in every budget, every Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and every pre-election economic and fiscal outlook.




Mr Danby:
  In bed with the Greens again.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I will come to that in a moment. These debt statements will include information about Commonwealth stock and securities on issue at the time of the report for the financial year to which the report relates and for the following three financial years. They include: the value of Commonwealth stock and securities, including their market and face value and their value as a proportion of GDP; the total expected interest expenses relating to the stock and securities; and a breakdown by maturity and interest payments of the stock and securities on issue at the time of the report. An additional debt statement will also be published should debt increase by $50 billion or more since the last debt statement or additional debt statement was made. These additional debt statements would set out the reasons for the increase in debt, including the extent to which the increase was caused by lower than expected revenue, higher than expected spending, capital purchases and/or, alternatively, grants to state and territory governments for infrastructure. In addition, debt statements and additional debt statements will facilitate a parliamentary debate on government debt. At a minimum a debate will be held twice a year and more often if debt is increasing at a rapid rate.


We commend the Greens for coming to the table with sensible proposals to enhance transparency. Before the member for McMahon gets up to speak I would just remind him of his own words in relation to dealing with the Greens. When he said on Saturday, 'Sitting down and doing a deal with, of all people, the Greens,' he was criticising us. Madam Speaker, I seek an extension.



The SPEAKER:  Under standing order 1 interventions and speeches are limited to five minutes. You are at liberty to seek the floor again if there is no-one from the other side.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I seek the floor again.



The SPEAKER:  Granted.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The member for McMahon is a cracker. The member for McMahon, in 2010, said: 'The Greens are a party who have a very clear policy objective but also a party that you can sit down and discuss policies with.' That is what he said in 2010. And how about this, he said: 'We go into discussions of a very intense nature with the minor parties and there is often brinkmanship to the last minute, but we have found the Greens accommodative to good policy.' So the member for McMahon is the complete hypocrite in any judgement. He is out there saying that it is absolutely ridiculous—



The SPEAKER:  The minister will withdraw that.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry; I am just giving him a free character assessment.



The SPEAKER:  Just withdraw 'hypocrite'.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Hypocrite? He contradicts himself on a regular basis.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  You just asked the Treasurer to withdraw and he did not do so, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Yes, I did. I would ask the honourable Treasurer to withdraw.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I withdraw. The member for McMahon contradicts himself on a regular basis with no underlying principle. He criticises us for doing a deal with the Greens when, in fact, he has recommended doing a deal with the Greens in the past.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley.




Mr HOCKEY:
  This is the same member for McMahon who does not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. Come on! He was actually Treasurer just for a few days, but he does not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. I thought it was a bit of a slip of the tongue; like the time he came into this place and described the Chinese currency as the yen.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  Yes, he did. I know it is hard to believe, but he did. I thought it was just a bit of a slip of the tongue and I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and he did come into this place and talk about the debt limit applying to net debt, but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt. I tried with this man; I really tried. Then, when he wrote to me and said that he was going to distribute it to the whole world and talked about net debt being subject to the debt limit, he did not know the difference between net debt and gross debt. I thought, hang on, this guy is not fit to run a tuckshop let alone to run an economy. And, as we know, the member for Watson is over there preying on him.


What we do know is that when it comes to credibility the Labor Party has none. Do you know why they have no credibility? Because they have no principles. Not only do they vote against our savings, they vote against their own savings. Not only do they not know the difference between net debt and gross debt, they created the problem and they are trying to stop us from fixing it. That is the Labor Party way. Here is a tip for a new opposition: you actually have to be a little bit consistent. You actually have to believe in something. I know you believe in debt. I know the Labor Party believes in debt; I know the Labor Party believes in racking up the credit card.


You save him, Tony—good idea. He needs your help like he needs a bullet in the head.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer should be speaking through the chair. He is making terrible allegations against you, unless he is speaking through the chair.



The SPEAKER:  I think I can avoid the effrontery, but I would ask the honourable the Treasurer to speak through the chair.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I will tell you what: there is no way on God's earth the member for Mackellar would do anything other than act responsibly when it comes to debt, handling debt and paying down debt, because the member for Mackellar knows, like every other member who is mature about this sort of debate, that you do not play Russian roulette with a loaded gun when it comes to debt. The Labor Party has been playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun and it has gone bang in their face, because they have been dealt out of the equation by, of all people, the Greens. Now the Greens are proving to be more middle-of-the-road, more responsible, than the Australian Labor Party who have consigned themselves to somewhere way past the Democrats at the bottom of the garden; they have buried themselves along with their lack of credibility when it comes to handling the economy. I would say to the Labor Party: one day, for just one day, have some integrity, have consistency, have some principles—actually, do us a favour and stick to your election promises, especially when it comes to paying down your debt.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,BILLS,17,2,speech
"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:24):  'Stick to your election promises when it comes to paying down the debt.' The Treasurer just said it himself. Apparently the Australian people got it wrong, because when they heard the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer say, 'We'll pay off the debt,' as one of the three fundamental promises, what they really meant was, 'We'll vote with the Greens to get rid of the debt limit.' Remember the Prime Minister on the Bolt interview—and the Manager of Opposition Business very correctly pointed out to the House that you have to work really hard to get a bad interview as a Liberal Prime Minister on the Bolt show—where he said, 'We'll keep the promises we made, not the promises people think we made.' Apparently a promise the people think the Liberal Party made was to pay off the debt. The promise they really made was to vote with the Greens—the economic fringe-dwellers, as the Prime Minister explained—to actually abolish the debt limit, which the then opposition voted against increasing twice, in 2009 and 2012, despite the Prime Minister of Australia standing at that dispatch box and denying it, saying 'We never voted against increases to the debt limit.' They twice voted against increases to the debt limit in this House and/or the other house.


What we are seeing today is the hypocrisy of a party which is voting with another party, which they described as economic fringe-dwellers—those are not my words; they are the Prime Minister's words—to get rid of Australia's debt limit. This is a Treasurer and a Prime Minister who said before the election, 'We have a budget emergency on our hands.' And what have they done since? The Treasurer has given $9 billion to the Reserve Bank—




Mr Hockey:
  Given!




Mr BOWEN:
  Yes, that is right, Treasurer; that is what you did. He storms out of the chamber, shaking his head. The fact of the matter is that he has given $9 billion to the Reserve Bank, which increases this year's deficit and increases our interest bill by $1 billion over the next four years. He borrowed money and gave it to the Reserve Bank. They watered down Labor's tax integrity measures and made changes to support people with more than $2 million in their superannuation accounts. Those are this government's priorities—all things which increase the deficit and increase the debt. So what do we see? We see the Treasurer asking for an increase in the debt limit, first to half a trillion dollars. That was his first act, and he acted surprised and hurt that the opposition did not just say, 'We know you said you'd pay off the debt, but, if you want half a trillion dollars, that's all right.' No—it does not work that way. What happens is: you have to justify it. On each occasion when the former government asked the House for an increase to the debt limit, it was justified by a budget or an economic statement—on every single occasion. Not once did the member for Lilley, the then Treasurer, come into the chamber and say, 'By the way, I need an increase in the debt limit and I'll show you the figures later'—not once, because that is the wrong thing to do. You justify yourself to the parliament by releasing the midyear economic forecast and a statement, but what we see is the new Treasurer saying, 'I need half a trillion dollars and I'll show you the paperwork later.' Australia's biggest no-doc loan—that is what the Treasurer wants.


The Treasurer found that he could not get that through the parliament because the Greens' position then was that an increase of $200 million was not justified. Now their position is that we do not need a debt limit at all. So the Greens have had a change of position over the last few weeks. That is okay; political parties are allowed to do that. But the biggest change of all is from the government, which told the Australian people solemnly that they would pay off the debt. The Treasurer had a chance to explain. He said, 'You've got to let us fix up the mess,' as he calls it; 'You've got to let us fix the debt.' So his position is: 'We've got to get rid of the debt limit to pay off the debt.' He has not explained the internal inconsistency in that little equation: 'We've got to pay off the debt, so we'll get rid of the debt limit.' Well, I think there are Liberal voters around Australia scratching their heads, thinking: 'Is this really the government we voted for? Is this really the government that promised to pay off the debt and said that we are open for business; the same Treasurer who showed that we are open for business by knocking back a foreign investment application—




Ms Rowland:
  The national interest.




Mr BOWEN:
  in the national interest—and who said, 'We need more foreign investment, so I'm going to knock this one back,' to paraphrase the Treasurer? The Treasurer is a cracker. He said, 'We need more foreign investment, so I'm going to knock one back, and we need to pay off the debt so we'll get rid of the debt limit.' This sort of stuff catches up with you, and it will catch up with the Treasurer, because he seems to think it is a matter of pride that they are voting to get rid of the debt limit. He is very proud of it and the fact that he has done a deal with the Greens. He thinks that is an achievement for him. I beg to differ. I think it shows a complete lack of integrity on behalf of this government. (Time expired)

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-09,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:29):  I rise to speak in support of these amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, which have their genesis in amendments moved by the Greens in the Senate. They will lead to a more sensible discussion about debt in this country. I was listening very closely to what the member for McMahon said. Far too often in this chamber, now and over previous years, we have seen the unfortunate case of Labor trying to out-Liberal the Liberals, sometimes on refugees and in this instance on debt. Every time that Labor try and turn the issue of debt or the issue of refugees to their political advantage, it comes back to bite the progressives. There can be no clearer instance than with the issue of debt.


In the last parliament, every time the question of debt came up we watched the opposition, as they then were, stand up and berate the government about the level of debt that had been incurred. In all of that there was not one single sensible argument about why it was that we had that debt in the first place. Of course there was a thing called the global financial crisis and there was a need to borrow to spend to ensure that Australia did not go into recession. The Greens supported that because it was the right thing to do. As a result, the country incurred debt. Even after incurring that debt, Australia still has a remarkably good position in OECD countries on both net and gross debt.


Separately, if you come from the progressive side of politics then generally you would think it is a good place to mount the argument that governments, especially the Australian government at the moment, should be quite happy to take advantage of the relatively cheap money that is on offer at the moment to borrow to fund the infrastructure that this country needs to set itself up for the 21st century. Maybe instead of having pieces of legislation that say maybe we will or will not do something about high-speed rail in five or 10 years time, we could actually get on with the job of building it—if people were prepared to have a sensible discussion about debt. In part because of the creation of this artificial debt limit which Labor supported, we end up in this situation where we miss having a sensible discussion about debt and, instead, all debt is apparently evil.


Anyone will tell you that there is a difference between the mortgage and the credit card. If you are borrowing to fund some long-term infrastructure, to fund something that at the end of the day is going to be useful to you, or if you are borrowing in the short-term term to meet some speed bumps or some even bigger challenges like we saw in the global financial crisis, then that is a good thing. But if what you are doing is extending the credit card limit just to meet your expenditure, then it is not a good thing. Most people would understand that and that is the discussion we need to have with the Australian people. If we routinely beat each other over the head about a number without any sensible debate over what the money is actually being spent on we are going to get into the worst discussion in this country. Ultimately, if and when Labor gets back into power, it is going to hurt them even more. I suspect there are many on the Labor side of politics who are quietly happy that this has happened because they know that when they get back into power it will make their life easier—if they choose to stop trying to out-Liberal the Liberals and instead say, 'Yes, it is a good thing to borrow to fund the infrastructure that this country needs.'


I am very proud of the transparency measures that we have secured, and they are timely too. As we head towards the budget, what is clear from the national account figures that have been released is that as mining investment comes off the boil there are many places in Australia and sectors in the Australian economy that are now reliant on government spending to keep them going. Now we have removed one of the last hurdles in the way to the Treasurer stimulating the economy, there will be no excuse for savage budget cuts in May, and we will not support them.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:34):  It has become clear this afternoon that the Treasurer bear hugs the Greens that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection rejects. On one day we have on one side of the chamber the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection rejecting the Greens and talking about all the heinous things the Greens do. The minute those opposite need to get a deal through they suddenly welcome the Greens with open arms and cannot believe that they have got the opportunity to do this type of deal. It is unbelievable for the Greens to think that this will lead to a bold new era of transparency. I would hate to actually have them, by their own actions, reinforce the view that that they are economic fringe dwellers—but their own actions will do that if they think this government is committed to transparency.


There was a simple proposition extended by us to those opposite, to those in government, which was we will support an increase in the debt ceiling to $400 billion. If those opposite want to go beyond that then be transparent, table MYEFO and let the public know the state of the books. That was the simple test of transparency that they refused to meet. When will they table MYEFO? They will table it next week. When? After the Australian parliament goes into recess for the break. The Greens are all after transparency but not if it actually involves the most official document, which is MYEFO.


This is not really about transparency, this is not about being upfront, this is not about having a conversation—that well worn phrase—with people about debt; this is about one thing and one thing only. It is about Joe Hockey, the Treasurer, avoiding coming back here to explain that all the bravado and all of the bluster that they engaged in pre-election cannot be matched by post election performance. They are unable to demonstrate why, when they said that if debt is the problem then more debt is not the answer, they cannot deliver a strain of logic that actually says why this is the case.


While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has to sit here on his own, defending the case of the government, it is very hard—and I am sure he could come up with lots of reasons. In fact, I reckon he could come up with 93 reasons that could try and help him justify this deal to the parliament! He is unable to, because they all know, with a red face—



An opposition member:  Don't pick on Barnaby.




Mr HUSIC:
  I will not pick on the agriculture minister. But, frankly, they know what we know and had to deal with for quite some time: national incomes across the globe are contracting. Economies are not growing. Monetary policy is not giving the same kick that it once did. As a result, budgets come under pressure—as ours have for many years, and as they know theirs will, which is why they will not release MYEFO. So, in an effort to avoid actually admitting to people that their bluster before the election on surpluses—because remember, Madam Speaker, those on that side of the chamber made a commitment that they would get to surplus in one year—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  One year, they said, Member for McEwen. They said they would get to surplus in one year. And when did they ditch that promise? They ditched it in the quiet of January this year. When no-one was really paying attention, they moved away.




Mr Bowen:
  They meant 'one year' like 'one day'.




Mr HUSIC:
  One year, one day—




Ms Rowland:
  Like dog years!




Mr HUSIC:
  Exactly—it gets measured in a quantum that we mere mortals cannot understand! But they have been dragged to economic realism, and yet they will not be up-front with people about the reasons they need to increase the debt ceiling. It is outrageous that, in this last-ditch effort, as the shadow Treasurer indicated, their way of getting rid of debt is to lift the debt ceiling. It is preposterous logic. It does not sit at all well with the rhetoric used before the election, and they should be explaining fully why they are going to this position. And they should not just back it up with words. They should back it up with the numbers contained in MYEFO, and they should do it this week.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:39):  It is quite extraordinary to stand in this debate on the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2013 and to have listened to the contributions from Labor members opposite on how debt was a problem under the coalition and how the Australian people needed to be vigilant and on guard, and how it was in the national interest for the Australian Labor Party to stand opposed to the deal that is being done between the coalition and the new economic centrists—certainly, relative to the Labor Party—the Greens! Members of the public up in the gallery were probably scratching their heads as they heard the Australian Labor Party start to lecture the Australian people on the dangers of debt. This is the Australian Labor Party! Let us not ever forget the track record of Labor, because if you had only tuned in to the last 10 minutes you would have thought: 'Well, they seem reasonable. The solution to debt is not more debt—that seems to be a reasonable comment to make.' And if you did not know that the Australian Labor Party was the party that presided over the most significant deterioration in Australia's debt position in our history, and if you did not know that the Australian Labor Party inherited $45 billion of net assets and turned that $45 billion into a mountain of over $400 billion worth of debt, you might think they had a skerrick of credibility. But, in a continuation of form for the Australian Labor Party, we know that they will say absolutely anything if it happens to suit their argument at any given point in time.


I heard the shadow parliamentary secretary turn around and make comments about how the coalition was being dragged to economic realism and I heard him start to criticise the coalition, saying that we promised there would be a surplus. Again, if I cast my mind back, it was only about six months ago that we heard the Australian Labor Party promise, on over 600 separate occasions, that they were going to deliver an economic surplus. We recall the way they completely bastardised the Australian company tax collection system when they turned around and said, 'We're going to change from quarterly PAYG to making sure that it is paid monthly.' Why did they do it? They did it for one reason and one reason alone: the Australian Labor Party did it because it was all part of their phoney campaign to try to get back to surplus. And after Prime Minister Rudd, and Prime Minister Gillard, and Prime Minister Rudd, and Treasurer Swan, and Treasurer Bowen, we saw the Australian Labor Party left in a situation where, after promising on over 600 occasions that they were going to deliver a budget surplus, they actually delivered a nearly $31 billion deficit.


The Australian people are not fools, I am pleased to say. They see straight through this lot opposite. And I am very pleased to stand on the track record of the coalition, time and time again, because our track record—and I say this for the benefit of the members opposite—is a good track record. We have paid down Labor's debt before and we will pay down Labor's debt again. And if that means that we have to take hard decisions, and if that means that we have to make responsible decisions, then the coalition will always step up to the plate. That is the reason the Australian people thoroughly rejected the Australian Labor Party at the last election. They rejected you because they know you will say and do anything, members of the Australian Labor Party. These kinds of silly games from the Australia Labor Party just underscore why the Australian people know that the cupboard is bare when it comes to genuine policy decision making.


So I say to the Australian Labor Party: get with the times. It is a bad strategy, Australian Labor Party, when you are outflanked in the centre ground by the Australian Greens. So if that does not send you a message, members of the Australian Labor Party, I do not know how on earth you are ever going to get the message. But I would say to you: the signs are there. You do not need a crystal ball to gaze in; you do not need to try to read the tea leaves. All the signs are there, members of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian electorate rejected you. You have got a mountain of debt of over $400 billion. And now you have the Australian Greens being the sensible centre. So read those cryptic clues and see what you can come up with. (Time expired)

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:44):  I was loath to raise a point of order while the member for Moncrieff kept failing to refer his remarks through the chair, because I do enjoy that speech from the member for Moncrieff. I enjoyed it the first time I heard it and I have continued to enjoy it on each subsequent occasion that we have heard that speech. The thing that we hear time and time again, in the refrain from everybody on that side, is that they are not doing what they told the Australian people they would do. We went through that debate last week with respect to education. We go through that debate repeatedly in the vast gulf between what the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection promised and what he is doing now.


But I do not think there is an example more clear to the Australian people than when the same people who were railing against debt and railing against deals with the Greens then do a deal with the Greens for unlimited debt. I do not think you can get a quinella quite like that when it comes to what is being done by the government. I heard one of my favourite lines from the member for Moncrieff in his speech and I enjoy it every time he gives it. He says that they have to 'make the hard decisions'. Unlimited debt is hardly a hard decision. Unlimited debt is avoiding future hard decisions. Unlimited debt means they are just going to remove any level of public restraint and debate into the future. Then they say how proud they are that they managed to do a deal with the Greens.


I am disappointed, obviously, to see that they have been so willing to jump in and team up with the Greens. When the House divides on this motion, we will see the Greens sitting side by side with members of the coalition, and that is a decision for them. But for those opposite to pretend that it was really hard to get the Greens to agree with unlimited debt is really missing the point of basically every public debate that we have had on debt issues over the last few years. What is not lost on the Australian people is that the Prime Minister himself said that you should not do cheap and tawdry deals with the Greens. Well, I concede that this one might be tawdry, but it ain't cheap. There is nothing cheap about this deal at all. Those opposite told people that they would turn around the figures and start delivering surplus—they would shift from deficit to surplus. If you go to surplus, what occurs? Debt starts to go down. Yet they, on the economic pathway they have now chosen, know that they are heading down a path where, under their government, debt year on year will become higher. That is the pathway they have chosen and that is why the action they have taken now is for debt to be unlimited. Unlimited debt is the pathway that those opposite have chosen.


They are so desperate to say that, even though it has happened since they have been in office, the continued increases are somehow Labor debt. Those opposite need to recognise: they are in government now, which means what happens on their watch is their responsibility. As debt goes up, it becomes their responsibility. The final record that was the responsibility of those on this side of the House was reflected in the pre-election fiscal outlook. The Charter of Budget Honesty, which Peter Costello used to back in and which those opposite used to support, did not require the figures to go to a half a trillion dollars. But there is nothing like the hypocrisy of going from bringing the debt down, to needing it to go to half a trillion dollars, to then saying, as those opposite do, that they want debt to be unlimited.


As the shadow Treasurer held up that ad last week, I think it struck a chord with people when they could see next to the Prime Minister the words that he would reduce the debt—and now we have the sheer hypocrisy of their not merely saying they will not reduce it and not merely saying they want to take it to a half a trillion dollars but saying the sky is the limit. Unlimited debt is now what those opposite want, which is the exact opposite of what they told the Australian people they would do. On issue after issue, be it education, their handling of immigration issues or debt, they are a government who say one thing and do the exact opposite. (Time expired)

Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (16:49):  The last thing this House needs is a lecture on budgetary matters from fiscal pygmies. That is what those people on the opposite side are: they are fiscal pygmies. They are the group who have taken this country from being in the black to facing an absolute fiscal nightmare after five to six years. We are the ones trying to clean up this mess. Each and every day we open a cupboard to another budgetary skeleton. Those people sit over on the other side of the chamber with a great sense of commitment to their cause, when we are the ones trying to clean it up.


They slid money out of education and spent three to four years of the infrastructure forward estimates in the first year, leaving nothing in the cupboard. They then come to this place and, even after the evidence of officials from Treasury at Senate estimates, refuse to accept the fact that we need to increase the debt ceiling. We would not need to have this debate right now if the Labor Party had decided to do what was in the best interests of the country, upon the advice of senior officials, and taken the debt limit to the $500 billion that was proposed. But, no, they want to take advantage of the political environment. They want to be political opportunists. They want to do absolutely anything they can to be economic vandals. They continue to be economic vandals in this place and it is an absolute disgrace. So do not lecture us on debt. Yours is the party that has taken us into fiscal oblivion.


We are comfortable on this side of the House with the Charter of Budget Honesty and the agreement that has been made between this side of the House and the Australian Greens to get us through this period. We have no qualms with that because we have nothing to hide. When it comes to the Charter of Budget Honesty, we have nothing to hide. You are the guys who are absolutely useless when it comes to managing Australia's finances.


They are the party that after six years took a country with money in the bank and no interest payments on debt to one now with in excess of $400 billion in debt and $10 billion in interest payments. They think it is funny, but it happened on their watch. It happened on their watch in six short years. They need to admit the fact that that is what occurred.




Dr Leigh:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Is the member for Braddon willing to give way?




Mr WHITELEY:
  No. The debt limit is a construct of the Australian Labor Party. Let's not forget that this was brought in in 2008. Let's keep in mind that at that point we had no debt, as a legacy of the Howard-Costello government. We had money in the bank. We were in a super position fiscally. In 2008 the Australian Labor Party came to this place on the back of the perception of a new superhero fiscal conservative in Mr Rudd—and what did we see? The first debt limit was set at $75 billion. Then they asked, 'Mr Bank Manager, can I have more?' It then went to $200 billion. Then they asked, 'Mr Bank Manager, can I have more?' It went to $250 billion. It went on and on. Thank goodness the Australian people spoke so loudly on 7 September and said, 'Enough is enough. We need to get the finances of this country back under control.'


What is absolutely ironic about this is that at the start of this whole process, when this bill was first introduced by the Treasurer, those on the opposite side were offered briefings. They refused to have them. The dead giveaway, when the Treasurer was bringing this matter to a conclusion today with his speech earlier, was that the accused, the shadow Treasurer, could not face the prosecutor. That is always a dead giveaway. He sat there. He twirled in his seat. His eyeballs rolled around in their sockets. He could not look the Treasurer in the eye. The Treasurer nailed him. The shadow Treasurer left a massive black hole. He left skeletons and black spiders in every cupboard. We are here now to declare, 'We will clean up the mess.' But those opposite should not stand in our way. The Greens have come to an agreement with us to make sure that we can continue to pay the bills when the time comes in the very near future. It is about time that those on the opposite side woke up to themselves, because they are nothing but economic pygmies.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:09):  I move:


That the further amendments, including an amendment of the title, be agreed to.


Madam Speaker, if you ever needed a more clear demonstration of how the Australian Labor Party have dealt themselves out of this debate, of how the Australian Labor Party have lost any credibility at all when it comes to this debate, then you just saw it when the Greens and the two Independents walked to this side of the chamber. By walking from there to this side of the chamber, they demonstrated that they were willing to put economic orthodoxy on the table. It stands in contrast to the new economic fringe dwellers, which is the Australian Labor Party. 


I have heard members of the Australian Labor Party claim repeatedly that they could not understand why the debt ceiling of more than $400 billion needed to go. They did not understand why there needed to be a debt ceiling of $500 billion, which was of course the first call that the coalition made. The reason—and it is really not that complicated—is that, as was attested to by members of the Australian Labor Party, peak debt under Labor was forecast to reach $370 billion. We know from the tabled Australian Office of Financial Management minute that you need a $60 billion buffer. Let me go very slowly through it for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party: 370 plus 60 equals 430. I will break it down again: 370 plus 60 equals 430. So there you go, Madam Speaker, there is the great riddle that the Australian Labor Party cannot work out. 


When the Australian Labor Party say with their hands on their heart, 'Oh, we only want it to go up to $400 billion,' let them now understand why. It is because 370 plus 60 equals 430. So I say to the Australian Labor Party that is the reason your $400 billion was nothing other than a political gimmick and that is the reason we walked away from it. When we could not get any agreement from the Australian Labor Party, we spoke to the Greens—and guess what? The Greens were the sensible ones who were willing to recognise the best way forward and what was clearly in Australia's national interest. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  I now hear Labor members opposite repeatedly making remarks, 'But that's not until 2016.' The extraordinary thing is that Labor still does not get it. They still think it is acceptable to simply kick the can down the road. 



Mr Danby interjecting—



Mr Sukkar interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Melbourne Ports will desist. The member for Deakin will also desist.




Mr CIOBO:
  Labor still thinks it is acceptable to say: 'We'll deal with that down the track. We don't want to deal with it now.' I say to members of the Australian Labor Party that that might be how Labor governs but that is not how the coalition governs. That is not our approach. We are not prepared to kick the can down the road. We want to deal with the issue once and we want to deal with it in a way that provides certainty to the economic markets and that does not invite in the kind of Tea Party politics that the Australian Labor Party so warmly embrace. 


I never really thought that the member for Melbourne Ports would necessarily be someone who would embrace Tea Party politics, but he is. Like all the members of the Australian Labor Party, he is willing to jeopardise Australia's national interest on short-term political opportunism. So, for that reason, we were willing to talk to anybody else who was willing to put the national interest first. Lo and behold, the Greens were willing to put Australia's national interest first—and that stands in contrast to the Labor Party. 


What the Senate has proposed and what we have agreed on with the Greens is a number of measures to enhance transparency around government debt reporting in the budget papers—in particular, there will be a debt statement published in every budget, in every Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and in every pre-election economic and fiscal outlook. In addition, the debt statements will include information about Commonwealth stock and securities on issue at the time of the report for the financial year to which the report relates and for the following three financial years; the value of the Commonwealth's stock and securities, including the market and face value and their value as a proportion of GDP; the total expected interest expenses relating to the stock and securities; and a breakdown by maturity interest payments of the stock and securities on issue at the time of the report. An additional debt statement would also be published should debt increase by $50 billion or more since the last debt statement or additional statement was made. 


The amendments that have been put forward are good amendments. The Senate recognises these amendments in a spirit of putting Australia's national interest first, of advancing our national interest and of providing certainty and stability, which stands in contrast to the juvenile approach that we have seen from the Australian Labor Party.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:14):  What an extraordinary contribution from the member for Moncrieff. We have heard it about four times already in this debate. Frankly, taking a lecture from those opposite, particularly from the member for Moncrieff, on political obstruction and opportunism is like taking a lecture from Ronnie Biggs on train safety. It really is. Their approach in the 43rd Parliament was to say no to everything. Even when it was consistent with their own policy, they said no to everything. They said no, whether it was about assisting the government to find savings through measures like putting an indexation on the private health insurance rebate—they talk about debt; well, they could have done some things when we were in government to assist in dealing with the issue of debt—or whether it was, as the member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out so many times, their belligerent approach when it came to the people transfer agreement with Malaysia. So taking a lecture from those opposite on the issue of obstructionism is really a little bit too much to take.


This bill, the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2013, is an extraordinary bill, which is why members on this side of the House cannot support it. It is extraordinary that the members on that side of the House would be speaking in favour of it, because, not three months ago, they were all standing in front of billboards and waving pamphlets around, saying, 'We will reduce the debt.'




Dr Leigh:
  Where is the debt truck now?




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Where is the debt truck now? The government members have gone from being the party of no debt to the party of no debt limit. I cannot understand why they are willing to stand there and speak in favour of this bill. It is Buzz Lightyear economics: 'To infinity and beyond!' We are all looking for Woody to make an appearance in this debate! They have only got themselves to blame. They would like to sheet home all of the blame to us on this side of the House, when we did the right thing by the country and we did the right thing by the parliament during the global financial crisis. Yes, we were willing to put the budget into the red to ensure that businesses stayed open and that people stayed in work. It was the right thing to do by the economy. It was the right thing to do by the nation. We got no assistance from those opposite, yet they come in here and complain to us about obstruction.


We might be able to take them a bit more seriously if, when they came back into government, they had done the right thing by the budget. But what was their first act? What was their first act when they came back into government? It was to give an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank. That is right—an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank, no strings attached. Yet they come in here and they complain about debt. Well, there is a fair bit of debt that was racked up on their own watch. They have only got themselves to blame.


From looking at what is in the chute, we believe the debt is actually going to get worse. What have the government's first acts been, on regaining the treasury bench? They have given a tax hike to low-superannuation earners and a tax cut to high-superannuation earners—an increase for high-superannuation earners. They have denied themselves a revenue stream. They like to take the fun out of the minerals resource rent tax, which is a growth tax: the tax increases when profits increase and decreases when profits are flat. But one of their first acts in government is to bring a bill into parliament to reduce the government's capacity to raise revenue in the future. It would seem that, if you want a tax cut in this country today, you have to own a mine. You can see where their priorities are. In fact, if you want help with your school expenses, your name has to be George Brandis. You can see where their priorities are and who they are looking after.


Those opposite puff up their chests and talk about the great deal that they have been able to do with the Greens. You can see how tough those negotiations must have been, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta! 'Dear Senator, I'm here; I want to ensure that we have no brakes on debt into the future, no debt limit.' You can imagine that that negotiation went on for weeks and weeks! We on this side of the House oppose the legislation. It is the right thing to do by the country.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:19):  In August this year, the then opposition leader, Mr Abbott, launched a stinging attack on the Greens political party. He said they had 'fringe' economic policies. When asked about his decision to put the Greens party last in all Liberal preferences, he said he was making a 'captain's call'. Mr Abbott said:


There is a world of difference between the Greens and as far as I'm aware just about everyone else who is contesting this election … because everyone else in this campaign supports economic growth and supports a more prosperous economy.


He was then asked, if he disliked the Greens so much, whether it had been a mistake to preference the Greens over Labor in 2010, thereby ensuring that the current member for Melbourne won that seat. Mr Abbott waved his hands and said:


That was then, this is now.


And 'that was then, this is now' is a good summation of where we have ended up in this debate. Back then, the Greens were 'fringe economic dwellers' that were on the extremes of Australian politics. Now we see the Greens literally sitting on the front benches in a division moments ago. Back then, if debt was the problem, more debt was not the solution. Now it turns out that an uncapping of the debt limit is exactly what Australia needs; the right medicine for Australia is unlimited debt! We are seeing what I think is best summed up in the words of Mr Abbott himself:


… a litany of betrayals, of broken promises, of disappointed hopes …


If, before the election, the then opposition had gone to the people and said, 'We think that the real problem is debt and our policy is going to be to strike a deal with the Greens to remove the debt limit,' I think people would have voted a little differently.


Of course, it is not the only broken promise that we have seen from this government. They have been in office for only a matter of months, but already we have seen them break their promise to bring down a budget update within 100 days. We might not have needed to have this debate at all if that promise had not been broken by the Treasurer—if that 100-day limit had not been broken. We are now pushing into December, a period well beyond where Labor ever went in releasing the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We have seen the government breaking their pledge that no public servants would be fired, breaking their pledge that there would be no adverse changes to superannuation arrangements, breaking their pledge to the schoolchildren of Australia that they are on a unity ticket in education and breaking the pledge that there would be a boat buyback. It is passing strange that just before the election Mr Abbott said, in an interview with the doyenne of the Press Gallery, Michelle Grattan:


… you should move heaven and earth to keep commitments … and only if keeping commitments becomes almost impossible could you ever be justified in not keeping them … And I suspect the electorate would take a very dim view even in those circumstances.



Let us apply Mr Abbott's test to what has happened today. Is it impossible not to keep the opposition's pledge to bring down debt? Not at all. The Labor Party would have been very happy to support a $400 billion debt cap which allows a $30 billion buffer in 2016-17, when debt is expected to peak. But, if the government believes that the situation has changed—if they believe that debt is peaking higher—then they can bring down the budget update and be very clear with the Australian people about what has shifted. Has the $9 billion to the Reserve Bank—the thimble and pea trick which says, 'We'll give you $9 billion now so that we can pull out a bigger dividend later—had an impact? Has the $17 billion of tax cuts to mining billionaires and big polluters had an impact on the budget? It is important that the people of Australia are not put in the position of Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey suggesting that this is somehow Labor's debt. The people of Australia are entitled to see whether the budget has deteriorated in this government's time in office. We have seen disappointing consumer confidence numbers out today suggesting that all is not well under this government. We have seen closed economy decisions on foreign investment— (Time expired)

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (17:24):  In response, I would like to speak about the fact that it is Labor's debt, and I would like to discuss where it came from. It is very clear to me that the money has already been spent. This is the reason the debt cap needs to be increased and, as the amendment has come back, to be deleted—to have no debt ceiling. Quite simply, the money was spent on things like school halls. I have been to many locations, up to 100, where the school hall was replicated side-by-side with one which they already had. When I said, 'Why do you have a second school hall exactly the same as the other one?' they said, 'We were told we had to spend the money; we didn't have a choice.' That is not the way we do business on this side of the House and it is certainly the way business should not be done, but I will give them some credit. In areas like Tara, Miles and St George, where there was absolutely nothing, where there was no local community facility, there was some benefit. But in the many hundreds of coastal locations there were literally thousands of replications, whether they be libraries or other BER projects. The very first school project I went to I said to the construction company, 'Are you sure this cost $2 million?' They said, 'Absolutely: design and construct project,' I said, 'How many do you have?' They said, 'Ten,' I said, 'What do you have to do?' They said, 'Same again.' I asked, 'What about the design component?' They answered, 'That's fine; we covered that in the original quotation, no problems at all.' It cost hundreds of millions of dollars.


Just because somebody sends your credit card in the mail, that does not mean you necessarily have to fill it. Just because we have an option to use the money, that does not mean that we are going to spend it. We are not the United States. This is Australia, and this is the Australian parliament.


I sat in this place in recent weeks as a new member of the House. I continue to hear from those opposite how they represent the union movement. I am more interested to hear what it is that they intend to do for their electorates. Over and over they say that they represent the unions; that they represent the workers. I find it absolutely outrageous that they would indicate to those on this side of the House that they do not fairly represent all people because I am a worker. That is exactly where I come from. I hold a trade qualification. I work on a farm. I also have a degree in engineering. I represent people equally. That is why we are here and that is why I am on this side of the House and sit with the Nationals—because the Nationals are for regional Australia. That is what we are about.


I would like to talk briefly about a gentleman called Craig van Rooyen, who is an immigrant to this country. He came through with the correct process. It took years to arrive and they work hard. They have a lychee farm in my electorate of Hinkler. They were the people who broke the story on backpacker cheques. You may recall a story in The Australian during the election campaign. Mr van Rooyen came to me and said, 'How is it possible that I have a cheque for a backpacker who has not worked at this location for two years, yet they get a cheque for $900?' That is an absolute waste, yet it continues.


The house insulation scheme: as an electrician I think it was criminal. People lost their lives because of that project. They should be very careful about what it is that they put forward because it was clearly poorly-planned. There was evidence provided to people in this place, and they knew that over and over people with no training were put at risk in areas where they should not have been—and some lost their lives. It is time that people on this side of the House recognise that those opposite are not interested in what we do for Australia. What we do here is in the best interests of all people in our electorates—not just union members, not just workers but all people in the electorate. I look forward to the process where this legislation goes through the Senate and we can get on with the business of running this country.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (17:29):  There are many examples of this government saying one thing before the election and doing something completely different after the election. There are plenty of examples we could point to, but nothing is more stark than this, where before the election the government said they were going to reduce debt. They went around telling everyone they were going to be responsible and reduce debt. Then, not more than four sittings weeks in, they are asking this parliament to pass an unlimited cap on debt—no debt ceiling whatsoever.


The now Treasurer said during the election campaign that he would like to ensure there was less debt and that more debt does not reduce debt. It seems kind of odd for him to change his tune within four sitting weeks. I imagine that the Australian people are scratching their heads. Before the election he said, 'Reduce the debt,' but after the election he says, 'Give us a licence to have as much debt as we possibly can.'


I think the Australian people would be scratching their heads not only over that backflip but also about the Liberal Party now courting the Greens for their economic policy. Before the election, there was a lot of criticism on any occasion that the Greens voted with the Labor Party, despite the Liberal Party voting with the Greens on numerous occasions—for example, to trash the Malaysia solution, which was a responsible solution in relation to asylum seekers. In public, with their megaphones, they were saying, 'Don't trust the Greens. The Greens have irresponsible economic policies.' Indeed, Tony Abbott described the Greens as the fringe dwellers of economic policy. But today we see once again the Liberal Party doing a complete U-turn and courting the Greens to support their irresponsible economic policy.


Let us be clear about why we are in a position where the Liberal Party have had to court the Greens. It is because the Greens and the Liberal Party actually do not want to talk about where the debt is coming from. All Labor asked was, 'Just be honest—why do you need this increase?' Since the election, we have had the Liberals spending a lot of money in a lot of areas. They are secretly spending it—in terms of the Reserve Bank—and not wanting to be transparent with the Australian people about where the debt is coming from and why they now need unlimited debt. Into the future, they also want to continue hiding and not come back to this parliament to report on why they need more debt. So it is not surprising now that we see the fringe dwellers—I am talking about what Tony Abbott called the Greens—getting on with the Liberals and voting for this.


But we still see the Liberal Party having an incoherent economic message. We see them wanting to abolish the debt ceiling while at the same time refusing to recognise why the spending was required during the global financial crisis. They fail to recognise that the then Treasurer, the member for Lilley, received the 'world's best Treasurer' award for the way he dealt with the global financial crisis, ensuring that Australians kept on working.


While it was the priority of the previous, Labor government to put jobs at No. 1, over the last few days we have seen constantly that the Liberal Party will refuse to put jobs at No. 1. They are happy to see jobs in my electorate and in my state of South Australia, and indeed in the southern states and right across Australia, go by the wayside. This government has no narrative. Increase debt, but do not focus on jobs. Jobs are not a critical component for this government. They refuse to protect jobs in this economy.


I call on the government to reconsider this. It is irresponsible and the hypocrisy is quite rank in terms of their dirty deal with the Greens. (Time expired)

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:34):  It is time that we reflect on financial management. I am not here to cast aspersions across the House about whose fault it is. Let us have a look at where we are and how we got to this point. There was a time not that long ago when Australia was not in debt. We walked into a financial crisis globally, and there was an argument for a legitimate stimulus package. But now the challenge is how we lift ourselves up into the future.


Debt has a place. It has a place in business. I have run a small business and I have used debt. Debt can be constructive, but it can also be an inhibitor. The question is not so much whether we want to increase our debt limit; the question is, 'What are we doing it for?' and then working out what we are going to do into the future. We have a situation where we have to walk a balance between a level of austerity and a level of confidence in the Australian economy. I am a strong believer that debt can play a part, but I am also a strong believer that a government should send a signal to its population that it can live within its means. Our ambition as members of the new government is to live within our means to send a signal to the Australian people that our government can live within its means.


However, in the very short term we find ourselves in a situation where we will need to invest and drive productivity across the country, and doing that is going to require capital. It is going to require capital that is not just going to come from the tax revenues of Australians; it is going to require some foreign capital, and that is the reason we have had to expand the debt limit. To have this argument that somehow the coalition government is not, in the long term, going to live within its means and that, therefore, asking for an increase in the debt limit means the government is going to go from a $300 billion debt to a $500 billion debt and then just keep racking it up, I think, misses the point. The point is that governments need to ambitiously aim to spend the taxpayer revenue effectively. They need to ambitiously aim to live within their means. But there are times when we are turning the corner that we need to keep a level of confidence in the economy and we need to borrow. This is the reason.


When looking at whether the coalition government should have done a deal with the Greens, the situation was this: the argument that we were going to hit the debt ceiling of $300 billion and go through it did not appear to be resonating with the Labor Party. They had a political imperative and saw that they could somehow score some points here. We put the argument to the Greens that there was a practical imperative here and that we needed to borrow more money to keep confidence in the economy and after that we could begin the process of living within our means and eventually paying back that debt. But this is a long-term project. This is not something that is going to happen in one year; it is going to take a number of years. I hope that both sides of the political sphere will see the sense in that.


Anyone in small business knows that there are times that you have to borrow. But there are always times when you have to pay it back. This is a time when we need to cut through that threshold. But our ambition and our stated aim—backed by our past history as a coalition government through the Howard years—is to pay back the debt. But we have to instil confidence in the Australian economy to do that.


This is good fiscal management. It is not about scoring points and playing political games; it is not about saying, 'You racked up debt'; 'We didn't rack up debt'; 'You can't be trusted'; 'No, you can't be trusted.' This is about what is in the best interests of Australia. We have challenges ahead. We have a slowing global economy. We have to make sure that we have a high level of confidence. To do that, we will borrow. But our stated aim is to get back to a situation in which the total expenditure of this government is less than the total tax revenue. Hopefully, some common sense will be seen on both sides of the House, and particularly on the Labor Party side, about the reason we needed to make that deal. The challenge is immense. But with strong fiscal management we can do it. Debt has a place. But ultimately debt has to be paid back.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:39):  The position taken by the government in this debate is utterly bizarre and, I must say, somewhat hypocritical, because some 3½ months ago, those opposite were gallivanting around the country campaigning vehemently against debt. They were saying that the debt level in Australia was much too high. They were driving around with a big truck with numbers ticking over saying that this country's debt was ticking up every minute and every second and it was out of control, when in fact the situation was that Australia had a very reasonable level of debt and one that was the envy of most of the Western world and most advanced nations when comparing it to their fiscal positions.


It is a fact that Australia has a level of debt. But we need to be conscious of why we have a debt position at the moment. It is because in 2007 the world was hit by the global financial crisis. Australia was not immune. We are an open, global based economy. We were affected by the global financial crisis. It affected growth, it affected consumption and, most importantly, it affected projections for growth within our economy. There was a very big risk that Australians would be forced out of work and that small businesses would be affected, as has occurred in Europe—and we have all seen the carnage that has been wrought by debt crises in Europe—and in the United States. But the Australian government acted swiftly and decisively to prime our economy to ensure that demand continued. To do that, we needed to take out a level of debt. That debt was spent on productive infrastructure and on creating and protecting jobs in our economy.


Examples of that productive infrastructure are well known in my state of New South Wales. If you drive up the Pacific Highway, you will go past the Bulahdelah bypass being built. That is a road construction job that will improve the productivity of the Pacific Highway. You will drive through the Kempsey bypass, the world's longest continuous road bridge. That was built during the period of the previous Labor government using a level of debt. You will go past the Ballina bypass. That was again built during the reign of the Labor government using a level of debt. And you will go past the Woolgoolga, which is being built at the moment. They are all good, productive pieces of infrastructure that are building and growing our economy and creating jobs. That is what the debt was devoted to in our economy. While Labor was government, those opposite were saying that that was an irresponsible position to take. They like to airbrush out of history the effect of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy and the job that Labor did in projecting jobs and building productive infrastructure.


The reason Labor is taking the position that it is taking in this debate is that those opposite have done not one thing to justify the increase in the debt and indeed the removal of the debt ceiling. Picture this: a married couple go into a bank to consult their bank manager. They say to their bank manager that they would like to increase their mortgage, not by a small amount but by 65 per cent. The bank manager says: 'Gee, that's a large increase. Can we see some of your figures? Can we see your income? Can we see records of your current level of debt? Can we see records of any personal debt that you may have—credit cards or any personal loans? And can we see some records of any assets that you own that might be collateral?' And the couple say: 'No, we're not going to supply you with any of that. We just want you to provide us with a 65 per cent increase in our mortgage.' That couple would be laughed out of the bank. And that is exactly what the government is asking the Australian people to do by attempting to increase the level of debt without the proper checks and balances.


On the latest figures that were produced by Labor when in government, gross debt was forecast to peak at $370 billion in 2016. That is why Labor has taken a position of supporting $400 billion worth of debt—$370 billion with a buffer. It is up to those opposite to justify the increase that they want to the Australian public, which to date they have not done. That is why Labor has taken this position.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-12-09,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:44):  We have heard some common sense uttered in this chamber in this debate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Moncrieff, certainly had some good comments to make about why we need to increase the debt ceiling. We have just heard from the member for Hinkler and the member for Mallee. Both made some very good, practical and reasonable comments on why we need to increase the debt ceiling.


We have also heard hypocrisy writ large. We heard that from the member for Kingston, who went on about jobs. Nobody in this chamber is not focused on creating more jobs. But in the last parliament all we ever heard about was the Labor Party protecting their own jobs. Their whole focus was on who would be Prime Minister, who was going to stab whom in the back—it became the focus of the whole 43rd Parliament.


We just heard the member for Kingsford Smith talking about the infrastructure projects that Labor allegedly got on with in the 43rd Parliament. I will admit there were some good infrastructure projects but—certainly in my electorate—there was far too much focus on buying back productive water. He also talked about the Pacific Highway. It is my understanding—and I think I am pretty right here—that under previous coalition governments the split between Commonwealth and state governments was 80:20, but under Labor it became fifty-fifty. So there was more emphasis on the state governments providing that fifty-fifty amount of money, whereas we only required a small input from the state government. We should not politicise the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. It is something that we as governments just need to get on with. Whether the split is 80:20 or fifty-fifty, we just need to improve that road so that people can get on with the business of driving from Queensland to New South Wales without the threat of driving on a goat track—and that is what it is.


We are getting on with the job of having a commission of audit, and we are getting on with the job of a strategic review into the National Broadband Network, because they are necessary. It has been 20 long years since we have had a commission of audit, and it is necessary. The commission is going to assess the current split of roles and responsibilities between state and federal governments, and that is necessary to avoid areas of duplication. It is also necessary to look into every way we can save money, because of the debt and deficit left to us as a legacy from Labor. Under its terms of reference:


The Commission is asked to review and report on the extent, condition and adequacy of Commonwealth sector infrastructure and, if found to be deficient, factors that may have contributed to the current situation and possible remedies.


That is necessary. And it is going to report back to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, something that was not done under Labor—there was no consultation; they just went out, squeezed the life out of the money for the Pacific Highway, bought far too much productive water out of the Murray-Darling Basin and held no cost-benefit analysis into the NBN. Who in business goes into a deal without making sure their money is going to be well spent? No-one does that but Labor, because of lot of them have not been in business, a lot of them have never had to worry about where their next income was going to come from because they have had this history of being in trade unions and this history of coming up through the staff ranks. Not that there's anything wrong with that: unions have a place and there have been any number of political staffers who have become good, contributing members of parliament.


But I put it to you, Deputy Speaker, that sometimes it is good to also listen to those with a world of experience—either in having had a job, having been an employer, or having had to sniff the oily rag and not know where the next dollar was going to come from, or having been in business, or actually having had the responsibility of making sure families could have a future next week and the week after. Not too many of the Labor members who I looked across at when they were in government had that experience, and it is so necessary.


It is so necessary also for us to have this debt ceiling of $500 billion, because of the legacy of debt and deficit that we inherited from Labor. With that, I move:

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (18:23):  I rise to speak on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I say very strongly that this is bad legislation, tabled by a government that is not prepared to take proper steps to protect Australia's environment. The federal government plays an important role in overseeing protection of our environment. This legislation allows the federal government to abrogate its responsibility for the environment to the Australian people, and give the states a much freer hand without properly scrutinising them. 


As a whole, this bill will be giving with one hand and taking with the other. In effect, it removes the legislative requirement for ministers to consider threatened and endangered species when approving projects, while increasing penalties for the illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. On the one hand, they are saying 'We're not going to look at what you're doing' and, on the other hand, they are saying 'We're going to increase the penalties.' It is very difficult to increase penalties in these circumstances, particularly when you look at the history relating to the enforcement of these penalties for the illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. 


Over a number of years, I have been actively involved in looking at issues surrounding the environment. I was a councillor in local government and for a little while was a state member of parliament. I know the problems that are associated with development approvals. Sometimes a project is only properly considered when the federal government looks at the impact a particular action will have on a threatened species. In this case, the minister is moving away from that. Under these changes, a minister can approve a development that causes direct harm to turtles and dugongs, without even considering the impact, while at the same time increasing penalties for others who have harmed these animals. They can, on the one hand, increase the penalties but, on the other hand, take away a minister's responsibility. That is not good enough. As a parliament, we owe it to the Australian people to take these issues a lot more seriously than this legislation does.


It is not just about the federal minister. When plans delegated to approve powers to Queensland and New South Wales come to fruition, Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales and Premier Newman in Queensland will have the power to be relieved of the duty to consider conservation advice before approving projects. Under the legislation, the O'Farrell government—I know a little about its activities and have seen some of the projects that have been approved—will have greater power. This causes me a lot of concern. 


There have been a number of projects within my electorate that I have serious concerns about. If the proposed legislation this parliament will be considering comes into effect, in some cases, state governments will be considering or granting approval for their own projects. That should cause concern for every member of this House, because there are times when self-interest can outweigh the benefit to the community as a whole. We on this side of the House are opposed to the weakening of these powers, because we do not believe that you can trust state governments. I certainly would not trust Barry O'Farrell, who has allowed shooters in national parks, or Campbell Newman, who I would not trust to look after the Great Barrier Reef. 


They are really important assets of our country, and we are prepared to water down the effect of the sanctions, the protections, that are in place. The current penalties for the hunting of dugong, if they reflect anything, are not being used—and here we are increasing them.


We on this side of the House strongly support greater protection for turtles and dugongs, but we do not support the weakening of power. This bill will drastically weaken the EPBC Act in its protection of threatened and endangered species. That comes back to what I was saying when I started my contribution to this debate. There are developments in my electorate that have only been reconsidered or changed because the federal government forced the developers and the approval authorities to look at the threatened and endangered species. This bill removes any capacity to legally challenge an approval on the basis that the advice was not properly considered. It does this retrospectively. Not only are we taking away that power, not only are we saying that it does not matter if everything is not properly considered and that it does not matter if the minister has not taken into account all the issues, but we are doing this retrospectively. I am never comfortable with retrospective legislation and I am particularly uncomfortable with this legislation.


Often in this place we forget how important the environment is. If we do not look after the environment practically every aspect of our lives will be impacted upon. We need to look after the environment; the farmers need to look after the environment because it is about preserving their livelihood; and the tourism industry needs to look after the environment because it is about preserving their livelihood. We are talking about the dugongs and the turtles which are both tourist attractions. If we do not have the proper mechanisms in place and if we do not have the proper legislation in place to ensure the protection of these vital species, our environment and the endangered species, then we are putting a lot at risk.


I cannot support any bill that is going to weaken environmental laws. I think that further down the track those on the other side of the House will look back and say, 'I had the opportunity when I was in federal parliament to ensure that our environment was properly protected. I had the opportunity to see that our endangered species were protected and that the act that covers them was properly enforced. Instead of that, I took the easy way out. I took the way out that allowed me to say: 'Let's abrogate our responsibility. Let's hand it over to the states. By the way, when we hand it over to the states, if they do not take everything into consideration as well, then I suppose that is okay. We'll let them get away with it.' It is all about weakening environmental protection. That is something that we cannot support on this side of the House.


Depending on the type and the location of a project—for example, a new housing estate, or a new mine, or a port expansion—when we look at advice in relation to threatened species, then it could have a really big impact. When the government is preparing to hand over environmental assessments and approvals to state governments like Queensland and New South Wales, it is an even greater worry. The changes in this bill not only mean that the federal minister does not consider expert advice; they also allow state ministers to not consider expert advice. I know there have been some problems in the past, but this is using a sledgehammer to secure a tack.


There has been a lot of commentary on this and it has not been favourable. When the government first touted that it was going to introduce this bill, it was opposed by a number of environmental groups, by people in the community and by people who are experts in the area. It was also highlighted that the proposed changes to the law would be retrospective so that any approval by the minister up until now would be insulated against any type of legal action. The amendments will apply retrospectively to ensure that past decisions are not at risk of being invalid. Cases have been heard time and time again which make the minister and the government of the day a little more accountable. What is the point of even having an environment minister if he is not prepared to listen to advice about the environment? It is very important that advice is sought, that advice is received and that the minister consider that advice. Failure to do so shows that the minister is not serious about his portfolio. It also shows that, rather than look at ways to properly consider issues, the minister is more worried about actions in the Supreme Court or actions that come out of the fact that he has not looked at the issue properly. I think alarm bells are ringing throughout the country, following the introduction of this legislation. I implore the government to think about this a second time.


The bill before us is not good legislation. It is not going to deliver accountable, transparent government to the Australian people. Rather, it is going to deliver a system that will allow the cover-up of bad decisions, it will allow ministers to be very lazy in their approach to the assessment process, it will not ensure the future of endangered species and it will not ensure that the Commonwealth really fulfils its role. There is a lot of talk about green tape and cutting green tape. If cutting green tape means that we do not have proper environmental protection in place, then I think it is bad legislation.


Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I urge you and other members of this House to take a second look at this legislation and to look at ways that proper environmental protection can be put in place. Environmental protection is essential if we are to enjoy a sustainable future. This legislation opens the door for poor decision making and allows both the federal and the state ministers to abrogate their responsibilities completely. It will remove transparency from the process and it will remove accountability. It is legislation that is allowing governments to be lackadaisical. It is poor legislation and it should be rejected by this House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (18:38):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak about the flaws contained in this bill, the Environment Amendment Legislation Bill 2013, which will undoubtedly weaken Australia's environmental protection framework. That framework has been painstakingly assembled, and it will be no surprise to anyone that it has largely been assembled by Labor governments. It is unfortunate that coalition governments at state and federal level, when it comes to the custodianship of Australia's environment, are inclined to err on the side of large commercial interests in relation to finding the right line between development and environmental protection, when it must be said that those commercial interests are quite capable of putting their own best foot forward and it is government's role, without question, to err on the side of environmental protection.


The environment is a part of the global commons that belong to all of us. Government is our representative and our voice in support of its appropriate care and conservation. As other members have noted, this bill essentially permits the minister to have less regard to the advice of conservation experts and it accords that advice much less weight or significance by removing the capacity for a decision made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to be reviewable where a minister has not received or had regard to expert advice. On the face of it, such a change is hard to fathom. It is absolutely right that environmental assessments and decisions relating to development that has environmental impacts ought to be informed and guided by appropriate expert advice. Indeed, if there are shortcomings in the current system, in my view they lie more in the area around issues of independence in terms of professional environmental advice and assessments, especially with regard to those that are commissioned and paid for by development proponents.


The use of the Tarkine case as justification for this bill's weakening of basic environmental and administrative requirements is bewildering. In the Tarkine case the relevant advice was not provided to the minister. It was a departmental process failure, an administrative failure and not in any way a shortcoming of the current framework. Ultimately, the decision in Tarkine cured the administrative failure by requiring that the advice be provided so that it could be considered. This occurred and the decision was then properly taken. I think the average person in the street—the person who in English case law was once referred to as the 'man on the Clapham omnibus'—would see the folly of addressing the administrative shortcomings of a particular decision by altering national law to ensure that any future decision that suffers a similar administrative flaw can effectively be deemed valid.


The requirement that a decision maker have regard to certain facts, criteria, considerations or advice—as is the case under section 139 of the EPBC Act—is a very common feature of a properly structured decision-making process. If the failure to have appropriate regard to such advice has no consequences, what is the point of requiring the provision of such advice in the first place? If decisions that involve significant expertise can be made without regard to expert advice, what confidence can the public have in the quality of government decision making? If the regulatory framework is watered down to such a degree, how can anyone make a reasonable argument that the proper and necessary consideration is being given to environmental conservation and protection?


This bill extends to state governments the weakened scrutiny of potentially unacceptable impacts on the environmental and biodiversity values of an affected area. It will mean that, where a decision is delegated to a state government, the failure to take account of expert advice in making that decision will not affect its validity. Again, one has to ask: what is the point of requiring the provision of expert advice and requiring that it be paid due regard if in fact neither of those things are necessary ingredients of a valid decision?


In my home state of Western Australia we have seen the kind of decision that is made when develop-at-all-cost state governments preside over an insufficiently rigorous environmental assessment and protection process. In fact, we saw a state government decision taken in relation to the James Price Point gas hub proposal on advice from the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority that was formulated despite four of the five EPA board members having recused themselves on the grounds of conflict of interest. The WA Supreme Court ultimately found the EPA and state government processes to have been fatally flawed. Prior to that decision, the EPA chairman, Paul Vogel, tried to allay concerns about the EPA process by reference to the provision of expert advice. He said, 'I actually have access to expert technical and scientific advice across the office of the EPA, the Department of Environment and Conservation and any other agency that I deem necessary to inform my decision.' The message here from the WA EPA chairman is that important decisions affecting the environment must be evidence based. Yet, with the changes that this bill contains, ministers—including state government ministers—will be able to make decisions without having received expert advice.


The coalition government is relying on a simplistic and reductive abhorrence of so-called red tape or green tape in tearing away the kinds of regulatory constraints that have been fashioned over some time and that exist for very good reason. These are the kinds of regulatory restraints that rightly meet the community's expectation that government policy, departments and ministers will rely on evidence, science and expert advice to protect and conserve the environment that we all share and that we all enjoy on trust for future generations. This bill uses a spurious excuse to make changes that abrogate government's responsibility to perform that protective role in relation to Australia's fragile and precious environment.


I would like to associate myself with the eloquent remarks by the member for Wills on this bill to the effect that we should be strengthening rather than weakening the protections in the EPBC Act. The member for Wills referred to many endangered species, including a number of parrots. I am especially pleased that he mentioned one of the most endangered species of all, the beautiful western ground parrot, which is one of the rarest parrots in the world and almost extinct. Unique to Western Australia, there are less than 110 of these parrots left and their numbers are declining fast. It is unspeakably sad to contemplate the extinction of a species, and I pay tribute to the Friends of the Western Ground Parrot for their efforts to raise awareness and funding for the preservation of the western ground parrot. I am also grateful for the contribution to the community debate on the need to strengthen the EPBC Act by the Places You Love campaign, including such organisations as the Australian Conservation Foundation, The Wilderness Society, WWF, state and territory conservation councils, national parks associations and EDOs, as well as many other groups. These organisations represent over 1.5 million Australians, people who love our wildlife, the natural environment and our national parks.


As parliamentarians we have a duty to look after our unique shared natural heritage. When the time comes to leave this place, this should be one of our most important legacies.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (18:46):  I want to thank all of the members for their contribution to the debate on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill provides legal certainty for decisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It provides additional protection for turtles and dugongs under the EPBC Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. The need for these improvements to national environmental law has arisen as a result of recent case law, and, separately, concerns about the illegal poaching and trading of turtles and dugongs.


Let me deal first with the question of the conservation advice amendment. This is actually fixing up a mess caused by the previous government. We are helping them out. There is an existing set of appeals. There could potentially be more based on technicalities. These could cause endless delay without there being any substantive basis for the claims of improper decision making. We know that the other side is in agreement with this. What they are doing at the moment is in breach of what we understood to be the direction they would head. So in good faith we have entered into discussions so as not to delay this—to ensure that there is a sunset clause on this legislation with regard to decisions made by 31 December of this year. In other words, we are covering and protecting all of the decisions made by the previous government and are setting 31 December for the sake of clarity and precision. We are doing that in good faith, and I would hope that members opposite, and in particular the shadow minister opposite, would not act in contravention of the good faith shown, the discussions had and the actions taken.


We are repairing that which was broken under a previous administration and we are not even requiring that this protection apply to us. We are making the decisions properly on our watch. We are making the decisions carefully on our watch. And it is passing strange that the people who made the mess are now opposing others cleaning up their mess. I think that the relevant previous minister and the relevant current opposition shadow minister know that to be the case; they know that it would be utterly inappropriate for them to stand in the way of us cleaning up the mess. Nevertheless, in good faith, we will make sure that this has a sunset clause. I will move an amendment to that effect during the consideration in detail stage. That is a significant move. It places a higher burden on the government and in particular on me as the responsible minister. I am happy to accept that and happy also to make sure that there is no uncertainty in relation to past decisions made by the previous government. It would be a singular act of inappropriate behaviour were they not to honour the steps which were agreed and which were progressed in good faith. I will wait for the opposition to honour that which they had indicated they were going to pursue.


As I just indicated—as the shadow minister enters the chamber—we will, in good faith, put in place a sunset clause of 31 December—no tricks, no games. Therefore, all decisions made by the previous government will be closed and covered and protected against a technical deficiency. On our watch, in our time, on our responsibility we are not seeking that protection for all decisions after 31 December. I think that it is very important to understand that we are setting for ourselves a higher standard than that which we are now putting in place for decisions of the previous administration.


The second part of this bill is in relation to the turtles and dugongs amendments. These amendments implement our election commitment to triple the financial penalties for poaching and illegal transportation of turtle and dugong meat as announced in the dugong and turtle protection plan. The bill amends the EPBC Act and the Marine Park Act to increase criminal and civil financial penalties for killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving a turtle or a dugong in the Commonwealth marine area and for taking or injuring turtles and dugongs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The increased penalties will deter people from committing offences or breaching civil penalty provisions under the act.


I would also note that we will not be accepting the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition for the very reasons I have set out. In good faith, we have offered through the consideration in detail process substantive amendments which will achieve their concerns whilst protecting their decisions. I believe that that is more than the government needed to have done but it is done so there is no delay in this process.


The Greens have indicated that they will be making amendments. We will not be accepting those amendments because that would effectively forestall and destroy the one-stop-shop process. We are in the process of lifting standards around the country. States are coming to us, not going in the other direction. So we are lifting standards. This would hurt standards in the states. It would create unnecessary delay. It would create duplication. And it would fail to help the environment in any way. So I respectfully say to the Leader of the Greens in this House that we will not be accepting those amendments.


Having said that, I commend the bill to the House. I commend it in its original form and I will let the House continue its work.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (18:23):  I rise to speak on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I say very strongly that this is bad legislation, tabled by a government that is not prepared to take proper steps to protect Australia's environment. The federal government plays an important role in overseeing protection of our environment. This legislation allows the federal government to abrogate its responsibility for the environment to the Australian people, and give the states a much freer hand without properly scrutinising them. 


As a whole, this bill will be giving with one hand and taking with the other. In effect, it removes the legislative requirement for ministers to consider threatened and endangered species when approving projects, while increasing penalties for the illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. On the one hand, they are saying 'We're not going to look at what you're doing' and, on the other hand, they are saying 'We're going to increase the penalties.' It is very difficult to increase penalties in these circumstances, particularly when you look at the history relating to the enforcement of these penalties for the illegal hunting of turtles and dugongs. 


Over a number of years, I have been actively involved in looking at issues surrounding the environment. I was a councillor in local government and for a little while was a state member of parliament. I know the problems that are associated with development approvals. Sometimes a project is only properly considered when the federal government looks at the impact a particular action will have on a threatened species. In this case, the minister is moving away from that. Under these changes, a minister can approve a development that causes direct harm to turtles and dugongs, without even considering the impact, while at the same time increasing penalties for others who have harmed these animals. They can, on the one hand, increase the penalties but, on the other hand, take away a minister's responsibility. That is not good enough. As a parliament, we owe it to the Australian people to take these issues a lot more seriously than this legislation does.


It is not just about the federal minister. When plans delegated to approve powers to Queensland and New South Wales come to fruition, Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales and Premier Newman in Queensland will have the power to be relieved of the duty to consider conservation advice before approving projects. Under the legislation, the O'Farrell government—I know a little about its activities and have seen some of the projects that have been approved—will have greater power. This causes me a lot of concern. 


There have been a number of projects within my electorate that I have serious concerns about. If the proposed legislation this parliament will be considering comes into effect, in some cases, state governments will be considering or granting approval for their own projects. That should cause concern for every member of this House, because there are times when self-interest can outweigh the benefit to the community as a whole. We on this side of the House are opposed to the weakening of these powers, because we do not believe that you can trust state governments. I certainly would not trust Barry O'Farrell, who has allowed shooters in national parks, or Campbell Newman, who I would not trust to look after the Great Barrier Reef. 


They are really important assets of our country, and we are prepared to water down the effect of the sanctions, the protections, that are in place. The current penalties for the hunting of dugong, if they reflect anything, are not being used—and here we are increasing them.


We on this side of the House strongly support greater protection for turtles and dugongs, but we do not support the weakening of power. This bill will drastically weaken the EPBC Act in its protection of threatened and endangered species. That comes back to what I was saying when I started my contribution to this debate. There are developments in my electorate that have only been reconsidered or changed because the federal government forced the developers and the approval authorities to look at the threatened and endangered species. This bill removes any capacity to legally challenge an approval on the basis that the advice was not properly considered. It does this retrospectively. Not only are we taking away that power, not only are we saying that it does not matter if everything is not properly considered and that it does not matter if the minister has not taken into account all the issues, but we are doing this retrospectively. I am never comfortable with retrospective legislation and I am particularly uncomfortable with this legislation.


Often in this place we forget how important the environment is. If we do not look after the environment practically every aspect of our lives will be impacted upon. We need to look after the environment; the farmers need to look after the environment because it is about preserving their livelihood; and the tourism industry needs to look after the environment because it is about preserving their livelihood. We are talking about the dugongs and the turtles which are both tourist attractions. If we do not have the proper mechanisms in place and if we do not have the proper legislation in place to ensure the protection of these vital species, our environment and the endangered species, then we are putting a lot at risk.


I cannot support any bill that is going to weaken environmental laws. I think that further down the track those on the other side of the House will look back and say, 'I had the opportunity when I was in federal parliament to ensure that our environment was properly protected. I had the opportunity to see that our endangered species were protected and that the act that covers them was properly enforced. Instead of that, I took the easy way out. I took the way out that allowed me to say: 'Let's abrogate our responsibility. Let's hand it over to the states. By the way, when we hand it over to the states, if they do not take everything into consideration as well, then I suppose that is okay. We'll let them get away with it.' It is all about weakening environmental protection. That is something that we cannot support on this side of the House.


Depending on the type and the location of a project—for example, a new housing estate, or a new mine, or a port expansion—when we look at advice in relation to threatened species, then it could have a really big impact. When the government is preparing to hand over environmental assessments and approvals to state governments like Queensland and New South Wales, it is an even greater worry. The changes in this bill not only mean that the federal minister does not consider expert advice; they also allow state ministers to not consider expert advice. I know there have been some problems in the past, but this is using a sledgehammer to secure a tack.


There has been a lot of commentary on this and it has not been favourable. When the government first touted that it was going to introduce this bill, it was opposed by a number of environmental groups, by people in the community and by people who are experts in the area. It was also highlighted that the proposed changes to the law would be retrospective so that any approval by the minister up until now would be insulated against any type of legal action. The amendments will apply retrospectively to ensure that past decisions are not at risk of being invalid. Cases have been heard time and time again which make the minister and the government of the day a little more accountable. What is the point of even having an environment minister if he is not prepared to listen to advice about the environment? It is very important that advice is sought, that advice is received and that the minister consider that advice. Failure to do so shows that the minister is not serious about his portfolio. It also shows that, rather than look at ways to properly consider issues, the minister is more worried about actions in the Supreme Court or actions that come out of the fact that he has not looked at the issue properly. I think alarm bells are ringing throughout the country, following the introduction of this legislation. I implore the government to think about this a second time.


The bill before us is not good legislation. It is not going to deliver accountable, transparent government to the Australian people. Rather, it is going to deliver a system that will allow the cover-up of bad decisions, it will allow ministers to be very lazy in their approach to the assessment process, it will not ensure the future of endangered species and it will not ensure that the Commonwealth really fulfils its role. There is a lot of talk about green tape and cutting green tape. If cutting green tape means that we do not have proper environmental protection in place, then I think it is bad legislation.


Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I urge you and other members of this House to take a second look at this legislation and to look at ways that proper environmental protection can be put in place. Environmental protection is essential if we are to enjoy a sustainable future. This legislation opens the door for poor decision making and allows both the federal and the state ministers to abrogate their responsibilities completely. It will remove transparency from the process and it will remove accountability. It is legislation that is allowing governments to be lackadaisical. It is poor legislation and it should be rejected by this House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (18:38):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak about the flaws contained in this bill, the Environment Amendment Legislation Bill 2013, which will undoubtedly weaken Australia's environmental protection framework. That framework has been painstakingly assembled, and it will be no surprise to anyone that it has largely been assembled by Labor governments. It is unfortunate that coalition governments at state and federal level, when it comes to the custodianship of Australia's environment, are inclined to err on the side of large commercial interests in relation to finding the right line between development and environmental protection, when it must be said that those commercial interests are quite capable of putting their own best foot forward and it is government's role, without question, to err on the side of environmental protection.


The environment is a part of the global commons that belong to all of us. Government is our representative and our voice in support of its appropriate care and conservation. As other members have noted, this bill essentially permits the minister to have less regard to the advice of conservation experts and it accords that advice much less weight or significance by removing the capacity for a decision made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to be reviewable where a minister has not received or had regard to expert advice. On the face of it, such a change is hard to fathom. It is absolutely right that environmental assessments and decisions relating to development that has environmental impacts ought to be informed and guided by appropriate expert advice. Indeed, if there are shortcomings in the current system, in my view they lie more in the area around issues of independence in terms of professional environmental advice and assessments, especially with regard to those that are commissioned and paid for by development proponents.


The use of the Tarkine case as justification for this bill's weakening of basic environmental and administrative requirements is bewildering. In the Tarkine case the relevant advice was not provided to the minister. It was a departmental process failure, an administrative failure and not in any way a shortcoming of the current framework. Ultimately, the decision in Tarkine cured the administrative failure by requiring that the advice be provided so that it could be considered. This occurred and the decision was then properly taken. I think the average person in the street—the person who in English case law was once referred to as the 'man on the Clapham omnibus'—would see the folly of addressing the administrative shortcomings of a particular decision by altering national law to ensure that any future decision that suffers a similar administrative flaw can effectively be deemed valid.


The requirement that a decision maker have regard to certain facts, criteria, considerations or advice—as is the case under section 139 of the EPBC Act—is a very common feature of a properly structured decision-making process. If the failure to have appropriate regard to such advice has no consequences, what is the point of requiring the provision of such advice in the first place? If decisions that involve significant expertise can be made without regard to expert advice, what confidence can the public have in the quality of government decision making? If the regulatory framework is watered down to such a degree, how can anyone make a reasonable argument that the proper and necessary consideration is being given to environmental conservation and protection?


This bill extends to state governments the weakened scrutiny of potentially unacceptable impacts on the environmental and biodiversity values of an affected area. It will mean that, where a decision is delegated to a state government, the failure to take account of expert advice in making that decision will not affect its validity. Again, one has to ask: what is the point of requiring the provision of expert advice and requiring that it be paid due regard if in fact neither of those things are necessary ingredients of a valid decision?


In my home state of Western Australia we have seen the kind of decision that is made when develop-at-all-cost state governments preside over an insufficiently rigorous environmental assessment and protection process. In fact, we saw a state government decision taken in relation to the James Price Point gas hub proposal on advice from the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority that was formulated despite four of the five EPA board members having recused themselves on the grounds of conflict of interest. The WA Supreme Court ultimately found the EPA and state government processes to have been fatally flawed. Prior to that decision, the EPA chairman, Paul Vogel, tried to allay concerns about the EPA process by reference to the provision of expert advice. He said, 'I actually have access to expert technical and scientific advice across the office of the EPA, the Department of Environment and Conservation and any other agency that I deem necessary to inform my decision.' The message here from the WA EPA chairman is that important decisions affecting the environment must be evidence based. Yet, with the changes that this bill contains, ministers—including state government ministers—will be able to make decisions without having received expert advice.


The coalition government is relying on a simplistic and reductive abhorrence of so-called red tape or green tape in tearing away the kinds of regulatory constraints that have been fashioned over some time and that exist for very good reason. These are the kinds of regulatory restraints that rightly meet the community's expectation that government policy, departments and ministers will rely on evidence, science and expert advice to protect and conserve the environment that we all share and that we all enjoy on trust for future generations. This bill uses a spurious excuse to make changes that abrogate government's responsibility to perform that protective role in relation to Australia's fragile and precious environment.


I would like to associate myself with the eloquent remarks by the member for Wills on this bill to the effect that we should be strengthening rather than weakening the protections in the EPBC Act. The member for Wills referred to many endangered species, including a number of parrots. I am especially pleased that he mentioned one of the most endangered species of all, the beautiful western ground parrot, which is one of the rarest parrots in the world and almost extinct. Unique to Western Australia, there are less than 110 of these parrots left and their numbers are declining fast. It is unspeakably sad to contemplate the extinction of a species, and I pay tribute to the Friends of the Western Ground Parrot for their efforts to raise awareness and funding for the preservation of the western ground parrot. I am also grateful for the contribution to the community debate on the need to strengthen the EPBC Act by the Places You Love campaign, including such organisations as the Australian Conservation Foundation, The Wilderness Society, WWF, state and territory conservation councils, national parks associations and EDOs, as well as many other groups. These organisations represent over 1.5 million Australians, people who love our wildlife, the natural environment and our national parks.


As parliamentarians we have a duty to look after our unique shared natural heritage. When the time comes to leave this place, this should be one of our most important legacies.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (18:46):  I want to thank all of the members for their contribution to the debate on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill provides legal certainty for decisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It provides additional protection for turtles and dugongs under the EPBC Act and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. The need for these improvements to national environmental law has arisen as a result of recent case law, and, separately, concerns about the illegal poaching and trading of turtles and dugongs.


Let me deal first with the question of the conservation advice amendment. This is actually fixing up a mess caused by the previous government. We are helping them out. There is an existing set of appeals. There could potentially be more based on technicalities. These could cause endless delay without there being any substantive basis for the claims of improper decision making. We know that the other side is in agreement with this. What they are doing at the moment is in breach of what we understood to be the direction they would head. So in good faith we have entered into discussions so as not to delay this—to ensure that there is a sunset clause on this legislation with regard to decisions made by 31 December of this year. In other words, we are covering and protecting all of the decisions made by the previous government and are setting 31 December for the sake of clarity and precision. We are doing that in good faith, and I would hope that members opposite, and in particular the shadow minister opposite, would not act in contravention of the good faith shown, the discussions had and the actions taken.


We are repairing that which was broken under a previous administration and we are not even requiring that this protection apply to us. We are making the decisions properly on our watch. We are making the decisions carefully on our watch. And it is passing strange that the people who made the mess are now opposing others cleaning up their mess. I think that the relevant previous minister and the relevant current opposition shadow minister know that to be the case; they know that it would be utterly inappropriate for them to stand in the way of us cleaning up the mess. Nevertheless, in good faith, we will make sure that this has a sunset clause. I will move an amendment to that effect during the consideration in detail stage. That is a significant move. It places a higher burden on the government and in particular on me as the responsible minister. I am happy to accept that and happy also to make sure that there is no uncertainty in relation to past decisions made by the previous government. It would be a singular act of inappropriate behaviour were they not to honour the steps which were agreed and which were progressed in good faith. I will wait for the opposition to honour that which they had indicated they were going to pursue.


As I just indicated—as the shadow minister enters the chamber—we will, in good faith, put in place a sunset clause of 31 December—no tricks, no games. Therefore, all decisions made by the previous government will be closed and covered and protected against a technical deficiency. On our watch, in our time, on our responsibility we are not seeking that protection for all decisions after 31 December. I think that it is very important to understand that we are setting for ourselves a higher standard than that which we are now putting in place for decisions of the previous administration.


The second part of this bill is in relation to the turtles and dugongs amendments. These amendments implement our election commitment to triple the financial penalties for poaching and illegal transportation of turtle and dugong meat as announced in the dugong and turtle protection plan. The bill amends the EPBC Act and the Marine Park Act to increase criminal and civil financial penalties for killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving a turtle or a dugong in the Commonwealth marine area and for taking or injuring turtles and dugongs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The increased penalties will deter people from committing offences or breaching civil penalty provisions under the act.


I would also note that we will not be accepting the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition for the very reasons I have set out. In good faith, we have offered through the consideration in detail process substantive amendments which will achieve their concerns whilst protecting their decisions. I believe that that is more than the government needed to have done but it is done so there is no delay in this process.


The Greens have indicated that they will be making amendments. We will not be accepting those amendments because that would effectively forestall and destroy the one-stop-shop process. We are in the process of lifting standards around the country. States are coming to us, not going in the other direction. So we are lifting standards. This would hurt standards in the states. It would create unnecessary delay. It would create duplication. And it would fail to help the environment in any way. So I respectfully say to the Leader of the Greens in this House that we will not be accepting those amendments.


Having said that, I commend the bill to the House. I commend it in its original form and I will let the House continue its work.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (21:00):  In this, the last adjournment debate of the year, I would like to offer my thanks and give credit to the people of Shortland electorate. I thank them very much for placing their faith in me and for re-electing me at the last election, and I give them a guarantee that I will deliver to them. I know that health, education and the environment are all very high priorities for the people of the electorate that I represent, and I will work to see that we have a strong, safe and inclusive society. Unfortunately, over the last 12 months, my office has been inundated with constituents who have raised state government issues with me. I do not believe that the state members within Shortland electorate have a common goal with me and share my desire to deliver to the people of the area.


Be it the Department of Housing, the police, education or health, the story is the same: the state member is unavailable to assist. Recently, there has been the issue of GST on residential parks. Members on both sides of this parliament have expressed concern that residents living in these residential parks may be forced to pay a GST on their rental. That is very unlike the response of state members in my area to the new residential parks laws that the New South Wales government have put in place. People have been very disturbed by the way it has been handled, and the state members have been missing in action when residents have wished to talk to them. There is a chronic shortage of social housing, and the O'Farrell government is responding by selling housing stock. Surely this will make the housing crisis even worse.


The people of Swansea have been battling to have their police station operating for 24 hours a day for a very long time. Unfortunately, even though the state member promised the people of Swansea prior to the last state election that he would ensure that the police station was operating 24 hours a day, he still has not delivered. 


Belmont police station is being upgraded—I congratulate the O'Farrell government on choosing to upgrade Belmont police station and Belmont courthouse—and the police from there are to be moved on a temporary basis to Swansea. There has been a 12-month process during which approval for the redevelopment has been stuck in a position where nothing has happened. I made some inquiries as to why this was the case. Was it a council hold-up? We all have problems from time to time with councils being a little bit slow. But, no, the problem was that the O'Farrell government was not giving the information to the local council, even though they had requested it. I am very hopeful that that will happen soon. But once the police station has been upgraded I have great fears that Swansea may not even have a police station. I can see that the O'Farrell government will sell it off just the way they are currently selling off the education office in Swansea. The district education office is in the process of closing down and moving into inner Newcastle because the state O'Farrell government is selling the building. It is a very sad state of affairs. Fire stations have been taken off-line, leaving communities at risk. The O'Farrell government has been selling off all of the electricity stocks. In Newcastle, the Port of Newcastle has been sold.


When Labor was in government they invested in health. They gave $20 billion to the states to address shortages. In New South Wales, money is being taken out of the system. Staff are being treated appallingly. Staff working at John Hunter hospital have been told that they can only use UHT milk, and the waiting lists continue to grow. The way that the O'Farrell government has handled workers compensation in New South Wales and the way that they have really disadvantaged workers is appalling. There is one young woman that I have been working with over a long period of time. All she needs is a back operation, yet the changes to the workers compensation laws make it impossible. I think it is appalling that the state government refuses to treat the people of Shortland electorate with the respect that they deserve.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:31):  I rise today to speak about a very important issue for my local community—that is, the future federal funding that was committed to the planned upgrade of Bice Oval in Christies Beach. The former federal Labor government promised to contribute $600,000 for a much-needed upgrade to this popular community facility, if re-elected. I worked hard with the local clubs at Bice Oval to secure this pledge for a number of refurbishments—including the much-needed upgrade of change rooms, which desperately need an overhaul. The fact that there is inadequate lighting also restricts the use of this very popular facility, which many clubs use on a daily basis. The funding would mean a brand-new change room could be constructed on the oval and it would mean sufficient lighting could be installed to allow for night sport to be played. Regrettably, following the election of the Abbott government, the future of this funding remains in doubt. My correspondence to the Minister of sport remains unanswered: two letters seeking urgent confirmation that this project can proceed as planned, one dated 2 October 2013 and one dated 28 November 2013. These letters have been completely ignored. All of the fantastic sporting clubs that call Bice Oval home, including the Christies Beach Football Club, the Southern District Cricket Club and the Christies Beach Sports and Social Club, are now calling on the Abbott government to listen to the community and honour the pledge.


The president of the Southern District Cricket Club, Harvey Jolly, has said that the upgrade would benefit hundreds of locals in our community who come together every week to play at Bice Oval, to watch a game, or to train there. There is much junior development sport there. This funding would also show that the federal government recognises local-level sport as an important contribution to local communities. The time has come now for the Minister for Sport to listen to the close to 500 local residents who have signed my petition on change.org calling for this funding to be delivered. I am a big supporter of local sporting groups in my community. I know just how important this funding is, both to the players and to the organisers, which is why I will continue to push for this commitment from the Abbott government to that $600,000 for this much-needed upgrade.



Despite the change of government, I will continue to lobby on behalf of local sporting groups. The Abbott government needs to show us that they are serious about investing in local communities and supporting local sporting clubs. Regrettably, there are a number of projects—this is just one in my local community—that have been put on hold indefinitely or scrapped following the election of the Abbott government. The government is not doing its job in our local community. I will continue to hold the government to account and ensure that they deliver not only to the Bice Oval project but also on many others.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:06):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes with alarm the burden placed on the bushfire affected residents of the Blue Mountains and Central Coast via the combined mismanagement of recovery processes by the Australian and New South Wales governments;


(2) acknowledges that while emergency personnel and volunteers acted swiftly and bravely to minimise the impact of the horrific October fires, the Australian and New South Wales governments have made decisions that have hurt families and businesses in the aftermath of the fires, namely:


(a) failing to extend full disaster relief support payments;


(b) presiding over a poorly executed response to the clean-up process; and


(c) breaking a promise by failing to provide consequential concessional loans to small businesses struggling to recover after the fires; and


(3) calls on both the Australian and New South Wales governments to urgently act to remedy this situation and assist homes and businesses to fully recover in a quicker timeframe.


I rise on an issue of prime importance to the people of the Blue Mountains in the wake of the devastating bushfires in October. It is now 53 days since these bushfires occurred. It remains evident that those affected by the bushfires, many of whom were left homeless, have been abandoned by the federal government. The clean-up effort has been tardy and the government has walked away from its commitment to meet consequential damage concessional loans to small businesses in the Blue Mountains—in particular, to tourism businesses in this internationally famous place of beauty, which have been crippled. Some business operators are reporting that revenue is down 80 per cent. Householders, left sifting through the ruins of their much loved properties, have had the body blow of being told they need to sign waivers accepting liability for the clean-up of their sites.


What is particularly disturbing about the entire saga is that it appears that little has been learnt from the devastating Victorian and Tasmanian bushfires when it comes to the disaster recovery effort. In Victoria, for example, some 2,000 homes were caught up in the raging fires, 10 times the number that were devastatingly lost in the Blue Mountains in October. In Victoria, a contract was enforced to have the debris cleaned up in 21 days, and that was with more homes affected. In Tasmania, where around the same number of properties were claimed by the bushfires as those in the Blue Mountains, the equivalent contract demanded the clean-up be completed within eight days.


I repeat: the Blue Mountains fires raged 53 days ago and the clean-up effort is at a bureaucratic crawl—and the Liberal Party has led this crawl. Governments demand plenty of their citizens, who pay their taxes, pay their levies and pay their school fees. So, when disaster strikes, it behoves government to support their own in a time of need—not to make promises and then walk away from responsibility. But, I hasten to add, this has happened in the Blue Mountains in the wake of these fires. The buck-passing has been there for everyone to see. It has been the governmental order of the day that devastated families and businesses have been the collateral damage. There have been few sadder and more heart-wrenching sights than watching families in the Blue Mountains return to what is left of everything they had—their homes—to sift through the rubble to find whatever they can take away to remind them of what they had; in some cases, it is the smallest trinket. What they did not need after that was to be left wondering what was going to happen next in their lives. They were left in a no-man's land between levels of government that could not or would not show leadership in this time of crisis.


For the federal government to impose new and restrictive criteria on government disaster recovery payments, as per the regime upheld by the Labor government previously, is mean spirited to say the least.



Mrs Markus interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Member for Macquarie, you may have private views on the changes to these processes but I have not heard you stand up and criticise your government on the way it has treated people in the past. I do not say these words lightly. As the record shows, when my party has been in government I have stood up to demand better for the people I am proud to represent. If you have any issue with the way that disaster recovery is being delivered, then you have a prime opportunity to speak up for the people of Macquarie in this chamber and demand that it is improved. It should be better. I read through the statistics and it has taken 53 days for the recovery process to get underway—and that is after what we have seen in Tasmania and Victoria. I have previously given credit to the federal government when they have lent people a hand. For instance, I was very quick to support the Filipino-Australian community—whom I now represent and you previously represented—after Typhoon Haiyan. Australia has been a fantastically generous international citizen. We do spend hundreds of millions on international aid where it is needed, but people also want to see the same speedy response that the Abbott government has given to Haiyan extended to the Blue Mountains. This is a classic case where the government has gone to great lengths to be seen doing the right thing internationally, but it needs to do more on our local patch. 


I have previously mentioned the onerous restrictions on the clean-up effort, whereby the New South Wales Liberal government threw the ball to insurance companies, saying, 'You run with it'. That meant the recovery effort stalled, leaving affected home and business owners nowhere to turn. The responsibility, or at least the liability, for the clean-up was forced on property owners who were required to sign a legally-binding waiver. It is just more buck-passing by the coalition government. Only in recent days has this, fortunately, changed with the government agreeing to cover the costs of removing concrete slabs, for instance, where homeowners have decided to rebuild on a different footprint. In Tasmania and Victoria they seem to have got their recovery right, with a single contractor charged with organising and handling the clean-up and recovery effort. In New South Wales it looks as if it has taken longer for those lessons to sink in. This motion, in part, calls on the New South Wales government to engage in a single contract to fund the total clean-up and later to engage individual insurers to recoup funds that have been outlaid. It should have been done from the start. A lot of heartache could have been avoided; a whole lot of angst and bad blood could have been sidestepped. 


The second area of concern is the treatment of small business operators in the Blue Mountains. Some operators, of which there are thousands, have reported downturns of up to 80 per cent. At the height of the fires people from outside the Blue Mountains were rightly told to stay away and there was a mass exodus of residents fleeing the fire grounds. The few roads that remained open were clogged with fire trucks and other emergency services vehicles frantically trying to limit the impact of these blazes. The financial pain for business operators has lingered: there will not be the annual throng of visitors to the tourist spots over the holiday season and so the businesses are not recovering. To add salt to the wounds of those affected, a muddled assistance regime from the federal government has effectively benefited businesses that lost trade on the fringes of the worst areas but nothing has been offered to those business operators whose properties were consumed by the fires. So, I ask the federal government: why? Where are the small business consequential damage concessional grants to these poor folk? Why have they been left with nowhere to turn? Their only instructions have been to deal with an insurer. This is not what good governments do. It is particularly ironic given that the Liberal Party prides itself on looking after business. As I have said many times in this place in recent weeks, it said one thing before the election and another thing after it—not just on school funding, but also on the Blue Mountains disaster and small business assistance packages. My colleague Senator Doug Cameron has put a great deal of effort fighting for the people of the Blue Mountains after these fires, and he estimates the federal government has perhaps ripped $4 million from small business assistance in the form of promised grants. Senator Cameron has put the microscope on the recovery effort in an area where, he knows too well, the state and federal governments have been found wanting. The finger of blame can be pointed even further down the line. I have heard of cases where residents were desperate to clear properties as the fire approached and took vegetation to the local waste management site only to be told they were required to pay more than $100 to offload a trailer of green vegetation. It is simply not right.


My electorate of Chifley sits close by. We could read about and see the fires, but we could also smell them and see the ash falling around us in Western Sydney. I take this opportunity to praise the brave efforts of the many emergency services workers and the RFS brigades in our area. The firefighters on the ground put themselves in great danger to limit the impact of these fires. There are three brigades in my area—Shanes Park, Eastern Creek and Plumpton. I understand that Plumpton put in 2,700 man-hours of work to help with the management of these blazes. Police managed traffic to avoid what could have been absolute chaos when ambulance officers were treating the injured and the smoke affected or those who were just plain exhausted. It is a testament to the skill of the emergency services workers that lives were not lost on a grand scale in October.


The harshness and ruggedness of Australia are features we are internationally famous for; they can also be our greatest enemy. No matter how many precautions are put in place, we do experience these terrible incidents where nature works violently against us. It pains me to see the efforts of volunteers who take time off work being undermined because of bureaucratic shifting from one level of government to another. I fully agree with the seven points in the motion. Recovery efforts have to be coordinated and improved, and they have to happen sooner rather than later. The dollar figure has to be sorted out properly and the penny-pinching by state and federal governments has to end now. The federal election has come and gone, but the suffering of the people still lingers. They should not be forced to endure any more.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:17):  I rise to speak on the private member's motion moved by the member for Chifley. Firstly, to the member for Shortland, on behalf of my constituents, can I extend our deepest regret for what you and your community have experienced. Having walked the journey with my community over recent months, I want to extend to you our thoughts. I particularly extend condolences to the family and friends of Walter Linder. In the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury we experienced significant devastation and loss, but, fortunately, there has been no loss of life, which is miraculous.


It is of deep sadness to me that the member for Chifley would seek to criticise and politicise at a time when the people of my community are trying to rebuild after what has been a devastating and traumatic two months. It has been my observation that those opposite are seeking to play politics with the emotions, minds and hearts of people rather than reaching out and providing help where it is needed. During the recent bushfires, the Leader of the Opposition was quoted during a press conference as saying, 'Matters such as these emergencies are above politics.' I am disappointed that the behaviour of Senator Doug Cameron and others opposite has proved this statement false. I do not have time now to list every time I have seen the senator behave in a very inappropriate fashion, particularly to my community, who are suffering at this time.


The impacts of the bushfires in my electorate of Macquarie have been significant. Two hundred and eight homes have been lost, with another 191 damaged. All three major fires—the Linksview Road fire, the Mount York Road fire and the State Mine fire—have resulted in significant damage and loss throughout the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, and the impacts will be felt for some time to come. The fires hit hardest on 17 October. At the time, I was with my own local fire brigade getting ready to hop on a truck to head up to Bilpin when the seriousness of what was happening at Springwood began to unfold. I had to meander my way around closed roads and so on to reach the affected people at the Springwood evacuation centre, where I spent most of that evening with families, emergency services and NGOs.


Early Friday was a very emotional time. Escorted by police, I stood with members of the community in front of their destroyed and damaged homes, and many of these people are facing their own challenges already. In fact, there was one young mum whose daughter was in the hospital for that week for serious surgery, and while that was happening and her focus needed to be there she was losing her home.


Since that terrible day, I have been witness to the significant loss and hardship for the people of my community and have done my best to respond with whatever assistance is needed on the ground. What this motion fails to recognise is the incredible response on the ground by both the federal and state governments within the first hours and days following the disaster, not to mention the response by the community. I wish to enlighten the member opposite, as I failed to see him during this time. In the first 24 hours following 17 October, I was joined by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services on the ground in Springwood and Winmalee. In fact, the Minister for Human Services spent close to a week there, making sure that all the services that were required on the ground were there. The Minister for Human Services was quick to assess what was needed for families and acted appropriately. A mobile Centrelink was set up at Summerhayes Park in Winmalee. We had to ask them to move it as the fires came quite perilously close; it was an emergency that went on for more than 10 days. Centrelink officers were stationed at all evacuation centres as well as at every local Centrelink office. They were open all weekend.


On 18 October the state government announced the appointment of Phil Koperberg to lead the recovery efforts and the team. On 21 October, the Blue Mountains Bushfire Recovery Committee was established to begin work. Both the local member and I were part of this. On 22 October the recovery centre opened in Springwood. The centre has been a one-stop shop for Blue Mountains recovery, for all agencies and for people to access on a daily basis. Included in that recovery centre from the first day it opened were representatives from Centrelink, the tax office, other government departments, the Salvation Army and other NGOs providing vital services to people that were experiencing a very tough time and still do today.


I would like to address the false and misleading claims made by the member for Chifley and to point out the following information regarding disaster relief payments which have been activated: within 24 hours the federal government activated the Australian government disaster recovery payment so that those who had been most severely affected could get assistance right away. The disaster recovery payment allows families who have been severely affected by the fires, those who have a lost or damaged house, have been severely injured or have lost a loved one—fortunately we lost no-one—to access payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. For the first time ever we activated the disaster recovery allowance, which provides 13 weeks of income support to those who have lost income as a result of the bushfires. Labor failed to do this. The disaster recovery payment is designed to be flexible assistance.


Labor's claim that the payments were removed is false and, in fact, seems to be criticising their own approach given that when in government Labor have also adopted this approach by activating different criteria for different disasters. In fact, Labor used the same eligibility criteria that we have put in place on five occasions while they were in government: in January 2008 for storms and flooding in Mackay; in February 2008 for flooding in Mackay; in November 2008 for storms in Queensland; in May 2009 for storms and flooding in south-east Queensland and New South Wales; and in March 2010 for storms in Victoria. Labor have incorrectly stated that we did not activate the payment for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the fires. Along with this, I have been approached by a member of the public who witnessed Senator Cameron at the recovery centre approach a distraught resident and hassle them about the disaster recovery payments—very inappropriate. This behaviour should be absolutely condemned.


Let me bring some very important figures to the attention of those opposite. I have the latest figures, as of 5 December, from the Department of Human Services. For the AGDRP, the number of claims finalised is 764, at $833,600. For the disaster recovery allowance, 44 claims have been finalised, with the payments reaching $21,977. The cumulative number of calls to the Australian Government Emergency Information Line is more than 1,000. These figures do not include the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, nor do they include the raft of other measures: fast-tracking of tax refunds by the Australian Taxation Office; waived passport fees and streamlined processing of replacement passports; free mail redirection from Australia Post; and access to essential PBS medicines under the arrangement between the Department of Health and local pharmacists.


Following the impact of the initial emergency, the area of the Blue Mountains is now well into the recovery-and-clean-up phase. This is a very important phase. On 14 November 2013, the Minister for Justice made a joint announcement with the NSW government that we would be sharing the cost of cleaning up and removing debris from the bushfire affected properties in the Blue Mountains. This additional financial support came after an initial $1.4 million commitment by the state government, which funded urgent work to make safe sites containing asbestos in the bushfire zone. I also acknowledge that the Army was present on the ground, emptying unfenced pools, removing unsafe trees and also making sites safe in the weeks that followed. By taking these methodical steps in partnership with insurers, the state government is ensuring that 100 per cent of a homeowner's insurance payout is directed towards rebuilding, not spent on the clean-up.


Since the announcement on 14 November, the government has worked to move efficiently throughout this process, and it is estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of debris will be removed from the Blue Mountains. Based on similar tragedies in other jurisdictions, the clean-up operation could take months. It took five months to clear properties following the Tasmanian fires in 2012.


Let me also talk briefly about the business assistance that is available. We are absolutely 100 per cent committed to delivering on the $100,000 concessional interest rate loans. There is also additional assistance for businesses that are affected. Already, small businesses whose assets have been directly damaged by New South Wales fires may be eligible for concessional interest rate loans of up to $130,000. There is also additional assistance available from various sources. We also provided a holiday from PAYG.


We are progressing the $100,000 concessional loan as quickly as possible. Labor for six years failed to implement this. They never came up with that idea, nor did they attempt to deliver it. We are getting on with the job. We are committed to supporting our local communities throughout this whole process. There is no quick fix for recovering from a natural disaster of this magnitude.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (11:27):  On Thursday, 17 October, fires devastated the Central Coast and the southern part of Shortland electorate, just as they did the Blue Mountains, and I pass on my condolences and support to the people of the Blue Mountains area. In Shortland electorate, it had enormous impact on the people who lived there, on their homes and on their lives. Thousands of people had to be evacuated from their homes. During the evacuation they were forced to move to evacuation centres either at Doyalson or at Swansea, and these areas were also without electricity for a long period of time. As the member previously mentioned, there was loss of life as well as loss of property. Nowhere near the number of houses was lost in the Shortland electorate as was lost in the Blue Mountains, but the suffering of people in that area was quite significant.


When the electricity was disconnected and people were forced to leave their homes, it caused a loss of food. One of my constituents, Bianca Uicich, lives in Catherine Hill Bay, where water has to be brought into the area because there is no town water, so her water was used to fight the fires. After she was allowed back home, she had to throw out everything that she had in her freezer and at the same time had to pay to get new water to drink and use in the house. On investigation—and this is very significant because Bianca is a student; she is studying education at the University of Newcastle—I was absolutely astounded to find out that she could not access the AGDR payment because, unlike on previous occasions, that was only going to be paid to somebody who lost their home or lost their life.


There were some people at Catherine Hill Bay who lost their homes, and they accessed it. People like Ken Marples, who lost absolutely everything, received the $1,000 payment, but, unfortunately, I had to link him into charities in the area, because that $1,000 does very little to help sustain him.


I am astounded that this payment is not being made to families. There were a number of people who have contacted my office about this. People have been absolutely devastated by the fires. I think this it is not a time for blaming. I was a bit disappointed with the member across the chamber's contribution. I think it is a time that we should all join together and fight to get these things for our constituents. We really need to do that.



A government member interjecting—  




Ms HALL:
  What the member for Chifley is trying to do is actually pull the government onside so that people who have lost thousands and thousands of dollars, who may not have any coverage from insurance companies, can get a payment with some dignity; people who slept on the floor of recreation centres, people who then had to turn around, go home and clean up their houses; people who may not have had their house burn down but still suffered significant losses. I think that the role of government is to support them. 


The government's response initially in the Shortland electorate was good. But they have definitely failed the people of Shortland when it comes to emergency payments to help them cover the financial losses that they had at the time, to help them get on with their lives and to take up where they left off. It is not good enough that we get weasel words from the minister about why it cannot happen. What we should all be doing here in this parliament is saying that we want the best for our constituents.

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (11:32):  I rise to speak on private members' business relating to the government's response to the Blue Mountains and Central Coast bushfires. It is a shame, and I will say that I am shocked that the member for Chifley neglected to point out in his motion that the bushfires also very much affected the Lithgow region, a very important part of Calare. 


I am also shocked that somebody like the member for Chifley, who would not know what a bushfire was if it bit him on the backside, would get up and say this. I realise he is young and ambitious and wants to make a name for himself, but this is not the way to do it. I am pretty disgusted, to be honest. 


I concede that what happened in my part of the world was nowhere near as bad as what happened in the electorate of Macquarie or the Blue Mountains, which was horrific. It was an amazing thing that there was no loss of life. But there were enormous losses to people. In my part of the world we lost half a dozen homes or so, but it was nothing like what happened further up in the mountains. Even so, we did lose about 30,000 square kilometres, burnt out, but the member for Chifley would not really be aware of those sorts of things.


I spoke about the local response in parliament only a few weeks ago. I have to say again that it is a shame that the opposition are trying to make political points when this fire was as well-run as any I have seen. In my part of the world, I have to say that the response by the bushfire brigade, particularly the rural bushfire section, did an extremely good job. They worked with the council, the police and everybody. It was as good as anything I have seen. They could focus on joining with us, both federal and state governments, to help those communities rebuild, repair and regenerate. 


As my colleague the member for Macquarie has already mentioned we are committed to working with the state—in fact, we are contributing half of the cost of recovery. That covers things including the demolition of damaged houses and removal of debris, as well as emergency food, clothing and accommodation for people impacted by the bushfires.


About the clean-up: I know that the Army obviously has a part to play in this. At the minute the railway contacted me about their problems I put the Army in contact with them, and they made themselves available to them to help to the nth degree.


During the height of the fire threat for the Lithgow region I visited the various centres in town and I can, as I have already said, attest to the support that was being provided by everybody. The 23 RAAF Base Glenbrook volunteers assisted with the clean-up at the Zig Zag Railway at Lithgow. They sorted bushfire-damaged scrap and salvageable items. Further assistance was available locally from the RAAF Base at Glenbrook, and non-emergency Defence assistance to the civil community could also be provided.


In general, the Australian government has activated the disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance—obviously with the payment being the immediate payment and the allowance continuing on for weeks for those who have lost income as a result of the bushfires. Sadly, I know one person who is very aware of what bushfires can do, and it is a bit rich for the opposition to criticise when it was actually the Howard government who designed the disaster recovery payment to be a flexible assistance measure. When in government, Labor also adopted this approach by activating different criteria for different disasters. Small businesses whose assets have been directly damaged by the bushfires may also be eligible for concessional interest rate loans of up to $130,000, jointly provided by New South Wales and the Commonwealth.


Our government will do what it should do for people who are affected by fire which, by its suddenness and what it does, is worse than flood and drought. I come from a part of the world which was probably the most bushfire affected in New South Wales back in the seventies, eighties and nineties. It does not seem to have had so many lately—maybe the seasons have not been quite as good.


I stand by what the government has done and will do so in the future. I am absolutely disgusted that somebody who is young and wants to make a name for himself wants to make a name for himself like this.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:37):  The bushfires that affected the Blue Mountains, Lithgow and the Central Coast regions of New South Wales in October and November this year were truly devastating. At the outset I want to join with my Labor colleagues in acknowledging the tremendous work of our emergency service personnel and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, including the thousands of volunteers that helped limit the devastation that was wrought across the state.


While my electorate of Newcastle was spared extensive damage, blazes in Salt Ash and those that came perilously close to our airport and the RAAF base at Williamtown were worrying, and certainly affected a number of residents and businesses. My neighbouring electorate of Shortland experienced major fires in the Gateshead and Catherine Hill Bay areas, and my colleague Jill Hall has worked tirelessly to support her constituents at this time of need.


Hundreds of properties were under threat from the various blazes for a number of weeks. However, thanks to the preparation and mitigation work before the blazes hit, and the tremendous response efforts of various bodies, few properties were in fact lost. The community of Catherine Hill Bay, just south of Newcastle, was not totally spared, and did lose a number of historic properties and businesses, notably Woollahra House, an 1887-built homestead that was on the market to be sold for the first time, was destroyed. And a service station on the link road between the Central Coast and Newcastle—more famous, perhaps, for its giant prawn that its petrol—was also destroyed.


Aside from the recognition already given to the Rural Fire Service, I would also like to make special note of one of the forgotten heroes of disaster management, the RSPCA. They played an important role in the evacuation and care of domestic animals and wildlife, creating specialised services at evacuation centres reuniting pets and owners that had been separated because of the fires.


Make no mistake, however, the fire mitigation and response activities helped to limit the loss of property and life. The weather forecasting and other early warning systems developed by CSIRO helped residents prepare their properties and evacuate dangerous areas well before fires hit. CSIRO's forecasting is now so precise that I have no doubt their skills and expertise have saved many properties and lives.


As already acknowledged, the disaster response efforts of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service and other emergency bodies also saved property and lives. On the other hand, the recovery effort in New South Wales has been haphazard and continues to cause trauma to the lives of hundreds of residents and local businesses.


It is with dismay that I stand here today to speak on this motion. It has been more than 50 days since the bushfires raged through New South Wales and, to a large extent, the clean-up effort has only just commenced. Squabbling between state and federal governments has prolonged the trauma for residents and businesses, and it has to stop. Action is required. I note that efforts have been made over the past few days to commence the demolition, clearing and rubble removal that is required to start the rebuilding process, but it has taken far too long and the process has been flawed.


Residents traumatised by the loss of their homes and possessions had to take to the media in order to get things moving and to have their cases dealt with properly. The mental and physical trauma experienced by those affected residents and businesses cannot be quantified. However, the economic costs can be.


Blue Mountains, Lithgow and Oberon Tourism have estimated the region is down $47 million in revenue already. Their estimates show day trips alone have dropped by more than 144,000, resulting in flow-on losses of about $13 million for local businesses. Small businesses are the lifeblood of these communities but their recovery is being held back. Just last week the Minister for Small Business wrote to my Labor colleague Senator Doug Cameron confirming the circumstances in which disaster recovery payments are made available. I quote: 'People who have significant hardship, including the loss of a loved one and serious injury, or those whose homes have been significantly damaged or destroyed, are to be the priority areas.'


Minister, I can assure you that the small businesses of the Blue Mountains and the Central Coast are going through significant hardship and could benefit from the full range of disaster relief payments including, as promised, the consequential concessional loans to small businesses struggling to recover after the fires.


As a nation, we are getting much better at prevention and mitigation. But we need to remedy this situation to assist everyone to fully recover as soon as possible. That is the intent of this motion. (Time expired)

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (11:42):  I rise in opposition to the member for Chifley's private member's motion relating to the government response in supporting those residents in New South Wales who were adversely affected by the recent bushfires. I would like to start by commending the work of the rural bushfire brigade and the emergency services that went above and beyond the call of duty to help so many people across the region. My electorate of Lindsay neighbours that of Macquarie. It was within my own electorate that I witnessed firsthand the commitment and the work of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Services and the Minister for Justice, coordinated by the state member for Macquarie, where they provided help, support and assistance to the people of the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. Their on-the-ground work, alongside each other, ensured the Australian government's response to this disaster was swift and that those who needed our support got it without delay. I would also like to commend my local community groups in the Lindsay region, including the Penrith Panthers, which housed 1,500 firefighters throughout the entire ordeal. 


I would like to remind those opposite that, with regard to disaster recovery payment eligibility criteria, the Howard government designed the disaster recovery payment to be a flexible assistance measure. When in government, Labor also adopted this approach by activating different criteria for different disasters. In fact, Labor used the same eligibility criteria that have been put in place on five occasions whilst they were in government. Labor incorrectly said that the coalition did not activate the payment for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed. This and other comments made by Labor on the issue have been misleading and should be condemned. Over the weekend following the initial fire emergency on Thursday, 17 October 2013, the Department of Human Services opened its service centres in Springwood, Katoomba, Raymond Terrace, Charlestown and Wyong. The department's mobile service centre was also operating throughout the Springwood area, including Winmalee—the epicentre of the devastation—less than 48 hours after the initial firestorm. Forty-six departmental staff directly assisted the emergency response on the ground and in the weeks following the initial fire emergency. In addition, 209 staff assisted with other services provided by the department, including, but not limited to, taking calls and providing technical support. The department has had a strong presence at the state recovery centre in Springwood and was on hand at the evacuation centres in Springwood and Lithgow in the immediate aftermath of the fires.


The Linksview fire destroyed 193 homes in Springwood, Winmalee and Yellow Rock. The Australian government activated disaster assistance measures on Friday, 18 October 2013—less than 24 hours after the greatest impact of the fire. The department is delivering three assistance schemes to those who were affected by the fire: the Australian government disaster recovery payment, the disaster recovery allowance and ex gratia payments equivalent to the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance for certain New Zealand passport holders. The department's top priority during this disaster has been to deliver payments as quickly and as compassionately as possible to people in need. As at midnight, 5 December 2013, 764 claims for the Australian disaster recovery payment have been granted, with more than $850,000 paid into people's bank accounts. There have been 1,174 calls related to the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance, which have been answered by the department. As at midnight, 5 December 2013, 44 claims for the disaster recovery allowance have been granted, with money paid into people's bank accounts on a fortnightly basis for up to 13 weeks. People have until April 2014 to lodge a claim.


The Australian government emergency information line operates weekdays from 8 am to 5 pm. For the first 11 days of the emergency response, the hotline was available from 8 am to 8 pm seven days a week. The department's processing teams are taking a compassionate approach to assessing claims, but, ultimately, people still need to meet the eligibility criteria determined by the Minister for Justice. Departmental social workers have been deployed in the affected areas to provide support to their customers, many of whom have suffered great loss in this disaster. I commend the Prime Minister, the Minister of Human Services, the Minister for Justice and the member for Macquarie for their compassionate work to those affected.


Debate adjourned.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (16:00):  I pay tribute to Nelson Mandela and express my condolences, as so many Australians have, to Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, his children and the people of South Africa. Although we all knew that Nelson Mandela was seriously ill, I was still deeply saddened when I heard of his death last Friday morning as I landed in Beijing.


Mandela was a towering figure of our time, such that I feel sure everyone will remember 6 December as the day we stopped to think of this great man and what his life meant to his country of South Africa and to the world. Mandela was truly one of the most recognised and greatest figures of the 20th century, an icon of resistance against repression who became a champion of reconciliation. Mandela will also be remembered as an advocate for human dignity, for freedom and for justice. He was truly one of the most inspirational leaders of our time: a great political leader, a courageous moral leader. 


Nelson Mandela's management of South Africa's peaceful transition from apartheid is one of the 20th century's greatest displays of positive leadership. He was the person to whom many turned to look for guidance on issues of forgiveness, respect and how to make a positive individual contribution to our times. He transformed not only his country, South Africa, but also Africa and the rest of the world. Through the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s, when South Africa was a polarised, divided and rather desperate country, there seemed little chance that it could be turned into a modern democracy without first suffering through an appalling civil war. It did not seem possible that the injustices, humiliation, exploitation and deep divisions apartheid had created could ever easily be overcome. 


We pinned our hopes on the sporting and economic sanctions in the hope that they might force the white regime to change its course. But, put simply, it was the towering force of one man, Nelson Mandela, which changed the destiny of South Africa. Many other people played important roles, but Mandela gave something crucial—his wisdom, his compassion and, almost unbelievably, his forgiveness—so that a peaceful transition was achieved. The people of South Africa, and indeed the world, owe him an enormous debt of gratitude for sparing the world from what could have been a tragedy if South Africa had continued down a path of racial violence into civil war.


Nelson Mandela showed black South Africans that change could be achieved through peaceful ways. He showed the white minority that they did not need to fear a new democratic South Africa. Mandela had the wisdom, the courage and the humanity to understand that peaceful change was what was needed in South Africa. Despite the long years of confinement and personal deprivation he suffered on Robben Island he was able to show enormous strength of courage. He did something we should all aspire to do: he showed forgiveness—forgiveness to the prison wardens, forgiveness to the white regime—so that South Africa could move on to a better future.


He certainly overcame many personal challenges in his life. We should not gloss over the years he spent struggling against the brutal regime in the years before his imprisonment. I think one of his most enduring quotes, and there are many, which sums up the man is:


I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.


It was through his personal example that the rest of the country was able to forgive and come together in a peaceful way and transform South Africa into the modern, democratic country it is today.


His leadership as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 was truly inspirational. He started the process of healing the deep wounds created by decades of bitter apartheid. He showed the people of South Africa that they had more to gain by working cooperatively together. He helped to turn around the economy by reassuring the white population that they had a future in the new South Africa, which helped stem a great potential loss of capital, human capital and knowledge.


Nelson Mandela's management of South Africa's peaceful transition from apartheid is extraordinary. Despite his numerous achievements, he will be remembered foremost for his humility and his humanity. Encapsulating this, Malcolm Fraser, as the then Co-chairman of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, recalled his first meeting with Nelson Mandela before his release from prison. Mandela's first words were, 'Mr Fraser, is Don Bradman still alive?' The Don was later to inscribe a bat to Mandela with the words 'To Nelson Mandela, in recognition of a great unfinished innings'.


Australia has a long and proud history of engagement with South Africa and support for Mr Mandela and the anti-apartheid struggle. Australian welcomed Nelson Mandela to our shores in October 1990 as a true friend, and more than 100,000 people listened to his speech on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. In 1994, Mandela chose Australia as the first country outside Africa to visit as President and thank for its support in the anti-apartheid struggle. In 1999, Prime Minister John Howard honoured him with our nation's highest award, the Companion of the Order of Australia, in a ceremony at our High Commission in Pretoria in recognition of his leadership and of the example of reconciliation he and South Africa had given the world. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, Australian communities and church groups devoted themselves to his cause. Reflecting strong community sentiment at home, successive Australian governments from both major parties campaigned in international forums against the apartheid system and in support of a representative and democratic South Africa.


Nelson Mandela is considered a hero whose struggles, sacrifices and moral stature led to the election of the first truly democratic, fully representative government in South Africa. Today, despite the inequalities which remain as a result of the apartheid era, South Africa continues to embrace democratic freedoms. The economy, while facing many challenges, is relatively strong and stable. South Africa is a respected voice on the international stage, stemming in part from the high esteem with which Nelson Mandela was regarded by the international community.


Nelson Mandela will be deeply mourned and missed. He was a man who made a difference to the life of our times.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (16:07):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion. I do so, I suspect, as one of the few members of this parliament, or perhaps the only member of this parliament, who had the privilege of knowing Nelson Mandela. For me, it was a unique and very special privilege, and I want to recount why.


In my very early years, before I came to this parliament, I participated in debates in my own political party, which were sometimes difficult and divisive, over both South Africa, with its apartheid system, and Zimbabwe. There were two leaders of significance that we came to support: in South Africa, Mandela, and, in Zimbabwe, Mugabe. I think they have taken very different paths. For me, the magnanimity of Nelson Mandela is what has really distinguished him from his fellow continental leaders, if I might put it in that way.


Just think about it. Australia, for a time, supported the apartheid regime. Many were anxious about it and sought to see change. I can remember when members of this parliament in my very early years would receive invitations from the South African government to go and see for themselves firsthand the apartheid regime and why it should be supported. I could never bring myself to accept that offer of hospitality. For me, the system was so insidious that it was something that I could not bring myself in any way, shape or form to support.


I had a unique opportunity to go to South Africa in 1994 as one of the five Commonwealth observers of the elections—the first democratic elections for South Africa. It included John Cain, a former Premier of Victoria; Janine Haines, the former leader of the Australian Democrats in the Senate; Dr Duncan Chappell; and the chief electoral commissioner. It was a unique experience for me. I have never been an election observer before. I did not think the elections were faultless, but it earned me the enmity of many of my colleagues when I raised some of the faults who were of the view that it should be supported unequivocally. But the moments that I remember and are etched forever with me were to see Mandela at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town, where he addressed one of the largest crowds of people that I have ever seen. I still have photographs in my office of Mandela on a vehicle being driven around the perimeter of the stadium before he spoke.


He was a man of enormous presence. Of course the election outcome was quite decisive. I often remind school parties visiting parliament of the first democratic elections in South Africa. Why do I do that? It is because I want to emphasise the importance of democracy and what it means, and what a privilege it is to be able to participate in elections. What etched it in my memory was standing beside some people of South Africa waiting to vote on that day, sometimes all day, in queues outside their polling booths. Their patience and their willingness to participate in those first democratic elections was something unique and something special. 


When I first rose, I compared the results in South Africa with the results in Zimbabwe. Only two years ago, I had the opportunity of visiting South Africa again and Zimbabwe. The results are very, very different. The suffering of the people of Zimbabwe, the reduction in their collective standard of living and the nature of the administration of the Mugabe regime have, I think, left that country greatly diminished. Mandela's leadership has had quite a different outcome, an inclusive outcome—the rainbow society, as it has been called, a situation in which they have not deprived themselves of the economic opportunities that can be gained by retaining the skills and capacities of their people. I am not saying it is perfect, but I think Mandela played a unique and very special role in uniting the people of South Africa. For that, not only should South Africa be grateful but the world should be grateful for his very effective leadership.


Having witnessed that, it was a great privilege for me to meet him here in Australia at Kirribilli House with John Howard and on other occasions when he came to these premises. I had seen a man who had suffered a great deal. Interestingly, I recall the condolence motion only a little while ago when we spoke about the late Michael Hodgman. He, as one of the early members of the parliamentary Amnesty group here in Canberra, lamented that because Mandela would not eschew the use of violence initially in relation to the ANC as it sought a change, he was never adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty—quite remarkable.


I visited Robben Island. I saw where he was held. I saw the way in which he endured so many years imprisonment, unjustly. But here was a man, after all he had endured, who was still able to forgive, to seek reconciliation and to build a nation. I do not think any of us will see a man of this ilk in our lifetime again. It is a remarkable story. He has been a great person of the world, one we should justly celebrate, as they are in South Africa, for his life and all that he was able to achieve.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (16:15):  I join other members in expressing our condolences over the passing of the former South African President, Nelson Mandela. I would also like to associate myself with the fine words of the Chief Government Whip in his recollections of what this man meant to him and, indeed, what this man has meant to millions of people around the world. Mr Mandela was a leader who fought against the apartheid policies of South Africa and rendered an immense service to humanity. He changed the lives of millions of impoverished and oppressed people. A hero of the apartheid struggle, Mr Mandela spent 27 years in jail and then became South Africa's first democratically elected president.


The collective bereavement which has met his death across the world not only reflects the scale of his achievements but, indeed, the quality of the man. The African National Congress, in a statement released shortly after Mr Mandela's death, said:


The large African Boabab, who loved Africa as much as he loved South Africa, has fallen. Its trunk and seeds will nourish the earth for decades to come.


Mr Mandela's legacy and memory have been celebrated and his passing mourned by leaders around the world. The world leaders' speeches are replete with superlatives and sorrow. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, said just after Mr Mandela's passing that he now 'belongs to the ages'. President Obama said that Mandela:


… embodied the promise that human beings—and countries—can change for the better.


He paid homage to the influence that Mandela had on his own political career. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, a good friend of Nelson Mandela, described Mandela as being 'like a most precious diamond honed deep beneath the surface of the earth'.


For the many Australians who have paused to reflect on Mr Mandela's contributions, they can be proud that three successive prime ministers—Mr Whitlam, Mr Fraser and Mr Hawke—all played an important role in advocating for Mandela in his struggle. Mr Whitlam's government banned racially selected sporting teams from touring here, which of course meant that we did not go through the same difficulties that we have seen occur in other countries. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke played a pivotal role at the CHOGM meeting in the Bahamas in 1985, ensuring financial sanctions designed to choke the South African economy were adopted. It is also true to say that there was a different view about economic sanctions at the time. Mr Howard, the then opposition leader, opposed those sanctions. He told parliament in 1986:


The proposition that the white regime can be removed by the imposition of economic sanctions or that the imposition of sanctions will bring about a major change in the attitude of that regime, is a very questionable one.


I do believe that, on that occasion, the then leader of the coalition and, indeed, the coalition at that time were on the wrong side of history. The Australian Labor Party was one of the very few parties around the world to give practical assistance to Mr Mandela and the ANC in the 1994 general election.


When Mandela was released from prison, he visited Australia. Tens of thousands turned out to hear him speak. I had the good fortune to be in attendance at a gathering on 25 October 1990 at Melbourne Town Hall, where Nelson Mandela addressed unionists to thank them for their long effort to put political pressure on the regime of South Africa to have him released and—more importantly, as he would see it—to see a road to democracy for his country. I had the great honour to be in the audience when he was there. I just want to read out a couple of things that he said on that day as he addressed us:


It was the labour movement of this country in the early-50s which supported the dockworkers in this country who refused to unload South African ships. That was a decision which created a great deal of excitement, which gave the people of South Africa in their struggle, a lot of strength and a lot of hope. 


It was difficult to understand how workers, thousands of miles from our shores, who did take the initiative the lead, among the workers of the world, to pledge their solidarity with the people of South Africa. The feeling that we are not alone, that we have millions of workers behind us, is a factor which has prepared us, notwithstanding the most brutal form of oppression which we've faced in our country. Throughout, since 1912, every South African Government has tried to destroy the African National Congress, or at least to cripple it. Not only have they failed in that resolve, but we have emerged to be the most powerful political organisation in the country, inside and outside of Parliament.


Clearly this was an emotional tribute by Mr Mandela and it showed his appreciation for the efforts of the union movement in this country, even before Labor governments agreed to impose sanctions on what was a horrific and undemocratic regime. As I say, I was fortunate to be there that day when Mr Mandela addressed us. He seemed, even at that moment—that moment of triumph, one would think—a man of humility, of modesty and of even temper. Amidst a very excitable crowd, he was in complete possession of the moment, and his dignity shone through. It is a great loss to South Africa, a great loss to this world. Let us hope that he will continue to inspire future generations.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-12-09,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:22):  Richard Stengel, who worked with Nelson Mandela on his autobiography, told the story of when he was out walking one morning in the Transkei with Mr Mandela and they spoke about when he would be joining his ancestors. Mandela said:


Men come and go. I have come and I will go when my time comes.


He had an extraordinary life. The first time he shook the hand of a white man was when he went off to boarding school. He was born into a relatively privileged family by black South African standards. He grew to stand six foot two and he had a strong education. Nonetheless, when he was a young man in Johannesburg people spat on him in buses, shopkeepers turned him away and whites treated him as if he could not read or write. He thought to himself that, if that was how he was treated, how must it be for so many other black South Africans?


He was tried for his revolutionary activities for the ANC and sentenced. In the sentencing hearings, he spoke for four hours, finishing with the final statement:


During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.


His defence team urged him to take out the last sentence for risk of antagonising the judge and, as history has suggested, it may have been a close-run thing. Another member of the Johannesburg bench claims that he persuaded the trial judge, Quartus de Wet, to change his mind over a cup of tea in the judicial common room just before he returned to the court for sentencing: de Wet had been set on hanging.


The 27-year sentence saw Nelson Mandela become prisoner 466/64. He was held for 18 years in an eight-foot by seven-foot cell. It was a brutal sentence. He was a man who loved children but spent 27 years without holding a baby. As was reported, when he was being pursued by thousands of police, he secretly went to tuck in his son in his bed. When his son asked why he could not be with him every night, Mandela told him millions of other South African children needed him too. He lost his eldest son, Madiba Thembekile, in a car crash in 1969 and felt terrible guilt.


Mandela did not eschew violence entirely, as Gandhi did. He said, 'At a certain point, one can only fight fire with fire.' He never disowned the struggle and he was the founder of Umkhonto weSizwe, the Spear of the Nation, the military wing of the ANC. He regarded violence as a tactic not as a principle. As my media adviser, Toni Hassan, has pointed out, Mandela reached a point of taking the view that violence was a necessary strategy. But when the time came, he said to the ANC:


We must accept that responsibility for ending violence is not just the government's, the police's, the army's. It is also our responsibility.


This was most difficult when Chris Hani was killed by an assassin commissioned by the right-wing conservative party. It was Mandela who called aggrieved black South Africans not to take revenge when the country could have been plunged into bloodshed. He noted that a white woman of Afrikaner origin risked her life so that 'we may know and bring justice to the assassin'.


When Mandela was released from jail, almost a generation had passed. It was said that when he saw a television soundman waving a boom microphone at him he thought he was 'wielding a fancy assassination device'. But Mandela brought black and white South Africa together as the first president of a multiracial South Africa. In the moment when the country hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Mandela wore captain Francois Pienaar's No. 6 jersey on the field. The crowd loved it and loved him. They experienced a great moment of unity.


I am very pleased to see the bipartisanship with which Nelson Mandela has been acknowledged, but it is important to note that this was not always so. When people like Meredith Burgmann protested against white-only South African sporting teams, she was attacked by many Australian conservatives. Reading through the Hansard reveals John Howard opposing sporting sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s and Michael Cobb calling in 1990 for the resumption of sporting contact with South Africa. It also reveals Liberal members calling for the expulsion of the African National Congress from Australia and people like Senator Crichton-Browne saying:


When Mandela gets out of gaol he will be just in the ruck with all the rest. As long as he is in gaol he really is a symbol of all that the blacks represent. The sooner he gets out, the sooner, in my view, his influence will be considerably diminished.


One is so glad that those words have been consigned to the dustbin of history. There was a great moment in that speech when Senator Crichton-Browne said:


No one, in my view, has an absolute mortgage on morality.


And the late John Button said:


Certainly not you, Senator.


Mandela was a towering figure the likes of which we may not see again. His example to all of us was an extraordinary one. We are lucky to have shared this planet with him for that great run of 95 years he was on it. May he rest in peace.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (16:30):  I appreciate the opportunity to make some comments this evening on behalf of the electorate of Gippsland regarding the death of Nelson Mandela. I am sure that the people of Gippsland would like me to extend their condolences to Nelson Mandela's family, his friends and his nation. Mandela spent much of his life standing up against the injustice of apartheid and, as we have already heard this evening, when that fight was won he inspired us again by his capacity to forgive and to reconcile his country. While the world may never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again, he has certainly inspired countless men and women throughout the world to live more courageous and more honest lives. Much has been written and said already about Mandela's legacy. There is little I can add, perhaps, beyond a simple thank you. Thank you to this great man, and thank you for a life well lived.


Naturally, over the past three days we have seen extensive media coverage—and I must commend the Australian media for the way it has covered the death of Nelson Mandela—and that coverage has been exhaustive but it has been very reflective as well. It has taken the time to delve into the intricacies of the issues that Mandela faced and the way he triumphed against great adversity. There has been grief, and there has been a sense of loss, of course, for his family and for the South African nation, as the world mourns a father, grandfather, a great-grandfather, a husband and simply an extraordinary individual. But there has also been a sense of celebration, to commemorate 95 years of an extraordinary life which, by any standards, has been well lived.


We have already heard in this place many moving tributes—from the Acting Prime Minister, the member for Wide Bay; from the acting opposition leader; and from the member for Berowra and the member for Gorton—both of whom had the opportunity to meet Nelson Mandela. Even in his death, Mandela has been a great unifier; he has managed to unify this place—which in many ways would probably be one of his greatest miracles!


At his trial in 1964, Mandela spoke of his determination to achieve a free and harmonious society, saying: 


It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.


The courage contained in that statement alone is stark. Mandela remained true to those words during his long and arduous 27 years in prison. I believe his passing serves as a challenge to us all here in this place. His inspirational leadership can guide us as we make decisions and as we make the most of the opportunities that have been afforded to us as leaders of our own communities. I was particularly taken by the comments from Mandela's biographer, Richard Stengel, which appeared in The Weekend Australian, and I want to quote from them:


Deep in his bones was a basic sense of fairness: he simply could not abide injustice. If he, Mandela, the son of a chief, handsome and educated, could be treated as subhuman, what about the millions who had nothing like his advantages? ""That is not right,"" he would say to me about something as mundane as a flight being cancelled or as large as a world leader's policies, but this phrase - that is not right - underlay everything he did.


To see something that is wrong and to take action to make it right must surely underpin our actions as members of this place.


As Mandela himself remarked, he was not a saint; he was just a man. Surely, he was an extraordinary man. But he was just a man. As was reported in The Age over the weekend, both Verne Harris, project leader at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, and Adam Roberts, a former correspondent from The Economist, say that Mandela had his flaws. He led an armed struggle which, by some definitions, could be seen as terrorism. Some have spoken about his stubbornness, his tendency to be aloof, and some other less attractive qualities. But in those failings, flaws or traits, we see Mandela as more of a complete human being. That should serve as further inspiration to us all and to our communities. He was just a man; he was not a saint. This man was able to achieve some remarkable things for his nation—but not through some mystical qualities. If one human being can achieve so much, why can't others rise to greatness? His life, including any faults or failings, whether they are perceived or otherwise, can inspire us all—men and women, black and white—to protect the legacy of Nelson Mandela and to reach within ourselves to find our better selves.


The resilience and the capacity to never give up even in the face of oppression are enduring qualities and values that can achieve change everywhere, including in our wonderful nation of Australia. To see something that is wrong and to take action is to take responsibility for that situation. To never give up, to remain determined in the face of adversity and to ultimately triumph are lessons that every generation can learn from. I believe they are the fundamental lessons that Nelson Mandela taught his nation and the world.


Many quotes from Mandela have appeared in the press over the last few days and they have been inspirational. I have taken perhaps greatest inspiration from two of them, and I would like to quote them now. One is: 'What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is the difference we have made to the lives of others.' And another is: 'There is no passion to be found playing small—in settling for a life that is less than the one that you are capable of living.' I was taken by those quotes because they are the types of messages that I try to convey to school students when I visit them in my electorate of Gippsland—when I meet them to discuss civics or citizenship or their future and the opportunities that might lie ahead for them. I must say that Mandela put them far more eloquently than I ever could, but the intent is the same.


Mandela demonstrated through his life the values and principles behind the words 'respect' and 'responsibility'. It is the same message that I like to give to students in my community when I meet with them. It is about respecting others and treating them in the same way you expect to be treated. As MPs, we have a long way to go in that regard. We can do better on the lesson of respect and the way we treat each other in this place. It is also about self-respect, and in his quote, 'There is no passion to be found playing small,' Mandela is saying to me: 'Let yourself achieve your absolute best with the skills and the abilities and the lessons you have learnt in life. You owe it to yourself to achieve whatever you possibly can in your life, and there is folly in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.'


The lessons for all of us in Nelson Mandela's life are the values of hard work, of determination, of humility, of respect and of taking responsibility when you see something is wrong and trying to make it right. I know that taking responsibility these days is not always a popular course of action—it may not be so fashionable—and there always seems to be someone else to blame when we do make mistakes. And we do make mistakes as members in this place—we all make mistakes, some on a daily basis, some more regularly than that. When we make a mistake, we have to take responsibility. If we see a fault or if we make a mistake, we have to act in the best interest of our nation and try to correct it. They are the lessons that I have taken from Nelson Mandela's life and from reading more about his experiences over the past few days. In Mandela's example, it is to recognise what is not right and try to do something about it.


Finally, as I mentioned before, even in death Nelson Mandela has continued to achieve greatness. He has unified what is an often troubled and divided world. The speeches we have heard here today have demonstrated that unity, as members from both sides have recognised Mandela's contribution to the world. We have had tributes from world leaders, both black and white; from European leaders and Asian leaders; and from celebrities and mums and dads. We have seen people in the street crying and people in the streets celebrating. He has that enormous capacity to bring the world together to recognise a person who did in fact change the world. The lessons are there for us to see in his writings, in his speeches and, more importantly, in his deeds. As we in this place seek inspiration, and search for wisdom to see what is wrong and help make it right, I believe many of us would benefit from taking guidance from Mandela's struggles and his extraordinary achievements. My last words this evening are from Mandela himself: 'I learnt that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.' In years to come I think we will all do well to reflect on the words and the life of Nelson Mandela.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:39):  This is a time to honour all of those who fought against the evils of the apartheid regime in South Africa, from the great man whom we commemorate today all the way down to the lowly record store owner who was portrayed so beautifully in the movie Searching for Sugar Man, which came out in the last year or two. It is a great movie that shows that one of the amazing things about the anti-apartheid movement was the way that it spread through the country and made change an irresistible thing. It was a remarkable movement and I pay tribute to it today.


It is with a great deal of sadness, but with limitless admiration, that I rise to join with colleagues from all parts of this parliament to pay tribute to a man and that movement, and to the causes of antiracism, reconciliation, democracy, progress and equality, which will live on well beyond the passing of Nelson Mandela. For some people those are just words or slogans. For a lot of the leaders on that continent, unfortunately, they were easily traded away for power, but for Nelson Mandela they were causes for which, as other speakers have mentioned and he repeatedly said, he was prepared to die.


To his clan, his people and statesmen such as Bill Clinton, whom he befriended, he was known as Madiba, his clan name. That is the name they have been chanting in South African streets and around the world since the awful news broke late last week.


He once said, 'The time is always ripe to do right.' It is right to mark the extraordinary life of an extraordinary man who lived for 95 years but whose impact will be felt forever. His was a life forged in the fires of racism and imprisonment during the time of injustice imposed by South African apartheid, by the minority white population, on the majority black population.


He once wrote to his second wife, Winnie, 'Difficulties break some men but make others.' There can be no better example of that than Mandela's own life and struggle on behalf of all South Africans, but especially the poor, the oppressed and the marginalised.


He spoke simply but with immense power multiplied by his humility. I mark something that the Deputy Prime Minister said earlier today, which is the paradox that, the more humble Nelson Mandela got, the greater he became. I thought that was an excellent point raised by the Deputy Prime Minister. How Nelson Mandela maintained such amazing dignity in the face of such trials is beyond explanation. To spend more than a quarter of a very long life in prison and emerge like he did, with his optimism and vision, that straight back and a deep, reflective voice was incredible.


As they did for my colleagues who have spoken already, his struggles inspired me and helped instil in me a passion for tolerance and justice achieved through political action. In that sense he was like Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln and FDR but with one important difference: he was the only one of those who lived and worked in my time. One of my earliest political memories is from grade 7, when Nelson Mandela was released from jail and there was the amazing scene where he was walking along with a big crowd behind him. One of the things that made me start to think that I was from this side of politics was that a social studies teacher explained to me that the Left in Australia was siding with Nelson Mandela, whereas the Right had not always sided with him and had indeed at times sided with his opponents.


Mandela showed us that inspired and courageous political leadership could be contemporary and not just historical. In the mid-90s his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom became the first political book I read. I remember setting the alarm early so that I could plough through as much of it as I could before school. I suspect this week it might become the most re-read book in the world—that is a great thing. I also mark what the previous speaker and also my colleague the member for Canberra said about the Richard Stengel book. Stengel collaborated with Mandela on Long Walk to Freedom and more recently wrote his own book, which laid out 15 lessons from Mandela's life, taken from the thousands of hours they spent together talking about life and leadership while they worked on the first book. Stengel did us a tremendous service by showing Mandela, warts and all: a hero but also a human.


Our greatest debt to Stengel is for familiarising us with the African term Ubuntu. In an introduction to Stengel's book Mandela describes Ubuntu as the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world it will be due in equal measure to the work and achievements of others. What a tremendous sentiment that is.


This humility and selflessness is embodied by the man we pay tribute to now, the man who wrote in a famous essay that 'to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others' and who later said in a letter to his famous ally Walter Sisulu:


What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.


So the Australian parliament unites to thank and honour Madiba today. There is surely no better way to mark his passing than with his own words on mortality:


Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity.


He will be remembered for eternity as well.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:45):  Many of my colleagues have already spoken on the condolence motion before the House, and I would like to associate myself with the words and the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister in particular. Today I would like to pay my respects on the passing of one of the world's greatest leaders, Nelson Mandela, and to offer the condolences of the people of McPherson. Our thoughts are with his wife, his children, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren and the entire family, as well as his friends and colleagues, those who struggled alongside him.


Nelson Mandela's legacy is more than just ending apartheid and greater than bringing forth a new era for South Africa. Nelson Mandela's legacy is of bringing change and humanity to a nation and to the world and bringing about change peacefully. As he famously said in his 1964 address at the opening of the defence case in the Rivonia trial:


During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realised.


People around the world this week will be looking at all that Nelson Mandela achieved in his lifetime, and, although his achievements were great, we should also be looking to the future, learning from all that he did and expanding to create a better world. Nelson Mandela believed in the power of humanity, and we should too. Sitting in this parliament are a group of diverse people with diverse backgrounds and ideals, but what we all have in common is the desire to create a better Australia and a better world. I think we can all look to Nelson Mandela as an inspiration to come together and to do just that.


Most people believe that one person cannot make a difference, but Nelson Mandela went to show us that it is possible. One person can make a change that affects the lives of millions of people around the world. His actions have inspired many and will continue to inspire people into the future. He has taught us to respond to injustice and stand up for the equality of all people. The world has lost a great man and a great leader, but his memory will live on through his work and those that work in his vision. May he rest in peace.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (16:48):  I am very proud to be able to join colleagues in paying tribute to a true giant of humanity, Nelson Mandela. Mandela's story is well known all around the world: the freedom fighter against the apartheid regime who became the most famous prisoner in the world and who subsequently was able to unite his nation as the first democratically elected President of South Africa.


Over the last few days, so many people have recognised his enormous and total commitment to reconciliation in post-apartheid South Africa. A shining example of this was his meeting with Percy Yutar upon his election as President. Yutar had been the state prosecutor at the trial which resulted in Mandela's 27-year imprisonment and had demanded during that trial the death penalty for Mandela and his comrades, and yet here was the newly elected President not exerting retribution or punishment but meeting the gentleman who had sent him to prison.


As a Labor member of parliament I am very proud that the Australian Labor Party was one of the few political parties that provided assistance to Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress in the first democratic election in South Africa, in 1994. This assistance had a broader base than just the parliamentary Labor Party; the combined trade union movement was also involved. I remember working in a building in Granville which had framed in its foyer a reproduction—I hope it was a reproduction—of a ballot paper, with a note of thanks from the ANC written on it, from the first democratic election in 1994.


I pay tribute to the remarks of people from across the chamber. The passing of Mandela is the passing of a giant who unites everyone, and I think many countries can learn from his approach to power. I was very interested in the comments from the member for Berowra, the Chief Government Whip, on the contrast between South Africa and other countries in its region, and I think that is very important. Being from an Irish background, I know that Northern Ireland is also dealing with reconciliation. So it is a good time to pause and reflect on the passing of a true giant.


It is also important at this stage to recognise the efforts of people in Australia who supported Nelson's activities and those of the ANC in general. It is widely acknowledged that economic sanctions imposed by the international community, led in part by Australia, played a significant role in ending apartheid. Australians should be very proud of the role we played and grateful that we were led by successive prime ministers who were vocal advocates of ending apartheid. History shows that Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and Keating were right. I pay tribute in particular to former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser for his efforts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which were continued by Prime Minister Hawke.


Of course, not all former leaders can lay claim to having taken part in such efforts. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and Australia's very own former Prime Minister John Howard were all opposed to Australia's efforts to end apartheid in various forms. Prime Minister Howard is on the record as having opposed economic and sporting sanctions. In fact, in 1975, Prime Minister Howard rose in parliament to oppose the Whitlam Labor government's prevention of the Australian cricket team from touring South Africa. His attempt to trivialise apartheid by suggesting that Australia should only compete with countries whose sporting teams were democratically selected was shameful. Apartheid was not a joke; when John Howard made his suggestion, Mandela had been in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison for 11 years whilst the black South African population was being systemically denied its human rights.


I raise this point because, when we reflect on the passing of a giant—a statesman who was certainly on the highest tier of statespeople—we should not take it as an opportunity to rewrite history. We should acknowledge Mandela's contributions and the circumstances surrounding them. I also note that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher labelled the ANC a terrorist organisation and vehemently opposed efforts by Commonwealth nations to end apartheid and that president Reagan used his presidential powers to veto the United States' efforts to end apartheid. We are here acknowledging the passing of a giant who was convicted of terrorism and condemned by various governments around the world in the past, and we remember Mandela as a truly unique individual whose unwavering commitment to social justice and human rights leaves a legacy which will be held up as an example for generations to come. However, in remembering him we must also remember that some share a shameful legacy of opposing efforts to end apartheid.


As a keen rugby follower I acknowledge Mandela's support of the South African national rugby team, the Springboks—once a symbol of white domination and apartheid—in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. His embrace of the Springboks is another shining example of his commitment to reconciliation. The captain of the 1995 World Cup winning team, Francois Pienaar, said over the weekend that in post-apartheid South Africa:


… where there was real tension, he gave us all hope. There will never be another like him.


I agree with him.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:54):  I humbly rise to offer my condolences to the people of South Africa on the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela. The world has lost a bastion of humanity with the passing of Nelson Mandela. He leaves behind a nation in mourning. They have lost the man who personified the heart and soul of South Africa—a beacon of humanity, forgiveness and national pride.


The people of the world have also lost one of their greatest. Nelson Mandela created a benchmark for the entire world in how to bring about peaceful conflict resolution. Watching Mandela and FW de Klerk standing side by side to receive the Nobel Peace Prize is one of the great moments in history. It was a scene many thought was not possible. However, as Mr Mandela himself said, 'It always seems impossible until its done.'




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 16:5

Ms GAMBARO:
  Nelson Mandela leaves behind a legacy that is not that of a saint and he would not want to be remembered that way. He went to prison in 1962 as an angry radical revolutionary. When he emerged from prison nearly 30 years later, in 1990, at 72 years of age and with the whole world watching, nobody really knew what to expect. If he was bitter he was not showing it. He seemed happy and at peace. This is a man who had a third of his life stolen from him. This is a man who had been spat on in the street and refused service in stores for the colour of his skin.


Yet, when he emerged from prison, he emerged as a man of peace and forgiveness. It was this journey that gave Nelson Mandela the authority to stand in front of his people as their leader and inspire them to free themselves from anger and to forgive their oppressors. He once told former US President Bill Clinton, 'You simply cannot be free without forgiveness.' He himself could not truly be a free man if he held on to his anger. Furthermore, South Africa as nation would never be able to move ahead as a peaceful democracy without its citizens forgiving the sins of the past.


This is how Nelson Mandela became the heart and soul of a multiracial, modern, democratic South Africa. And this is how, in 1994, just four years after he was released from prison, he became the South African President with a 62 per cent majority. Who can forget those long, snaking lines as millions queued in the sun for hours to vote in South Africa's first multiracial elections?


While Mr Mandela only served one term as President of South Africa, it was during this time that he laid a road map for a modern South Africa. In his inaugural speech he said:


We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.


We enter into a covenant that we shall build the society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity - a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.


He did not just speak these words; he lived them.


In a well-chosen gesture of forgiveness, Nelson Mandela appeared wearing South African colours at the Rugby World Cup Final in Johannesburg to congratulate the victorious home team, bringing the overwhelmingly white crowd of 63,000 to its feet chanting his name. Nelson Mandela used rugby to bring a nation together. He needed to find something that all South Africans could share so they could see there was something in which such a bitterly divided and rawly hurt nation could come together.


As a fellow rugby-loving nation, Australia will never forget that moment in 1995 when Mandela appeared wearing a Springbok rugby jersey with the number 6 on his back. The No. 6 jersey was that of South African captain on the day, Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaaner with whom he had become close friends. Pienaar said it was an amazing feeling when Mandela walked into the Springbok dressing room wearing his number to wish them good luck. To this day, television footage of that spectacle brings a tear to the eye of the toughest Australian rugby fan and rugby fans all around the world.


Nelson Mandela knew exactly what he was doing that day. It was a bold and risky decision, but he knew that it sent an important message to his people. As Mr Mandela was subsequently to say in a speech about that day:


Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.


Even after his retirement, Mr Mandela continued to work against social injustice, poverty and oppression. In fact, he was working so hard in his retirement he famously had to retire from his retirement.


He became an outspoken advocate against HIV/AIDS, speaking out about the loss of his son in 2005, Makgatho Mandela who had died of an AIDS-related illness at the age of 54. This was a significant moment in Nelson's Mandela's fight against HIV/AIDS. At the time Mr Mandela said:


Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS—and people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary.


Despite his achievements, one can never forget that Mandela was in his heart a family man who adored his children and sacrificed so much. He was a father, a grandfather and a great-grandfather. One cannot imagine the enormous pain his family must have endured throughout those years. Family spokesperson Temba Matanzima said in a recent statement about Mr Mandela's death that the pillar of their family was gone, just as he was during the 27 painful years of his imprisonment. 


Nelson Mandela's family has lost their pillar, the South African nation has lost their father and the world has lost a great man. Nelson Mandela will forever be in the hearts and minds of the world and will forever be an inspiration to those who are fighting against oppression, poverty and racism. As I said at the outset, the world has lost a bastion of humanity with the passing of Nelson Mandela. It is our responsibility now to continue his legacy.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (17:20):  I join with other members here today in expressing my condolences and those of the people of Fremantle on the passing of Nelson Mandela, a man who embodied through great suffering the greatest human qualities; a man who showed unwavering strength of purpose in the service of moral and humanitarian principle; a man who displayed courage and endurance—quite unbelievable endurance—in the face of violence and oppression; a simple, noble man who lived by the values of leadership, camaraderie, humility, forgiveness and love.


I am sure there has not been another death felt around the world like the passing of Nelson Mandela. His departure leaves hundreds of millions of people in nations across the globe feeling his loss but feeling at the same time enormous gratitude for what he gave and enormous sadness at this subtraction from the world of wisdom, goodness and the will for peace. Those of us in Australia who celebrate the life of Nelson Mandela and who mourn his death can imagine what it must be like for his nation, South Africa, for his family and for his friends. We extend our condolences to them at this time.



The West Australian newspaper said it well in its editorial on the weekend when it stated that Mandela's achievements:


… rank him alongside Mahatma Gandhi in the pantheon of statesman who have led their nations through turbulent times and whose towering moral authority helped to avoid bloodshed on a terrifying scale.


There are two precepts of Mahatma Gandhi's that come to mind when one reflects on the life of Nelson Mandela. The first is: 'Be the change that you want to see in the world.' The second is: 'Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.'


There is no better example of the power of those ideas than in the life of Nelson Mandela. He had more than enough reason to give up his personal struggle to be and bring about the change that he knew was required in South Africa, and he had 27 years of incarceration and mistreatment in which to give himself up to the claims of hate and bitterness. Yet his commitment to justice did not falter and his capacity to forgive and to love was not overcome.


It is hard to grasp and hold the full weight of those 27 years in prison. All I can do is pick out some of the details that drive home to me the kind of suffering he experienced: the fact that when first imprisoned he was allowed one visit and one letter every six months; the fact that when his mother and then his first-born son died—in 1968 and 1969 respectively—he was not allowed to attend either funeral; the fact that his daughters were not able to visit him until 1975, 11 years after he was first taken to Robben Island; the fact that when he worked in the prison's lime quarry he was forbidden from wearing sunglasses and as a result suffered permanent eye damage. All these cruelties, punishments, denials of freedom—and many, many more—took place across a length of time that is itself hard to fathom, yet Nelson Mandela emerged from prison to both lead and heal his nation. I believe the best way of honouring a great soul like Mandela is to recognise that the way he lived and the principles he lived by are available to everyone—and, indeed, that they are exemplified, in small and large ways, by many people.


There was a time, when Mandela was beginning his journey, that he was hardly known in South Africa, let alone in the wider world. There was a time when people in Australia second-guessed the need to oppose apartheid and failed to support those in our community who did recognise and share the fight against that evil. There are forms of racial injustice now—including in this country—that require more of us to make a greater effort to say, 'That is not right', as Mandela said, and to do something about it.


As the world honours and celebrates the life and achievements of Nelson Mandela, let us not fall into the historical fiction that would regard the triumph of his cause as inevitable. It took the outside world too long to act in concert against the apartheid regime and there have been in the recent past, and there are even now, instances of tyranny and systemic inequality that the world should not ignore but does. The last thing we should do in remembering Mandela is to put his example on a pedestal where no-one can reach it. The first thing we should do is to look around us a little more keenly to see those among us who are seeking to deliver justice, to promote peace and equality and to ensure the observance of human rights for all our fellow men and women.


I love the fact that Mandela's tribal name, Rolihlahla, means troublemaker. In the pursuit of freedom and equality and in the face of structured and entrenched oppression, you need to be prepared to make a certain amount of trouble; to be a firebrand in the cause of change. Nelson Mandela lived nearly a century and in his 95 years he came to represent all that was possible and good in people, in us. That will be his legacy. Through the century that has passed, 100 years of substantial horror and darkness as well as progress, Mandela achieved the miracle of transforming an entire nation from a deeply racist, cruel and oppressive past to a free and democratic future through reconciliation without significant bloodshed. His death is a great loss but his life and his example have been the greatest gift. We will remember him and be inspired by him, and shape our conduct by the light of his leadership, humility and love.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:26):  There are few people who inspire us to the level that Nelson Mandela has done. The contribution that an individual makes to society and to the global community in which we all live is something he will be remembered for, but also the circumstances that built his character as a man, a leader and an individual. Last week the world community lost one of its greatest leaders, a pioneer and an advocate for peace, unity, equality and peer recognition. The death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's President from 1994 to 1999 has struck a chord with individuals and leaders from all walks of life. In death as in life, Mandela commands the respect of the world stage. 


Fifty-nine world leaders are making the trek to South Africa to pay their respects to the man, and to the unity and forgiveness that was his life's work. Occasionally in life the world gives birth to a great leader. Mandela was one of those few exceptional men who rose above the fray to transition from countryman to world elder, a unifying figure not only for South Africans but for many throughout the world. Mandela is best known for his work as a civil rights activist, a world leader and an author. 


Mandela stands to be known as one of the world's most pre-eminent symbols of peace. In 1993, Mandela was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize with the then South African President Fredrik Willem de Klerk for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime and for laying the foundation of a new democratic South Africa. In 1942, Mandela joined the African National Congress and for 20 years directed a campaign of peaceful nonviolent defiance against the South African government and its racist policies.


Mandela like Gandhi had a unique and extraordinary capacity to forgive. I am always struck by the way both men used peace and unity. They used unity in a passive sense by bringing to the fore their message in respect of seeking freedom for the nations of their people and at the same time building an ethos of forgiveness and directing people on a journey towards unity for their nations. It is a unique quality that transcends the politics and the strengths of those individuals to make a difference in blending together the vision for their nations. The way they went about that is a character of strength and something I admire. I often use their words when I deliver my addresses because they are pertinent to the way they delivered their message. They are salient and go to the crux of what their society was and what their vision was for all of those around them, the people of their nations.


In spite of the terrible atrocities levelled against him, he was able to channel his experiences into a strategy to bring together all men and women in South Africa. As Mandela was known to say, 'Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do.' There were few who were as passionate as Mandela to achieve peace and freedom in South Africa. Mandela saw his life's objective as achieving unity and quality for all South Africans. He was known to say:


During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination.


I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realised. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.


Not once did Mandela's vision for his nation falter, which is a remarkable achievement for any world leader. In total, Mandela spent 27 years in incarceration for his political offences. He was charged due to his efforts to end apartheid, particularly because of his involvement with the African National Congress. Despite the incredible hate that was thrust upon him during these years and the perceived insurmountable challenges in pursuing peace in South Africa, Mandela chose to pursue peace and reconciliation. We remember the image of him walking free into a country that had once jailed him and his first speech when he returned home. It was not about bitterness, it was not about retribution, it was not about revenge; it was about the fact that he wanted to unify a country that could become a great nation, in which people of differing opinions could walk together and deliver a future that augured well for the generations to come.


Mandela was empowered by the very process that sought to disempower him and his efforts towards reconciliation. He said after his release:


If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner. 


He certainly achieved that. The approach towards partnership was the one that marked Mandela's presidency. His legacy and key objective was national reconciliation. He retained his integrity throughout the trials and tribulations he faced, and he did not compromise his beliefs in order to make the journey easier.


Nelson Mandela's achievements are considered all the more remarkable in the light of his previous history. When he was just nine years old his father lost his life to lung cancer, initiating a time of great change for him. Nelson Mandela's extraordinary background began long before he was incarcerated. Mandela was the first in his family to attend school and in spite of a difficult childhood he made the most of his opportunities. Mandela was given the opportunity to study at the Wesleyan mission school, the Clarkebury Boarding Institute, and the Wesleyan college where he solidified his understanding that success was achieved through hard work. Later Mandela studied at the University of Fort Hare, preparing for a career in the civil service as a clerk. After working in law firms and passing exams to become a qualified attorney at law, Mandela, together with his university peer and friend Oliver Tambo, opened the first solely African-run law firm in South Africa, where he provided legal advice and support to those who could not afford to access the legal systems of South Africa. In an interview this morning the grandson of his friend spoke openly of the friendship that the two had and the work that they did together to bring about the changes required to move from an oppressive regime to the Africa we see today.


The impact of education on Mandela's own life is no doubt where his passion for education came from. Mandela believed that education was 'the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world'—and in fact to change the society in which you live. He credited much of what was achieved in South Africa and elsewhere around the world to education. Nelson Mandela identified that the key to all change was education. It unlocks our ability to achieve our destiny and effect lasting differences. It is a vehicle through which he was able to promote peace and unity.


Nelson Mandela did not stop with achieving democracy in South Africa. Instead, he used his experience to urge other nations to overcome conflict and internal destruction through reconciliation, democracy and diplomacy. One of Nelson Mandela's greatest achievements came after his retirement from South African politics. He used his position to bring together world leaders to effect lasting change across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Nelson Mandela convened a group appropriately titled The Elders, which included such individuals as Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, Li Zhaoxing and Mohammed Younis. The Elders promoted peace and women's equality as well as developing initiatives to end human rights atrocities and to address the humanitarian crises that existed in various places in the world. 


I am proud that leaders of both sides of Australian politics will be showing their respect by attending memorial services for Nelson Mandela. The ideological and symbolic change that Nelson Mandela achieved in South Africa is a contemporary issue that we in Australia are still reconciling. It is an issue on which we look to all sides of politics to unify in order to achieve this change. As Nelson Mandela himself said:


Success in politics demands that you must take your people into confidence about your views and state them very clearly, very politely, very calmly, but nevertheless state them openly. 


These same principles are the ones that are needed in our own journey towards reconciliation. Just as Mandela took South Africans into his confidence to share his vision, so too must we as Australian leaders take all Australians into our confidence and state our vision for a united Australia. We members of the Australian parliament must bring all Australians together on a journey to better understand each other. Only by taking this journey together will we be able to achieve lasting reconciliation for Australia.


In closing, I will use Nelson Mandela's own words to encourage us in Australia's journey towards unity: 


Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow our fear to stand in the way. 


May we never let our fear stand in the way of achieving a stronger, more united Australia. Let us hope that the vision that has been imparted to us not only by him but by leaders within Australia becomes a basis from which we take the next stage of the journey that we have, that we achieve a country of greatness and of unity—a country in which all are part of the vision for the country but where we also stand as equals in the way we integrate and accept each other's ideas. Let us hope to show the passion for the future as Mandela did for Africa, as he did for the global community, for which he gained respect and acknowledgement for having the forgiveness to forge a way where all walk as equals.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:38):  Last Friday, the world learned that Nelson Mandela had died at 95. Mandela was a towering figure of the 21st century. He transformed a resistance movement into a force for national liberation and was a leader in the true sense of the word. He served over 27 years in Robben Island prison for trying to effect multiracial political change in South Africa. Over those long years of incarceration, he became known as the father of the nation, yet his children grew up without their father. Despite a prison term that would have broken most men, Nelson Mandela did not give up on his dream. He brought to an end white minority rule in South Africa by becoming the first black, democratically elected president in 1994. When he stood in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria 19 years ago to be sworn in, he embodied the hope of the nation.


Apartheid had been defeated, but his greatest gift to South Africa was to ensure that the sins of apartheid were dealt with through truth and reconciliation and not revenge. A wave of unforeseen optimism spread across the country and across the world. Mandela served in office for five years, but the international acclaim for his activism resonated for much longer than that. He has received more than 250 honours throughout his life, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, shared with FW de Klerk. As some have pointed out since his passing, Mandela was not a saint. He was a human and he had his flaws. That said, South Africa still faces many challenges but we cannot deny that it is a better place because of him. 


I had the great honour of meeting Nelson Mandela briefly. It was 1990, just months after he had been released from prison. He came to Australia to thank our government and the community organisations that had supported the anti-apartheid movement throughout its years of struggle. I had been very active in the group on the south coast. In those years the anti-apartheid cause was not always bipartisan. The sanctions movement was very controversial. There existed apologists who gained comfort at high levels throughout the country. I am pleased to say that the south coast branch was a very strong movement that gained support, financial, moral and otherwise, from trade unions, a good friend and colleague Terry Fox and the former member for Throsby, Colin Hollis. It was a great honour to meet a great man, however brief the encounter was. I am very sad, as I am sure all members of this place are, to learn of his passing. The world is a better place for the time he spent with us. Vale, Nelson Mandela.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (17:42):  I can only echo the remarks that have been made by other members. Nelson Mandela was a great individual. He will be remembered as one of the great individuals of the 20th century, someone who fought for civil rights in the same way that Gandhi and Martin Luther King did. It seems incredible, but when Nelson Mandela was released in 1990 there had been no images of him for 20 years. The photos used for stamps were taken from his trial in the 1960s. Younger people might not even remember the period when South African sporting teams did not compete internationally for 20 years. A number of Australian cricketers went on rebel tours of South Africa, but, under the Gleneagles Agreement, for 20 years South Africa was an international pariah in the sporting world.


I had the opportunity to work in South Africa in late 1989 and early 1990. I worked in a hospital in KwaZulu, then a non-independent homeland. It was an interesting time. In 1989 the previous president of South Africa, Mr Botha, had been replaced by FW de Klerk, the Berlin Wall had come down and some members of the ANC had been released but not Mandela. It was obvious that the system of apartheid was unsustainable and that South Africa had really been held back by the way that it had had sanctions imposed on it by countries around the world. Although many elements of apartheid were by then illegal, I do remember being in the Northern Transvaal and seeing the signs in banks saying 'Europeans only' at a time when that was no longer allowed. I remember staying with a family on 2 February 1990 when the news came that President de Klerk had decided to remove the remaining pillars of apartheid by unbanning the ANC. He subsequently released Nelson Mandela. This was something that this family welcomed but it took their breath away; they had not expected it so soon.


I also distinctly remember when Mandela became president in April 1994. I heard his acceptance speech on the ABC; it was absolutely electrifying. I am pretty sure that I was late for work that day; I just stopped the car and listened to Mandela's acceptance speech. When you consider how South Africa could have gone, and when you compare the path that South Africa has taken with that of Zimbabwe, you see how important Mandela's approach has been—the way he was able to forgive but not forget, the enormous grace he showed, and the way he was always prepared to build a bridge with people who had previously been violently opposed to him.


In closing I wanted to repeat the words he gave almost 50 years ago in his Rivonia trial speech: 'I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.' They were his words; they were words he always lived by. The world and South Africa are better places for him.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:47):  For me, it was not what put Mandela in jail or the man he was before he was arrested and it was not the 27 years he spent in jail. It wasn't the Special AKA singing Free Nelson Mandela; it wasn't Jim Kerr and the Simple Minds singing about Mandela Day; and it wasn't even Steven Van Zandt from the E Street Band singing 'I ain't gonna play Sun City' in defiance of the apartheid regime. It was not how abhorrent apartheid was. It was not the Springboks tours—I am old enough to remember them—and the state of emergency in Brisbane declared by Joh Bjelke-Petersen. He had the field ringed by police so that the game could go on. The students who protested at the time by blowing whistles and trying to get onto the field—I would have been nine or 10 at the time and they were a bunch of long-hairs creating trouble when it was just a game of football. It was far more than that. I will note that the Vice-Chancellor of Queensland University at the time was none other than Sir Zelman Cowen. If you want to talk about truly great men of peace, Sir Zelman Cowen was one of the best of them.


For me it was all about how Mandela conducted himself from the moment he was released from Robben Island Prison after 27 years. He could have been bitter. He could have gone all out for payback and we would have forgiven him. He could have evened up old scores, but he chose not to. He set to work with FW de Klerk—the forgotten man in this story, because without him it would not have happened—to dismantle apartheid. I heard a quote from FW de Klerk just recently where he said that both men walked out of their first meeting saying, 'There's a man I can deal with; there's a man I can work with.' So it was both men's ability—Mandela's and de Klerk's—to get there and say, 'We can end this; we can do the right thing.'


So they built a new nation, they got a new anthem and they got a new flag. And the symbolism of the flag, being divergent lines coming together and forging one way ahead, is I think a truly amazing thing—to the point where people, not too far from now, will not even remember the old South African flag and what it stood for and what was on it. More than all that—more than everything—was that he forgave. And that, for me, is just the most amazing thing: after what they had done to him, he was able to forgive.




A division having been called in the House—





Proceedings suspended from 17:5

Mr EWEN JONES:
  As I was saying before the suspension, more than anything, Nelson Mandela forgave. The ability to forgive when every fibre of your being is screaming for retribution is what truly sets Nelson Mandela apart from all other people. I still hold grudges from primary school and I can walk you through them. I still hold grudges from my first marriage. But the ability to get over it, to see the bigger picture, to be able to stand back and see what is best for other people—that is what truly sets Nelson Mandela apart.


The normal thing to do these days when someone dies is to put something up on Facebook. When Nelson Mandela died, some people came back and said that he was flawed and said some negative things about him. This may come as a surprise to my wife, but no man is not flawed—not even Ghandi. Every man is flawed. Some say South Africa is a mess and that it faces huge challenges. That is true on so many levels. But, equally, to fix all the problems of South Africa is not one man's job—and certainly not Nelson Mandela's job. To right every wrong, to fix every problem, is not his role. Racism still exists—everywhere. Sadly, it probably always will. But his job is complete. His job was to forge a new nation, an inclusive nation.


No image instils the message—and other speakers have spoken about this—better than the one from the 1995 World Cup. Mandela got out of prison in 1990. Australia won the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In 1992 we played the Springboks in South Africa and we beat them. In 1993, they came to Australia. They had a new national anthem and the singing of the previous national song, Die Stem, was forbidden. I was sitting in the northern stand at Ballymore when Australia played the Springboks in 1993. We were sitting right next to a big group of South African tourists and they stood as one and sang Die Stem that day. So to see Nelson Mandela, at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, walk out with what was to many South Africans the symbol of apartheid—the green Springbok jersey with its gold collar and the jumping springbok on the breast—and embrace the team, embrace the nation, was truly a great moment for absolutely everyone. It was the moment that crystallised in everyone's mind that this was one nation. That was the last bastion of apartheid and they were very proud.


They are now one nation. They are what they want to be as one nation. They have a lot of problems to fix up, as do we all. Vale, Nelson Mandela, a truly great man.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (18:08):  Nelson Mandela—what do you say? So much has already been said over recent days. This is a man whose life, over some 95 years, has traversed some of the great challenges of his country and his continent—and, in fact, the world. He faced the struggles over apartheid and the struggles, as part of that, relating to his incarceration for some 27 years. On from that, he dealt with the challenges involved in the establishment of a democratic nation, a nation that has had a very troubled history with respect to race and, with that, violence and oppression. Mandela, it was said, would say that he was an ordinary man, a simple man. In fact it is clear that he faced, as an ordinary and simple man, many complex challenges. He dealt with those challenges in a way that was, frankly, a wonder to many in the world.


Those who have been jailed, those who have been tortured, those who have been brutalised, often as a result become changed by those circumstances. Often they become in some ways tainted by their experience. In fact, it is completely understandable how they will react in a manner that is in itself often quite brutal. One of Mandela's greatest achievements was his capacity to forgive, to understand and to move beyond that oppression and provide an example for all the world with respect to how to deal with those circumstances.


As the first black president of the new democratic nation of South Africa he faced enormous challenges, challenges in relation to poverty, exploitation, race and the aftermath of the power structures that were apartheid. He would have admitted that he was not always able to meet those challenges with solutions, but he worked hard over his five years as President to move his country forward to help establish it as a free nation and as a nation where all citizens have the opportunity and the capacity and the ability to live a decent life.


The work that he did over that time is still a work in progress. I have always thought that probably one of the greatest tragedies regarding Nelson Mandela is that if only he had been released 10 or more years earlier and been in a situation where he could have become President at a younger age, his potential to have influenced modern South Africa would have been even greater.


Often described as a man of peace, there is no doubt that he embraced peaceful means; there is also no doubt that, when he felt it was necessary, as a last resort, he was prepared to take a more violent path. It was never his first choice. It was his last resort. But it was something that he was prepared to do, and I think that is something that needs to be understood.


In terms of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and how it has been described by others—he embraced white South Africa in the context of things like the Rugby World Cup. In terms of his statements to many of those who had been a part of his oppression—that he could forgive and that they had to move forward together—it showed what a great man he was. He also recognised and acknowledged always that he was not alone in what he did, that in fact he was part of a movement and that many in that movement were less famous and less celebrated, but had suffered and given much also to the cause.


I visited Robben Island several years ago, just before I attended a delegation of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in Africa. I managed to get there a couple of days early, so I went to Robben Island. I saw his cell. I have been to the quarry where he worked. I met with former prisoners who were working there as guides and who told us what happened with guards—about the circumstances the prisoners faced—and they gave us a bit of their personal experience about what it was like to be there at that time. There was a tremendous sense of community amongst them in terms of what they talked about and a tremendous sense of a shared experience that they saw as part of what they had suffered but also what they had to move beyond. That capacity to inspire across many of compatriots, and, through that, across the entire South African community, is another significant aspect of Nelson Mandela's achievement over the years.


His experience was horrific, but his achievements as a result should be celebrated and remembered. The challenge for modern South Africa is to build on that legacy. It is a big challenge. It is a challenge for those who were his compatriots and remain in the ANC, but also within the broader South African community. I hope and I pray that the example of Nelson Mandela in all the good things that he came to represent, for the need to move South Africa forward as a great nation of the world but also for the African continent, is something that those in South Africa will remember and will learn from for the future. I believe that is this man's legacy and I believe that it is a legacy that all should live to honour and to represent in future as being the way forward for Africa.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (18:15):  On behalf of the people of Lyons it is indeed a great honour to stand here to recognise a true giant of the 20th century. Notwithstanding that some will struggle to understand why I chose to speak on this motion, he was for much of his life a controversial figure. Like all of us, he had his failings but in some way I think that all, including his detractors, could recognise the legacy that he finally left South Africa and perhaps the world with. There but for the grace of God go I, I suspect. Until you have walked in his shoes, it might be hard to judge. Nelson Mandela said:


If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.


It is a philosophy that this man lived and breathed from the time of his imprisonment through a long and distinguished public life following his release. It is the kind of philosophy that shaped him as a beacon for freedom in our time.


The world mourns a great leader of his people in Nelson Mandela, a revolutionary, a politician and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 until 1999. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was one of our country's first leaders to meet Mr Mandela. Mr Mandela was still in prison at Pollsmoor in Cape Town, to where he had been moved. It was 1986 and Mr Mandela, aged 67, was 23 years into what would be 27 years spent in jail. Former Prime Minister Mr Fraser visited him as then chairman of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group which was charged to help South Africa to speed up the end of apartheid. As Stuart Rintoul said in The Australian newspaper at the weekend, prison 'authorities … had sent a tailor to fit him out for a pinstripe suit so he would not have to meet the former Australian prime minister in his old prison clothes'. He met Mr Fraser with a question, 'Tell me, Mr Fraser, is Donald Bradman still alive?' Mr Fraser told Rintoul that he and Mr Mandela met in the prison grounds, but even there he had a natural authority and presence. It also pleased him greatly to find out that Don Bradman was indeed still alive!


I join millions of people across the world who mourn the passing of Nelson Mandela. He will be remembered as a humble man who showed us the best of the human spirit and who fought all his life against injustice not only in his own country but internationally. His speech at the Rivonia trial in 1964 before he went to prison gave the world the first inkling that this was a man who would stand alongside India's Mahatma Gandhi as one of the generation's great leaders for peace. His words could be the mantra for those who strive for a free society in which all people are equal. He said:


I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.


We live in a privileged country and I struggle to imagine personally what I or others would have been capable of doing presented with similar circumstances. Thank you for the opportunity.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (18:19):  I speak to this condolence motion on behalf of the people of Bennelong. Woollarawarre Bennelong was the first Indigenous Australian to befriend the white settlers, and so this may well be appropriate. Around the world over the past week, there has been only a very brief moment of mourning the passing of Nelson Mandela, because, in hearing this news, as one the world commenced a celebration of his life, and that is appropriate. Many people have talked a great deal about his contribution and the type of man that he was. Archbishop Desmond Tutu had a very personal and long-term relationship with Nelson Mandela, and he said:


Never before in history was one human being so universally acknowledged in his lifetime as the embodiment of magnanimity and reconciliation as Nelson Mandela was. He set aside the bitterness of enduring 27 years in apartheid prisons—and the weight of centuries of colonial division, subjugation and repression—to personify the spirit and practice of ubuntu—


or human kindness—


He perfectly understood that people are dependent on other people in order for individuals and society to prosper.


…   …   …


Can you imagine what would have happened … had Mandela emerged from prison in 1990 bristling with resentment at the gross miscarriage of justice? Can you imagine where South Africa would be today had he been consumed by a lust for revenge, to want to pay back for all the humiliations and all the agony that he and his people had suffered at the hands of their white oppressors?


Instead, the world was amazed, indeed awed, by the unexpectedly peaceful transition of 1994, followed not by an orgy of revenge and retribution but by the wonder of forgiveness and reconciliation epitomized in the processes of the TRC—


the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 


Quoting Tom Curry from NBC News:


Mandela's biographer, Rick Stengel, said a decisive moment for South Africa came three years after his release from prison when Chris Hani, a popular leader of the African National Congress, was murdered by an apartheid supporter.


Hani’s assassination came at the moment that the ANC was negotiating with South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk's white-minority apartheid government on the terms of the transition to majority rule.


After Hani's murder, Mandela went on the state-run national television network to tell his country, ""We must not permit ourselves to be provoked by people who seek to deny us the very freedom for which Chris Hani gave his life.""


Mandela ""went on television in South Africa that night—rather than de Klerk—and showed that he was the father of the nation,"" Stengel said. He was so calm in a crisis and he rose to that. And he said later that was when South Africa was on the knife edge of a civil war, right then, that was the most perilous moment in their modern history.""


Fergal Keane from the BBC has written:


To the wider world he represented many things, not least an icon of freedom but also the most vivid example in modern times of the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. Back in the early 1990s, I remember then President, FW De Klerk, telling me … how he found Mandela's lack of bitterness ""astonishing"".


His fundamental creed was best expressed in his address to the sabotage trial in 1964. ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination,"" he said.


""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""


Nelson Mandela often spoke of his human qualities and yet, if we think that his life was such an example of Christian values, understanding that it is 'human to err, divine to forgive', and that 'vengeance is mine, saith the Lord', we see that he was human, he was divine and he chose not to take any vengeance.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:25):  I rise today to speak about a great man, a man who not only inspired a nation but also inspired the world. Very few people have single-handedly had as large an impact on the world than Nelson Mandela. Born in 1918, in Transkei, South Africa, into the Thembu tribe, Nelson Mandela went on to lead one of the most extraordinary lives that we have witnessed in our time. Educated at the University College of Fort Hare, Mandela completed his law degree at the University of Witwatersrand. Not long after his graduation he joined the African National Congress to combat the apartheid policies of the ruling National Party.


These policies divided a nation, oppressed a people and led to great poverty in South Africa. Mandela's political journey was not a journey without controversy. In his early years he was a supporter of violent resistance and created a splinter group within the ANC, the Umkhonto we Sizwe, that advocated for this violence.


In 1962 he was arrested and sentenced to five years hard labour. After the ANC was outlawed by the government, Nelson Mandela was charged with plotting to overthrow the government by violence and sentenced to life in prison. He spent 27 years of his 95 years on Robben Island as a political prisoner. It was there that Nelson Mandela had a life-changing experience, an epiphany, as it were: instead of advocating violence to change his country he would advocate for peace. He would do that by demonstrating that he was prepared to forgive those people who had jailed him and who had taken his freedom. Through this forgiveness and humility, he would seek to unite his nation.


His ability to eradicate the hate that once enveloped him and his embrace of long-time political opponents led to successful reconciliation in South Africa. He was supported in this journey not only by his own country but by many right around the world. We here in Australia played a special role in that, in supporting these aims to end apartheid in South Africa. Both sides of this chamber, both Liberal and Labor, then supported investment sanctions that had, I think, a very critical impact on changing the focus of many of those in South Africa and their view on apartheid.


We were also able to honour, in our own special way, the great career and achievements of Nelson Mandela when former Prime Minister John Howard presented Nelson Mandela with an Order of Australia for his courage and strong moral leadership.


Today, in this chamber we honour—and I am sure it is echoed in many parliaments around the world—a great life. It takes a supreme sense of grace, dignity and magnanimity to offer your lifelong enemy the hand of peace and friendship. And that is what Nelson Mandela did. It is also a great achievement of President FW de Klerk to take that hand of friendship as it was offered and to unite South Africa by breaking down the apartheid barriers so that it was no longer a country divided by race and, instead, to build a new South Africa together.


Upon his release from prison, Nelson Mandela won the first free election in South Africa that was open to all people. He used that opportunity to support a burgeoning new democracy and a new social order. The ANC had gone from an outlawed political organisation to the ruling party; and Nelson Mandela from a political prisoner, held in the harshest of conditions, to a political hero who was healing his nation. In 1993 Nelson Mandela was duly recognised with the Nobel Peace Prize. Although it was undoubtedly deserved, I suspect it was very little consolation for a life much of which was spent behind bars on an island, imprisoned for fighting for his political rights and the rights of his people.


While Nelson Mandela will be missed by almost everybody in this world, I think we can say, because of his huge impact, he will be most particularly missed by those closest to him—his family. He had a very large and extended family, with his wives, six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. To conclude, I would like to quote Nelson Mandela:


For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.


Nelson Mandela, you are finally free, and we hope you rest in peace.

Mr BROUGH
 (Fisher) (18:32):  I rise to celebrate the life of this great man and recognise the challenge that he gives the world. It is beyond my comprehension how you can spend 27 years in jail and come out and act in the way that he has. He says he is not a saint, but I do not know of another person that could do that. The enormity of what he lived through, the persecution, and then to have the hope of the nation upon you, leaves you speechless. We see so many regimes change and we see so much hope, as we have seen in the Middle East of late, and so often that hope just dissolves because the people charged with taking their nations forward are just not up to the task. Here is a man that has gone above and beyond in every walk of life.


Whether sitting in this place or in our normal lives, we or any person can look to him for inspiration and for a role model—one that I know we will all fail. But we can at least attempt in our normal way of life to reach some of that forgiving nature that he not only espoused but lived by. It was not the words which so many other members today have repeated, though they are eloquent, they are brilliant, they are moving and they are going to go down in history through the aeons. It is the fact that he followed those through actions—actions that are quite beyond what we recognise as being not just acceptable but what mankind has been known to do.


Some have reflected upon the fact that South Africa today is not a brilliant nation, but think of what it was only a short time ago. And it has come to this point in its history largely through a movement and through a belief, but it is through the leadership of an individual. As the member for Berowra has said, he has been to the island and he has been in the prison cell. He has been able to experience that and to have that soak in; to appreciate that Mandela, for 365 days a year for 27 years through the best years of his life, not thinking there was any hope that that was ever going to end, would come out at the other end of that and then walk as tall as he has done—to walk into a community of whites and sit down and break bread with the man who wanted to see him sentenced to death—and at no stage show retribution. If all of us in this place can draw something from this man's life, then his impacts will go way beyond South Africa, and way beyond this generation. They will live on in generations to come. That is what we owe him for what he has achieved, and for the sacrifices that he and his family and his community have endured for so long. If we do that, then that is the simply the greatest honour that we can pay him. We thank him for his contribution. We acknowledge his life. We celebrate his life. And we pass on our condolences to everybody who is feeling the pain of his passing.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (18:36):  Much will be said and forever pondered on the life of Nelson Mandela. Over the last few days, many eloquent words have been spoken—and will be spoken—about this remarkable man who has forever changed our world. Yesterday, I was reading the Sunday papers and reflecting on his life as I looked through the photo galleries. I was confronted by an image of Nelson Mandela finally walking free. You are always struck when you see images like this by the vulnerability and the humanity of the man—incarcerated for 27 years yet so inspired that he never lost his passion to see his vision of a free South Africa.


In historic times when these things happen, many of us think back and ask, where were you when this happened? For me, I was at school in year 7. I was only 12 years of age. My teacher was one of the most amazing men that I would ever have the privilege to meet, a gentleman by the name of Nigel Kleinveldt. Mr Kleinveldt was what would have been described under the apartheid regime as a 'coloured' man, and hence had left South Africa. This was a moment in history that he was never going to miss—having a class whilst watching Mandela finally walk free. Mr Kleinveldt booked the TV for our class, and we sat watching history unfold before us. As a 12-year-old, I did not fully understand at the time the significance of what I was viewing, but I could see and I did understand the emotion on the face of my remarkable teacher, Mr Kleinveldt, and through him I saw what it meant to so many people—the inspiration of Nelson Mandela. This is possibly one of my most striking memories from my schooldays. I doubt I will ever be able to thank Nigel Kleinveldt enough for being able to share this emotion with us.


I echo the sentiments of so many of the previous speakers today. Nelson Mandela was a remarkable man. So much more than just a political leader, he was also a moral leader, a philanthropist, an anti-apartheid revolutionary and a freedom fighter. He is one of those towering figures of the 20th century who will hold an enduring place alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King as an advocate for human dignity. With the death of Mandela, the world may have lost one of our living treasures. But the legacy of his life will live on for those he has touched and inspired, not only those who are alive today but also future generations. Mandela has truly enriched the lives and the future of our world. I would like to conclude today with a quote from Nelson Mandela himself:


When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity.


Based on this philosophy, one can be assured that Nelson Mandela will rest in peace. Vale Nelson Mandela.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (18:39):  In modern times words like 'iconic' or 'living legend' or dare I say 'hero' are bandied about far too often. The superlatives we use for those who have passed make it difficult to differentiate and mark appropriately the passing of someone of the calibre and standing of Nelson Mandela. How do we acknowledge the contribution this man made to the world if all the accolades we could use have been used for others whose light shone pale by comparison to his?


Instead of doing that, I want to look at the greatest of Nelson Mandela's legacies. He was a man who, like all men, had human strengths and human frailties. His greatest gift without which his legacy would have been so much less was surely that of forgiveness. How many men—or women, for that matter—would have finished a 27-year prison term of hard labour and deprivation by forgiving their jailers? How many people would have been capable of the forgiveness and generosity of spirit that Mandela showed to those who held him and other South Africans as second-class human beings? His focus on the dignity of the human spirit over its thirst for revenge is the great inspiration he left the world. In this way he ranks with Gandhi as one of the true heroes of the modern age. Both Gandhi and Mandela responded to violence with peace and to anger with understanding. How often in our modern society do we glorify anger, violence and revenge? Our movies and television heroes do not respond to attack with humble and considerate reason. Instead, we often see our community fed a diet of anger and aggression. Our heroes are those who are most aggressive. It is the Mandelas and Gandhis of this world who are our true heroes. 


Nelson Mandela is a far better role model that any fake superhero or movie star. His vision for South Africa post apartheid was not to reverse the positions of power as a vengeful leader might have sought to do—and, as history shows, that has often been repeated—instead, his rainbow nation was designed to encompass all; to lift all, not to tread down some.


Of course such lofty ambition is not easily achieved and to say that there are no problems remaining in South Africa would be false. There is still much to be done in terms of standards of living, law and order and social harmony. It will fall to a new generation of leaders to finally finish the dream that Nelson Mandela began. Only time will tell if this new group of leaders is up to the task. However, such achievement would be possible only because they truly stand on the shoulders of a giant.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (18:43):  I follow the very telling and moving words of my colleague and friend the member for Forrest, who has joined many people in this chamber in paying their respects following the passing of Nelson Mandela. In life most heroes are anonymous, but Nelson Mandela was a hero who was far from anonymous. His public struggle for true democracy and freedom in his country, South Africa, was a struggle that galvanised supporters around the world. He truly was a great man who, passing at the age of 95, has left the world a better place than it was when he found it.


To think that he was imprisoned for 27 years! His sole job in prison was to break rocks. He was allowed one visitor every six months. He was a man of letters, but he was only allowed to write or receive one letter every six months. His eyesight was diminished by the glare of the quarry beneath his cell. It would have been easy for a man in that position to simply give up the struggle or to negotiate his principles away so that he could get out of incarceration. But Nelson Mandela said no to such overtures. Nelson Mandela did his time till he was released in 1990, and from there he became President of South Africa. The 'from prisoner to president' story knows no better example than that told by the life and times of Nelson Mandela.


What strikes me about this man's character is his dignity, his forbearance and his ability to look beyond the hardship of his years and the nature of his imprisonment and the attacks which he had to confront throughout his whole life. He was able to rise above all these things and to reach out to the white rulers in South Africa and plot a path forward together with them. With FW de Klerk, who I believe deserves a lot of credit too, he formed a new South Africa without a bullet being fired. Democracy was awakened and a pluralistic country born which stands as an example to the world of what can be achieved through the ballot box as opposed to the end of a rifle.


I believe that Nelson Mandela is an inspiration to a generation of black, white and coloured people—and to humanity in general. I look up on my wall in my office here in parliament to a portrait of Abraham Lincoln as a man whose example stands the test of time. So too will the successors to me and my colleagues in this place be talking in 50 or 100 or 150 years' time about the achievements and the life of Nelson Mandela. There are not many people in the world who have had the impact of the same size and nature as the impact that Nelson Mandela has had.


There is a graphic example of the brilliance of this man. It is the way that he inspired his nation to win the 1995 Rugby World Cup by embracing the overwhelmingly white South African rugby team and leading the country off the battlefield while Francois Pienaar and others led it on the battlefield to victory in the World Cup. And we will never forget that picture of him wearing the cap from the Springboks, wearing the jumper of the Springboks and leading the rejoicing from the stadium.


I want to conclude by saying that we do celebrate Nelson Mandela's life. We do understand that he was a man, as my friend the member for Forrest said, who had strengths and, of course, as any person does, human frailties. We celebrate his contribution to humanity but we also understand that it is his legacy that must be protected, and we cannot be complacent about the harmony that may exist today in South Africa or indeed that exists around the world. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, not only was Nelson Mandela an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia but he was also a Nobel Prize winner. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in 1993 he said about the struggle against apartheid and the people who got behind that struggle against apartheid the following:


These countless human beings, both inside and outside our country, had the nobility of spirit to stand in the path of tyranny and injustice, without seeking selfish gain. They recognised that an injury to one is an injury to all and therefore acted together in defense of justice and a common human decency.


I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that that is a paragraph that can be extended far beyond its application to just South Africa and apartheid rule there.


So we remember on this day Nelson Mandela. We thank him for his service. We say to the people of South Africa that we, Australia, are with you. We are proud that we played a small but significant role in the anti-apartheid movement and we look forward to a world in which Mandela's legacy is not only strengthened but is remembered in the best possible way.

 (Forrest—Government Whip) (18:53):  As the Deputy Speaker would know I have waged a long battle, as he has, for a fair and better go for regional students in the tertiary education system in this country. It was my motion on 28 October 2010 which called on the then Labor government to reverse its decision to discriminate against regional students in the changes that they made to youth allowance. This motion was the first defeat on the floor of the House for an incumbent government for a long, long time, and in my view represented a low point for Labor in power at that time.


I thought it was a low point as well because of the importance of that particular issue and the importance of youth allowance to young people who live in rural, regional and remote areas. Labor had, as we saw repeatedly, disadvantaged regional Australian families and students for the express purpose, in this case, of diverting funds into outer metropolitan seats. For those of us who live in regional areas and work with people in those areas, this had an immediate and profound effect. I know that members like me had family after family and young person after young person coming to see them, and it was the most dreadful time.


I was in a supermarket and had a mum come up to me in desperation because she wanted to talk to me about the fact that she had to choose which one of her children she could afford to send to university in Perth. They lived two or three hours away and they had no choice. Her children did not have the choice to be educated locally; they had to move to the city. Of course, this meant that families had to choose. I had one particular family who had five children who needed to go to university, and the family could not afford to send them. I had one mum who said to me, 'Both my husband and I have gone and got second jobs to try to give our children the opportunity to go to university.' That came about through the changes that the Labor government made at that time.


There was a two-year campaign in 2010 and 2011 before the previous Labor government made some changes. There were profound efforts, and there was an inquiry into this. The inquiry came into my electorate, and many of the families who had worked with me for so long on this came along and gave evidence to that inquiry. They were very honest to the inquiry, and for practical purposes they could demonstrate exactly what this had done.


When I visited schools, what disturbed me most was that these great young people from my part of the world had literally changed their options to the subjects they were taking because they knew their families could not afford to send them to university, so they had made conscious decisions about their futures because they would never be able to afford that option. That, as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, was something I found very hard to deal with: that these great young people were unable to pursue their ambitions and their dreams. They were not able to go to university. The measure of support that youth allowance gave them was the difference between being able to go to university and not being able to go to university. Of course, we rely on those young people to come back into our communities and to be our leaders of the future or really important parts of our community.


So this was something that many of us fought very hard for at the time. I wondered then why, as part of making the change, the previous Labor government then added a parental means test to the students who were classified as independent, even though they were independent of their families. We know that many students have to take a year off to earn enough to be considered independent, and that applies particularly to regional students. They have no choice but to move away, and they have so many costs when they move, including accommodation and the food that they need. They cannot even go home to their families. They have no choice but to live away. Not only does this often create some social and emotional challenges for them; it creates a huge financial burden on each of those families. They are costs that those who live in a metropolitan area would not have to face, and they would have the support of their families around them in often trying circumstances when they are going to university and studying.


The then education minister, Julia Gillard, changed the rules and used the maps where the ABS defined the Australian Standard Geographical Classification remoteness areas to pick the winners and losers. That divided the regional students again: those in outer regional and remote areas, who could access youth allowance after taking a single gap year; and the losers, technically in the so-called inner regional zones, who had to take two years off. It certainly did what it was intended to do, which was to reduce the number of regional students who were able to achieve independent status. It drove regional students out of the education process. This was a two-year battle.


The Labor government took independent status away from inner and outer regional students unless they took the two years off. Inner and outer regional students could then only qualify under the new rules for independents and earn their funds in blocks of 30 hours over 18 months. So there have been more and more challenges for these young people and their families to meet. For outer regional students 2013 was the first time that the means test applied. This was really an unforgivable decision by the then Labor government. There is no doubt that this was seen as discriminatory. In my area families came, and still come, to tell me that they believe that this is a form of discrimination against their children and their children's opportunities.


We know that young people in rural and regional areas are desperate for the opportunity to pursue their education. Often the only option they have for the courses they seek is a city based university. None of us underestimates the disadvantage they face. We are already seeing a reduced number of students from rural and regional areas go to university. This is something that has plagued me and still does. It is certainly something that plagues rural and regional students and their families. The whole family feels this.


When I look now at it, I see that these same families are being hit again by the debt and deficit we have been left. Our gross debt is over $400 billion and our interest payments are over $10 billion and I think, in relation to regional families and students, that is a lot of education opportunities for students in rural and regional areas. That is something that the previous Labor government clearly took lightly, but it is not something that regional families take lightly. One of the most important issues is opportunity for their students and their young people. They are constantly talking to me. They know I took a very strong position on this and that I would have sought a review on this whole process.


I intend to keep fighting for rural and regional students and their families. For these young people their time at university makes a difference for their whole life. None of us here underestimate the importance of education, and certainly not for those in rural and regional areas. We want our young people to come back to us. We want them to go away, get an education and qualify themselves. These are the young people who come back to us. I want to bring them back. I want to see them come back as doctors, specialists, engineers, teachers, whatever. They will make fantastic members of our community, but they need the education to start with. A key part of that is the additional cost involved for a rural and regional student in pursuing their education away from their home. That is why the issue of youth allowance is so critical to so many students and their families. Like my colleagues, I will continue to work on this issue.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (19:03):  Now that we are in the final week of this parliamentary year, it is worth reflecting on some of Newcastle's achievements and on the new government's agenda and the impact that might have for the people of my electorate of Newcastle. I do have many concerns. The time allotted tonight does not allow me to go through them all, so I will focus on a number that I believe have the broadest reach, particularly for the electorate of Newcastle.


As I touched on in my first speech, Newcastle is a city that leads with distinction in so many areas, such as the arts, science, sports, innovation, manufacturing and education. We are world leaders in a number of scientific fields that are directly saving lives. Researchers like Newcastle's laureate Professor John Aitken, the 2012 New South Wales scientist of the year, and his fellow researchers at HMRI are making a difference in medical research.


We are producing award-winning plays that are touring the country. In October this year, Alana Valentine won three Australian Writers' Guild awards for her 2012 play Grounded, which was centred on the famous grounding of the Pasha Bulker on Nobby's Beach in Newcastle in the 2007 storms that ravaged our city. We are home also to some of Australia's best athletes. World-beaters like Paralympians Kurt Fearnley and Christie Dawes are leading the way, and many young athletes are following. Even my team, the Newcastle Knights, had a good year, finishing in the final four in the NRL. We have some of the best journalists, too. Just last month, Newcastle Herald journalist Joanne McCarthy won the Gold Walkley for her coverage of the sexual abuse of children, helping to uncover decades of abuse within the Catholic Church in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley. It is a shocking part of our history, but her dedication to exposing the truth was necessary and much lauded. We also host great events, and we build amazing things.


I stood for the seat of Newcastle for Labor on the basis that I believed we had the best plan for the electorate and for the nation—a plan that would address needs, a plan that made sense, a plan that mapped out a future and a plan that was all-encompassing. Notwithstanding the distinct lack of plans this government have for Newcastle, I now have concerns that their commission of cuts will further harm the city. Agreements are being torn up, contracts are going unhonoured and promises are being broken every day.


On 15 April 2010 the then Minister for Education, the Hon. Julia Gillard MP, initiated a review of funding arrangements for schools to look at a new way of supporting Australian children. The result was the Gonski report—a report that recommended a new system of funding education, a system that tackled inequity and disadvantage to make education accessible for everyone and to level the playing fields to give every kid a chance, a system that was transparent, fair and sustainable, a system that promoted excellent education outcomes for all Australian students. The Gonski recommendations and funding arrangements were announced in April this year, passing through the parliament not long after. New South Wales, the ACT, South Australia, Tasmania, the Catholic schools group and the independent schools group all signed up. At one stage even the now Prime Minister and the now Minister for Education pledged their support for the model. They went to the election pledging a unity ticket on education.


We all know the story since then—the acrobatic flip-flopping between support, nonsupport, more funding, less funding and now the no-strings-attached cash handout for state governments. In the end, it seems as though the government have landed on less overall funding and have scrapped the recommendations for reform. It is little wonder that people are saying this is not the government they voted for. Abandoning the system does not make sense. It was created by the best minds in this country. It tackled inequity. This government clearly do not believe that everyone should have the same opportunities. Indeed, the Minister for Education has now declared that he does not believe there is an equity problem in Australian education. The evidence does not agree with him. Last week, the Program for International Student Assessment report released by the OECD showed that disadvantaged students in Australia are up to three years behind their peers and that students in regional and remote areas are almost a year behind city students.


We know that under the existing funding model we were falling behind. That is why we were reforming the system that got us into this position. It is apt today that I quote perhaps the greatest tackler of inequality in our history, Nelson Mandela. He said:


Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.


I urge the government to reconsider their reforms and to stick with the system that the Gonski report set out. It would be a powerful weapon to change Australia.


I also have concerns for the training and higher education sectors, which are areas where Newcastle thrives. The Labor government threw open the doors to Australian universities, with 190,000 more Australians now attending universities compared to 2007, enabling any Australian with ability and commitment to attend university. The 'commission of cuts' is promising to close the doors on higher education. The University of Newcastle, Australia's leader in opening doors to higher education through their enabling programs for universities, will suffer. The next generation of Australians will suffer.


In Newcastle, the higher education and TAFE sectors work very closely together to improve outcomes for students. I recently had the pleasure of attending an evening of recognition for the University of Newcastle industrial design graduates. These were not necessarily graduates who had the highest or best academic records throughout high school. They were the students who found their way to university through TAFE. The first three years of their degrees took place at TAFE, equipping them with the necessary practical skills before their study and research were refined at the University of Newcastle. They are the idea makers of tomorrow who, through a good education and a strong partnership between education sectors, are now graduating from our universities.


I note that the recent decisions of the New South Wales government to cut our TAFE system will have massive implications for those kinds of cross-partnerships between the university and TAFE, where we have done some great training. But more people have gained access to university study and education under Labor, and the track record there is substantial.


Access to education is likely to be cut, and funding to schools operating with this no-strings agreement is going to end in poor outcomes for Newcastle.


Sticking with my education concerns, I just finally mention that the parents and families who find it difficult to put their kids through school are now looking at losing out on the schoolkids bonus. It looks like there are more than 6,200 low- and middle-income-earning families in my electorate of Newcastle who are set to miss out on the schoolkids bonus under the watch of this new government. The schoolkids bonus is not beer-and-skittles money, as the Prime Minister has described it; it is money that helps families put their kids through school. Uniforms, shoes, textbooks, school equipment, school camps, laptops and school fees are not free. All of these things cost money, and the schoolkids bonus helps those who need it most.


As disappointing as it is that this government had no particular plan for Newcastle, made no promises to build on our education or infrastructure sectors and did not make any particular pledges to any of our industries in the area, you can be assured that I will continue to stand up for my community and hold this government to account for every cut to every job and every service that hurts the people of Newcastle.

Ms MacTiernan
  asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 14 November 2013:


In respect of NAPLAN, administered under the Australian Curriculum Assessment Reporting Authority, (a) how were the minimum standards determined in 2007, (b) what is the basis for yearly changes in the scoring necessary to achieve the minimum standards, and (c) who is undertaking the current review of the minimum standards, what is the plan for consultation, and when is the report on the review expected.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-12-09,"



Mr Pyne:

The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(a) The National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scale bands, including the National Minimum Standards (NMS), were developed during 2007 by the Australian Education Systems Officials' Committee (AESOC) NAPLAN Steering Group. 


The Steering Group received advice from the Expert Advisory Group (comprising leading Australian measurement experts) and were also informed by existing state and territory literacy and numeracy assessment programs that preceded NAPLAN. The bands were endorsed by AESOC early in 2008.


The NMS for each year level is represented by a particular band on the ten band NAPLAN common scale. The skills described in the table at Attachment A represent those assessed in NAPLAN tests at the relevant NMS band level for each year level. This information is available at www.nap.edu.au.


(b) The NMS remain the same from year to year and do not change. The scoring processes of NAPLAN tests have also not changed from the inception of NAPLAN. The number of correct responses needed to meet or surpass the NMS may change from year to year depending upon the difficulty of the current test when it is compared with the initial 2008 NAPLAN test. 


A well-established psychometric equating process is used to adjust for differences in the difficulty of the tests across years so that the results from different years can be reported on the same achievement scale. 


(c) The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) is reviewing a range of matters relating to reporting student performance as part of its ongoing work to align NAPLAN with the Australian Curriculum and transition to online testing. This work will also take account of results from and standards set for international testing programs in which Australia participates. 


ACARA's work will take account of a request from the Council of Australian Governments in June 2012 to the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC) to give consideration to establishing 'proficient' NAPLAN standards, which would further strengthen focus on reporting student achievement across multiple levels. 


In undertaking this work, ACARA will seek advice from its advisory, reference and working groups. These groups comprise departmental and school sector representatives, measurement experts, and representatives from other organisations. Advice on changes to the NAPLAN reporting process will be presented to the ACARA Board and SCSEEC during 2014 as part of the overall implementation of NAPLAN online. 


Any change to the NMS and the process for reporting on student performance will require a decision from SCSEEC.
