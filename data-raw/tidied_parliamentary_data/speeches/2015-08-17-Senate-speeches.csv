Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (10:02):  It is a pleasure to be able to continue my remarks in relation to the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill. I believe there is a pressing need to fix the current legislation: to re-establish the ABCC so as to re-establish meaningful penalties that can actually deter people considering compliance with the law as optional and stop them from repeatedly breaking the law as it suits them; to re-establish an effective building code to ensure contractors that want to do taxpayer funded work strictly meet all of their legal obligations, including laws dealing with worker entitlements, workplace safety and migration laws; to ensure antiquated practices that only add cost and delay are avoided on taxpayer funded projects; and to remove the absurd restriction on the regulator's ability to enforce the law in the public interest where parties reach a private settlement in their own commercial interests. This is a Labor and Greens imposed restriction that does not apply to any other Commonwealth regulator.


The building and construction industry is very important for the Australian economy not only because of the number of people it employs and the number of families it supports but also because it represents approximately eight per cent of GDP, which is similar to the contribution made by the mining industry. The building and construction industry can be an important source of sustainable, high-paying jobs. That is why it is so important to ensure the rule of law is respected by those in the construction industry, and that thuggery, intimidation and coercion are effectively dealt with. When projects are delivered on time and on budget, there is more money for more projects and that benefits the construction industry with not only more work and jobs but it also, more importantly, provides a better return for the Australian economy and the Australian consumer. The taxpayer and the consumer ultimately pay for construction delays and budget blow-outs.


The bill to establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission will re-establish a genuinely strong watchdog to maintain the rule of law and to protect workers and constructors. A re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission will improve productivity on building sites and construction projects, whether on shore or offshore. The re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission will bring to the industry confidence that the rule of law will be applied. This will encourage further investment and provide more jobs and greater prosperity for workers and the economy. The bill will prohibit unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination.


Labor experimented with a weaker regulator when it abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, strung one hand behind the regulator's back, slashed the regulator's budget by a third, reduced its staff complement by a third, and, alarmingly, reduced the applicable penalties for wrongdoing by two thirds.


A key feature of the government's legislation to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission will see a return of penalties for unlawful conduct that are high enough to actually deter people who repeatedly break the law to suit their industrial agendas. For many years, it has unfortunately been only too clear that the commercial building and construction sector provides the worst examples of industrial unlawfulness. In 2003 the Cole royal commission examined the construction industry and noted that it is characterised by unlawful conduct, and concluded:


These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular.


And:



… the rule of law has little or no currency in the building and construction industry in Western Australia … The ... industry ... is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously.


The royal commission findings lifted the veil on what everyone in the industry had known for years. Previous governments had been unwilling or too intimidated to tackle it. The Howard government was prepared to step in and make the tough decisions required to clean up the sector. The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 provided a genuinely strong watchdog and dissolved the 1970s-style practices that plagued the industry. It was a strong, specialist regulator that enforced the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector. Even Labor reluctantly acknowledged the need for a regulator and retained the Australian Building and Construction Commission, with its coercive powers, for its first term of government. It then, regrettably, abolished the ABCC and replaced it with a weak imitation with a slashed budget.


The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission saw a decrease in lawlessness. Site managers reported that for the first time in years they could focus on building rather than industrial relations. Over its term in government, Labor progressively dismantled the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and abolished it in 2012. Almost immediately, as night follows day. militancy and violence was demonstrated on the streets of Melbourne with the CFMEU shutting down part of the Melbourne CBD in its aggressive protest at the Grocon Myer Emporium construction site. In that dispute workers on the site who were being blockaded purchased an advertisement in the Herald Sun with an open letter to their own union bosses asking for the blockades to stop and to be given access to their own workplace. Images of these protests were seen on television screens across the world. What message did that send to national and international companies about investing in building construction projects in Melbourne or Australia? In what was unfortunately only too characteristic of the approach in the building and construction industry, on 4 September 2012 in that same dispute which shut down part of the Melbourne CBD, senior CFMEU official Derek Christopher addressed a crowd of over 1,000 protestors on Lonsdale Street with a megaphone. With fewer than 100 police officers present, he said:


There’s 11,000 coppers in the country or in Victoria and there’s 30,000 members of the CFMEU and greater among the other unions when we call on their support, so we’re up around the 50,000 mark, so bring it on we’re ready to rumble.


The approach by this union thug epitomizes the approach taken to the application of the rule of law in the industry by the CFMEU, amongst others. The current industry regulator advises that the spread of unlawfulness in the industry was a feature of Victoria and Western Australia and has now spread to Queensland and South Australia.


The previous government was well aware of this type of behaviour in the building and construction industry, and so was understandably reluctant to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission despite the strong union pressure. It contracted Justice Murray Wilcox QC to review the industry to buy time. Justice Wilcox recognised the need for and the benefit provided by the Australian Building and Construction Commission, stating in his report:


… the ABCC's work is not yet done.


and that it would be unfortunate if the ABCC's replacement body led to a reversal of the progress that had been made. But that is exactly what we have seen.


The principal purpose of penalties in the legislation is as a deterrent. As the royal commission into trade union governance and corruption concluded in its interim report, there is a culture of wilful defiance of the law which appears to lie at the core of the CFMEU. Unions began budgeting for penalties for breaking industrial laws and treated penalties simply as a cost of doing business. The Federal Court noted that comments such as, 'The last time it cost us'—I will say 'a bucketload' of money; I do not want to swear!—'and it is going to be expensive, but our fighting fund will fix it'. This is evidence of an attitude on the part of branch officials that the risk of the imposition of significant pecuniary penalties will not be allowed to act as a constraint on unlawful activity which they consider to be warranted.


In recent findings against the CFMEU for contempt of the Supreme Court orders in Victoria—and this was for shutting down parts of the Melbourne CBD—the Supreme Court said that the imposition of a penalty for contempt of court should not be viewed as simply an anticipated cost of industrial action. Few things could be more destructive to the authority of the court and to the rule of law then the idea that fines or similar punishments akin to a tax that, once budgeted for, enable the use of unlawful conduct to achieve industrial outcomes.


When Labor abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, it slashed applicable penalties by two-thirds. This only made it cheaper for the CFMEU to continue its business model of breaking the law. Even when maximum penalties were still at a meaningful level, the Federal Court said that the CFMEU had a 'deplorable record' of contraventions, that the contraventions were significant and that substantial penalties for past misconduct had not served to prevent repetition.


It was a few months ago that the Federal Court handed down yet another penalty, finding against the CFMEU, noting that the CFMEU's continued willingness to engage in contravening conduct supports the view that earlier penalties, some of them severe, had not had the deterrent effect.


The court went on to speak, in relation to the CFMEU's contravention, about the deplorable attitude on the part of the CFMEU to its legal obligations and to the statutory process which govern relations between unions and employers in this country, and that this ongoing willingness to engage in contravening conduct must weigh heavily when the need for both specific and general deterrence is brought to account.


The court also went on to say that, not for the first time, the CFMEU sought to impose its will by means of threats and coercion against employers. Its approach was one of entitlement. It was free, despite legal constraint, to deploy its considerable resources in order to achieve its industrial objectives. The concept of the rule of law was anathema to it.


This is not some historical exercise; this is a real and current problem. We must not forget that the maximum penalties are reserved for the worst offenders and repeated offences. It is extremely unlikely that individuals are penalised anywhere near the maximum for first offences.


In what was the last of the Australian Building and Construction Commission's legacy cases—meaning that it was a last case before the maximum penalty was cut by two-thirds—the CFMEU was found to have broken the law when it shut down work on a Queensland government housing project, which would have provided housing for the long-term homeless. The CFMEU proceeded to use cars to block access to the site and abused any worker who tried to enter the site.


Workers were repeatedly called 'scabs, parasites and dogs' plus a smattering of unparliamentary expletives. In fact one CFMEU official, Paul Cradden, approached one of the site workers and flooded him with aggressive attacks, saying to him, 'Hey scabby, gay boy, gay boy, gay boy, scabby. The CFMEU officials also made sure to let people know who they were dealing with. The court's decision records that while people outside the main gate were yelling 'scum' and 'scab', a CFMEU official, Mr Miles, said to a group of contractors words to the effect of, 'You've all got a long time left in the industry and we can influence your future jobs.' The clear implication was: 'Do not cross the CFMEU. We will ruin you, your business and your livelihoods.'


The CFMEU think they are a law unto themselves. We cannot in this country allow this state of affairs to continue in this industry and assist the kind of behaviour that the Labor Party or the Greens, who continue to accept substantial donations of support from the union, condone. The Federal Court certainly did not. It fined the CFMEU and a string of its officials a total of $545,000 for their offences, but, despite such a penalty, the CFMEU has not been deterred and it continues to break the law as and when suits it. The point is this: if the former Australian Building and Construction Commission's penalties, which were larger, were only partially successful in deterring the repeated breaking of the law, what did Labor and the Greens really expect would happen when they slashed the maximum penalty for doing the wrong thing by two-thirds? We will no longer see the penalties of this magnitude because the penalty for wrongdoing was substantially cut.


Justice Logan called out the CFMEU for its outrageous disregard of the law, and reiterated the comments of other judges and Royal Commissioner Cole in condemning the union's perverse attitude to the law. In light of this, it is absolutely disingenuous to see the CFMEU feigning outrage at the government's efforts to restore lawfulness to the construction industry through the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The CFMEU pretends that the construction industry does not require special regulation, when it is precisely because of the CFMEU's disregard for the rule of law that special legislation is necessary.


If you need any further example, who can forget what John Setka, now the CFMEU Victorian state secretary, said to a crowd of 100 people outside the Australian Building and Construction Commission offices? Directing his comments to the public servants working at the Australian Building and Construction Commission, this CFMEU official said:


And just for the task force, or ‘Rats’, ‘Dogs’ whatever they are—


he is referring to the inspectors, the public servants, employed by the Australian Building and Construction Commission—


just to remember one thing, when this is all over and they don’t exist anymore, they’ve got to work elsewhere and we will remember them 'cause we know every—


they really do swear a lot these union officials—


one of them; We'll never forget 'em.


Hindering regulatory powers is something that the CFMEU prides itself on. The former Labor government gave into unions demands and abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, replacing it with a severely curtailed version of the regulator in the Fair Work building industry inspectorate. As well as this inspectorate having its power substantially curtailed, it faced significant reductions in funding and cuts to staffing of around 30 per cent. In closing, I totally support this bill and the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is certainly needed so that we can cut down on the misbehaviour and the bad behaviour of the CFMEU.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:18):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 in the hope that it does not pass this Senate and also to make it clear why Labor opposes this legislation, which of course forces a return to the draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission. This bill is seeking to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which was created in 2005 theoretically to investigate breaches of federal industrial law in the building and construction industry. In reality, it was then something far more pernicious and its re-establishment threatens no less than that.


The ABCC's proposed powers are extreme, to say the least, and undermine this country's very civil liberties. But before I continue, I must bring to the Senate's attention the consistent ideological attack of the Abbott government upon the working people of Australia, which really goes to the foundation of this bill. The attack by the conservative Abbott government on working people, who organise together to protect their rights, is explicit both in this bill and in the establishment of the biased, prejudicial and political witch-hunt this government calls a royal commission.


I will not reflect upon the character of anyone involved in the royal commission, although whether the commissioner can continue in his role due to the clear present bias and the political nature of his appointment is an issue worth debating. Instead, I want to draw to the Senate's attention the foundational common law case Crown and Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy from1924 in which it was found:


… that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.


And that:


Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of justice.


The simple facts of this case are that Justice Dyson Heydon, whilst royal commissioner of an $80 million quasi-judicial inquiry into unions and Labor prime ministers, accepted an invitation to speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser. He has created at least the appearance of bias and, even to the most unreasonable person on the street, he has raised a suspicion that his professional judgement might be unduly influenced.


The Prime Minister has described Justice Heydon as the most distinguished person in the legal profession. If that is so, I then have no doubt that a man of Justice Heydon's distinguished legal experience and expertise knows that he has no other option but to recuse himself from the commission. I think that the commissioner really needs to consider whether his ongoing role in the royal commission is tenable. 


Justice, however, will not be accorded to workers who are brought before the reconstituted ABCC when it uses its reconstituted powers under this bill to compel workers to suffer secret interviews without legal representation and under the threat of imprisonment if they resists coercion. These powers are excessive, undemocratic and unwarranted. It sounds like something directly out of the Stasi handbook of the 1950s. This bill extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods on building sites. The new powers are aimed squarely at stopping pickets and include a reverse onus that will require individuals to prove they were not motivated by industrial objectives to escape the mere $34,000 penalty that will be put upon them if they were.


The case for the reintroduction of the ABCC has not been made. We know that Labor's Fair Work Building and Construction agency already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour in the industry. The ABCC is based on flawed modelling and its proposed powers, as I said, are extreme and unnecessary and compromise our civil liberties.


Further, I find that this particular legislation is demonising and discriminating against workers in the construction industry—against a particular group of workers. It is subjecting them to harsher laws than any other workers in this country. No other workers are being subjected to this level of demonising and discriminatory law changes. The Abbott government's determination to take Australia back to the ABCC shows a return to something very similar, in my belief, to Work Choices, which, as we know, lurks just below the surface of this government.


As I said, the Fair Work Building and Construction agency established by Labor already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour in the industry. It has a full suite of appropriate investigation and prosecution powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour, whether by employers, employees, unions or contractors. Fair Work Building and Construction is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations, getting more matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry. Indeed, Fair Work Building and Construction has already recovered more than $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Those were the sorts of breaches that the ABCC never focused upon. It was quite happy for workers to miss out on their fair share of wages and conditions. Those are the sorts of breaches which need to be readily investigated for a fair and transparent industry.


ABS data shows industrial disputation in the building and construction industry is, on average, less than one fifth the rate seen under the previous coalition government. Labour productivity has increased over the last 10 quarters and is almost three times higher, on average, under Fair Work than under Work Choices. Under Fair Work, the rates of industrial disputes are around one-third the rate we saw under the previous coalition government, yet the conservative Abbott government does not want to listen to any of that good news for workers and for employers. The government is not interested in giving workers a fair go. The government is only interested in systematically pursuing Australian workers through draconian laws like this.


Labor's dissenting report to this bill made very clear that there are very serious concerns of the human rights impact of this legislation. In fact, Labor believes that this bill represents a direct attack on the common law rights and privileges which form the cornerstone of our democratic and legal systems. This legislation seeks to demonise an industry, treat its workers as criminals and remove their rights in law. Not only will Labor oppose this bill but we will fight the Abbott government's ideological war on working Australians every single step of the way, including in the building and construction industry. We will continue to fight so that all working Australians will receive the fair living wage they deserve for the hard work they do in all industries and we will also ensure that the rights of all Australians are given equal respect under the law. It is for these reasons that Labor opposes this draconian legislation which tries to return the ABCC into law. It is my hope that it does not pass the Senate. It is my hope, very much, that those in the Senate, particularly those on the crossbenches, see sense to the threat of this law to our civil liberties, to the human rights of workers and to the demonising of a particular set of workers in this country and uphold the Australian ethos of the fair go for all.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-08-17,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I rise today to talk about the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill. It is a subject that I know a little bit about because I have worked in the building and construction industry for nearly 40 years. However, a definite split has developed over the years between the commercial construction industry on the one hand and the housing construction industry on the other. The glaring difference between these two construction environments is that you do not get the kind of criminal conduct on housing construction sites that you do on commercial construction sites. So what is the difference? Why do we not have the criminal behaviour, or anything like it, at home-building sites in the housing industry? The answer is: we do not see the CFMEU and its members on housing construction sites. We are having this debate about reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is because the ABCC is the only body capable of keeping the CFMEU in check on commercial building sites.


Those who have been listening carefully to my questions to various ministers in this place will know that I have been advocating for unemployed people to be able to work on terms and conditions which suit them. The unemployed are presently trapped in a workplace regulation prison. They cannot escape because there are so many patronising organisations that say, 'We have to lock you up in this workplace regulation prison for your own good, because you might be exploited if we let you out.' Yet, as I have mentioned in examples before, nobody stops young people from travelling to some of the most dangerous places on earth where they could be taken hostage or harmed. Yes, the department of foreign affairs issues travel warnings about some countries, but it ultimately respects the rights of people to go wherever they like in the world and take whatever risks they like. There is no travel prison regulating where people can travel. For some reason, we respect an Australian citizen's inalienable right to travel and expose themselves to potentially life-threatening risk, but if they want to go and work somewhere then they are captive to over 2,000 pages of workplace regulations. In some circumstances, these regulations have made it illegal for workers to negotiate terms and conditions which suit them. We hear the term 'paternalism' used in this place and throughout history, but the epitome of paternalism is the workplace regulation prison.


I challenge one person arguing in favour of workplace regulation to say that they have never taken the cheapest quote to have a job done. Whether it is something you need fixed at home, the servicing of your car or which hairdresser you go to, it is human nature to shop around or to change service providers because you have found a better deal. This is not considered criminal behaviour when you choose the cheapest quote, yet somehow when it comes to labour in other contexts there are regulations to say that the minimum price, for example, for working on a weekend is $40 an hour. But please spare a thought for the thousands of unemployed who are struggling on $5 an hour. These people are ready, willing and able to work for $20 an hour but it is against the law. The law says, 'No, cafe owners and others must pay $40 an hour'. But the cafe owners and others cannot afford $40 an hour, so they do not open their doors. Everyone loses: the unemployed person stays on the dole, the cafe owner cannot open and the customers cannot buy what they want. It is immoral to deny people the right to work and support their families. The contrary view on workplace regulation is this view that you simply must lock up the unemployed in this prison to protect themselves from exploitation. It is the very reason that these powerful organisations are a law unto themselves—but I digress.


Returning to the dire state of the commercial construction industry, what we are seeing here is leadership failure at every level. At the last count there were something like 80 different definitions of leadership. My favourite definition of leadership is: that which you will not tolerate. What is it that you will not tolerate? That determines what kind of a leader you are. What we are seeing in the commercial construction industry is a total failure of leadership. Let us look at some of them. The previous Labor government deliberately removed any notion that it was necessary to constrain criminal behaviour by certain unions. They were prepared to tolerate criminal behaviour—a failure. The police have failed to uphold the law in favour of so-called keeping the peace. They will tolerate criminal behaviour if it means keeping the peace—another failure of leadership. The courts have failed to uphold justice. In some cases those who have suffered unlawful behaviour wait years and years for justice. As we know, justice delayed is justice denied, and now we see in this bill the government's desire to increase penalties out of frustration at the relatively low penalties and, therefore, the low economic incentive to promote lawful behaviour. The judicial system: another failure of leadership.


When you have these growing power bases developing on construction sites, you get ridiculous situations such as those this bill seeks to rectify, including: contractors being forced to employ a non-working shop steward; situations where, if one worker is offered overtime, all workers have to be offered overtime, even if there is not enough work; and trade contractors being required to provide certain conditions to their workers even if they already have lawful arrangements with them. This bill would hope to address these and other allegations of standover tactics, intimidation and violence.


The Independent Contractors Association of Australia asserts in its submission to the Victorian CCCU inquiry that independent contractors working on the Westgate Bridge upgrade in 2009-10 were taunted regularly with 'It's a long way to fall, mate' because they were not members of the CFMEU. This is outrageous. Never in 40 years of working on housing construction sites have I heard someone saying to a fellow construction worker, 'It's a long way to fall, mate.' The ICA has posted footage of the violence and foul verbal abuse that workers were subjected to entering a worksite. The ICA went on to assert that, when the ABCC was in operation before 2010, the ABCC 'in large measure curtailed a good deal of the abuse and harassment in the Victorian construction industry, although'—sadly—'it did not eliminate it'.


The Greens talk at times about a 'social licence to operate'. In my opinion, the CFMEU does not even have a social licence to exist, let alone operate. Senator Lambie has called for the CFMEU to be deregulated. In his book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell talked about 'thin slicing'. Blink is the book and I recommend it. Weighing up situations in the blink of an eye. Looking for the shibboleths, the dead giveaways. For those who are not familiar with the Old Testament, 'shibboleth' is Hebrew for stream. Jephthah and Gilead fought Ephraimites and captured the Jordan crossing. To distinguish who was friend or foe, they had everyone say the word 'shibboleth'. If they could not pronounce is correctly, they knew they were the enemy. Hence 'shibboleth' became an identifier or a dead giveaway. It would be like hearing someone say, 'Where did I put my jandals?' Straightaway you would know they are a New Zealander. It is a shibboleth. Gladwell calls it 'thin slicing'. He says you can take a big salami and, no matter how thinly you slice that salami, everything you want to know about the whole salami is in that thin slice.


I note the CFMEU gave over $100,000 to the Greens before the last election. How morally bankrupt can you get when you oppose this legislation and you have received money from the CFMEU. The Greens, the party that pretends to be a party of ethics and morality, gladly takes money from the CFMEU. There's your 'blink' moment, your 'thin slice' of the Greens. The Greens shibboleth. Everything you want to know about them is right there.


By contrast, look at the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. I have never once heard allegations that they have engaged in criminal behaviour or provided funding to the Greens. The Shoppies have more in common with Family First than the Greens. The Independent Contractors Association says in the submission I mentioned earlier that the previous federal construction code changed the dynamic of reducing the violence, harassment and intimidation on construction sites. It did so because:


… any construction business that was involved in or permitted anti-competitive industrial relations activity (including violence and intimidation) found itself excluded from government work. This changed the commercial ‘reward’ system because the financial benefits from violence and intimidation were largely removed. Unfortunately this was undone with the closing down of the ABCC.


This bill creates the capacity for a new building code. I have heard about the huge cost blow-outs, enabled by the existing code. In my home state of South Australia the state Labor government is building a brand-new hospital, recently built a health and medical research institute, made a major expansion of the grandstands at Adelaide Oval and is, with the help of the Commonwealth, about to commence major and long-overdue roadworks. We have had to fight hard to get Commonwealth funding to support those projects and yet where will a significant percentage of that federal taxpayer money go? It will go into supporting the inefficiencies provided by the current building code. 


Look at the stadium construction project my Western Australian colleagues have happening in their capital and at the new footbridge they think will be better than Adelaide's new footbridge. Indeed, just on Thursday TheFinancial Reviewreported that 76 workers at the new children's hospital project in Perth were found, by the Federal Court, to have engaged in unlawful industrial action—on a children's hospital project! I see Senator Smith nodding. This happened in his home state. If taxpayers in the states that we senators here represent want value for state and federal taxpayer money we ought to demand that building codes support efficient civil construction projects—and that is not to mention private projects like the Olympic Dam expansion and other mining opportunities. When you have major inefficiencies, such as major work stoppages on questionable grounds, it is proper for the government to look at how we can ensure that those trying to create jobs and improve our economic situation can get on with the job to deliver projects on time and on budget. Let me quote from a report by Deloitte Access Economics, of last year, submitted to the Productivity Commission:


It is also worth highlighting that the rate of engineering construction cost increase has been notably higher for public sector projects … than private sector projects. Given the significant demand seen for resources investment, and the combination of a rising $A and high import component for resources projects … costs of imported materials … one might have thought this would be the other way around.


A loss of competitiveness in delivering infrastructure projects creates difficulties for the Australian economy …


I have heard allegations being made in this place about behaviour on construction sites and towards Fair Work Building and Construction officials which make one's hair curl. They are appalling allegations. I was willing to support the continuation of the powers needed by Fair Work Building and Construction during a previous session of the parliament when they were about to expire, because I believed there were legitimate concerns that needed investigation. For those same reasons and the factors I have outlined, whilst I am not generally in favour of expanding government power, the situation in the commercial construction industry has become so bad that we need to restore the ABCC. I support the bill.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:43):  Thank you very much for another very well informed and considered contribution to these matters, Senator Day. Those senators on the other side of the chamber would be well served if they paid more attention to contributions like Senator Day's. I commend him for that very powerful presentation.


It is also my pleasure to make a contribution this morning in support of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill, which should be fairly uncontroversial in the sense that all the bill is doing is making sure workers in the construction sector go about their jobs each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated or otherwise put upon by thugs within the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.


But before I proceed I just want to comment briefly on a contribution I heard from Senator Singh. If I heard her correctly she seems to take exception to the reverse onus of proof which is contained in this bill. I would just like to point out to Senator Singh and to other Labor and Greens senators who might make a contribution to this that such a provision is taken, pretty much cut and pasted I dare say, from the Fair Work Act that was passed by the former Labor government—cut and pasted from the Fair Work Act passed by the former Labor government! So, I think it is beholden on each and every speaker following on from me on the Labor side and on the Greens side to first and foremost answer these questions. What is their position? Is it consistent with the previous position? Has it changed from the previous position? And why might that be the case? So, that is a challenge for subsequent speakers.


Of course, the Labor Party cannot survive without the rivers of cash that flow to it from the union movement in this country. This point was demonstrated ably by Senator Day. And so it is that in the course of the debate on this legislation both here and in the other place, we have had the sorry sight of Labor members and senators getting to their feet and making excuses for bullying, intimidation and violent behaviour on construction and worksites across our country—indeed, even in my own state. I will come to that briefly.


It is really quite sad to see the once-great Labor Party reduced to such a state, but there we have it. I will come to some specific examples of the sort of conduct that Labor seeks to excuse in a brief moment. This legislation, however, goes to the heart of dealing with something that the Intergenerational report released earlier this year makes clear we must deal with, and that is improving productivity. We have heard, and we will no doubt continue to hear, histrionics from Labor senators about the provisions in this legislation. But desperately as they might wish otherwise, this is not a part of some grand conspiracy. This legislation is doing no more than what the coalition said we would do in the lead-up to the 2013 federal election.


This bill will finally re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong and independent watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and constructors and to improve productivity on building sites and construction projects whether onshore or offshore. This legislation will at long last reverse some of Labor's changes to the workplace relations laws which underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished by the Gillard government in 2012.


The bill prohibits unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination. It will put in place penalties that are high enough to provide an effective deterrent to breaches of these provisions. A number of effective remedies, including injunctions, will also be available to the ABCC and to persons affected by unlawful behaviour.


In passing this legislation the coalition government will finally be able to return some of the certainty and stability to the construction sector which went missing when Labor abolished the ABCC three years ago. Once again, we can banish some of the worst aspects of thuggery and lawlessness from construction sites across the nation and, most particularly, sites in Victoria and in my own state of Western Australia, where the corrosive culture within elements of the union movement have acted as a handbrake on economic activity for far too long.


Just to remind ourselves of the history of this issue: it was well known to insiders and to outsiders alike over many years that Australia's construction sector was home to the nation's most terrible examples of industrial thuggery and lawlessness. That was why in 2001 the Howard government's then workplace relations minister and now Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, established the Cole royal commission. It found that the standards of commercial industrial conduct exhibited in the building and construction industry varied significantly from those in the rest of the Australian economy—and not in a positive way.


Witness after witness testified to criminal conduct and unlawful and inappropriate conduct, including breaches of the relevant workplace relations and work health and safety legislation, and a blatant disregard for the law. When it came to my own state of Western Australia, the Cole royal commission found that:


… the rule of law has little or no currency in the building and construction industry in Western Australia.


'The rule of law has little or no currency.' Again, I quote:


The building and construction industry in Western Australia is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace.


Thus, in line with the recommendations that flowed from the Cole royal commission, the then Howard government moved in 2005 to set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a strong watchdog that would tackle lawlessness front-on. It was a strong, specialist regulator that enforced the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector.


Naturally then, as now, the move was opposed by the Australian Labor Party, which, at the end of the day, cares more about receiving its donations from the CFMEU than it does about the rule of law on Australia's construction sites. And over the three years between 2005 and 2012 when the Gillard government abolished the ABCC, what was the contribution of this body, which was detested, maligned and finally abolished by the Labor Party? According to independent research undertaken by Independent Economics in 2013, building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and fewer working days were lost through industrial action.


A rational and responsible political party would look at those things and think they were positives. They would speak from the evidence. Alas, though, we are talking about the Australian Labor Party, aided and supported by the Australian Greens, led at the time by Julia Gillard and staunchly supported by her at the time loyal minister for industrial relations, Mr Bill Shorten. Instead of exhibiting a bit of leadership, standing up to union leaders and telling them that, actually, the way that they had been behaving was not on and the ABCC was needed to keep the militants and lawbreakers within their ranks in check, what did Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten decide to do? They rolled over and did exactly what the CFMEU and other unions were demanding, and abolished the ABCC.


Of course, no-one would have been more delighted by this complete capitulation to union thuggery than the likes of Joe McDonald, the secretary of the CFMEU's WA branch. Without the ABCC in place, he has been free to resume his traditional disgraceful behaviour. Earlier this year Mr McDonald, who has a long history of bullying, intimidation and thuggery on Western Australian building sites, was fined $30,000 and banned from a Perth construction site for three years—once again for bullying. He was found to have threatened to have workers 'thrown off every building site in Perth' if they did not support strike action the CFMEU was encouraging. This is not an isolated case. Joe McDonald has repeated form in this area. Not long ago he and the CFMEU were fined almost $200,000 for their role in unlawful industrial action at the Citic Pacific Sino iron ore site in the Pilbara, in the far north of my home state. The federal court judgement in that case found:


Mr McDonald’s conduct involves a calculated and careless attitude to the law governing the employment of persons by employers. It was calculated to cause disruption to employers carrying out building and construction work on the site and it was careless in that McDonald was aware of the legal consequences of his actions and pursued them nonetheless.


Indeed, Mr McDonald was proud of his flagrant disregard for the law. On that occasion, when his right to be on site was challenged because he did not possess a right-of-entry permit, he blithely said:


I haven’t had one for seven years and that hasn’t—


expletive—


stopped me.


All told, Mr McDonald and the CFMEU have, between them, been penalised to the tune of more than $1 million over the past decade for illegal industrial actions. Joe McDonald's history of criminal thuggery is well known to Western Australians. Indeed, it became well-known nationally in 2007—so well known that the then Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, ordered his expulsion from the Australian Labor Party. Julia Gillard was right on board at the time, saying:


Kevin [Rudd] and I have made it clear that under our leadership of the Labor Party there will be zero tolerance for unlawful conduct, for thuggery, in Australian workplaces.


Yet she seemed to have had a change of heart because less than six years later Mr McDonald was readmitted to the ranks of the Australian Labor Party where, so far as I am aware, he remains as a member to this day. True or false: does Joe McDonald remain a member of the Australian Labor Party to this day? Perhaps future speakers from the Labor Party might like to clarify that point for me.


That is not to say that the CFMEU's mischief is limited to the confines of my home state of Western Australia. Indeed, in Victoria the problems have been even worse. Almost the moment that the former Labor government abolished the ABCC in 2012, we saw a significant upswing in disgraceful conduct from the CFMEU in Victoria. In September that year, the CFMEU sanctions brought Melbourne's CBD to a virtual standstill. If you wanted an insight into the mindset of the CFMEU's leadership, there could scarcely be a more powerful one than the sight of its leaders telling a crowd of its members:


There’s 11,000 coppers in the country or in Victoria and there’s 30,000 members of the CFMEU and greater among the other unions when we call on their support, so we’re up around the 50,000 mark, so bring it on, we’re ready to rumble.


That is what we are dealing with: basically, a union leader saying, 'Don't worry, comrades, we can take on the cops.' That might appeal to those who exist in a fantasyland where every day is a goodie versus baddie Hollywood style script—a battle between the poor downtrodden worker and moustache-twirling capitalists—but it simply does not reflect modern reality.


More than that, such behaviour does absolutely nothing to promote the certainty and stability that the construction sector requires. In case it needed pointing out, the companies that the CFMEU demonises are the ones that actually create jobs for its members and, importantly, for its members' families. The union itself does not create jobs; it seems to create only trouble. No stronger proof of the complete disconnect between the CFMEU and the interests of ordinary workers is needed than the fact that in 2012 workers on building sites published an open letter in the Herald Sun newspaper, not to the government but to the leadership of the union that supposedly represents their interests, begging them to stop the blockades and the violence and to allow workers on site so they could go to their jobs. It really is utterly perverse: workers having to beg their own union to let them do their job.


One wonders how it is that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, continues to tolerate this situation given the clearly criminal conduct undertaken by members of that union, including its senior figures like Mr McDonald, in Western Australia. Perhaps he values union donations more than the rule of law. Does Mr Shorten, the opposition leader, value union donations more than the rule of law? Perhaps future Labor senators speaking on this bill can clarify that point: does Mr Shorten, the opposition leader, value union donations more than the rule of law? Then again, perhaps we should not be surprised by his attitude, given the Leader of the Opposition's seeming attraction to militant union activity. That is no exaggeration. In 2013, in his capacity as Minister for Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten flew to Perth to address the conference of the Maritime Union of Australia. Standing in front of a banner boasting 150 years of militant struggle, Mr Shorten cheerfully told delegates: 'There's no place I'd rather be in Australia.' 'There's no place I'd rather be in Australia' than in front of a sign that talks about 140 years of militant struggle?


Of course, earlier this year we saw the MUA's ugly underbelly once again when, at its 2015 conference, a journalist from The Australian, Mr Andrew Burrell, was assaulted by an MUA member for the crime of attending the conference, which the MUA itself had invited him to attend. The MUA's WA secretary, Christy Cain, tried to distance his union from the attack. However, Mr Cain also sought to excuse the aggressor, subsequently identified as Mr Campbell Walton, on the ground he was suffering stress due to unemployment, except we later learned that was not true. Mr Walton is employed. He works as a stevedore in Perth and also owns his own earthworks business. Once again, we see a culture of thuggery, intimidation and violence from the union movement in Western Australia. Once again we have deafening silence on these issues from the union movement's backers here in the Senate. It is interesting to note, Senator Day, that during my contribution so far, not one Labor senator has come into this chamber, and the two Labor senators sitting in the chamber have not challenged what I have said—




Senator Bilyk:
  I have.




Senator SMITH:
  I have not heard a word, Senator Bilyk.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Ignore the interjection, Senator Smith, and I would encourage you not to invite the interjections.




Senator SMITH:
  When are the Labor Party going to say enough is enough and exile these rogue unions from its ranks? When are the Labor Party going to say enough is enough? Only when they are challenged by a coalition senator. What makes all this especially disappointing is that there are good unionists out there.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  This is a most important part of my contribution, Senator Bilyk. What makes all this especially disappointing is that there are good unionists in our country. There are those who genuinely try to provide a service to their members. I do not doubt that for a second, but their efforts are constantly overwhelmed by behaviour from their colleagues that is either aggressive or criminal or just downright stupid.


You do not have to take my word for it, and indeed I am sure you will not take my word for it. Not long ago, Mr Mark Olson, the WA state secretary of the Australian Nursing & Midwifery Federation, penned an opinion piece in which he called for unions to focus on their core business, which he believes might actually stop haemorrhaging membership numbers. He condemned the recent 'paltry gathering of a few hundred at the steps of Western Australia's Parliament House', which was supposed to represent a mass worker uprising but instead made him:


… wonder why this event was even happening, other than to try and help Labor … and perhaps boost the profiles of some union heavies in an election year.


He went on to say:


Workers are sick of self-serving union officials, helping out their buddies in the movement and in Labor, and not focusing on what's best for their members.


Indeed, Mr Olson is quite right, which is why workers are voting with their feet and why self-serving union figures like Mr Joe McDonald and Mr Christy Cain are resorting to increasingly desperate tactics to try and maintain their own relevance. This government is not about to let them do that, and it is certainly not going to do so at the expense of the national productivity growth.


Under the provisions of this legislation, the Australian Building and Construction Commission will be led by its commissioner, who will have the critical task of monitoring, promoting and enforcing appropriate standards of conduct by building industry participants and referring matters to other relevant agencies and bodies as required. The commissioner will also be responsible for investigating suspected contraventions of the law by building industry participants. They will also institute or intervene in proceedings in accordance with those laws and provide assistance and advice to building industry participants on their rights and obligations under designated building laws.


This government will make certain that the ABCC once re-established will be properly funded to ensure it can do its work and restore some certainty to the nation's construction sector, on which so much direct and indirect employment depends. This legislation enables the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to compel witnesses to attend an examination, or to produce documents, in circumstances where he or she reasonably believes that the person has information or documents relevant to an investigation into a suspected contravention of workplace relations laws. This is critical in making certain the re-established ABCC is able to carry out its investigations effectively. I have much more to say, but time is definitely against me.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:03):  I have to say I find it curious that the Prime Minister who said that Work Choices is 'dead, buried and cremated' seems to take a fairly backward step to the dark old days of Work Choices every time his government seeks to introduce a workplace relations bill to this parliament. While Labor struck a good balance between the rights of workers and the needs of employers in the Fair Work Act, every legislative move by this government has attempted to tip the balance unfairly back in favour of business.


We will be debating legislation this week which would tie up unions in so much red tape that they would be unable to effectively do their job—so much for a government that seeks to reduce red tape. Let us look at what has happened so far. So far we have seen legislation that will make it more difficult for union representatives to enter workplaces or talk to workers. We have seen attempts to reintroduce AWAs via the back door by weakening the better-off-overall test. We have seen the government dump Labor's 'clean start for cleaners' contracting principles, cutting the wages of cleaners who clean the buildings of government agencies, including this place. We have seen a highly centralised approach to bargaining across the Australian Public Service in an attempt to put strict caps on conditions and pay increases. We have seen the government try to cut paid parental leave for thousands of parents, mostly mothers, referring to many of them as 'double dippers' and 'rorters'.


In addition to the legislative attacks on unions and workers' rights and entitlements we have also seen $80 million of taxpayers' money already wasted on a political witch-hunt, the Productivity Commission being used as a proxy for the government's attack on penalty rates and the government flagging plans to legislate to wind back the protection of wages and conditions for Australian-crewed ships.


Work Choices is not 'dead, buried and cremated'; it is merely in hibernation. They have merely had it lying low. Let us not ever forget that Mr Abbott said Work Choices was 'good for wages; it was good for jobs; and it was good for workers'. Despite their rhetoric, we know that the coalition cannot walk away from Work Choices. The urge to reintroduce elements of Work Choices is Pavlovian. It is in their DNA. So it should not surprise any of us that the Abbott government will continue its attack on workers by dusting off its draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission, or ABCC.


The establishment of the ABCC, as Senator Smith said, followed the Cole royal commission. Senator Smith had a lot to say on the Cole royal commission, but there are a few things he did not mention, and I will come to those. The Cole royal commission was effectively a futile and very expensive exercise initiated by the current Prime Minister when he was workplace relations minister. It took 18 months and some $66 million to run the Cole royal commission but—and this is the bit Senator Smith did not say in his somewhat biased comments—after 18 months and $66 million of taxpayers' money, do you know how many criminal convictions the government managed to secure? Would anyone on that side like to hazard a guess? Let me tell you. None, not one, zilch, absolutely zero. So much for the supposed criminality, fraud and corruption in the building and construction industry.


It appears that Mr Abbott and those opposite have not learnt their lesson about the folly of using royal commissions to pursue ideological battles. A royal commission is meant to be an instrument of justice, not a political instrument. It is meant to shine a light in dark places and investigate matters that have been unable so far to be uncovered. But the Cole royal commission was the start of a pattern displayed by those opposite, a pattern of using royal commissions to pursue their ideological battles against political rivals.


Now we have got the long-running, expensive political witch-hunt in the form of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. For those in the gallery and those listening who may not be aware that the trade union royal commission is a political exercise, on this side we are particularly concerned with the royal commissioner's judgement in accepting an invitation to help raise funds for, guess who, the Liberal Party. The recent revelations about Mr Abbott's royal commission and his captain's pick of a royal commissioner, Mr Dyson Heydon, confirm this. The community have legitimate concerns about the affinity of the commissioner with Mr Abbott and the Liberal Party. In fact, over the weekend I do not know how many people spoke to me about it.


I believe the commissioner really needs to consider whether his ongoing role in the royal commission is tenable. The royal commission is and always has been a political exercise commenced by Mr Abbott to go after his political enemies. And who are his political enemies? The Labor Party and the trade union movement. I believe that only a lawyer with a predisposition to the Liberal Party would have taken on this blatantly political royal commission. You only have to look at the terms of reference to know the intention of the government and that it is a political witch-hunt.


In regard to the fundraising event that the commissioner was going to attend, no matter what the commissioner knew and when, it is clear from his own correspondence that his predisposition is to the Liberal side of politics. To top it all off, we have seen the New South Wales Liberal Party absolutely refusing to reveal when the commissioner was invited to speak at the Liberal Party fundraiser, an event that we all know has been addressed by prominent Liberals since it commenced in 2010. So I think there needs to be a bit of revisiting some of the commissioner's conduct, some of the commissioner's rulings and some of the commissioner's conclusions so far and the question needs to be asked: was any of it was influenced by the commissioner's political world view? The commissioner has consistently gone beyond what might constitute corruption to what is legitimate industrial behaviour dealt with according to the industrial laws in place in this country.


The tendency of those opposite to use royal commissions as a political instrument has many unfortunate consequences. One in particular is that they waste tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' moneys for absolutely no public benefit. Just look at the Cole royal commission. They are an exercise designed to produce a headline, to fight ideological battles and to embarrass the political rivals of those opposite. Another unfortunate consequence—and one I think is really sad—is that they have the potential to undermine the credibility of those royal commissions that actually are being used for public benefit and for justice and that are not merely a political exercise. With the royal commission currently being conducted into the serious issue of child sexual abuse—an issue which everybody in this place knows I am very passionate about—I consider this to be extremely unfortunate.


While those royal commissions that are used as an expensive political exercise by those opposite help to generate a headline, they are also a useful excuse for the coalition to introduce legislation aimed at gaining further power over their political rivals. And this was the other purpose of the Cole royal commission—to be the catalyst for establishing one of the most draconian bodies in Australia's history.


There is absolutely no justification for this bill we are debating today. There is already a watchdog for the building industry, and it is highly effective. The building industry watchdog that Labor put in place, Fair Work Building and Construction, has actually been outperforming the ABCC. Fair Work Building and Construction is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations and getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry. It has secured over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Under Fair Work, labour productivity is up, and industrial disputations have dropped dramatically compared to their levels under the Howard government.


The Abbott government use flawed modelling to back its argument that a body such as the ABCC needs to be reintroduced. The firm whose report they relied on, which is now called Independent Economics and was called Econtech, has a history of churning out report after report purporting to support the case for the government to attack the CFMEU. The claims in the report—particularly that the ABCC produced $6 billion in productivity savings—have been debunked by a range of people, including Justice Murray Wilcox QC, the Queensland Government's department of industrial relations, and academics from Griffith University. Justice Wilcox said the modelling is 'fundamentally flawed' and 'ought to be totally disregarded'. So basically you can disregard any comments that those on that side make in regard to those reports. But far be it from those opposite to engage in evidence-based policymaking, unless they are relying on discredited evidence which suits their predetermined agenda. For those opposite, this is personal and ideological. We know, as I have said, that Work Choices is in their DNA. We know that a coalition government will stop at nothing in attacking the rights and entitlements of workers. And we know that they will stop at nothing to attack those who stand in their way, particularly the trade union movement.


They do not like the fact that workers organise and bargain collectively, that they can negotiate on an even footing with big business—after all, big business are their financial and political backers, their mates. Those opposite, the Liberal-National coalition, are in their corner on workplace relations, just as they are on issues like multinational tax avoidance. Yet, those opposite have learned the hard way that Work Choices is politically toxic, so they try the boiled frog approach instead—introducing legislation bit by bit, aimed at cutting entitlements and attacking the collective power of the trade union movement. I think the Australian people are too smart to be fooled by that. They will not accept Work Choices 2.0 any more than they will accept the first version. Draconian bodies like the ABCC are part of the architecture of Work Choices and they should rightly be rejected.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-08-17,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:15):  At this stage, I would like to indicate that I will support the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill, but I reserve my position on the third reading. There are matters that I believe need to be thoroughly negotiated with the government, and with the opposition, in my view, to involve key stakeholders. That includes not only industry groups that are concerned about the state of play on building sites in this country but also the unions. These bills propose measures that are controversial and contentious. On the one hand, unions have a vital role in Australia's workplace relations system and they must have the freedom and power to be able to do their jobs. That involves not just issues about terms and conditions for their employees—obviously fundamental—but also issues of workplace safety. 


Whilst I was a member of the South Australian parliament, I did propose, and it was rejected by a state Labor government, that we ought to have industrial manslaughter laws. I think we need to have tougher laws in place when it comes to workplace safety and there ought to be appropriate and strong penalties in respect of that. Insofar as unions require a right of entry for the purpose of safety issues, then I think that is quite fundamental and ought not to be derogated from.


On the other hand, concerns have been raised through the royal commission, and the Boral court case cannot be ignored—and I will refer to that shortly. I think it is appropriate, at this stage, to refer to the controversy around Royal Commissioner Dyson Heydon and the invitation to a Liberal Party fundraiser. Notwithstanding that not much money probably would have been raised at that fundraiser—presumably there can be auctions and other peripheral fundraising activities that usually occur at these things—it was an invitation about which we need more information from the royal commissioner. I think it is quite reasonable for the royal commissioner to provide a detailed and thorough explanation as to what he was aware of at the time he accepted the invitation, when he accepted the invitation and whether he was the commissioner or about to be appointed as commissioner for this royal commission. If he did so whilst he was royal commissioner and he assumed that the royal commission would be over by then and that there would not be a problem attending this fundraiser, and he was aware that it was a Liberal Party fundraiser, then, on an objective basis, I think that would show a significant error of judgement on the part of the royal commissioner. If so, he ought to be apologise for that. 


Notwithstanding what the member for Sturt has said, that this was a birthday gift for him the other day on his 48th birthday—and happy belated birthday to Christopher Pyne—as you know, Acting Deputy President—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  I would ask you to refer to the member for Sturt by his appropriate title, Senator Xenophon.




Senator XENOPHON:
  What title would that be?




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr!




Senator XENOPHON:
  Mr Pyne, sorry—the Hon. Mr Pyne. Thank you for defending the honour of the Hon. Christopher Pyne, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very grateful for being pulled up on that.




Senator COLBECK:
  A principle worth upholding.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is worth upholding. It was unambiguously a very serious issue that still needs to be ventilated because there are issues that some have raised about apprehended bias. I know there are different academics raising different views about this. I note that Julian Burnside—no friend of the coalition government—has defended the commissioner. At the very least, if the commissioner accepted this invitation, assuming that the royal commission would be over, then I think it shows an error of judgement on his part and an explanation is warranted.


In my view, if you are a royal commissioner on something as contentious as this, then for the rest of your life you should not even be thinking about attending any political event or any party fundraiser. It is interesting to note what some commentators have said, such as Michael Stutchbury—the editor of The Financial Review—yesterday on Insiders. He used to do music reviews for me when I was on the Editor many years ago at Adelaide university and is a fine music review writer. He raised issues about the nature of the interchange between the royal commissioner and the opposition leader. There are some reasonable commentators who are saying that that may have been seen to be somewhat too harsh and unnecessary in terms of the royal commissioner's intervention. 


The royal commission has gathered evidence, some of which I find quite compelling, about allegations of corruption and about allegations of bullying and harassment. These matters also relate to serious allegations of misuse of funds, boycotts, threats and even corruption. These allegations, if true, are clearly unacceptable. And they raise the question of whether our existing legislative framework is strong enough to properly address these issues. We know the commercial building sector is a very substantial employer. I want a strong and vibrant building and construction industry in this country in the commercial sector as well as in the home-building sector. I want the workers in that industry to go to a safe working environment where occupational health and safety are of paramount consideration. I also want them to be well paid for the work that they do. If there are impediments, then they need to be dealt with in a way that people's rights are considered.


I want to make it very clear that union representatives I have worked with in the past and whom I am working with on current issues have always been strongly against the kind of action that this legislation aims to address. I think it is an interesting paradox that there is no suggestion that Michael O'Connor, the head of the CFMEU—someone with whom I have worked very closely on issues involving free trade, 457 visas and putting Australian jobs first—has been involved in these sorts of activities. If find him to be a person of great integrity.


I have also worked recently with Aaron Cartledge, the state secretary of the CFMEU in South Australia, who has been subject to some allegations. However, one issue that I have worked with him very constructively on is substance abuse on building sites, particularly the use of ice. He has shown a lot of leadership in relation to that, because he does not tolerate it and the impact that it can have on a work force and the safety of not only those who are abusing the substance but also others on building sites. 


More recently, I have also worked with Mr Cartledge and met with a number of subcontractors in relation to the collapse of Tagara Builders—a complete mess that has left many people in the lurch. I have to give credit to Mr Cartledge for the work that he has done on that. We need a better approach to this in consultation with industry so that subbies—the subcontractors—who have been left in the lurch and face financial ruin have better forms of redress. I also wish to pay tribute to Senator Cameron's work in relation to this, and I hope that the inquiry will have a hearing in Adelaide sooner rather than later, because it would be incredibly welcome. We need a better approach to dealing with that.


Insofar as there are allegations of bullying, intimidation and corruption, they need to be dealt with. I do not subscribe to the view that unions are uniformly bad or that they have too much power. I do very strongly believe that they have responsibility and a duty of care to their members; in the environment that they work in, they do not cause unnecessary and needless disruption; and they should be subject to greater scrutiny in that regard.


I also believe that, as in any negotiation, there may be particular individuals or groups who act in their own interests who are rogue operators instead of acting in their members' broader interests. It is these people who I believe this legislation ought to be targeting. The question is: are the measures in these bills fair and proportionate to the issues that they are trying to address?


I have some concerns about limiting the control of a body such as the ABCC solely to the building and construction industry—and I do not want to verbal my friend and colleague Senator Madigan about what to do about corruption in other sectors where there are concerns in other workplaces. I acknowledge the argument, however, that this is where most of the concerns have arisen but I wonder whether this legislation should be so targeted at one sector. Surely, there are legitimate concerns in other sectors that could benefit from the oversight provisions in these bills. 


A few months ago I supported, unambiguously, the need to give the fair work building inspectorate the coercive powers to call in witnesses just as the ACCC, ASIC and other key regulators have. Without those powers, you will not get in my view some witnesses coming forward. There has been intimidation in respect of that from the evidence that I have heard.


I note that my crossbench colleagues Senators Madigan and Lambie have expressed concern about the breadth of this legislation. I look forward to exploring these matters in more detail during the committee stage, if the bill is passed at the second reading stage—as I hope it will—because I think these are legitimate issues that need to be vented.


I also think it is important to clarify that I believe that some changes need to be made in this area. What I am hoping to have clarified by the government through this process is why the new ABCC has to be established and why the additional powers should simply rest with the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate or Fair Work more broadly. I will also be seeking assurances from the government in relation to maintaining the right of entry and other matters for union representatives in relation to legitimate workplace and safety issues. I do not want to see reasonable union behaviour curtailed and I want unions and businesses to have access to the tools they need to combat the serious issues that have come to light. 


In relation to the issue of Boral, that is a matter still before the courts; however, I do not think it is improper to raise the fact that this has taken a long time for our legal system to deal with these issues. It raises issues about access to justice, which is a much broader issue in civil and all sorts of disputes in this country, but it has had a significant impact on one particular company. If the allegations are proven, then it raises issues as to whether there has been an abuse of power in that regard. I think that there must be a better way for the resolution of such disputes, and the difficulties in the gathering of evidence in this case raise issues about whether you need to have the sorts of mechanisms that have been raised in this legislation in some form to deal with disputes. 


At the end of the day—and I emphasise this—I want there to be a strong building and construction industry in this country. Building and construction can provide a real antidote to the job losses we are expecting in manufacturing. Having people working in a safe, working environment on good incomes is absolutely fundamental. My concern is that there needs to be some reform to help facilitate that. The issue is: to what extent do you go in this legislation? I think it is worth having this bill go into committee for further negotiations in respect of this.

Prior to the 2013 federal election, the coalition committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to restore the rule of law to a sector that is plagued by lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery. The government consulted widely seeking feedback on this important policy to identify issues which need to be addressed.


The construction industry is critical to a productive and prosperous Australia and is vital for jobs. It is the nation's third largest employer, with more than one million people employed by the 100,000-plus predominantly small and medium businesses. The sustainability and success of the construction sector are crucial to the Australian economy and to the Australian people.


The need to re-establish the ABCC is clear and evident. This industry, regrettably, stands apart from others in terms of its industrial unlawfulness. For far too long there has not been a meaningful consequence in the construction industry for doing the wrong thing. Who is then surprised that this has resulted in a culture where complying with the law is taken to be merely optional? Industrial laws and penalties in this industry are seen as no more serious than a parking ticket where the fine is paid, the cost charged to the client or union members and the offending conduct repeated again and again. Since 2005 the courts have imposed fines of over $6.1 million on CFMEU related unions and officials for proven breaches of the law, but even this has not been enough to deter those activities from continuing—remembering that these are breaches of laws that have passed through this chamber but are yet ignored. The Federal Court recently spoke of the CFMEU's 'outrageous disregard' for 'Australian industrial norms'. The court also cautioned that breaking the law should not be seen as 'nothing more than an affordable price of doing business'. Yet, because Labor and the Greens slashed the maximum penalties for industrial wrongdoing in this area by two-thirds, that has only promoted the CFMEU's business model of breaking the law.


Re-establishing the ABCC is about introducing a meaningful consequence for unlawful industrial conduct in the construction industry, whether by unions or employers. It is about bringing about a needed change in the culture. When there is an effective regulator enforcing laws with meaningful penalties, there will once again be a deterrent for breaking the law, and those who would previously have done the wrong thing, simply because they could, will think twice.


While the ABCC existed, the performance of the construction sector improved. The ABCC contributed to economic benefits for consumers, higher levels of productivity and fewer days lost to industrial action, and we saw an increase in respect for the rule of law across the country. This benefited all law-abiding workers, unions and employers and the taxpayer.


Labor abolished the ABCC in 2012 and replaced it with a significantly weakened regulator. Labor slashed its budget by $9 million each year, making it even more difficult for the independent regulator to do its job. What flowed from Labor abolishing the ABCC was entirely predictable. Almost immediately we saw the CFMEU shut down parts of the Melbourne CBD for days on end in defiance of Supreme Court orders. Who can forget seeing on the news footage of protesters yelling abuse and threatening workers trying to get to work—workers who were actually members of the CFMEU, by the way—or protesters attacking police horses? All this while, CFMEU officials actively promoted this ugliness.


I am amazed that certain Labor and Greens senators opposite sit in silence when faced with such conduct and do not immediately condemn such abhorrent and repeated unlawful and thuggish behaviour. If the Senate were faced with such unlawfulness in another part of society as has been seen in the construction industry, there would be an outcry, and rightly so, yet we have silence from those opposite in respect of the construction sector. There are currently 69 CFMEU representatives before the courts or the Fair Work Commission, and the courts have time and again commented that the CFMEU simply shows no contrition despite repeated penalties being imposed on it for its wrongdoing.


The current system is simply not effective. It was only on Friday last week that a Federal Court judge fined a CFMEU official for his contempt in ignoring the court's orders. The judge said:


The CFMEU has a significant history of non-compliance with the provisions of industrial legislation … I have remarked upon the fact that each of the individual respondents' conduct indicates that each—


with the exception of one individual—


simply did not care about complying with the entry provisions.


In that case, the court found that the CFMEU officials had threatened to go to war against the subcontractor if he did not employ a CFMEU official and put him on the payroll. This was last week in South Australia, not some historical reference to the former BLF. This was a decision of the Federal Court in Adelaide just three days ago.


It reminds me of an earlier case where a CFMEU official was found to have said to a contractor in Victoria:


Everything works on a bit for youse and a bit for us. Forget about the law, … right?


Another CFMEU official in Queensland was found to have told a group of contractors who had been prevented from working because of the union blockade:


You've all got a long time left in the industry, and we can influence your future jobs.


When one of the subcontractors asked, 'What are the consequences to my business if I bring my boys on site?' the union official replied:


You want to know what the consequences are? You would be committing industrial suicide.


I am sure senators from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland in particular would join me in condemning these examples of the disregard shown for the laws of this parliament in their home states.


Regrettably, these are not isolated incidents. They disclose a culture in the construction industry of wilful defiance. The list of examples continues. Only last week, there were allegations finally explored in the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption over the conduct of the CFMEU—listen to this—in siphoning off half of all employer EBA payments meant for a drug and alcohol facility straight into the CFMEU's own coffers.


In another example of the graft revealed in evidence, the CFMEU had skimmed $80,000 of a $100,000 donation by a construction company to a drug and alcohol facility. The CFMEU took an unauthorised 80 per cent donation for itself. Yet Labor and the Greens would say, 'Nothing to be seen here; move right along. We don't need to deal with this.' This conduct shows there are elements in the industry, particularly in the construction division of the CFMEU, that are more interested in exercising their power over overs and lining their own pockets. I would also say that I think employers have a huge responsibility here. But one suspects these payments are simply made to buy some industrial peace and whether the money gets used for drug and alcohol purposes is a secondary consideration.


I will move on to the point of safety. The act that established the former ABCC, the present bill and Labor's Fair Work Act have the same standard of safety in respect of stopping work over safety concerns. The proposed ABCC legislation uses the very same standard on safety that Labor put in its Fair Work Act and which currently applies in the construction industry. Incidentally, this is the exact same standard which was previously included in the former ABCC legislation. This bill does not contain any provisions that would prevent legitimate safety issues in the building industry from being raised and addressed by employees, unions or state and territory work, health and safety regulators. I also note that the bill retains the role of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian government's building and construction industry work, health and safety accreditation scheme. The misrepresentations over this important issue should be seen for the shameless tactic it is; namely, to deflect and distract from their unlawful industrial conduct.


On the issue of the compulsory powers, I have made it clear many times in this place that they are similar to powers that Labor gave to the FWBC. And Senator Xenophon outlined that the powers that the ACCC, ASIC and APRA have are very similar, other than there are a lot more safeguards under this legislation.


A very important aspect of this legislation is that it will remove the absurd and unprincipled restriction on the current regulator to which no other Commonwealth regulator is subject. This is in fact without precedent. This restriction prevents the regulator from commencing or continuing legal proceedings if private industrial parties reach a 'settlement' in their own interest. This put private interests above the public interests. When this absurd restriction was forced through this place by Labor and the Greens even the Law Council of Australia condemned such a restriction on a public regulator. This private settlement arrangement is subject to abuse. It is the equivalent of the Fair Work Ombudsman being unable to prosecute an employer guilty of underpaying a worker because the worker and employer reached a confidential settlement which could be for a nominal sum of $1. This also has the perverse outcome that, once wrongdoers achieve what they set out to achieve through unlawful means, they have an added incentive to coerce parties into confidential settlements so the public regulator cannot prosecute. 


We recently saw an example of how this absurd restriction played out in Queensland with respect to the nine-week strike at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital site. Just before the judge handed down his decision on wrongdoing over the nine-week stoppage, the CFMEU and ETU entered a confidential settlement with the builder; meaning the FWBC was unable to take any action in the courts in respect of the nine weeks that were lost on that important public project. At the end of the day, the regulator was legally prevented from enforcing the law and the taxpayer was left to foot the bill. If such a restriction on enforcing the law in the public interest were imposed on the police, on the Fair Work Ombudsman or the ACCC, there would be an outcry from those opposite—and rightly so. Yet, when the favour is done for the benefit of the construction unions, which are significant donors to Labor and the Greens, there is simply shameful silence from those opposite.


Any objective observer can recognise that there is a particular problem in this industry; yet the ABCC was regrettably abolished before it could achieve a lasting change in culture in the industry. I recall at one time the construction union was crying for 'one law for all' in arguing for the abolition of the only regulator that was keeping it in check. When one considers the appalling rap sheet of the CFMEU and its litany of regular and repeated industrial contraventions, it is clear that the CFMEU has no credibility when it calls for the application of 'one law for all'. It ignores Supreme Court injunctions. It ignores orders of the Fair Work Commission. It thumbs its nose at the rule of law, which it says everybody should abide by. The FWBC reports that it now has more cases before the courts than ever before. As I said a moment ago, there are currently 69 representatives before the courts. More than 90 per cent of FWBC cases before the courts involve allegations of wrongdoing by the CFMEU. Is anyone surprised that the ABCC, which was effectively started to hold the CFMEU to account for breaking the law is opposed by the CFMEU?


There has been the suggestion that, as a solution, we should deregister the CFMEU. I would make three points. Firstly, when the Builders Labourers Federation was deregistered in the 1980s it was a Labor government, with the support of a responsible opposition, that passed the legislation. The fact is that the current Labor opposition and the Greens are so beholden to the CFMEU that they would not support such a measure. Secondly, the deregistration of the BLF did not solve the problem of the culture in the industry. Here we are again dealing with the BLF by a different name and once again facing endemic industrial unlawfulness in the industry. Former BLF tactics have simply migrated to the CFMEU—which leads me to my third and key point.


The purpose of the ABCC is to introduce into the industry the concept of respect for the rule of law. The ABCC will work to introduce a culture in which any party, whether an employer, employee or union, accepts that they must comply with the laws set by this parliament. Indeed, I am reminded that just last week Baulderstone, a major construction company, was fined for having demoted a worker where the only reason that could be proffered was that this worker had resigned from the CFMEU. This sort of cooperation behind the scenes between big unions and big employers needs to be weeded out, and I am delighted that Baulderstone was publicly shamed by this case and fined for so doing. This is why we need the ABCC.


The bill will also provide for a building code. This applies to employers, and only employers can be sanctioned for breaches of it. The code will mean employers can no longer just ignore wrongdoing on their sites because they do not want to get involved. Employers will no longer be able to ignore inefficient practices and cost blowouts because they know they can just pass the cost on to their client, who is often the taxpayer. The building code will require strict compliance with employment, safety and migration laws. Why shouldn't the taxpayer expect that projects funded with tax dollars are run efficiently, lawfully and safely? The new code will have a new and streamlined enforcement mechanism to allow the ABCC to efficiently impose sanctions on employers who breach the code. The code will introduce a real commercial consequence on employers for doing the wrong thing or for allowing laws to be broken on their sites.


There has been a concerted campaign of misinformation about the code—for example, the absurd suggestion that the code bans RDOs or time off over Christmas or Easter. Each of these claims is simply false. Why they are made beggars belief, but it indicates the paucity of argument against the proposal that is currently before the Senate. One only needs to ask: what are the true motivations for the misrepresentation and untruths that are propagated in opposition to the return of an effective regulator and an effective building code that will hold employers to account?


The problem of endemic industrial unlawfulness in this industry has been clearly established. No objective observer can argue that the construction industry is simply like any other; it has shown itself to stand apart from other industries. The current laws have proven not to be enough. What is proposed in this legislation is about changing culture so this industry becomes like every other—that is, one in which the law always applies rather than only when convenient. The Senate today has a clear choice before it: to either send a message to the construction industry that it must comply with the law like everyone else or turn a blind eye and endorse the construction industry's history of ignoring the laws of this parliament and engaging in intimidation and bullying.


The problems with this industry are obvious. The choice is clear. The consequences flowing from that choice will be evident soon enough. As this nation embarks upon its most ambitious infrastructure-funding project of over $50 billion, it is vital to ensure that the construction sector is brought to account to abide by the rule of law so that the $50 billion worth of money invested by the Australian taxpayer proves value for money and that these projects can come in on time and on budget. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-08-17,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (10:02):  It is a pleasure to be able to continue my remarks in relation to the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill. I believe there is a pressing need to fix the current legislation: to re-establish the ABCC so as to re-establish meaningful penalties that can actually deter people considering compliance with the law as optional and stop them from repeatedly breaking the law as it suits them; to re-establish an effective building code to ensure contractors that want to do taxpayer funded work strictly meet all of their legal obligations, including laws dealing with worker entitlements, workplace safety and migration laws; to ensure antiquated practices that only add cost and delay are avoided on taxpayer funded projects; and to remove the absurd restriction on the regulator's ability to enforce the law in the public interest where parties reach a private settlement in their own commercial interests. This is a Labor and Greens imposed restriction that does not apply to any other Commonwealth regulator.


The building and construction industry is very important for the Australian economy not only because of the number of people it employs and the number of families it supports but also because it represents approximately eight per cent of GDP, which is similar to the contribution made by the mining industry. The building and construction industry can be an important source of sustainable, high-paying jobs. That is why it is so important to ensure the rule of law is respected by those in the construction industry, and that thuggery, intimidation and coercion are effectively dealt with. When projects are delivered on time and on budget, there is more money for more projects and that benefits the construction industry with not only more work and jobs but it also, more importantly, provides a better return for the Australian economy and the Australian consumer. The taxpayer and the consumer ultimately pay for construction delays and budget blow-outs.


The bill to establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission will re-establish a genuinely strong watchdog to maintain the rule of law and to protect workers and constructors. A re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission will improve productivity on building sites and construction projects, whether on shore or offshore. The re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission will bring to the industry confidence that the rule of law will be applied. This will encourage further investment and provide more jobs and greater prosperity for workers and the economy. The bill will prohibit unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination.


Labor experimented with a weaker regulator when it abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, strung one hand behind the regulator's back, slashed the regulator's budget by a third, reduced its staff complement by a third, and, alarmingly, reduced the applicable penalties for wrongdoing by two thirds.


A key feature of the government's legislation to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission will see a return of penalties for unlawful conduct that are high enough to actually deter people who repeatedly break the law to suit their industrial agendas. For many years, it has unfortunately been only too clear that the commercial building and construction sector provides the worst examples of industrial unlawfulness. In 2003 the Cole royal commission examined the construction industry and noted that it is characterised by unlawful conduct, and concluded:


These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular.


And:



… the rule of law has little or no currency in the building and construction industry in Western Australia … The ... industry ... is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors and workers face this culture continuously.


The royal commission findings lifted the veil on what everyone in the industry had known for years. Previous governments had been unwilling or too intimidated to tackle it. The Howard government was prepared to step in and make the tough decisions required to clean up the sector. The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 provided a genuinely strong watchdog and dissolved the 1970s-style practices that plagued the industry. It was a strong, specialist regulator that enforced the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector. Even Labor reluctantly acknowledged the need for a regulator and retained the Australian Building and Construction Commission, with its coercive powers, for its first term of government. It then, regrettably, abolished the ABCC and replaced it with a weak imitation with a slashed budget.


The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission saw a decrease in lawlessness. Site managers reported that for the first time in years they could focus on building rather than industrial relations. Over its term in government, Labor progressively dismantled the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and abolished it in 2012. Almost immediately, as night follows day. militancy and violence was demonstrated on the streets of Melbourne with the CFMEU shutting down part of the Melbourne CBD in its aggressive protest at the Grocon Myer Emporium construction site. In that dispute workers on the site who were being blockaded purchased an advertisement in the Herald Sun with an open letter to their own union bosses asking for the blockades to stop and to be given access to their own workplace. Images of these protests were seen on television screens across the world. What message did that send to national and international companies about investing in building construction projects in Melbourne or Australia? In what was unfortunately only too characteristic of the approach in the building and construction industry, on 4 September 2012 in that same dispute which shut down part of the Melbourne CBD, senior CFMEU official Derek Christopher addressed a crowd of over 1,000 protestors on Lonsdale Street with a megaphone. With fewer than 100 police officers present, he said:


There’s 11,000 coppers in the country or in Victoria and there’s 30,000 members of the CFMEU and greater among the other unions when we call on their support, so we’re up around the 50,000 mark, so bring it on we’re ready to rumble.


The approach by this union thug epitomizes the approach taken to the application of the rule of law in the industry by the CFMEU, amongst others. The current industry regulator advises that the spread of unlawfulness in the industry was a feature of Victoria and Western Australia and has now spread to Queensland and South Australia.


The previous government was well aware of this type of behaviour in the building and construction industry, and so was understandably reluctant to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission despite the strong union pressure. It contracted Justice Murray Wilcox QC to review the industry to buy time. Justice Wilcox recognised the need for and the benefit provided by the Australian Building and Construction Commission, stating in his report:


… the ABCC's work is not yet done.


and that it would be unfortunate if the ABCC's replacement body led to a reversal of the progress that had been made. But that is exactly what we have seen.


The principal purpose of penalties in the legislation is as a deterrent. As the royal commission into trade union governance and corruption concluded in its interim report, there is a culture of wilful defiance of the law which appears to lie at the core of the CFMEU. Unions began budgeting for penalties for breaking industrial laws and treated penalties simply as a cost of doing business. The Federal Court noted that comments such as, 'The last time it cost us'—I will say 'a bucketload' of money; I do not want to swear!—'and it is going to be expensive, but our fighting fund will fix it'. This is evidence of an attitude on the part of branch officials that the risk of the imposition of significant pecuniary penalties will not be allowed to act as a constraint on unlawful activity which they consider to be warranted.


In recent findings against the CFMEU for contempt of the Supreme Court orders in Victoria—and this was for shutting down parts of the Melbourne CBD—the Supreme Court said that the imposition of a penalty for contempt of court should not be viewed as simply an anticipated cost of industrial action. Few things could be more destructive to the authority of the court and to the rule of law then the idea that fines or similar punishments akin to a tax that, once budgeted for, enable the use of unlawful conduct to achieve industrial outcomes.


When Labor abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, it slashed applicable penalties by two-thirds. This only made it cheaper for the CFMEU to continue its business model of breaking the law. Even when maximum penalties were still at a meaningful level, the Federal Court said that the CFMEU had a 'deplorable record' of contraventions, that the contraventions were significant and that substantial penalties for past misconduct had not served to prevent repetition.


It was a few months ago that the Federal Court handed down yet another penalty, finding against the CFMEU, noting that the CFMEU's continued willingness to engage in contravening conduct supports the view that earlier penalties, some of them severe, had not had the deterrent effect.


The court went on to speak, in relation to the CFMEU's contravention, about the deplorable attitude on the part of the CFMEU to its legal obligations and to the statutory process which govern relations between unions and employers in this country, and that this ongoing willingness to engage in contravening conduct must weigh heavily when the need for both specific and general deterrence is brought to account.


The court also went on to say that, not for the first time, the CFMEU sought to impose its will by means of threats and coercion against employers. Its approach was one of entitlement. It was free, despite legal constraint, to deploy its considerable resources in order to achieve its industrial objectives. The concept of the rule of law was anathema to it.


This is not some historical exercise; this is a real and current problem. We must not forget that the maximum penalties are reserved for the worst offenders and repeated offences. It is extremely unlikely that individuals are penalised anywhere near the maximum for first offences.


In what was the last of the Australian Building and Construction Commission's legacy cases—meaning that it was a last case before the maximum penalty was cut by two-thirds—the CFMEU was found to have broken the law when it shut down work on a Queensland government housing project, which would have provided housing for the long-term homeless. The CFMEU proceeded to use cars to block access to the site and abused any worker who tried to enter the site.


Workers were repeatedly called 'scabs, parasites and dogs' plus a smattering of unparliamentary expletives. In fact one CFMEU official, Paul Cradden, approached one of the site workers and flooded him with aggressive attacks, saying to him, 'Hey scabby, gay boy, gay boy, gay boy, scabby. The CFMEU officials also made sure to let people know who they were dealing with. The court's decision records that while people outside the main gate were yelling 'scum' and 'scab', a CFMEU official, Mr Miles, said to a group of contractors words to the effect of, 'You've all got a long time left in the industry and we can influence your future jobs.' The clear implication was: 'Do not cross the CFMEU. We will ruin you, your business and your livelihoods.'


The CFMEU think they are a law unto themselves. We cannot in this country allow this state of affairs to continue in this industry and assist the kind of behaviour that the Labor Party or the Greens, who continue to accept substantial donations of support from the union, condone. The Federal Court certainly did not. It fined the CFMEU and a string of its officials a total of $545,000 for their offences, but, despite such a penalty, the CFMEU has not been deterred and it continues to break the law as and when suits it. The point is this: if the former Australian Building and Construction Commission's penalties, which were larger, were only partially successful in deterring the repeated breaking of the law, what did Labor and the Greens really expect would happen when they slashed the maximum penalty for doing the wrong thing by two-thirds? We will no longer see the penalties of this magnitude because the penalty for wrongdoing was substantially cut.


Justice Logan called out the CFMEU for its outrageous disregard of the law, and reiterated the comments of other judges and Royal Commissioner Cole in condemning the union's perverse attitude to the law. In light of this, it is absolutely disingenuous to see the CFMEU feigning outrage at the government's efforts to restore lawfulness to the construction industry through the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The CFMEU pretends that the construction industry does not require special regulation, when it is precisely because of the CFMEU's disregard for the rule of law that special legislation is necessary.


If you need any further example, who can forget what John Setka, now the CFMEU Victorian state secretary, said to a crowd of 100 people outside the Australian Building and Construction Commission offices? Directing his comments to the public servants working at the Australian Building and Construction Commission, this CFMEU official said:


And just for the task force, or ‘Rats’, ‘Dogs’ whatever they are—


he is referring to the inspectors, the public servants, employed by the Australian Building and Construction Commission—


just to remember one thing, when this is all over and they don’t exist anymore, they’ve got to work elsewhere and we will remember them 'cause we know every—


they really do swear a lot these union officials—


one of them; We'll never forget 'em.


Hindering regulatory powers is something that the CFMEU prides itself on. The former Labor government gave into unions demands and abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission, replacing it with a severely curtailed version of the regulator in the Fair Work building industry inspectorate. As well as this inspectorate having its power substantially curtailed, it faced significant reductions in funding and cuts to staffing of around 30 per cent. In closing, I totally support this bill and the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is certainly needed so that we can cut down on the misbehaviour and the bad behaviour of the CFMEU.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:18):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 in the hope that it does not pass this Senate and also to make it clear why Labor opposes this legislation, which of course forces a return to the draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission. This bill is seeking to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which was created in 2005 theoretically to investigate breaches of federal industrial law in the building and construction industry. In reality, it was then something far more pernicious and its re-establishment threatens no less than that.


The ABCC's proposed powers are extreme, to say the least, and undermine this country's very civil liberties. But before I continue, I must bring to the Senate's attention the consistent ideological attack of the Abbott government upon the working people of Australia, which really goes to the foundation of this bill. The attack by the conservative Abbott government on working people, who organise together to protect their rights, is explicit both in this bill and in the establishment of the biased, prejudicial and political witch-hunt this government calls a royal commission.


I will not reflect upon the character of anyone involved in the royal commission, although whether the commissioner can continue in his role due to the clear present bias and the political nature of his appointment is an issue worth debating. Instead, I want to draw to the Senate's attention the foundational common law case Crown and Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy from1924 in which it was found:


… that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.


And that:


Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of justice.


The simple facts of this case are that Justice Dyson Heydon, whilst royal commissioner of an $80 million quasi-judicial inquiry into unions and Labor prime ministers, accepted an invitation to speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser. He has created at least the appearance of bias and, even to the most unreasonable person on the street, he has raised a suspicion that his professional judgement might be unduly influenced.


The Prime Minister has described Justice Heydon as the most distinguished person in the legal profession. If that is so, I then have no doubt that a man of Justice Heydon's distinguished legal experience and expertise knows that he has no other option but to recuse himself from the commission. I think that the commissioner really needs to consider whether his ongoing role in the royal commission is tenable. 


Justice, however, will not be accorded to workers who are brought before the reconstituted ABCC when it uses its reconstituted powers under this bill to compel workers to suffer secret interviews without legal representation and under the threat of imprisonment if they resists coercion. These powers are excessive, undemocratic and unwarranted. It sounds like something directly out of the Stasi handbook of the 1950s. This bill extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods on building sites. The new powers are aimed squarely at stopping pickets and include a reverse onus that will require individuals to prove they were not motivated by industrial objectives to escape the mere $34,000 penalty that will be put upon them if they were.


The case for the reintroduction of the ABCC has not been made. We know that Labor's Fair Work Building and Construction agency already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour in the industry. The ABCC is based on flawed modelling and its proposed powers, as I said, are extreme and unnecessary and compromise our civil liberties.


Further, I find that this particular legislation is demonising and discriminating against workers in the construction industry—against a particular group of workers. It is subjecting them to harsher laws than any other workers in this country. No other workers are being subjected to this level of demonising and discriminatory law changes. The Abbott government's determination to take Australia back to the ABCC shows a return to something very similar, in my belief, to Work Choices, which, as we know, lurks just below the surface of this government.


As I said, the Fair Work Building and Construction agency established by Labor already has sufficient powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour in the industry. It has a full suite of appropriate investigation and prosecution powers to deal with any unlawful behaviour, whether by employers, employees, unions or contractors. Fair Work Building and Construction is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations, getting more matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry. Indeed, Fair Work Building and Construction has already recovered more than $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Those were the sorts of breaches that the ABCC never focused upon. It was quite happy for workers to miss out on their fair share of wages and conditions. Those are the sorts of breaches which need to be readily investigated for a fair and transparent industry.


ABS data shows industrial disputation in the building and construction industry is, on average, less than one fifth the rate seen under the previous coalition government. Labour productivity has increased over the last 10 quarters and is almost three times higher, on average, under Fair Work than under Work Choices. Under Fair Work, the rates of industrial disputes are around one-third the rate we saw under the previous coalition government, yet the conservative Abbott government does not want to listen to any of that good news for workers and for employers. The government is not interested in giving workers a fair go. The government is only interested in systematically pursuing Australian workers through draconian laws like this.


Labor's dissenting report to this bill made very clear that there are very serious concerns of the human rights impact of this legislation. In fact, Labor believes that this bill represents a direct attack on the common law rights and privileges which form the cornerstone of our democratic and legal systems. This legislation seeks to demonise an industry, treat its workers as criminals and remove their rights in law. Not only will Labor oppose this bill but we will fight the Abbott government's ideological war on working Australians every single step of the way, including in the building and construction industry. We will continue to fight so that all working Australians will receive the fair living wage they deserve for the hard work they do in all industries and we will also ensure that the rights of all Australians are given equal respect under the law. It is for these reasons that Labor opposes this draconian legislation which tries to return the ABCC into law. It is my hope that it does not pass the Senate. It is my hope, very much, that those in the Senate, particularly those on the crossbenches, see sense to the threat of this law to our civil liberties, to the human rights of workers and to the demonising of a particular set of workers in this country and uphold the Australian ethos of the fair go for all.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-08-17,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I rise today to talk about the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill. It is a subject that I know a little bit about because I have worked in the building and construction industry for nearly 40 years. However, a definite split has developed over the years between the commercial construction industry on the one hand and the housing construction industry on the other. The glaring difference between these two construction environments is that you do not get the kind of criminal conduct on housing construction sites that you do on commercial construction sites. So what is the difference? Why do we not have the criminal behaviour, or anything like it, at home-building sites in the housing industry? The answer is: we do not see the CFMEU and its members on housing construction sites. We are having this debate about reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is because the ABCC is the only body capable of keeping the CFMEU in check on commercial building sites.


Those who have been listening carefully to my questions to various ministers in this place will know that I have been advocating for unemployed people to be able to work on terms and conditions which suit them. The unemployed are presently trapped in a workplace regulation prison. They cannot escape because there are so many patronising organisations that say, 'We have to lock you up in this workplace regulation prison for your own good, because you might be exploited if we let you out.' Yet, as I have mentioned in examples before, nobody stops young people from travelling to some of the most dangerous places on earth where they could be taken hostage or harmed. Yes, the department of foreign affairs issues travel warnings about some countries, but it ultimately respects the rights of people to go wherever they like in the world and take whatever risks they like. There is no travel prison regulating where people can travel. For some reason, we respect an Australian citizen's inalienable right to travel and expose themselves to potentially life-threatening risk, but if they want to go and work somewhere then they are captive to over 2,000 pages of workplace regulations. In some circumstances, these regulations have made it illegal for workers to negotiate terms and conditions which suit them. We hear the term 'paternalism' used in this place and throughout history, but the epitome of paternalism is the workplace regulation prison.


I challenge one person arguing in favour of workplace regulation to say that they have never taken the cheapest quote to have a job done. Whether it is something you need fixed at home, the servicing of your car or which hairdresser you go to, it is human nature to shop around or to change service providers because you have found a better deal. This is not considered criminal behaviour when you choose the cheapest quote, yet somehow when it comes to labour in other contexts there are regulations to say that the minimum price, for example, for working on a weekend is $40 an hour. But please spare a thought for the thousands of unemployed who are struggling on $5 an hour. These people are ready, willing and able to work for $20 an hour but it is against the law. The law says, 'No, cafe owners and others must pay $40 an hour'. But the cafe owners and others cannot afford $40 an hour, so they do not open their doors. Everyone loses: the unemployed person stays on the dole, the cafe owner cannot open and the customers cannot buy what they want. It is immoral to deny people the right to work and support their families. The contrary view on workplace regulation is this view that you simply must lock up the unemployed in this prison to protect themselves from exploitation. It is the very reason that these powerful organisations are a law unto themselves—but I digress.


Returning to the dire state of the commercial construction industry, what we are seeing here is leadership failure at every level. At the last count there were something like 80 different definitions of leadership. My favourite definition of leadership is: that which you will not tolerate. What is it that you will not tolerate? That determines what kind of a leader you are. What we are seeing in the commercial construction industry is a total failure of leadership. Let us look at some of them. The previous Labor government deliberately removed any notion that it was necessary to constrain criminal behaviour by certain unions. They were prepared to tolerate criminal behaviour—a failure. The police have failed to uphold the law in favour of so-called keeping the peace. They will tolerate criminal behaviour if it means keeping the peace—another failure of leadership. The courts have failed to uphold justice. In some cases those who have suffered unlawful behaviour wait years and years for justice. As we know, justice delayed is justice denied, and now we see in this bill the government's desire to increase penalties out of frustration at the relatively low penalties and, therefore, the low economic incentive to promote lawful behaviour. The judicial system: another failure of leadership.


When you have these growing power bases developing on construction sites, you get ridiculous situations such as those this bill seeks to rectify, including: contractors being forced to employ a non-working shop steward; situations where, if one worker is offered overtime, all workers have to be offered overtime, even if there is not enough work; and trade contractors being required to provide certain conditions to their workers even if they already have lawful arrangements with them. This bill would hope to address these and other allegations of standover tactics, intimidation and violence.


The Independent Contractors Association of Australia asserts in its submission to the Victorian CCCU inquiry that independent contractors working on the Westgate Bridge upgrade in 2009-10 were taunted regularly with 'It's a long way to fall, mate' because they were not members of the CFMEU. This is outrageous. Never in 40 years of working on housing construction sites have I heard someone saying to a fellow construction worker, 'It's a long way to fall, mate.' The ICA has posted footage of the violence and foul verbal abuse that workers were subjected to entering a worksite. The ICA went on to assert that, when the ABCC was in operation before 2010, the ABCC 'in large measure curtailed a good deal of the abuse and harassment in the Victorian construction industry, although'—sadly—'it did not eliminate it'.


The Greens talk at times about a 'social licence to operate'. In my opinion, the CFMEU does not even have a social licence to exist, let alone operate. Senator Lambie has called for the CFMEU to be deregulated. In his book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell talked about 'thin slicing'. Blink is the book and I recommend it. Weighing up situations in the blink of an eye. Looking for the shibboleths, the dead giveaways. For those who are not familiar with the Old Testament, 'shibboleth' is Hebrew for stream. Jephthah and Gilead fought Ephraimites and captured the Jordan crossing. To distinguish who was friend or foe, they had everyone say the word 'shibboleth'. If they could not pronounce is correctly, they knew they were the enemy. Hence 'shibboleth' became an identifier or a dead giveaway. It would be like hearing someone say, 'Where did I put my jandals?' Straightaway you would know they are a New Zealander. It is a shibboleth. Gladwell calls it 'thin slicing'. He says you can take a big salami and, no matter how thinly you slice that salami, everything you want to know about the whole salami is in that thin slice.


I note the CFMEU gave over $100,000 to the Greens before the last election. How morally bankrupt can you get when you oppose this legislation and you have received money from the CFMEU. The Greens, the party that pretends to be a party of ethics and morality, gladly takes money from the CFMEU. There's your 'blink' moment, your 'thin slice' of the Greens. The Greens shibboleth. Everything you want to know about them is right there.


By contrast, look at the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. I have never once heard allegations that they have engaged in criminal behaviour or provided funding to the Greens. The Shoppies have more in common with Family First than the Greens. The Independent Contractors Association says in the submission I mentioned earlier that the previous federal construction code changed the dynamic of reducing the violence, harassment and intimidation on construction sites. It did so because:


… any construction business that was involved in or permitted anti-competitive industrial relations activity (including violence and intimidation) found itself excluded from government work. This changed the commercial ‘reward’ system because the financial benefits from violence and intimidation were largely removed. Unfortunately this was undone with the closing down of the ABCC.


This bill creates the capacity for a new building code. I have heard about the huge cost blow-outs, enabled by the existing code. In my home state of South Australia the state Labor government is building a brand-new hospital, recently built a health and medical research institute, made a major expansion of the grandstands at Adelaide Oval and is, with the help of the Commonwealth, about to commence major and long-overdue roadworks. We have had to fight hard to get Commonwealth funding to support those projects and yet where will a significant percentage of that federal taxpayer money go? It will go into supporting the inefficiencies provided by the current building code. 


Look at the stadium construction project my Western Australian colleagues have happening in their capital and at the new footbridge they think will be better than Adelaide's new footbridge. Indeed, just on Thursday TheFinancial Reviewreported that 76 workers at the new children's hospital project in Perth were found, by the Federal Court, to have engaged in unlawful industrial action—on a children's hospital project! I see Senator Smith nodding. This happened in his home state. If taxpayers in the states that we senators here represent want value for state and federal taxpayer money we ought to demand that building codes support efficient civil construction projects—and that is not to mention private projects like the Olympic Dam expansion and other mining opportunities. When you have major inefficiencies, such as major work stoppages on questionable grounds, it is proper for the government to look at how we can ensure that those trying to create jobs and improve our economic situation can get on with the job to deliver projects on time and on budget. Let me quote from a report by Deloitte Access Economics, of last year, submitted to the Productivity Commission:


It is also worth highlighting that the rate of engineering construction cost increase has been notably higher for public sector projects … than private sector projects. Given the significant demand seen for resources investment, and the combination of a rising $A and high import component for resources projects … costs of imported materials … one might have thought this would be the other way around.


A loss of competitiveness in delivering infrastructure projects creates difficulties for the Australian economy …


I have heard allegations being made in this place about behaviour on construction sites and towards Fair Work Building and Construction officials which make one's hair curl. They are appalling allegations. I was willing to support the continuation of the powers needed by Fair Work Building and Construction during a previous session of the parliament when they were about to expire, because I believed there were legitimate concerns that needed investigation. For those same reasons and the factors I have outlined, whilst I am not generally in favour of expanding government power, the situation in the commercial construction industry has become so bad that we need to restore the ABCC. I support the bill.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2015-08-17,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:43):  Thank you very much for another very well informed and considered contribution to these matters, Senator Day. Those senators on the other side of the chamber would be well served if they paid more attention to contributions like Senator Day's. I commend him for that very powerful presentation.


It is also my pleasure to make a contribution this morning in support of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill, which should be fairly uncontroversial in the sense that all the bill is doing is making sure workers in the construction sector go about their jobs each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated or otherwise put upon by thugs within the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.


But before I proceed I just want to comment briefly on a contribution I heard from Senator Singh. If I heard her correctly she seems to take exception to the reverse onus of proof which is contained in this bill. I would just like to point out to Senator Singh and to other Labor and Greens senators who might make a contribution to this that such a provision is taken, pretty much cut and pasted I dare say, from the Fair Work Act that was passed by the former Labor government—cut and pasted from the Fair Work Act passed by the former Labor government! So, I think it is beholden on each and every speaker following on from me on the Labor side and on the Greens side to first and foremost answer these questions. What is their position? Is it consistent with the previous position? Has it changed from the previous position? And why might that be the case? So, that is a challenge for subsequent speakers.


Of course, the Labor Party cannot survive without the rivers of cash that flow to it from the union movement in this country. This point was demonstrated ably by Senator Day. And so it is that in the course of the debate on this legislation both here and in the other place, we have had the sorry sight of Labor members and senators getting to their feet and making excuses for bullying, intimidation and violent behaviour on construction and worksites across our country—indeed, even in my own state. I will come to that briefly.


It is really quite sad to see the once-great Labor Party reduced to such a state, but there we have it. I will come to some specific examples of the sort of conduct that Labor seeks to excuse in a brief moment. This legislation, however, goes to the heart of dealing with something that the Intergenerational report released earlier this year makes clear we must deal with, and that is improving productivity. We have heard, and we will no doubt continue to hear, histrionics from Labor senators about the provisions in this legislation. But desperately as they might wish otherwise, this is not a part of some grand conspiracy. This legislation is doing no more than what the coalition said we would do in the lead-up to the 2013 federal election.


This bill will finally re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong and independent watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and constructors and to improve productivity on building sites and construction projects whether onshore or offshore. This legislation will at long last reverse some of Labor's changes to the workplace relations laws which underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished by the Gillard government in 2012.


The bill prohibits unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination. It will put in place penalties that are high enough to provide an effective deterrent to breaches of these provisions. A number of effective remedies, including injunctions, will also be available to the ABCC and to persons affected by unlawful behaviour.


In passing this legislation the coalition government will finally be able to return some of the certainty and stability to the construction sector which went missing when Labor abolished the ABCC three years ago. Once again, we can banish some of the worst aspects of thuggery and lawlessness from construction sites across the nation and, most particularly, sites in Victoria and in my own state of Western Australia, where the corrosive culture within elements of the union movement have acted as a handbrake on economic activity for far too long.


Just to remind ourselves of the history of this issue: it was well known to insiders and to outsiders alike over many years that Australia's construction sector was home to the nation's most terrible examples of industrial thuggery and lawlessness. That was why in 2001 the Howard government's then workplace relations minister and now Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, established the Cole royal commission. It found that the standards of commercial industrial conduct exhibited in the building and construction industry varied significantly from those in the rest of the Australian economy—and not in a positive way.


Witness after witness testified to criminal conduct and unlawful and inappropriate conduct, including breaches of the relevant workplace relations and work health and safety legislation, and a blatant disregard for the law. When it came to my own state of Western Australia, the Cole royal commission found that:


… the rule of law has little or no currency in the building and construction industry in Western Australia.


'The rule of law has little or no currency.' Again, I quote:


The building and construction industry in Western Australia is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace.


Thus, in line with the recommendations that flowed from the Cole royal commission, the then Howard government moved in 2005 to set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a strong watchdog that would tackle lawlessness front-on. It was a strong, specialist regulator that enforced the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector.


Naturally then, as now, the move was opposed by the Australian Labor Party, which, at the end of the day, cares more about receiving its donations from the CFMEU than it does about the rule of law on Australia's construction sites. And over the three years between 2005 and 2012 when the Gillard government abolished the ABCC, what was the contribution of this body, which was detested, maligned and finally abolished by the Labor Party? According to independent research undertaken by Independent Economics in 2013, building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and fewer working days were lost through industrial action.


A rational and responsible political party would look at those things and think they were positives. They would speak from the evidence. Alas, though, we are talking about the Australian Labor Party, aided and supported by the Australian Greens, led at the time by Julia Gillard and staunchly supported by her at the time loyal minister for industrial relations, Mr Bill Shorten. Instead of exhibiting a bit of leadership, standing up to union leaders and telling them that, actually, the way that they had been behaving was not on and the ABCC was needed to keep the militants and lawbreakers within their ranks in check, what did Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten decide to do? They rolled over and did exactly what the CFMEU and other unions were demanding, and abolished the ABCC.


Of course, no-one would have been more delighted by this complete capitulation to union thuggery than the likes of Joe McDonald, the secretary of the CFMEU's WA branch. Without the ABCC in place, he has been free to resume his traditional disgraceful behaviour. Earlier this year Mr McDonald, who has a long history of bullying, intimidation and thuggery on Western Australian building sites, was fined $30,000 and banned from a Perth construction site for three years—once again for bullying. He was found to have threatened to have workers 'thrown off every building site in Perth' if they did not support strike action the CFMEU was encouraging. This is not an isolated case. Joe McDonald has repeated form in this area. Not long ago he and the CFMEU were fined almost $200,000 for their role in unlawful industrial action at the Citic Pacific Sino iron ore site in the Pilbara, in the far north of my home state. The federal court judgement in that case found:


Mr McDonald’s conduct involves a calculated and careless attitude to the law governing the employment of persons by employers. It was calculated to cause disruption to employers carrying out building and construction work on the site and it was careless in that McDonald was aware of the legal consequences of his actions and pursued them nonetheless.


Indeed, Mr McDonald was proud of his flagrant disregard for the law. On that occasion, when his right to be on site was challenged because he did not possess a right-of-entry permit, he blithely said:


I haven’t had one for seven years and that hasn’t—


expletive—


stopped me.


All told, Mr McDonald and the CFMEU have, between them, been penalised to the tune of more than $1 million over the past decade for illegal industrial actions. Joe McDonald's history of criminal thuggery is well known to Western Australians. Indeed, it became well-known nationally in 2007—so well known that the then Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, ordered his expulsion from the Australian Labor Party. Julia Gillard was right on board at the time, saying:


Kevin [Rudd] and I have made it clear that under our leadership of the Labor Party there will be zero tolerance for unlawful conduct, for thuggery, in Australian workplaces.


Yet she seemed to have had a change of heart because less than six years later Mr McDonald was readmitted to the ranks of the Australian Labor Party where, so far as I am aware, he remains as a member to this day. True or false: does Joe McDonald remain a member of the Australian Labor Party to this day? Perhaps future speakers from the Labor Party might like to clarify that point for me.


That is not to say that the CFMEU's mischief is limited to the confines of my home state of Western Australia. Indeed, in Victoria the problems have been even worse. Almost the moment that the former Labor government abolished the ABCC in 2012, we saw a significant upswing in disgraceful conduct from the CFMEU in Victoria. In September that year, the CFMEU sanctions brought Melbourne's CBD to a virtual standstill. If you wanted an insight into the mindset of the CFMEU's leadership, there could scarcely be a more powerful one than the sight of its leaders telling a crowd of its members:


There’s 11,000 coppers in the country or in Victoria and there’s 30,000 members of the CFMEU and greater among the other unions when we call on their support, so we’re up around the 50,000 mark, so bring it on, we’re ready to rumble.


That is what we are dealing with: basically, a union leader saying, 'Don't worry, comrades, we can take on the cops.' That might appeal to those who exist in a fantasyland where every day is a goodie versus baddie Hollywood style script—a battle between the poor downtrodden worker and moustache-twirling capitalists—but it simply does not reflect modern reality.


More than that, such behaviour does absolutely nothing to promote the certainty and stability that the construction sector requires. In case it needed pointing out, the companies that the CFMEU demonises are the ones that actually create jobs for its members and, importantly, for its members' families. The union itself does not create jobs; it seems to create only trouble. No stronger proof of the complete disconnect between the CFMEU and the interests of ordinary workers is needed than the fact that in 2012 workers on building sites published an open letter in the Herald Sun newspaper, not to the government but to the leadership of the union that supposedly represents their interests, begging them to stop the blockades and the violence and to allow workers on site so they could go to their jobs. It really is utterly perverse: workers having to beg their own union to let them do their job.


One wonders how it is that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, continues to tolerate this situation given the clearly criminal conduct undertaken by members of that union, including its senior figures like Mr McDonald, in Western Australia. Perhaps he values union donations more than the rule of law. Does Mr Shorten, the opposition leader, value union donations more than the rule of law? Perhaps future Labor senators speaking on this bill can clarify that point: does Mr Shorten, the opposition leader, value union donations more than the rule of law? Then again, perhaps we should not be surprised by his attitude, given the Leader of the Opposition's seeming attraction to militant union activity. That is no exaggeration. In 2013, in his capacity as Minister for Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten flew to Perth to address the conference of the Maritime Union of Australia. Standing in front of a banner boasting 150 years of militant struggle, Mr Shorten cheerfully told delegates: 'There's no place I'd rather be in Australia.' 'There's no place I'd rather be in Australia' than in front of a sign that talks about 140 years of militant struggle?


Of course, earlier this year we saw the MUA's ugly underbelly once again when, at its 2015 conference, a journalist from The Australian, Mr Andrew Burrell, was assaulted by an MUA member for the crime of attending the conference, which the MUA itself had invited him to attend. The MUA's WA secretary, Christy Cain, tried to distance his union from the attack. However, Mr Cain also sought to excuse the aggressor, subsequently identified as Mr Campbell Walton, on the ground he was suffering stress due to unemployment, except we later learned that was not true. Mr Walton is employed. He works as a stevedore in Perth and also owns his own earthworks business. Once again, we see a culture of thuggery, intimidation and violence from the union movement in Western Australia. Once again we have deafening silence on these issues from the union movement's backers here in the Senate. It is interesting to note, Senator Day, that during my contribution so far, not one Labor senator has come into this chamber, and the two Labor senators sitting in the chamber have not challenged what I have said—




Senator Bilyk:
  I have.




Senator SMITH:
  I have not heard a word, Senator Bilyk.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Ignore the interjection, Senator Smith, and I would encourage you not to invite the interjections.




Senator SMITH:
  When are the Labor Party going to say enough is enough and exile these rogue unions from its ranks? When are the Labor Party going to say enough is enough? Only when they are challenged by a coalition senator. What makes all this especially disappointing is that there are good unionists out there.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  This is a most important part of my contribution, Senator Bilyk. What makes all this especially disappointing is that there are good unionists in our country. There are those who genuinely try to provide a service to their members. I do not doubt that for a second, but their efforts are constantly overwhelmed by behaviour from their colleagues that is either aggressive or criminal or just downright stupid.


You do not have to take my word for it, and indeed I am sure you will not take my word for it. Not long ago, Mr Mark Olson, the WA state secretary of the Australian Nursing & Midwifery Federation, penned an opinion piece in which he called for unions to focus on their core business, which he believes might actually stop haemorrhaging membership numbers. He condemned the recent 'paltry gathering of a few hundred at the steps of Western Australia's Parliament House', which was supposed to represent a mass worker uprising but instead made him:


… wonder why this event was even happening, other than to try and help Labor … and perhaps boost the profiles of some union heavies in an election year.


He went on to say:


Workers are sick of self-serving union officials, helping out their buddies in the movement and in Labor, and not focusing on what's best for their members.


Indeed, Mr Olson is quite right, which is why workers are voting with their feet and why self-serving union figures like Mr Joe McDonald and Mr Christy Cain are resorting to increasingly desperate tactics to try and maintain their own relevance. This government is not about to let them do that, and it is certainly not going to do so at the expense of the national productivity growth.


Under the provisions of this legislation, the Australian Building and Construction Commission will be led by its commissioner, who will have the critical task of monitoring, promoting and enforcing appropriate standards of conduct by building industry participants and referring matters to other relevant agencies and bodies as required. The commissioner will also be responsible for investigating suspected contraventions of the law by building industry participants. They will also institute or intervene in proceedings in accordance with those laws and provide assistance and advice to building industry participants on their rights and obligations under designated building laws.


This government will make certain that the ABCC once re-established will be properly funded to ensure it can do its work and restore some certainty to the nation's construction sector, on which so much direct and indirect employment depends. This legislation enables the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to compel witnesses to attend an examination, or to produce documents, in circumstances where he or she reasonably believes that the person has information or documents relevant to an investigation into a suspected contravention of workplace relations laws. This is critical in making certain the re-established ABCC is able to carry out its investigations effectively. I have much more to say, but time is definitely against me.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:03):  I have to say I find it curious that the Prime Minister who said that Work Choices is 'dead, buried and cremated' seems to take a fairly backward step to the dark old days of Work Choices every time his government seeks to introduce a workplace relations bill to this parliament. While Labor struck a good balance between the rights of workers and the needs of employers in the Fair Work Act, every legislative move by this government has attempted to tip the balance unfairly back in favour of business.


We will be debating legislation this week which would tie up unions in so much red tape that they would be unable to effectively do their job—so much for a government that seeks to reduce red tape. Let us look at what has happened so far. So far we have seen legislation that will make it more difficult for union representatives to enter workplaces or talk to workers. We have seen attempts to reintroduce AWAs via the back door by weakening the better-off-overall test. We have seen the government dump Labor's 'clean start for cleaners' contracting principles, cutting the wages of cleaners who clean the buildings of government agencies, including this place. We have seen a highly centralised approach to bargaining across the Australian Public Service in an attempt to put strict caps on conditions and pay increases. We have seen the government try to cut paid parental leave for thousands of parents, mostly mothers, referring to many of them as 'double dippers' and 'rorters'.


In addition to the legislative attacks on unions and workers' rights and entitlements we have also seen $80 million of taxpayers' money already wasted on a political witch-hunt, the Productivity Commission being used as a proxy for the government's attack on penalty rates and the government flagging plans to legislate to wind back the protection of wages and conditions for Australian-crewed ships.


Work Choices is not 'dead, buried and cremated'; it is merely in hibernation. They have merely had it lying low. Let us not ever forget that Mr Abbott said Work Choices was 'good for wages; it was good for jobs; and it was good for workers'. Despite their rhetoric, we know that the coalition cannot walk away from Work Choices. The urge to reintroduce elements of Work Choices is Pavlovian. It is in their DNA. So it should not surprise any of us that the Abbott government will continue its attack on workers by dusting off its draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission, or ABCC.


The establishment of the ABCC, as Senator Smith said, followed the Cole royal commission. Senator Smith had a lot to say on the Cole royal commission, but there are a few things he did not mention, and I will come to those. The Cole royal commission was effectively a futile and very expensive exercise initiated by the current Prime Minister when he was workplace relations minister. It took 18 months and some $66 million to run the Cole royal commission but—and this is the bit Senator Smith did not say in his somewhat biased comments—after 18 months and $66 million of taxpayers' money, do you know how many criminal convictions the government managed to secure? Would anyone on that side like to hazard a guess? Let me tell you. None, not one, zilch, absolutely zero. So much for the supposed criminality, fraud and corruption in the building and construction industry.


It appears that Mr Abbott and those opposite have not learnt their lesson about the folly of using royal commissions to pursue ideological battles. A royal commission is meant to be an instrument of justice, not a political instrument. It is meant to shine a light in dark places and investigate matters that have been unable so far to be uncovered. But the Cole royal commission was the start of a pattern displayed by those opposite, a pattern of using royal commissions to pursue their ideological battles against political rivals.


Now we have got the long-running, expensive political witch-hunt in the form of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. For those in the gallery and those listening who may not be aware that the trade union royal commission is a political exercise, on this side we are particularly concerned with the royal commissioner's judgement in accepting an invitation to help raise funds for, guess who, the Liberal Party. The recent revelations about Mr Abbott's royal commission and his captain's pick of a royal commissioner, Mr Dyson Heydon, confirm this. The community have legitimate concerns about the affinity of the commissioner with Mr Abbott and the Liberal Party. In fact, over the weekend I do not know how many people spoke to me about it.


I believe the commissioner really needs to consider whether his ongoing role in the royal commission is tenable. The royal commission is and always has been a political exercise commenced by Mr Abbott to go after his political enemies. And who are his political enemies? The Labor Party and the trade union movement. I believe that only a lawyer with a predisposition to the Liberal Party would have taken on this blatantly political royal commission. You only have to look at the terms of reference to know the intention of the government and that it is a political witch-hunt.


In regard to the fundraising event that the commissioner was going to attend, no matter what the commissioner knew and when, it is clear from his own correspondence that his predisposition is to the Liberal side of politics. To top it all off, we have seen the New South Wales Liberal Party absolutely refusing to reveal when the commissioner was invited to speak at the Liberal Party fundraiser, an event that we all know has been addressed by prominent Liberals since it commenced in 2010. So I think there needs to be a bit of revisiting some of the commissioner's conduct, some of the commissioner's rulings and some of the commissioner's conclusions so far and the question needs to be asked: was any of it was influenced by the commissioner's political world view? The commissioner has consistently gone beyond what might constitute corruption to what is legitimate industrial behaviour dealt with according to the industrial laws in place in this country.


The tendency of those opposite to use royal commissions as a political instrument has many unfortunate consequences. One in particular is that they waste tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' moneys for absolutely no public benefit. Just look at the Cole royal commission. They are an exercise designed to produce a headline, to fight ideological battles and to embarrass the political rivals of those opposite. Another unfortunate consequence—and one I think is really sad—is that they have the potential to undermine the credibility of those royal commissions that actually are being used for public benefit and for justice and that are not merely a political exercise. With the royal commission currently being conducted into the serious issue of child sexual abuse—an issue which everybody in this place knows I am very passionate about—I consider this to be extremely unfortunate.


While those royal commissions that are used as an expensive political exercise by those opposite help to generate a headline, they are also a useful excuse for the coalition to introduce legislation aimed at gaining further power over their political rivals. And this was the other purpose of the Cole royal commission—to be the catalyst for establishing one of the most draconian bodies in Australia's history.


There is absolutely no justification for this bill we are debating today. There is already a watchdog for the building industry, and it is highly effective. The building industry watchdog that Labor put in place, Fair Work Building and Construction, has actually been outperforming the ABCC. Fair Work Building and Construction is undertaking more investigations, concluding more investigations and getting matters to court faster and recovering more money for workers in the industry. It has secured over $2 million in unpaid wages and entitlements for more than 1,500 workers. Under Fair Work, labour productivity is up, and industrial disputations have dropped dramatically compared to their levels under the Howard government.


The Abbott government use flawed modelling to back its argument that a body such as the ABCC needs to be reintroduced. The firm whose report they relied on, which is now called Independent Economics and was called Econtech, has a history of churning out report after report purporting to support the case for the government to attack the CFMEU. The claims in the report—particularly that the ABCC produced $6 billion in productivity savings—have been debunked by a range of people, including Justice Murray Wilcox QC, the Queensland Government's department of industrial relations, and academics from Griffith University. Justice Wilcox said the modelling is 'fundamentally flawed' and 'ought to be totally disregarded'. So basically you can disregard any comments that those on that side make in regard to those reports. But far be it from those opposite to engage in evidence-based policymaking, unless they are relying on discredited evidence which suits their predetermined agenda. For those opposite, this is personal and ideological. We know, as I have said, that Work Choices is in their DNA. We know that a coalition government will stop at nothing in attacking the rights and entitlements of workers. And we know that they will stop at nothing to attack those who stand in their way, particularly the trade union movement.


They do not like the fact that workers organise and bargain collectively, that they can negotiate on an even footing with big business—after all, big business are their financial and political backers, their mates. Those opposite, the Liberal-National coalition, are in their corner on workplace relations, just as they are on issues like multinational tax avoidance. Yet, those opposite have learned the hard way that Work Choices is politically toxic, so they try the boiled frog approach instead—introducing legislation bit by bit, aimed at cutting entitlements and attacking the collective power of the trade union movement. I think the Australian people are too smart to be fooled by that. They will not accept Work Choices 2.0 any more than they will accept the first version. Draconian bodies like the ABCC are part of the architecture of Work Choices and they should rightly be rejected.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-08-17,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:15):  At this stage, I would like to indicate that I will support the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and related bill, but I reserve my position on the third reading. There are matters that I believe need to be thoroughly negotiated with the government, and with the opposition, in my view, to involve key stakeholders. That includes not only industry groups that are concerned about the state of play on building sites in this country but also the unions. These bills propose measures that are controversial and contentious. On the one hand, unions have a vital role in Australia's workplace relations system and they must have the freedom and power to be able to do their jobs. That involves not just issues about terms and conditions for their employees—obviously fundamental—but also issues of workplace safety. 


Whilst I was a member of the South Australian parliament, I did propose, and it was rejected by a state Labor government, that we ought to have industrial manslaughter laws. I think we need to have tougher laws in place when it comes to workplace safety and there ought to be appropriate and strong penalties in respect of that. Insofar as unions require a right of entry for the purpose of safety issues, then I think that is quite fundamental and ought not to be derogated from.


On the other hand, concerns have been raised through the royal commission, and the Boral court case cannot be ignored—and I will refer to that shortly. I think it is appropriate, at this stage, to refer to the controversy around Royal Commissioner Dyson Heydon and the invitation to a Liberal Party fundraiser. Notwithstanding that not much money probably would have been raised at that fundraiser—presumably there can be auctions and other peripheral fundraising activities that usually occur at these things—it was an invitation about which we need more information from the royal commissioner. I think it is quite reasonable for the royal commissioner to provide a detailed and thorough explanation as to what he was aware of at the time he accepted the invitation, when he accepted the invitation and whether he was the commissioner or about to be appointed as commissioner for this royal commission. If he did so whilst he was royal commissioner and he assumed that the royal commission would be over by then and that there would not be a problem attending this fundraiser, and he was aware that it was a Liberal Party fundraiser, then, on an objective basis, I think that would show a significant error of judgement on the part of the royal commissioner. If so, he ought to be apologise for that. 


Notwithstanding what the member for Sturt has said, that this was a birthday gift for him the other day on his 48th birthday—and happy belated birthday to Christopher Pyne—as you know, Acting Deputy President—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  I would ask you to refer to the member for Sturt by his appropriate title, Senator Xenophon.




Senator XENOPHON:
  What title would that be?




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr!




Senator XENOPHON:
  Mr Pyne, sorry—the Hon. Mr Pyne. Thank you for defending the honour of the Hon. Christopher Pyne, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very grateful for being pulled up on that.




Senator COLBECK:
  A principle worth upholding.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is worth upholding. It was unambiguously a very serious issue that still needs to be ventilated because there are issues that some have raised about apprehended bias. I know there are different academics raising different views about this. I note that Julian Burnside—no friend of the coalition government—has defended the commissioner. At the very least, if the commissioner accepted this invitation, assuming that the royal commission would be over, then I think it shows an error of judgement on his part and an explanation is warranted.


In my view, if you are a royal commissioner on something as contentious as this, then for the rest of your life you should not even be thinking about attending any political event or any party fundraiser. It is interesting to note what some commentators have said, such as Michael Stutchbury—the editor of The Financial Review—yesterday on Insiders. He used to do music reviews for me when I was on the Editor many years ago at Adelaide university and is a fine music review writer. He raised issues about the nature of the interchange between the royal commissioner and the opposition leader. There are some reasonable commentators who are saying that that may have been seen to be somewhat too harsh and unnecessary in terms of the royal commissioner's intervention. 


The royal commission has gathered evidence, some of which I find quite compelling, about allegations of corruption and about allegations of bullying and harassment. These matters also relate to serious allegations of misuse of funds, boycotts, threats and even corruption. These allegations, if true, are clearly unacceptable. And they raise the question of whether our existing legislative framework is strong enough to properly address these issues. We know the commercial building sector is a very substantial employer. I want a strong and vibrant building and construction industry in this country in the commercial sector as well as in the home-building sector. I want the workers in that industry to go to a safe working environment where occupational health and safety are of paramount consideration. I also want them to be well paid for the work that they do. If there are impediments, then they need to be dealt with in a way that people's rights are considered.


I want to make it very clear that union representatives I have worked with in the past and whom I am working with on current issues have always been strongly against the kind of action that this legislation aims to address. I think it is an interesting paradox that there is no suggestion that Michael O'Connor, the head of the CFMEU—someone with whom I have worked very closely on issues involving free trade, 457 visas and putting Australian jobs first—has been involved in these sorts of activities. If find him to be a person of great integrity.


I have also worked recently with Aaron Cartledge, the state secretary of the CFMEU in South Australia, who has been subject to some allegations. However, one issue that I have worked with him very constructively on is substance abuse on building sites, particularly the use of ice. He has shown a lot of leadership in relation to that, because he does not tolerate it and the impact that it can have on a work force and the safety of not only those who are abusing the substance but also others on building sites. 


More recently, I have also worked with Mr Cartledge and met with a number of subcontractors in relation to the collapse of Tagara Builders—a complete mess that has left many people in the lurch. I have to give credit to Mr Cartledge for the work that he has done on that. We need a better approach to this in consultation with industry so that subbies—the subcontractors—who have been left in the lurch and face financial ruin have better forms of redress. I also wish to pay tribute to Senator Cameron's work in relation to this, and I hope that the inquiry will have a hearing in Adelaide sooner rather than later, because it would be incredibly welcome. We need a better approach to dealing with that.


Insofar as there are allegations of bullying, intimidation and corruption, they need to be dealt with. I do not subscribe to the view that unions are uniformly bad or that they have too much power. I do very strongly believe that they have responsibility and a duty of care to their members; in the environment that they work in, they do not cause unnecessary and needless disruption; and they should be subject to greater scrutiny in that regard.


I also believe that, as in any negotiation, there may be particular individuals or groups who act in their own interests who are rogue operators instead of acting in their members' broader interests. It is these people who I believe this legislation ought to be targeting. The question is: are the measures in these bills fair and proportionate to the issues that they are trying to address?


I have some concerns about limiting the control of a body such as the ABCC solely to the building and construction industry—and I do not want to verbal my friend and colleague Senator Madigan about what to do about corruption in other sectors where there are concerns in other workplaces. I acknowledge the argument, however, that this is where most of the concerns have arisen but I wonder whether this legislation should be so targeted at one sector. Surely, there are legitimate concerns in other sectors that could benefit from the oversight provisions in these bills. 


A few months ago I supported, unambiguously, the need to give the fair work building inspectorate the coercive powers to call in witnesses just as the ACCC, ASIC and other key regulators have. Without those powers, you will not get in my view some witnesses coming forward. There has been intimidation in respect of that from the evidence that I have heard.


I note that my crossbench colleagues Senators Madigan and Lambie have expressed concern about the breadth of this legislation. I look forward to exploring these matters in more detail during the committee stage, if the bill is passed at the second reading stage—as I hope it will—because I think these are legitimate issues that need to be vented.


I also think it is important to clarify that I believe that some changes need to be made in this area. What I am hoping to have clarified by the government through this process is why the new ABCC has to be established and why the additional powers should simply rest with the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate or Fair Work more broadly. I will also be seeking assurances from the government in relation to maintaining the right of entry and other matters for union representatives in relation to legitimate workplace and safety issues. I do not want to see reasonable union behaviour curtailed and I want unions and businesses to have access to the tools they need to combat the serious issues that have come to light. 


In relation to the issue of Boral, that is a matter still before the courts; however, I do not think it is improper to raise the fact that this has taken a long time for our legal system to deal with these issues. It raises issues about access to justice, which is a much broader issue in civil and all sorts of disputes in this country, but it has had a significant impact on one particular company. If the allegations are proven, then it raises issues as to whether there has been an abuse of power in that regard. I think that there must be a better way for the resolution of such disputes, and the difficulties in the gathering of evidence in this case raise issues about whether you need to have the sorts of mechanisms that have been raised in this legislation in some form to deal with disputes. 


At the end of the day—and I emphasise this—I want there to be a strong building and construction industry in this country. Building and construction can provide a real antidote to the job losses we are expecting in manufacturing. Having people working in a safe, working environment on good incomes is absolutely fundamental. My concern is that there needs to be some reform to help facilitate that. The issue is: to what extent do you go in this legislation? I think it is worth having this bill go into committee for further negotiations in respect of this.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2015-08-17,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (11:28):  I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. I also indicate that, in the event that the second reading is supported by honourable senators, I will be seeking to adjourn further debate—namely, the committee stage—for further discussions to take place.


Prior to the 2013 federal election, the coalition committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to restore the rule of law to a sector that is plagued by lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery. The government consulted widely seeking feedback on this important policy to identify issues which need to be addressed.


The construction industry is critical to a productive and prosperous Australia and is vital for jobs. It is the nation's third largest employer, with more than one million people employed by the 100,000-plus predominantly small and medium businesses. The sustainability and success of the construction sector are crucial to the Australian economy and to the Australian people.


The need to re-establish the ABCC is clear and evident. This industry, regrettably, stands apart from others in terms of its industrial unlawfulness. For far too long there has not been a meaningful consequence in the construction industry for doing the wrong thing. Who is then surprised that this has resulted in a culture where complying with the law is taken to be merely optional? Industrial laws and penalties in this industry are seen as no more serious than a parking ticket where the fine is paid, the cost charged to the client or union members and the offending conduct repeated again and again. Since 2005 the courts have imposed fines of over $6.1 million on CFMEU related unions and officials for proven breaches of the law, but even this has not been enough to deter those activities from continuing—remembering that these are breaches of laws that have passed through this chamber but are yet ignored. The Federal Court recently spoke of the CFMEU's 'outrageous disregard' for 'Australian industrial norms'. The court also cautioned that breaking the law should not be seen as 'nothing more than an affordable price of doing business'. Yet, because Labor and the Greens slashed the maximum penalties for industrial wrongdoing in this area by two-thirds, that has only promoted the CFMEU's business model of breaking the law.


Re-establishing the ABCC is about introducing a meaningful consequence for unlawful industrial conduct in the construction industry, whether by unions or employers. It is about bringing about a needed change in the culture. When there is an effective regulator enforcing laws with meaningful penalties, there will once again be a deterrent for breaking the law, and those who would previously have done the wrong thing, simply because they could, will think twice.


While the ABCC existed, the performance of the construction sector improved. The ABCC contributed to economic benefits for consumers, higher levels of productivity and fewer days lost to industrial action, and we saw an increase in respect for the rule of law across the country. This benefited all law-abiding workers, unions and employers and the taxpayer.


Labor abolished the ABCC in 2012 and replaced it with a significantly weakened regulator. Labor slashed its budget by $9 million each year, making it even more difficult for the independent regulator to do its job. What flowed from Labor abolishing the ABCC was entirely predictable. Almost immediately we saw the CFMEU shut down parts of the Melbourne CBD for days on end in defiance of Supreme Court orders. Who can forget seeing on the news footage of protesters yelling abuse and threatening workers trying to get to work—workers who were actually members of the CFMEU, by the way—or protesters attacking police horses? All this while, CFMEU officials actively promoted this ugliness.


I am amazed that certain Labor and Greens senators opposite sit in silence when faced with such conduct and do not immediately condemn such abhorrent and repeated unlawful and thuggish behaviour. If the Senate were faced with such unlawfulness in another part of society as has been seen in the construction industry, there would be an outcry, and rightly so, yet we have silence from those opposite in respect of the construction sector. There are currently 69 CFMEU representatives before the courts or the Fair Work Commission, and the courts have time and again commented that the CFMEU simply shows no contrition despite repeated penalties being imposed on it for its wrongdoing.


The current system is simply not effective. It was only on Friday last week that a Federal Court judge fined a CFMEU official for his contempt in ignoring the court's orders. The judge said:


The CFMEU has a significant history of non-compliance with the provisions of industrial legislation … I have remarked upon the fact that each of the individual respondents' conduct indicates that each—


with the exception of one individual—


simply did not care about complying with the entry provisions.


In that case, the court found that the CFMEU officials had threatened to go to war against the subcontractor if he did not employ a CFMEU official and put him on the payroll. This was last week in South Australia, not some historical reference to the former BLF. This was a decision of the Federal Court in Adelaide just three days ago.


It reminds me of an earlier case where a CFMEU official was found to have said to a contractor in Victoria:


Everything works on a bit for youse and a bit for us. Forget about the law, … right?


Another CFMEU official in Queensland was found to have told a group of contractors who had been prevented from working because of the union blockade:


You've all got a long time left in the industry, and we can influence your future jobs.


When one of the subcontractors asked, 'What are the consequences to my business if I bring my boys on site?' the union official replied:


You want to know what the consequences are? You would be committing industrial suicide.


I am sure senators from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland in particular would join me in condemning these examples of the disregard shown for the laws of this parliament in their home states.


Regrettably, these are not isolated incidents. They disclose a culture in the construction industry of wilful defiance. The list of examples continues. Only last week, there were allegations finally explored in the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption over the conduct of the CFMEU—listen to this—in siphoning off half of all employer EBA payments meant for a drug and alcohol facility straight into the CFMEU's own coffers.


In another example of the graft revealed in evidence, the CFMEU had skimmed $80,000 of a $100,000 donation by a construction company to a drug and alcohol facility. The CFMEU took an unauthorised 80 per cent donation for itself. Yet Labor and the Greens would say, 'Nothing to be seen here; move right along. We don't need to deal with this.' This conduct shows there are elements in the industry, particularly in the construction division of the CFMEU, that are more interested in exercising their power over overs and lining their own pockets. I would also say that I think employers have a huge responsibility here. But one suspects these payments are simply made to buy some industrial peace and whether the money gets used for drug and alcohol purposes is a secondary consideration.


I will move on to the point of safety. The act that established the former ABCC, the present bill and Labor's Fair Work Act have the same standard of safety in respect of stopping work over safety concerns. The proposed ABCC legislation uses the very same standard on safety that Labor put in its Fair Work Act and which currently applies in the construction industry. Incidentally, this is the exact same standard which was previously included in the former ABCC legislation. This bill does not contain any provisions that would prevent legitimate safety issues in the building industry from being raised and addressed by employees, unions or state and territory work, health and safety regulators. I also note that the bill retains the role of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian government's building and construction industry work, health and safety accreditation scheme. The misrepresentations over this important issue should be seen for the shameless tactic it is; namely, to deflect and distract from their unlawful industrial conduct.


On the issue of the compulsory powers, I have made it clear many times in this place that they are similar to powers that Labor gave to the FWBC. And Senator Xenophon outlined that the powers that the ACCC, ASIC and APRA have are very similar, other than there are a lot more safeguards under this legislation.


A very important aspect of this legislation is that it will remove the absurd and unprincipled restriction on the current regulator to which no other Commonwealth regulator is subject. This is in fact without precedent. This restriction prevents the regulator from commencing or continuing legal proceedings if private industrial parties reach a 'settlement' in their own interest. This put private interests above the public interests. When this absurd restriction was forced through this place by Labor and the Greens even the Law Council of Australia condemned such a restriction on a public regulator. This private settlement arrangement is subject to abuse. It is the equivalent of the Fair Work Ombudsman being unable to prosecute an employer guilty of underpaying a worker because the worker and employer reached a confidential settlement which could be for a nominal sum of $1. This also has the perverse outcome that, once wrongdoers achieve what they set out to achieve through unlawful means, they have an added incentive to coerce parties into confidential settlements so the public regulator cannot prosecute. 


We recently saw an example of how this absurd restriction played out in Queensland with respect to the nine-week strike at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital site. Just before the judge handed down his decision on wrongdoing over the nine-week stoppage, the CFMEU and ETU entered a confidential settlement with the builder; meaning the FWBC was unable to take any action in the courts in respect of the nine weeks that were lost on that important public project. At the end of the day, the regulator was legally prevented from enforcing the law and the taxpayer was left to foot the bill. If such a restriction on enforcing the law in the public interest were imposed on the police, on the Fair Work Ombudsman or the ACCC, there would be an outcry from those opposite—and rightly so. Yet, when the favour is done for the benefit of the construction unions, which are significant donors to Labor and the Greens, there is simply shameful silence from those opposite.


Any objective observer can recognise that there is a particular problem in this industry; yet the ABCC was regrettably abolished before it could achieve a lasting change in culture in the industry. I recall at one time the construction union was crying for 'one law for all' in arguing for the abolition of the only regulator that was keeping it in check. When one considers the appalling rap sheet of the CFMEU and its litany of regular and repeated industrial contraventions, it is clear that the CFMEU has no credibility when it calls for the application of 'one law for all'. It ignores Supreme Court injunctions. It ignores orders of the Fair Work Commission. It thumbs its nose at the rule of law, which it says everybody should abide by. The FWBC reports that it now has more cases before the courts than ever before. As I said a moment ago, there are currently 69 representatives before the courts. More than 90 per cent of FWBC cases before the courts involve allegations of wrongdoing by the CFMEU. Is anyone surprised that the ABCC, which was effectively started to hold the CFMEU to account for breaking the law is opposed by the CFMEU?


There has been the suggestion that, as a solution, we should deregister the CFMEU. I would make three points. Firstly, when the Builders Labourers Federation was deregistered in the 1980s it was a Labor government, with the support of a responsible opposition, that passed the legislation. The fact is that the current Labor opposition and the Greens are so beholden to the CFMEU that they would not support such a measure. Secondly, the deregistration of the BLF did not solve the problem of the culture in the industry. Here we are again dealing with the BLF by a different name and once again facing endemic industrial unlawfulness in the industry. Former BLF tactics have simply migrated to the CFMEU—which leads me to my third and key point.


The purpose of the ABCC is to introduce into the industry the concept of respect for the rule of law. The ABCC will work to introduce a culture in which any party, whether an employer, employee or union, accepts that they must comply with the laws set by this parliament. Indeed, I am reminded that just last week Baulderstone, a major construction company, was fined for having demoted a worker where the only reason that could be proffered was that this worker had resigned from the CFMEU. This sort of cooperation behind the scenes between big unions and big employers needs to be weeded out, and I am delighted that Baulderstone was publicly shamed by this case and fined for so doing. This is why we need the ABCC.


The bill will also provide for a building code. This applies to employers, and only employers can be sanctioned for breaches of it. The code will mean employers can no longer just ignore wrongdoing on their sites because they do not want to get involved. Employers will no longer be able to ignore inefficient practices and cost blowouts because they know they can just pass the cost on to their client, who is often the taxpayer. The building code will require strict compliance with employment, safety and migration laws. Why shouldn't the taxpayer expect that projects funded with tax dollars are run efficiently, lawfully and safely? The new code will have a new and streamlined enforcement mechanism to allow the ABCC to efficiently impose sanctions on employers who breach the code. The code will introduce a real commercial consequence on employers for doing the wrong thing or for allowing laws to be broken on their sites.


There has been a concerted campaign of misinformation about the code—for example, the absurd suggestion that the code bans RDOs or time off over Christmas or Easter. Each of these claims is simply false. Why they are made beggars belief, but it indicates the paucity of argument against the proposal that is currently before the Senate. One only needs to ask: what are the true motivations for the misrepresentation and untruths that are propagated in opposition to the return of an effective regulator and an effective building code that will hold employers to account?


The problem of endemic industrial unlawfulness in this industry has been clearly established. No objective observer can argue that the construction industry is simply like any other; it has shown itself to stand apart from other industries. The current laws have proven not to be enough. What is proposed in this legislation is about changing culture so this industry becomes like every other—that is, one in which the law always applies rather than only when convenient. The Senate today has a clear choice before it: to either send a message to the construction industry that it must comply with the law like everyone else or turn a blind eye and endorse the construction industry's history of ignoring the laws of this parliament and engaging in intimidation and bullying.


The problems with this industry are obvious. The choice is clear. The consequences flowing from that choice will be evident soon enough. As this nation embarks upon its most ambitious infrastructure-funding project of over $50 billion, it is vital to ensure that the construction sector is brought to account to abide by the rule of law so that the $50 billion worth of money invested by the Australian taxpayer proves value for money and that these projects can come in on time and on budget. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:05):  I move:



That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.



In moving this motion I would like to highlight my anticipation of the Attorney-General providing the full costs associated with the engagement of Commissioner Heydon. Whilst we know overall—at least from the information available to date—that the costs have been exorbitant, we still do not have the full picture.


Indeed, today Senator Brandis could not even tell us if he had provided a personal sign-off for higher-than-standard rates with respect to Mr Stoljar. How he could not remember that he had signed off on such a thing is beyond me, but it fits into the overall context here of the political witch-hunt that has been involved with this royal commission.


There are two factors which we should be looking at in relation to the royal commission. Firstly, this cost issue and secondly, also, the issue of impartiality. This is where, despite what might be put to Commissioner Heydon by 4 o'clock today from the parties and others, I would raise three issues. These are three pretty critical issues. They are the three issues that relate to 'three strikes and you are out'.


Let's go back to the first strike. The first strike I observed at the time—and which Laura Tingle raised in one of her columns—was the intervention by Justice Heydon in which he suggested that the opposition leader 'might' be seen as an evasive witness. How inappropriate that conduct was! He managed to skip through on that, maybe simply because it was his first indiscretion. But let's look at the other indiscretions. 


The second one is—and I tire of this discussion as to whether an event was a fundraiser or not; frankly that is not the point. The point is: it was a Liberal Party function, regardless of whether any funds were made—although donations were sought—Tony Nutt, it was a Liberal Party function. The commissioner should have had the good sense at the outset to avoid that type of partiality, but he did not—until the media started asking questions—




Senator Conroy:
  Then the cover-up started.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  You are right, Senator Conroy. As we are now aware: the cover up started. But let's go to the third issue. Last week, when I first saw the suggestions about this event when I looked online at Latika Bourke's article, I found a link—a link that was taken down—a connection. I cannot recall—I am searching even now—whether it was the New South Wales Law Society or the Law Council of Australia. But, either way, the connections within the legal fraternity in New South Wales need to be carefully addressed. 


This is why I raised the question: what balance is there in all of this being held within Eight Selbourne Chambers. Who is next door to whom? Who is having discussions with whom? Who is involving themselves in party events? These are all serious questions—when this Abbott government engages in the type of witch-hunts that have been involved in this royal commission. 


I might have originally thought otherwise. I might have taken the same approach that Bill Shorten took, which was to present himself and leave himself open to question. Then I heard Commissioner Heydon's comments during his evidence. How could he suggest he might 'seem' a particular way or another? It was outrageous in terms of his behaviour as the commissioner. That was his first strike, and now we have had two more. 


But let me close with the contrast. I thought it was more recent than this but I did a little search today because I wanted to make a contrast with the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Abbott. The contrast I made was with something people might recall: a particular Seven Network interview of Mark Riley's. Did Mr Abbott, back in 2011, want to leave himself open to questions? No. He could not answer a single question for 24 seconds. This man who is now the Prime Minister looked ridiculous. One Liberal Party member thought he was going to hit Mark Riley. Make that comparison in your mind. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:10):  It is not surprising why the Labor Party opposition in this chamber are doing their damnedest to try and disguise the evidence of organised criminality in the union movement. 


Can I just very briefly name 10: organised crime; jihad terrorists; the CFMEU—we all know about that; the Comancheros being used as debt collectors—we all know about that; the construction company that pays Mr Shorten's election campaign director—we all know about that. We know about Mr Shorten cutting workers' conditions. We know about the CFMEU leaking details from Cbus members. We know about John Sekta's threats. We know about the police arrest of a former CFMEU official who gives evidence. We know about Bill Shorten's close friend Cesar Melhem and the Industry 2020 slush fund. We know about Cesar Melhem, Mr Shorten's very close friend, and the false invoices. And we know about the Boral construction sites in Melbourne where, it was claimed, the law was determined by the CFMEU. 


Why are the Labor Party opposite running the union line? Because they are controlled by the union movement. There is perhaps nothing wrong with that—if the union movement were in any way representative of the Australian people. But the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that only 17 per cent of employees were trade union members. I will repeat that: 17 per cent of Australia's workers choose to be members of the trade union movement. No wonder the Labor Party involved themselves in these arrangements when in government—to make sure that governments insist on workers being members of the trade union—because, even in the public sector, only 42 per cent of employees choose to be members of the union. 


But take that to the private sector: only 12 per cent of employees in the private sector choose to be members of the union. Yet the unions control the Australian Labor Party. 


We all know the statistics: half the current federal ALP members and senators have had paid positions in the trade union movement. As I said, if the trade union movement were at all representative of Australian workers, you might be able to accept that, and yet 17 per cent of Australian workers choose the ALP organisation which choose every member sitting opposite here and half the ALP frontbench of the Labor Party. Of the front bench of the ALP, 22 of 43 are former union officials. Of the 26 current members on the national executive, the chief organisational body of the party, 19 are former union officials.


I say again: if the union movement were representative of Australian workers you could almost think that that was relevant. But only 17 per cent of Australian workers choose to be in the union and, in the private sector, only 12 per cent choose to be in the union.


Suddenly and, strangely, there is silence from those opposite. This is the first time I have ever made a speech where I have not been subject to bullying interjections. But today the facts are out there. Of all workers in Australia only 17 per cent of them choose to join the union movement. And yet the union movement controls the opposition and controls the alternative government. No wonder the Labor Party come in here and want to shut down a royal commission, which has exposed the criminality of the union movement. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:15):  The reason why no-one would want to interrupt that diatribe is that it proves the point. It proves the very point that we want to make here today—that the so-called royal commission is simply a tool of the Liberal Party of Australia and the hatred they have for trade unionists and the trade union movement. Nobody could have made it more forcefully than Senator Macdonald in what we have just heard from him. Instead of trying to defend former Justice Heydon and the witch-hunt that he now sits over the top of, he runs another attack on the trade union movement and the decent people who represent workers in this country. But we are used to that and we will hear much more of it. 


The issue here is whether the royal commissioner, Dyson Heydon, is conflicted in terms of his capacity to preside impartially over this inquiry. What we have seen is a number of issues at that royal commission. The first one being the bias towards witnesses getting access to cross-examination and that not being allowed for union officials who are under attack by Dyson Heydon and the Liberal Party. One issue of bias is the very nature of how that royal commission is being undertaken. It is okay if you are a friend of the Liberal Party, you can get cross-examination, but if you are a union official then no cross-examination from your lawyers—




Senator Conroy:
  One special union official!




Senator CAMERON:
  That's right—one special union official. And we also have the proposition here that so-called Justice Heydon—I think he has long lost that title—can sit on, supposedly, an impartial basis and then make comment about the evidence of the Leader of the Opposition. Nothing could have been more political; nothing could have been more biased. Nothing could have been a more public demonstration of why this royal commissioner is unfit to preside over this royal commission.


And then we come to the doozy. We know that Dyson Heydon has got a long family pedigree of links to the Liberal Party, going back to Sir Robert Menzies. We know that. We know that he was appointed because he is a conservative judge and will do the bidding of the Liberal Party in the attacks on the trade union movement—




Senator Smith:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not think it helps Senator Cameron's argument to be pointing out the virtues of—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, but what is your point of order, Senator Smith?





Senator Smith:
  I do not think it helps Senator Cameron's case to be pointing out the virtues of Dyson Heydon—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am not sure there is anything to rule on there but, just in case there was, Senator Smith, I rule there is no point of order.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Smith, I hope you do better in your contribution than in your point of order. That being as it may, there is Dyson Heydon, with long links to the Liberal Party, being appointed on a multimillion-dollar retainer to actually preside over a witch-hunt against the trade union movement. That is all it is. There is no doubt that Dyson Heydon is not an appropriate officer to be presiding over this royal commission. He is quite clearly biased and he is quite clearly partisan. There is no argument about that.


The documentary trail clearly shows that, while he was the royal commissioner, he was prepared to address a Liberal Party fundraiser. He was prepared to abandon all evidence of any impartiality to go to a Liberal Party fundraiser and address his Liberal Party peers. There is no doubt about that. This is a man who has disqualified himself because of his actions. This is a man who has got no credibility to preside over any impartial judgement of any issues. And it makes it even worse that this is the Prime Minister's royal commission, set up to attack his political opponents, the trade union movement and promote the interests of the Liberal Party.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  Just listening to Senator Cameron's performance I could not help but reflect on Shakespeare, not that his performance had anything to do with Shakespeare. But I am reminded of that Shakespearean comedy Much Ado About Nothing. Those of us who are fans of Shakespeare will know that the comedy Much Ado About Nothing has a central theme that a great fuss is made of something which is insignificant. Except that is only partially true because what we have here are the agents of the Australian union movement in this parliament trying to create a smokescreen from the very revealing evidence of the interim findings that have been made by that royal commission.


Senator Cameron is trying to suggest that the royal commission is a tool for the Liberal Party. Far from being a tool for the Liberal Party, it is in fact, we would hope, a tool so that the ordinary, honest, hardworking workers of this country who happen to be members of the union movement can get a proper, accurate, clear insight to what it is that is actually happening inside their union movement.


I just want to reflect briefly on what the royal commission has identified so far. What is it that Labor is trying to hide from? What is it that the agents of the Australian union movement in this place on that side are trying to hide from? Would it be evidence—




Senator Conroy:
  Does that make you the agent of Optus?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator SMITH:
  You are far from Shakespearean, Senator Conroy. Would it be evidence that the New South Wales branch of the TWU, the Transport Workers Union, sent the ALP inflated sets of membership numbers between 2005 and 2013? Would that be it, Senator Conroy? Would it be that certain officials of the AWU, the NUW, the TWU, the CFMEU and the HSU have used their union's name and their union position to raise funds for their own benefit and the benefit of like-minded associates, even by compulsory levies on their employees in breach of duties owed to new members? Would it be that the evidence has been that the superannuation fund Sievers put the interests of the CFMEU above that of its own members? Would it be that? Or would it be that a building redundancy fund, the BERT, paid to fund illegal strike action and millions of dollars in CFMEU apprenticeship training? Would it be that? The list goes on and on.




Senator Abetz:
  Drug and alcohol rehabilitation.




Senator SMITH:
  They were stealing from drug and alcohol rehabilitation. I want to make an important point. The union movement contains within it the hardworking, decent members of Australia's community. What we are talking about here is the thuggery, intimidation and abuse of that authority by union members. There was a powerful opportunity today. The Labor Party, senators on that side of the chamber, could have come into this parliament and their efforts could have been talking about the importance of reform, the urgency of reform even. They could have taken their lead from the very effective op-ed in the Australian Financial Review today by former Prime Minister John Howard highlighting how in the past oppositions have lent their energies, their arm to important reform measures.




Senator Conroy:
  It is remarkable how you can discover—




Senator SMITH:
  Importantly, Senator Conroy, you might like to read or have read to you that op-ed piece in the Australian Financial Review. It would be very revealing about what you as the deputy leader of Labor in this place can do to support reform, reform that would help, not hinder, ordinary Australian workers. The challenge is yours. This is a smokescreen on your part.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:26):  I rise to take note of answers, particularly those of the Attorney-General today. I note in the time since I have been out in the chamber—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator Abetz:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. We have witnessed Senator Conroy's non-stop sledging throughout this whole debate. Even if he does not want to extend any courtesy to my side of the place, at least he might extend it to his own colleague, Senator O'Neill.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy has not been the only interjector in this session. I would ask all senators to do two things—that is, not to interrupt other senators speaking and to address their remarks through the chair.




Senator O'NEILL:
  I am always happy to be assisted by my fine colleague in the Senate, Senator Conroy. But on this occasion, in the time since question time concluded and my return to the chamber, I understand Shakespeare has been somewhat discussed. That is quite interesting because in preparing my remarks, I was thinking about one of the lessons that Shakespeare is often used to teach—that is, to consider the difference between and the similarities of appearance and reality. What we have seen here is a government making every possible effort to encourage Australians to look the other way while they hide the shame of the disgraceful internecine concoctions of relationship that are part of what is the Liberal Party at large in government.


There are a royal commissions and there are royal commissions. Australians know there is a very important royal commission that was started under Nicola Roxon's watch into institutional violence against children, a very important matter. Australians have received that royal commission with great interest and have participated in it. Compare and contrast that with this political exercise funded by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $80 million—at least that is what we think at the moment but it is probably going to end up being more given what has been revealed about the fees today—including the fee of $1.367 million for Michael Elliott, who is assisting. That is his pay for nine months to go out into this so-called royal commission—trying to convey the appearance of being a royal commission—and find as much as they can possibly can and then bring it into the House of Representatives and use that in political questioning and political statements here in this parliament. There are royal commissions and there are royal commissions. The one into institutional violence is absolutely a real one in the tradition that Australians have come to know and respect. The other one is revealing of a disgraceful Liberal Party, who will abuse any of the advantages they have from this high office to help themselves out.


What are the Liberal links that have been revealed? While we were in question time today, there was an article filed at 2.22 this afternoon by Heath Aston, who has put on record—and I know there were questions of Mr Abbott—the Rhodes Scholarship connection: a personal relationship between Mr Abbott and his hand-picked judge to lead the trade union royal commission dates back decades. This Liberal Party, nearly all of them men, is a perfect example of the boys club and the insider conversations—the 'you look after me and I'll look after you' mentality that is a signature of this government. We have a Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, whose assistance to the Rhodes Scholarship was given by now Commissioner Heydon. Mr Abbott chose and appointed Commissioner Heydon, just as he did Bronwyn Bishop—another captain's pick, and it is coming unstuck because it was done as a favour. While this deception continues, we still have the Attorney-General of Australia standing up trying to tell the Australian people that it was not a fundraiser. Just because they did not make very much money does not mean it was not a fundraiser. It was a pretty bad fundraiser, but it was still a fundraiser, and there may well have been donations.


The reality is that, even though they deny it was a fundraiser, the Australian people are on to them. It is not a royal commission; it is a witch-hunt and a political exercise funded by the taxpayer. If it was a fundraiser, it was a fundraiser with no less than a royal commissioner standing up to speak at it. If the commissioner overlooked it, that goes to his character and to failure in his office. Certainly the Liberal Party of New South Wales are a great shame. They continue to ignore, deny and cover up whatever they can with regard to this, but they are responsible for this terrible situation where we have a conflicted and biased commissioner who is now discredited and compromised. He should resign in the interests of the royal commission. (Time expired)

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2015-08-17,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:32):  I rise to take note of the response given to my question by the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I asked Senator Brandis why on earth he is contemplating silencing the community's ability to uphold the environmental laws through the courts, when his own government and ministers are prepared to ignore those laws. The Attorney made some very perplexing remarks over the weekend. As I understand it, the Attorney is in fact the first law officer of the nation. I would have thought it was his job to uphold the law. He seems now to have taken it upon himself to, instead, uphold the rights of the coal lobby and silence members of the Australian community who want our laws complied with. It is a very confusing stance taken by a man who otherwise prides himself on being a black-letter lawyer. I asked the Attorney why he was so eager to change the law to silence Australians and to promote the rights of the coal lobby ahead of the rights of the community to see their laws enforced. He, of course, did not really answer that question—it is called question time, not answer time, for a reason. I asked him when the government would start enforcing their own laws so that maybe the community would not have to do their job for them. Sadly, he did not actually respond to that question either, but what he did say was that that kind of public enforcement of our laws, our environmental laws in this particular case, was gaming the system.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  That is exactly what it is.




Senator WATERS:
  So public enforcement of the law is now gaming the system. Perhaps I am in a parallel universe here—




Senator Abetz:
  Hear, hear!




Senator WATERS:
  and I am not getting the link. I take those interjections from the charming Senator O'Sullivan and the equally charming Senator Abetz. I put to the Attorney-General: are you really the first Attorney who wants to see laws less enforced? Has there ever been an Attorney-General who has advocated for less enforcement of the law, rather than more? It is a very confusing situation for the Attorney and, indeed, for anyone trying to make sense of his position.


We know that this is the latest in a long line of attacks on dissenting voices against this government and against the environment as well. They have axed the funding for the Environmental Defenders Office. They have launched a witch-hunt going after the tax-deductible donations to environment groups. They have slashed funding to community conservation groups and, of course, they have passed a motion at their party conference to go after environmental boycotts against harmful products like palm oil. Now they have made it clear that they want coal to be above the law.


It was very interesting to hear Senator Brandis describe the laws as poorly drafted when in fact it was his government that drafted them. These are John Howard's environment laws. It worries me greatly when I see the Abbott government now wanting to weaken those already weak laws, which have presided over huge declines in species health. We have lost about 10 per cent of our mammals; in fact, 35 per cent of the world's mammalian extinctions are occurring here in Australia. We know that our environmental laws are already too weak, but now we have the Abbott government saying, 'No, they are not weak enough—we don't want anyone to enforce our law; we'd rather just let the coalminers write their own laws and steamroll ahead,' even though the minister forgot to consider a conservation advice not once but twice. This is the second time this error has been made, and it is the second time it has taken a community group to go to court and say, 'Minister, you forgot about this key consideration again. What are you doing?'


So I welcome the fact that a community group, the Mackay Conservation Group, took that challenge. The minister admitted that he had made a fatal flaw in his decision making, and yet now we see Senator Brandis wanting to further silence the Australian community. I hope that no-one will give him truck in that regard. (Time expired)

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:51):  Here we are, today, the Monday after the week that was—the week that broke the figurative Liberal Party camel's back—and what a spectacle it has been since then. What we have seen is a government that prioritises political strategy over equality amongst Australians.


In my short time in this place the issue that Canberrans have written most to me about is marriage equality. I am well aware that there are a range of views in the community about marriage equality; however, there is no escaping that the strong majority of Australians support this reform and want to see it dealt with as quickly as possible. I have received letters from advocates on both sides of the debate but the overwhelming majority have been in support of this change. I have said before that the community view has changed faster than our parliaments have been able to respond—and this is something we have seen over a number of years across all state and territory jurisdictions and indeed in the federal parliament.


So let's look back at how the week evolved. It started with a surprise announcement in the coalition party room last Tuesday, where Warren Entsch said he would launch a co-sponsored bill for introduction that would create marriage equality in Australia—a positive step, many would say. A six-hour party-room meeting was called and held, where the Leader of the Government in the House, Christopher Pyne, accused the Prime Minister of branch stacking the meeting to prevent a free vote from being supported. The Prime Minister's strategy against equality prevails; one-third of the coalition party room voted in favour of a free vote but, unfortunately, two-thirds voted to bind others against equality. Ministers and backbenchers then took up open warfare against each other in the media in the following days over the appropriateness of what had happened and also the debate over whether a referendum or a plebiscite should be held. This bickering continued over the weekend and continues into this week. It has been astonishing to see one minister on one TV channel openly arguing for one position and then turn the channel and see another minister rebuking and lecturing that minister with a different position being put forward.


Despite all this division, and through all this internal turbulence, sanity prevailed and the cross-party bill on marriage equality was introduced to the House this morning. It is sad to note, though, that this bill appears to have already met its fate on the floor of the House. So what we have seen is one full week of open warfare among coalition members. The coalition has taken its eye off the ball. The government has shown that it is more focused on itself and on preventing individuals within the cabinet or the wider party from getting their way than on what the general population, the majority of this country, are expecting from their elected representatives.


The PM, through this, has consistently shown a reluctance or a refusal to see the marriage equality debate progress in this country. We have all known for a long time Mr Abbott's personal views around marriage equality and his staunch opposition to it. His position is disappointing. However, the Prime Minister, like all of us here, has the right to hold an opinion. The problem is that the Prime Minister, the leader of the country, refuses to see past his own personal view to let the majority view of Australians prevail. Last week's coalition party-room meeting was an opportunity for the Prime Minister to show leadership and show that he was a leader for all Australians. By allowing the debate to be held, respectful of all members and senators views, he could have taken an inclusive approach instead of the divisive one that was allowed to leave the party room meeting that day.


The reason I speak on marriage equality so often—and I think it is one thing that can get lost as politicians argue, delay and seek to run interference—is that the marriage equality debate is all about people; it is about families that you and I know; it is about loved ones that we share meals with; it is about children who go to school with our children. I do read all the emails that come into my Parliament House account on any issue—I make sure that I do. One email that arrived on Thursday evening was titled 'Heartbroken Australian', and I would like to read a bit from Lukas's story; he shared it with a number of politicians in the parliament on Thursday night. He said:


I, like millions of other Australians, was on Tuesday eagerly awaiting the decision of the coalition party-room whether to finally and consciously settle the issue of same-sex marriage before parliament. I have been checking Twitter every few minutes, trying to cling onto hope and optimism that the leaders of our country would put aside their personal views to allow the majority of leaders in parliament to reach a consensus. And then my world came crashing down. I phoned my mother, who is an elderly lady from a non-English-speaking background. I did not think she was even aware of the same-sex marriage debate. But as soon as I said, 'The vote has not been successful,' she began to cry. Despite my parents' reservations about me coming out as gay 15 years ago, they have always loved and supported me and my partner. They have always wanted me to be happy. But being treated by the members of this parliament as a perceived threat cannot be easily borne.


I then had a look at Facebook and was immediately confronted with dozens of photos from a friend's wedding on the weekend. This was further heartbreaking and distressing. Seeing the couple's sheer joy and ability to declare their love and commitment in front of family, friends and the law was a profoundly beautiful expression for them but a reminder that I and my relationship are somehow innately not worthy. The groom and bride even made a point to approach my partner and apologise for the celebrant's inclusion of the words defining marriage as a union between a man and woman. However, I am well aware that this is a legal requirement imposed by our parliament. My partner and I are both highly educated and contributing members to Australian society. He is a doctor and I hold a master's degree. We go to work, pay our taxes, contribute to the economy, socialise with friends and enjoy good coffee. Never until this day had I felt like a second-class citizen and someone whom my country, Australia, does not want. I am left to wonder: where does that leave gay and lesbian fellow Australians?


The talk about a referendum and plebiscite cannot be seen as anything but a further attempt to delay any progress on this issue. Defining marriage as between a man and a woman was imposed by parliament without asking the people, and rightly needs to be changed by parliament. The issue has been settled in almost every western developed country. Indeed, Australia and Northern Ireland are, embarrassingly, the last English speaking countries that have not recognised same-sex marriage. I used to be in favour of a plebiscite, but now I am scared about the impact of another prolonged debate as I can only see it bringing out the worst in people. The accusations, suspicions, labels and taunts are often unbearable—even when not front and centre of speeches by our respected leaders. Yes, LGBTI identifying people are a minority in Australia, but this issue presents a momentous opportunity for 'Team Australia' to stand up and respect and recognise the rights and dignities of all Australians. Same-sex marriage—or just 'marriage' as it is now called in most western countries—will not fundamentally change anything for opposite sex couples but it will be a life-changing affirmation and expression of love for same-sex couples who call Australia home. We are your family, friends and colleagues, and I want to stand shoulder to shoulder as equals with my heterosexual friends. I still hold out hope that love for fellow people will prevail.


That was Lukas Sigut, who is a fellow Canberran. In a very personal and touching way, it really sums up just how hurtful some of the decisions that were taken last week were for everyday Australians. I thank Lukas for sharing it, because putting the person in front of the politics often helps to explain to others just how words and positions translate to people living in Australia—particularly on this issue—and how hurtful they can be.


The MPI today relates to a failure of leadership on marriage equality. No-one was asking the Prime Minister to change his views on marriage equality; nobody expected him to. But I think a lot of people around the country thought that the Prime Minister could, and should, have allowed, navigated and promoted a way for the debate to actually occur. It is funny how there are a whole lot of decisions that do not require plebiscites or referendums that occur in this place and how there are many decisions that have far-reaching impacts on people's lives, but, all of a sudden, we come to a crossroads. The polls are very clear: almost 70 per cent of Australians support ending discrimination for people in same-sex relationships.


The Prime Minister last week had an excellent opportunity to stand up and show that he governs for all Australians, even if he does not agree and does not have to personally vote in a way that would end discrimination against same-sex couples. He failed to meet that test. I think that sums up, really, the Prime Minister and the government we have—they are out of touch, are arrogant and will do anything to stop losing a debate they do not want to lose.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-08-17,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:01):  I also rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I notice that the focus of the MPI is on leadership. I think it is important to understand what good leadership is about. At its heart, good leadership is about integrity. One of the things that I think this Prime Minister has demonstrated in this issue is that he has maintained the integrity of the position he took to the Australian people prior to the last election. In fact, he came out and made a very specific statement prior to the last election that, were this issue to be raised during the life of this parliament, he would bring it to the coalition party room to be dealt with in the normal manner. That is exactly what he has done. If there is one thing that you look for in a leader—I speak as someone who has served in the military for a couple of decades—it is integrity and consistency. That is what the Prime Minister has shown here.


The senator opposite was talking about things that are important and about the community asking us to deal with things that are important. I go to a number of opinion polls that have been conducted by various polling groups around the country. They clearly show that the issue of same-sex marriage is not a first-order issue for the vast majority of Australians. They are concerned to have a government that will deal with the economy, the creation of jobs and opportunity, and national security—whether that be securing our borders or dealing with the foreign fighter threat, dealing with the terrorist threat and countering violent extremism. They are concerned about things like the environment and having emissions targets in place that are effective and also will not cripple the economy by causing disincentives to people investing and employing—and, in fact, things that destroy jobs and shift manufacturing and other things that create emissions offshore in places where there will be much worse outcomes. In this Prime Minister I see leadership both in terms of this issue—in being consistent and maintaining faith with his promise to the Australian people—and also in terms of providing very clear direction and leadership and, most importantly, achieving outcomes with the things that the Australian people have consistently rated as the top priorities that they want the government to be focusing on.


The senator opposite complained that the Prime Minister had not been inclusive. The very fact that he had promised to take this issue to the coalition party room, maintained faith with that promise and included those people in what was a very lengthy but robust and respectful debate indicates that he was prepared to be inclusive of all the people whom he had said, in this first step, he would engage with in that process. What is important here is that he listened to that—as any good leader should. He is often criticised for making decisions without adequate consultation. Now that he has put in place a process whereby he has consulted and listened to the members of the coalition party room—which is exactly what he promised he would do—he is now being criticised for listening and not taking decisions off his own bat. As a result of that listening, he has indicated that he will include not only the coalition party room but the broader Australian society.


Going down the path of having a plebiscite means that people will have their say. It is instructive and important, I think, to look at what a plebiscite means. If you go to the commentary that the Australian Parliamentary Education Office have on their website, they call it an 'advisory referendum' as an alternative name to a plebiscite because it does not change the Constitution. There have only been three previously. Importantly, the PEO identified that there are no specific rules around a plebiscite. In fact, in the act that the government puts in place, it will set the rules for the plebiscite. It is important that, when those rules are set, we do have a plebiscite that is compulsory and is also one that will be binding. It being compulsory is important because that means we will avoid the situation that occurred in Ireland, where we saw a massive investment of funding from an individual in America to target and influence an active group within the Irish society so that they became the majority of those who did turn out to vote, even though the actual turnout was only around half the society in Ireland. If we are going to get a true reflection of the views of the Australian people, then that does need to be a process that all Australians are involved with.


The binding side of it is also important. The Prime Minister indicated in a couple of the media interviews he has done recently that he would be looking for a process where the parliament would be bound by the outcome of that plebiscite. That is important, because this parliament has decided. There have been several votes on the issue of same-sex marriage, and they have been defeated. But those who are actively pursuing this have not accepted that and keep bringing back more proposals. If the people speak with a voice to say that they support it, it should be binding; it should go through. But if they speak with a voice that says it is not supported, then, equally, the parliament should listen, and that should be the end of the story. There should be no more bills coming through the parliament seeking to overturn a binding plebiscite that the people of Australia have put forward.


The leadership this Prime Minister has shown is consistent. It has kept faith with what he promised to the Australian people before the election, not only on this issue but, most importantly, on that list of issues that people have consistently identified in polling as being important to them, such as the economy. Growth of the Australian economy is equally as good as, if not better than, that in most developed countries at the moment. The rate of jobs growth in the last measured period is 10 times greater than it was for the same period under the previous government. Australia is generating more jobs and is well on track to achieving the one million jobs in five years that the Prime Minister promised prior to the last election. I will note that the one exception to that is my home state of South Australia, where we are in dire circumstances because of the consistent decisions in nearly 14 years of a Labor government that have destroyed the environment that gives employers and businesses confidence to invest and grow and employ.


The Prime Minister has met the commitments we made prior to the election to restore security to Australia's borders, despite the last government, which opened the borders, saw over 1,000 people drown, saw 50,000 people come here and, importantly, went from having no children in detention when it came to power to having over 1,900 in detention in July 2013. This government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has stopped the boats coming and, importantly, has also stopped people drowning and reduced the number of children in detention to under 120 on the last figures I saw. That is a significant outcome, delivered through the leadership of this Prime Minister from both a national security and a humanitarian perspective. People should never forget that he achieved, with his team and with the same departments and the same resources that were available to those opposite, an outcome they said could never be achieved.


In terms of national security, we saw $21 billion either deferred or taken completely out of the Defence budget; we saw no decisions taken to contract new shipbuilding. In fact, regarding the one decision that was taken—to buy a large ship—members opposite bought a second-hand ship from the UK. In the one decision that was taken to build vessels, they sent the contract for 12 smaller vessels to Spain. When industry came to the members opposite with an unsolicited proposal to build the future supply ships, they did nothing. And they now have the hide to say that they did not have to take a decision, because the shipyards were working at capacity under them. Well, they were working at capacity because of the leadership of the Howard government, which signed the contracts for the LHD and the AWD. And in the future they will be working because of the leadership and commitment of this government to bring forward future shipbuilding programs to give Australia and Australians a secure future.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-08-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:11):  The Prime Minister is stubbornly refusing to listen to the Australian people on this important issue of equality and ending discrimination. As a result, it is our friends and neighbours, our brothers and sisters, our colleagues at work—even the Prime Minister's own sister—who are suffering. Around Australia, there are loving couples who want to show their commitment to each other in front of their family, their friends and the law and to take part in our society's rituals and celebrations, but they are being denied that right because of who they love. Last week the Prime Minister had the chance to change that. Instead, we saw a six-hour meeting that achieved nothing other than dividing his own party room. What a show of leadership!


The opinion poll that came out today reinforced what we know: that over two-thirds of Australians recognise that a couple should be given the opportunity to marry, to declare their love for each other, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The Prime Minister is out of touch with this majority, and he is trying every trick in the book to delay the inevitable change. We will see marriage equality in Australia, and we will see it sooner rather than later. On marriage equality we are lagging behind our peers in the world who have recognised it: the UK, New Zealand, Ireland and, most recently, the United States. However, we have the Prime Minister wanting to drag us further behind the rest of the world. And every day that we delay, Australian couples are waiting for this discrimination to end. We have to act now.


In terms of leadership, we have so many options up in the air at the moment, from a referendum to plebiscites—after the election, at the election, before the election. Who knows the meaning of these plebiscites. A referendum is a ridiculous idea. A referendum would require a majority of states, a majority of people—

Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator Moore:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I think Senator Rice should be allowed to be heard in silence, as we have listened on this side to previous speaker, from the government.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
):  Thank you, Senator Moore. I remind senators on my right that other senators will be heard in silence.




Senator RICE:
  A referendum is unnecessary. We do not need a referendum to change the Constitution, which clearly states that it is in the power of this parliament to decide on marriage. A plebiscite will tell us what we already know—that the vast majority of Australians want marriage equality. But, if it comes to a plebiscite, we must not prolong the process. Some plebiscites can take years, which will give a microphone to the more homophobic elements of our society and take a really heavy toll on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians and their families. If we are going to have a plebiscite, it must be held as soon as possible, no later than at the coming federal election, and the wording has to be owned by the parliament. It must not have the opportunity to be left to another of the Prime Minister's disastrous captain's picks.


We have the opportunity to end discrimination and to legislate for marriage equality in this parliament. It is up to this parliament. We are in this place to represent Australian people. The easiest and most straightforward way is to allow the cross-party bill which is currently in the House of Representatives to be debated in the House of Representatives and for the members of the Liberal Party to be given a conscience vote, a free vote, so that they can be listening to their constituents and voting according to their conscience. We should be allowing legislation to be debated similarly in the Senate. Every day that the Prime Minister delays this is another day that the discrimination against LGBTIQ people, and their families, in Australia continues.



Last week I raised in question time the story of 62-year-old Gerard, who is despairing that he may never get the opportunity to marry his long-term male partner, the love of his life. But, symptomatic of this government, the Minister representing the Prime Minister completely ignored my question, just like this government is ignoring the Australian people. Today I received a message from Gerard. He thanked me, saying, 'It's typical of the parliament that you didn't get an answer, but you did persevere, and I am so grateful for this.' There are thousands of people just like Gerard around the country, and the Prime Minister is failing them. But, despite the best efforts of the Prime Minister, the Greens will continue to stand— (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:17):  I also rise to speak on the matter of public importance:


The Prime Minister's failure of leadership on marriage equality.


We have already heard in Senator Fawcett's contribution on this matter how difficult it was for him to support his Prime Minister on this matter, because he talked about a lot of things, but I did not hear marriage equality being one of the things that the Prime Minister has led on. We only have to look at Mr Abbott's own words to see that this motion is supported on the fact that there has been no leadership from the Prime Minister on marriage equality.


After last week's marathon six-hour joint party room meeting on marriage equality, the Prime Minister stood before the press and announced:


As a result of the discussion in the party room …


I've come to the view—I believe this is the party room view—that this is the last term in which the Coalition party room can be bound, although we will definitely maintain the current position for the life of this term.


Going into the next election, we will finalise another position. The disposition of the party room this evening is that our position going into the next election should be that, in a subsequent term of Parliament, this is a matter that should rightly be put to the Australian people.


What a lot of gobbledegook. That is the kind of failed leadership we have come to expect from Mr Abbott on this issue. Under Mr Abbott the government policy could currently be best described as 'something else at some time in the near future'. Mr Abbott's recent actions have once again shown that he is the biggest barrier to marriage equality in Australia. It seems that every day is Throwback Thursday for Mr Abbott, as he clings to an outdated policy driven by his own out-of-step ideology.


The community have made it clear that marriage equality is something that they want. We have seen again today polling that overwhelmingly supports marriage equality. That has not just been in 2015. The results that we see in the paper today go back to 2010. The support for marriage equality in the community is growing. It will continue to grow regardless of the tactics by the Prime Minister to delay a vote on marriage equality in the parliament. With young people aged 18 to 24, the support is at 88 per cent. As I understand it, even a majority of Mr Abbott's own front bench support a conscience vote on this issue.


Clearly, marriage equality is an issue that should be dealt with by the parliament. In fact, the High Court has made it clear that this is an issue for the Commonwealth parliament. However, if Mr Abbott is so adamant that he wants the people to vote on this issue then let them. Let the people vote, and let the people vote now. Mr Abbott's political ineptitude and dogmatic ideology have fractured his own party, with senior cabinet members duking it out on the airwaves to shape the government's future policy on marriage equality. And do you know why they are doing that? It is because they do not trust him, so they are out there trying to put their view first before Mr Abbott decides what it is for them.


We have heard repeated calls from the self-appointed leader in waiting, Mr Morrison, suggesting we need a referendum on the issue of marriage equality. That is nothing but a political ploy to delay the momentum for equality. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, conceded as much in this chamber. Senator Brandis agreed with Labor that the High Court has ruled that the Commonwealth parliament has the power to legislate for same-sex marriage when he said:


I can't imagine there being a referendum question on this issue because, as I indicated … on this issue, the Constitution is perfectly clear.


He said:


… the High Court has spoken unanimously, unambiguously and recently, and this is really the end of the matter.



A public vote on this issue would run the real risk of being a taxpayer funded campaign for discrimination. Tony Abbott has the ability to lead a respectful debate in the parliament, but he has chosen the path of division and delay. If the Prime Minister cannot step up, if he cannot be the leader to this nation on this issue, the very best— (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-08-17,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (16:22):  On this matter of public importance, I want to note up-front that this is a very personal and very heartfelt question for many people. I want to start by quoting someone else, someone who a few years ago said: 'On the issue of marriage, I think the reality is there is a cultural, religious and historical view around that which we have to respect. I do respect the fact that's how people view the institution.' That was a quote from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Penny Wong, in July 2010, defending her then position in favour of traditional marriage. I do not begrudge anyone the right to change their view, after consideration, and obviously Senator Wong did that in the intervening five-year period. But she had a different view five years ago, and I still have a view—I have not changed my view over that period—in support of keeping the current definition of marriage. I respect other views. I am not going to try and make any comment on the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, but I do note that, from senators opposite, sometimes I do not feel that respect coming through in their contributions in this chamber on this debate, including from some senators who have changed their views in very short spaces of time. There is almost this view that it is a moral issue, that you must be immoral if you hold a different view, that you must be cast out if you do not agree with their view, when only a few years ago they held the very same view as me. That to me seems anomalous and something that cannot be held up to right and proper scrutiny in this debate. 


I would also say that there are still Labor senators who support traditional marriage, and I speak to some of them sometimes. Sometimes they freely admit that they continue to support traditional marriage, except you would never hear them say that in this chamber.




Senator Bernardi:
  They're not allowed to speak.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Senator Bernardi is right. They are not allowed to speak. We hear from the other side that they do support, at the moment, a free vote, but where are the other speakers for this side of the debate from the Labor Party on this issue? I would suggest that they are silenced by the Labor Party; they are not allowed to have their voice.


When you look at the position the Labor Party adopted at their recent convention, they are not showing any clarity over what their view is on this issue, because their position at the moment is that the Labor Party will have a free vote until the next election and then, after the next election, their members will be bound to support their party's policy in favour of a change to the Marriage Act.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  How does that work?




Senator CANAVAN:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy Presedent, to Senator O'Sullivan: I do not know how it works, because they come in here and call on us to adopt a free-vote policy but their free-vote policy has a time limit on it and then they will adopt a binding vote after that. So I am not exactly sure where their criticism is coming from for our position of maintaining a party policy on this issue.


I noted that the first speaker on this MPI today was Senator Gallagher. I was not here for her contribution, unfortunately. But a few months ago she very succinctly summarised the dichotomous view here of the Labor Party. She was asked in a press conference a few months ago, 'Do you support a conscience vote in the Labor Party on this issue?' Senator Gallagher in response said, 'Well, I do. I do support a conscience vote.' Later on in the very same interview, she said, 'Myself—I do support a binding vote in the party.' Then she was asked the logical question after those two seemingly contradictory positions: 'Are you saying you support a binding vote or a conscience vote within the Labor Party?' Senator Gallagher said, 'Well, I support both.' I do not know. I am not getting any clarity from that position, but that is actually the Labor Party's position right now. Senator Gallagher was criticised quite strongly for it at the time, but that is what the Labor Party actually ended up adopting at their conference only a few months ago.


What the coalition adopted last week was to maintain our party position, which has been a position for some time, in support of a view that marriage is between a man and a woman, as it has been for centuries. That is how we believe it should be defined and remain defined. We do have different views in our respective political parties, the Liberal and National parties, and I have no problems with that whatsoever. It is a great thing. We should celebrate the fact that there are different views from time to time. But of course it is also the case that in our party it is the proper jurisdiction and power of the party room to establish the policy of the party room. There was a lengthy debate last week, where every member got to speak. This is an important issue, in my view. Everyone was allowed to make their contribution. At the end of it, the clear majority was in favour of maintaining our party policy position. I actually think that there should be great respect given to our Prime Minister because he gave that time of his—it was about six hours—to hear all of his party members' views and then respected the views that were in the party room and they were adopted as the party room's policy.


We have also said that there should be a people's vote after the next election on this issue. It is really important—it is such a significant issue—that we should be deliberative about this change. It is not something we should rush into. We hear from the other side that this is just delaying and it is taking too much time. Every culture known to man has had a position that marriage is between a man and a woman, for more than five centuries—and apparently taking five years to make a change to our Marriage Act is too long. I reject that view. I think the Marriage Act is very important and the definition of marriage is extremely important. I believe the nurturing of a child in a relationship between a married mother and father is the best outcome, the ideal outcome, for a child. Notwithstanding that there are other very, very good parents, the ideal outcome is to have the biological mother and father remain married and provide the care for that child. That is not something I believe from any religious or personal view; it is something I believe from a very extensive and clear-sighted look at the literature in this area. The technical literature in this area is very, very clear: the best outcome for a child's development is to be nurtured by a mother and a father who remain married. 


In my view, that is one of the key reasons why this institution has evolved. We come into this place sometimes and think we know what is best for humanity and the world, without due respect for the institutions that have evolved over time in our human culture to properly reflect the problems of humanity. This institution is something that has evolved over decades and centuries to form around the relationship of a man and a woman. I believe it has been formed for one very clear reason: while it is the right and proper institution for children to be raised today, it was the right and proper institution for children to be raised five centuries ago as well. That is why it has been adopted. We should be very careful before we tinker with an institution that has lasted the test of time. I believe it is right to allow the Australian people to make that choice after a lengthy and considered debate.

"Lazarus, Sen Glenn",Ind.,2015-08-17,"



Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:30):  Tony Abbott's approach to marriage equality is nothing short of embarrassing and out of step with the views of the Australian people. In fact, I am embarrassed by the way Tony Abbott is behaving and I think he should be sin-binned from parliament until the issue is resolved. Not only is he failing to show leadership; he is making a shameful mess of a very serious issue which needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency. The people of Australia are being affected and our international reputation is being further trashed as a result of the Abbott government's stupid actions. This is why I want same-sex marriage to be taken out of the government's hands and put to the Australian people in the form of a plebiscite, so the people can vote on this issue. While not everyone is in favour of a plebiscite, at least this process will ensure the people of Australia are directly involved in the resolution of this important matter.


Marriage inequality only does one thing: it fosters discrimination across all areas of our community and promotes discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Discrimination of any type is not acceptable. My sport of rugby league was the first national sporting code in Australia to embrace marriage equality. We in rugby league understand the importance of marriage equality. We understand that marriage is about love and not gender. We understand that marriage equality is about human rights. We understand that everyone deserves the right to marry, enjoy the benefits of marriage and experience true inclusiveness, which we know provides important social and cultural benefits. Together with the Greens and other crossbenchers, I am sponsoring a bill which will be introduced in the Senate in the near future to force the government to undertake a plebiscite at the next federal election. I want marriage equality to become reality in Australia, as do most Australians.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-08-17,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:32):  I would like to start by sharing with you the story of Sandra Yates and Lee Bransden from Devonport in my home region of north-west Tasmania. They first met about 30 years ago when Sandra volunteered to pick apples in an orchard that Lee managed. They love to go camping and they both love music, art, cooking and politics. They describe each other as soul mates. Recently, Sandra and Lee flew to New Zealand to get married at a ceremony in the Mitai Maori Village in Rotorua, an idyllic destination for an ordinary couple in love to make their vows and embark on married life you might think. But, sadly, the reason that Sandra and Lee had to go to New Zealand is that they are not being treated like an ordinary couple in this country. They would have loved to have sealed their union on home soil, but they cannot because it is not legal because Sandra and Lee are both women, and, quite frankly, they simply do not have the luxury of time to wait for the day when we in this place give them the freedom to choose the path that millions of other people take for granted. Lee suffers from an incurable lung disease and it is very possible that she has only months or even weeks to live. 


Lee and Sandra knew that time was short, but they also knew, without a doubt, that they must find a way to legally marry. Unfortunately, they also knew they would not be able to do it in this country, so they put out a call to the community for help through a crowdfunding campaign. The community response was incredible. In only two days, Sandra and Lee managed to raise more than $10,000 so they could fulfil Lee's dying wish to be joined together with Sandra in marriage. While this is a very special and touching story of the triumph of love over adversity, it is a story that simply did not need to happen and one that should not have happened. It should have not have happened to Lee and Sandra and it should not happen to any other couple. 


After they returned from New Zealand, Sandra and Lee have continued to be active campaigners for marriage equality. They continue to advocate for change so that other couples will not find themselves in the same situation. They have tried to reach out to their local members of parliament, asking us to meet with them to listen to their story and to ensure that we are guided by the principles of humanity, fairness and equality when we make any decisions. 


I met with Sandra and Lee prior to them heading off to New Zealand. They are very caring human beings who just want to have their relationship recognised by marriage while Lee is still with us. We laughed and joked about a number of things. Lee told me about her little dog and the struggles that she has with her condition, and they both talked about how the recognition of their relationship by marriage would mean the world to them and provide them with peace. I hope they have found some of that now, although I know that whatever the future holds for Lee, Sandra will continue with the battle to ensure other couples are able to have their marriage recognised legally in Australia.


Unfortunately, despite Sandra and Lee's public plea, their local member of parliament, Mr Brett Whiteley, still has not got in touch. He has not reached out to learn more about their story. He has not made any attempt to understand what they have gone through and to consider how many others in his community might also be suffering from this discriminatory legal framework. Through the local newspaper, he said that they could pick up the phone and call him. Well, why couldn't he do what I did and reach out to them, and at least offer to meet with them and hear from them what this discrimination means to them and to others in our community? Mr Whiteley said that the push for marriage equality 'fails in, my view, to carry the goodwill of the community'. He is not alone.


Many on the conservative side of politics continue to assert that they know that Australians do not want marriage equality. But the facts do not support this assertion. In fact, polling shows that almost three-quarters of Australians are supporters, and the momentum is building. There is nothing that Mr Whiteley or anyone else can do to hold off the push for the removal of this discrimination, not in Australia or around the world.


In June, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that same-sex couples can marry anywhere in the country. This progressive milestone comes on the back of another historic outcome in Ireland. Ireland is a deeply religious nation not known for its progressive values and actions, but last month it became the first country to put the issue of marriage equality to the people through a referendum. There was a great turnout for the vote. It even saw Irish expats filing onto planes to head home to have their voices heard. The result of the vote was a decisive 62 per cent to 38 per cent in favour of marriage equality. If the vote in Ireland and the ruling in the United States have taught us anything, it is how far the rest of the world has moved and how far Australia is lagging behind.


These milestones come on the back of legalisation of same-sex marriage in many countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Brazil and Sweden. And do you know what the outcome of the legal change has been in these countries? Do you know what has happened in the places that have decided to legalise marriage equality? Well, I will tell you. People who loved each other got married. That's it. Full stop. Other couples still got married, and their marriages were still just as special. And the sun continued to shine and the world continued to turn—even in conservative countries.


We need to understand that this isn't just about the right of two individuals to have their love recognised under the law; it is about the value we place on these relationships. It is undeniable that our legal framework has a direct flow-on effect on broader social attitudes. Until marriage equality is enshrined in Australian law, we will continue to send a state sanctioned message to couples like Sandra and Lee that their love is somehow less valid, less real or less important. And, in doing so, we tell the children who have two parents of the same gender that their family is somehow less valid, less real or less important.


Opponents of equality use the pretence of protecting children as one of their major arguments to blocking marriage equality. I challenge them to look at a child who is being bullied, because his family is different, and tell him that they are protecting him. No, we are not protecting the children. We are maintaining and reinforcing discrimination that can only foster ignorance and homophobia.


The momentum is building to change this anachronistic policy. As a member of the Labor party, I am proud of the fact that previous parliaments changed 85 laws to remove discrimination against LGBTI Australians and same-sex couples. That is our legacy. But we still have the final hurdle ahead: to remove the final gender inequity for same-sex couples.


Close to three-quarters of Australians recognise that this needs to happen. When will our parliament catch up? How can it be that three-quarters of our community believe in marriage equality but two-thirds of government members want to lock their party into a regressive and discriminatory position? How can there be such a disconnect between the people of Australia and our elected representatives?


Prime Minister Tony Abbott previously said the problem is that the bills before the parliament have been from Labor or the Greens. He said that any bill must be co-sponsored by all parties. But last week, when a co-sponsored bill was due to hit the parliament, he did an about-face and manoeuvred to ensure that supporters within his party could not vote with their conscience on the issue.


The Liberals did not spend six hours deliberating on their savage cuts to health, education and welfare; however, this is the amount of time they spent on deciding to entrench discrimination against same-sex couples. For a party that regularly brags that their members are not bound to vote in any particular way, this should not pose a problem. So why does it?


Australia's lack of action on marriage equality is an international embarrassment, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott's suggestion of a referendum would be an outrageous waste of money when we know that public support for change is overwhelming. Prime Minister Abbott has nothing to gain from this belligerent stonewalling, and it will only reinforce people's perception of him as a dinosaur. He is not going to hold off Australia's eventual move to marriage equality. The momentum is growing. Every day in the different states and territories, we see the momentum for change. It is time that the people in this place started acting on the will of the people across this country. It is time for the Prime Minister to step aside and let his government members do exactly that.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-08-17,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:41):  I have to say I am a little embarrassed. I am embarrassed about the quality of debate that I have been able to listen to in this chamber. Whilst I understand that this is a very sensitive topic, I think it is incumbent upon us to be straightforward, honest and open about and accountable for the comments that we make.


I have to comment briefly on Senator Lazarus's contribution. In rugby league parlance, Senator Lazarus said he wanted the Prime Minister sin-binned for the grievous crime of putting in place a process that would deliver the same outcome that Senator Lazarus wants. He wants to sideline the Prime Minster, because he happens to agree with him. It was an extraordinary two-minute contribution. Perhaps he could come back and explain exactly what he is disagreeing with the Prime Minister about. 


Then we have Senator Urquhart who channelled all the regular nonsense about people who are opposed to same-sex marriage. She managed to mention dinosaurs, homophobia and bullying and how it is not going to have any impact on the rest of society and the world. She quoted what has happened internationally. Once again, Senator Urquhart, in order to defend her position, said, 'Look at what happened in Ireland where the Irish people got a vote and had a say.' That is exactly what the Prime Minister is proposing for the people of Australia. It is okay when the Irish do it; it is wrong when Australians do it.


Senator Urquhart then went on to say that nothing else changed when same-sex marriage was legalised in other jurisdictions. She should acquaint herself with the facts. We have seen people taken to court, because they have had a disagreement or a conscientious objection to being forced to participate in certain actions or practices. We have seen it impinge on religious freedoms in court cases and challenges to churches who were regularly promised would be exempt from that. We have seen further demands for the redefinition of marriage. If it is only about who you love, why should the number vary? These are the sorts of things that have been going on internationally, but they do not want to admit that on the other side. 


If you want to get back to the leadership issue of Mr Abbott in this space, he knows that the Australian people, just like this parliament, have a number of different views. We have got to respect those views, quite frankly, and we should be able to have that battle of ideas without rancour, abuse and the pejorative slurs that some, like Senator Urquhart, have resorted to.


Our party took quite clearly to the last election that, if we wanted to redefine marriage, we would put it to our party room. I know of no other Prime Minister who has listened to 99 people have their say in their party room over six hours to gauge the mood of the party room before making a determination. That determination was: we would stick to our policy and put it to the Australian people after the next election.


If, as we are told repeatedly, there is growing and building momentum and three-quarters of the people want this, what do those on the other side have to be afraid of? What are they worried about in putting it to the Australian people? We have Senator Lazarus, the Greens and others saying they are going to put in their own bill about having a plebiscite. What is the problem with us on this side wanting to have a plebiscite or a referendum or however you want to characterise it? What is wrong with going to the Australian people with it? Apparently, to the Labor Party, there is something wrong with that. The Labor Party are frightened of the people. That is the big problem. They are frightened of the people, and they do not know what they are doing. They have been sidetracked with this.


I would say to you that every single one of us in this place knows people who are passionately in favour of redefining marriage and those who are equally passionately opposed to redefining marriage. How are we expected to respond to the issue that parliament should deal with this matter when parliament in the last 10 years has had 16 different bills introduced seeking to redefine marriage? Three of them have been introduced this year. All of them either have failed by vote or failed by not being brought to a vote because the numbers were not there, or have just sat there on the Notice Paper. Sixteen times in the last 10 years, this parliament, in one way or another, has legislatively dealt with the proposal to redefine marriage. Parliament has decisively ruled on this, yet that is not enough for those who want to redefine marriage in an image that they seek to do it in.


So what is the only answer? If parliament renders its verdict again and again and again and it is not accepted, surely it is time to put it to the people. People who are as opposed to redefining marriage as me—and there are very few who are more opposed to it, I have to tell you—would have very little basis to object if the people said, under circumstances appropriate to a vote, 'We want to change marriage.' I might not like it, but ultimately I live in a democracy. Issues such as this do have significant and profound consequences and implications for other people's rights and for the types of freedoms we have in this country—and unforeseen consequences, might I add. I would have very little case to argue against it, particularly if my state of South Australia did it in concert with the majority of other Australian states.


I am not afraid of the people. I am happy to take the argument there. I know I will get called names by those on the other side. I will not respond in kind, but I will put the facts on the table. I will show again and again and again that what is being proposed by the other side is not just some innocuous change and not some campaign slogan called marriage equality. It is a significant departure from what has always been in our country, in our culture and in cultures for time immemorial. It has profound implications for how our society functions and the freedoms we enjoy— (Time expired)

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:48):  I rise to briefly contribute to the debate on the matter of public importance. It is clear that Mr Abbott is one of the worst prime ministers Australia has ever had. His leadership has failed on many issues, including same-sex marriage. Mr Abbott lacks the ability to unite and inspire ordinary Australians. If he were a leader who was sensitive to the needs and wishes of the Australian people, he would have supported my call and other crossbench senators' calls to hold a separate vote on same-sex marriage at the next election.


Let the people decide what our definition of marriage is, and let's get into talking about the out-of-control youth unemployment rates; organised criminals making big dollars selling ice to our kids; our pensioners struggling to pay their heating bills; our public hospitals, which are full, and Australians needlessly dying on record health waiting lists; homeless, desperate and suicidal veterans; and threats to prime agricultural land and hardworking farmers.


I strongly oppose any discrimination against LGBT people. LGBT Australians are very important and valued members of our community. I am sorry if my religious views have offended some LGBT people, but, just as non-Christian religious traditions are expected to be respected by all Australians, I would like my sacred Christian traditions respected as well.


A vote by the Australian people at the next election will quickly, fairly and legitimately settle the matter of same-sex marriage. If Mr Abbott understood leadership, he would realise that a vote by the people on this matter would also help to quickly heal the hurt that is created by this debate. The government talk about saving money and they talk about doing the heavy lifting. This is an opportunity to take it to the next election, save a lot of money, and once and for all get this done and get this voted on.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:50):  Children have rights, and their rights should be our primary concern. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all children have the right to know and be cared for by their parents. Despite all the love and care that can be given in a same-sex-parents household, children grieve when they do not have a mother and a father. That is why, I believe, we as legislators should not normalise a family structure that encourages children to be raised in anything less than the ideal family unit. Our laws should uphold the highest ideals.


I do recognise, however, that there are different views on this issue. This is a matter of conscience for all Australians, not just us as politicians. I therefore call on the government to agree to a plebiscite on this issue, to be held in conjunction with the next federal election.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Training) (16:53):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation activities remains at the forefront of international best practice.


Since 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (also known as ARPANSA) has been regulating Commonwealth entities undertaking activities involving radiation. This has included regulation of organisations such as CSIRO, ANSTO and the Department of Defence to undertake activities ranging from the operation of baggage x-ray machines at airports, to the operation of the OPAL research reactor at Lucas Heights.


Since the introduction of the legislation in 1998 there have been changes to international approaches to radiation and nuclear safety, as well as a number of reviews that have identified the desirability of minor changes to the regulatory scheme.


This has included reviews by the International Atomic Energy Agency and by the Australian National Audit Office. On the whole, the regulatory scheme was found to be appropriate, however changes were suggested to clarify the reach of the legislation, to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement powers of the regulator and to continue to ensure the legislation aligns with evolving international approaches.


Drawing on the recommendations of the various reviews and the experience of ARPANSA, this Bill makes changes to the legislation to provide greater clarity regarding the reach of the legislation, improve risk management of radiation activities undertaken by Commonwealth entities and provide greater capacity for ARPANSA to act in the event of an emergency or non-compliance with the legislation.


Specifically, the Bill makes amendments in four main areas.


Firstly, the amendments provide ARPANSA with greater powers to monitor compliance with the legislation and to take action in the event of non-compliance. For example, the amendments enable the CEO of ARPANSA to require a licence holder to produce information or documents, or to appear before the CEO to answer questions. Inspectors are also being empowered to issue improvement notices to require licence holders to address contraventions of the legislation, or likely contraventions, within certain timeframes.


These changes ensure that ARPANSA can access the information it needs to assess compliance with the legislation and can adopt a graduated and proportionate response to non-compliance, should it be identified. 


The amendments also support the CEO of ARPANSA to better respond in the event of an emergency, by enabling the CEO to issue directions to licence holders to minimise any risks to people and the environment in unforeseen circumstances. 


Importantly, all action taken by ARPANSA in response to non-compliance or to emergencies will continue to be reported quarterly and annually to the Parliament and will also be made publicly available.


Secondly, the amendments clarify the application of the legislation to contractors and those in arrangements with the Commonwealth or operating from facilities owned or controlled by Commonwealth entities. This provides greater regulatory certainty and ensures there is no gap in regulatory coverage between entities regulated by ARPANSA and those regulated by State and Territory authorities.


Thirdly, the proposed amendments improve the licensing regime and make it more efficient by:


enabling ARPANSA to issue time limited licences in circumstances where time limits may be more appropriate and ensures that unnecessary licenses do not exist into perpetuity– currently, no licenses expire;


providing for ARPANSA to regulate activities to maintain the integrity and safety of contaminated legacy sites as under current arrangements, ARPANSA does not have a clear legal basis to undertake this work; and


clarifying that ARPANSA may issue single licences for multiple activities to reduce regulatory burden and streamline arrangements. 


Finally, the Bill makes a number of minor technical and administrative amendments, such as updates to definitions and removal of outdated provisions to improve the operation of the legislation.


The proposed changes have no financial implications, and do not place any additional regulatory requirements on regulated entitles. The amendments reflect sound administrative practice, and will ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation remains best practice.


Debate adjourned.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (21:50):  I rise tonight to speak in celebration of Australia's netball team, the Australian Diamonds, on their renewed title of world champions. Sunday's gold medal match at Sydney's Allphones Arena was, without a doubt, a hard fought match and an intense clash, with the Diamonds conquering the New Zealand Silver Ferns 58 points to 55. The victory secured the Diamonds' third successive world championship title, their 11th overall, and has shown all Australians and, indeed, the world just how brightly the Australian Diamonds really do shine.


Led by coach Lisa Alexander and captain Laura Geitz, our Diamonds showed tenacity, strength and sheer brilliance to emerge victorious once again. I congratulate Caitlin Bassett, Erin Bell, Rebecca Bulley, Kimberlee Green, Paige Hadley, Renae Hallinan, Sharni Layton, Natalie Medhurst, Kimberley Revaillion, Caitlin Thwaites and Julie Corletto, who played her final match for Australia and retires on a great high.


The Netball World Cup is held every four years and is the premier international competition in netball. For the second time Sydney hosted the event, bringing together 16 nations in a tournament that showcased the world's best. The Netball World Cup was previously held in Sydney in 1991 and in my home town of Perth in 1967. The 2015 competition was truly global in nature, with qualifying teams from Barbados, England, Fiji, Jamaica, New Zealand, Malawi, South Africa, Samoa, Scotland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Wales and Zambia.


To support the engagement in netball and the World Cup, the Abbott government invested $3 million to assist Netball Australia to deliver the sport's ultimate event. The government also invested $3 million towards one of the two host venues, Netball Central, ensuring another legacy from this great event. A further $2 million was allocated to support high performance in netball through the Australian Institute of Sport. The government also provided additional funding of $300,000 to support the participation of qualified teams from Zambia, Uganda, Sri Lanka, Malawi and Samoa.


During the Netball World Cup we have been continuing to encourage school children to get involved in our new $100 million Sporting Schools program, which aims to boost participation in sport. Minister Sussan Ley has been driving Sporting Schools to get our nation's children more active by giving primary schools across the country grants to access to accredited coaches and programs, with the aim of creating healthy habits that last a lifetime.


And more than 700 women from 31 different sports have been funded to assist in reaching their leadership potential through the Women Leaders in Sport program in the past year. It supports women in all levels of the sporting industry, including coaches, administrators, officials and board directors.


I am also pleased to note that a number of world records were broken during the 2015 world cup. We had the world's biggest netball clinic, which was held during the cup and included more than 555 schoolchildren from 40 schools along with teachers and qualified coaches. There were record crowds at a number of games, culminating in the gold medal match with almost 16,849 in attendance at Allphones Arena. Nearly 100,000 people attended a match at Sydney Olympic Park over the 10 days of the competition, and·FanFEST—the ultimate activity hub for fans—saw 65,292 people throughout the tournament.


I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate former player, umpire and national coach Ms Joyce Brown for her ascension to 'legend' status in the Netball Australia Hall of Fame as announced at the Netball Legends Memories and Milestones Lunch. Joyce is one of the most respected and admired members of the netball family and was unanimously chosen for this honour by the board of Netball Australia.


Importantly, I also want to commend Netball Australia and the World Cup organising committee for all the hard work that made for such a successful and memorable event, with INF President Molly Rhone saying that 'the 2015 Netball World Cup in Sydney is the best one ever!'


Netball, as we know, has the highest participation rate of any women's sport in Australia, with 350,000 registered players and an estimated one million players nationwide. It is enjoyed by many more Australians who spend their evenings and Saturday mornings standing on sidelines around the country, cheering on friends and family. Netball is part of the sporting and social fabric of almost every community in Australia and is particularly popular in our country towns. It is truly a grassroots movement with approximately 80 per cent of all netball being played at local and state clubs.


Netball teaches young girls and women how to be assertive and to always play fair. It teaches them how to be gracious in success and in failure and to always be a team player. The sport helps young women understand their potential and to learn how to lead. Despite it being the leading participation sport for females in our country, netball has only recently become a large spectator sport. The Australian government recognises the contribution organisations like Netball Australia make in encouraging women and girls to actively participate in sport within their community. They are also pivotal for helping young women to understand their potential and for developing and promoting positive role models for future generations. So I want to pay particular tribute to Netball Australia for over half a century of teaching young girls these important life lessons.


Our Australian Diamonds are exceptional examples. They show what can be achieved through hard work and determination. They give girls the confidence to be successful in any arena they choose. I hope that in hosting this World Cup we are helping all women's sport claim the attention it so rightly deserves.


On the subject of women's sport: it has been an absolutely fantastic week for Australia. The men might not be lifting their weight and living up to expectations, but certainly our sporting women are bathing in green-and-gold glory. I also pay tribute to our Southern Stars. On Friday the Southern Stars cricket team decimated England by 161 runs to win the one-off women's test, edging closer to regaining the Ashes. The Southern Stars now lead the series by six points and are firming as favourites to beat the Brits in England for the first time in almost a decade and a half. The 161-run victory was more than double the entire number of runs the men's team scored in the final test a few days prior, and they did it with more than five hours of play to spare.


Of course there is also the women's basketball team, the Opals, who set the scene for a great weekend for women's sport when again they defeated the Kiwis on Saturday by a magnificent 20 points. They have now beaten the New Zealanders at every Oceania championship since 1974, which equates to 38 wins to zero. 


As our Prime Minister has stated, 'Women's sport matters.' I am so delighted, like all of us here in the Senate, that Australian sportswomen are finally on the front cover of our magazines and our national newspapers and are gaining the attention and the accolades they so richly and rightly deserve.
