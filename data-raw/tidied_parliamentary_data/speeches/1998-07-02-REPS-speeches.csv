That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposals for works in the Parliamentary Zone which were presented to the House on 22 and 25 June 1998, namely:
(a)	 introduction of parking restrictions at East Block carpark;
(b)	 introduction of parking restrictions at West Block western carpark access road;
(c)	 construction of an international flag display on the Lake Burley Griffin foreshore;
(d)	 construction of pedestrian and cycle access, Commonwealth Avenue Bridge and Kings Avenue Bridge approaches;
(e)	 demolition of old Parliament House Annex;
(f)	 refurbishment of old Parliament House Library external works; and
(g)	 revised proposal to undertake minor roadworks in front of old Parliament House.
This motion concerns a number of minor works in the Parliamentary Zone for which the approval of both houses is required under the terms of the Parliament Act 1974. Each of the proposals has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital 
 and External Territories, and the committee has determined that they need not inquire into the works. I commend the works to the House.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—I move:
That the bill be read a second time.
I shall not speak very long on the bill at this time because when I introduced it on Monday, 29 June I gave details of the bill and what it implied for the residents who live near Adelaide airport. It is not appropriate that I go through those details now, as they are available in that introductory speech.
I would just like to say at this time that the bill was introduced to give security to residents who live around Adelaide airport. Adelaide airport is built right in the middle of a residential area. There are residences built on the east side, the south side and the north side. These people are badly affected by the aircraft that take off during the day, but that is part of the penalty they pay for living near an airport. But, because they live near an airport, they do not forfeit their right to a proper night's sleep. The purpose of this bill is to put the existing administrative curfew into legislation.
The reason why this is important is that over time there has been a gradual erosion of that very curfew, and the people living around the airport are concerned that, unless the curfew is legislated, there will be an eating away of the curfew and that one day they will wake up to find there are large, heavy aircraft coming into the airport at 3 o'clock in the morning and none of them will be able to get any sleep. Should that happen, they would also find that they probably could not sell their houses to move to another area. To give them the security that they require, we are not changing the present situation, we are simply saying that this curfew, as it exists at present, with some exceptions which I referred to in my introductory speech, will be legislated.
If we go back to the early 1990s, we see there was very little breaking of the curfew. It was, in fact, the Labor government at that time that decided to break the curfew by bringing in an international passenger flight at 5.05 in the morning. In respect of the Labor Party, may I say that it did specify that jet had to be of the new generation of silent jets, it could not use reverse thrust greater than idle on landing and it was to come in over the sea. I took a survey following that flight coming in to see the effect on my residents. I must say that there was very little complaint about that one plane. Since then there have been other erosions of the curfew, and it is to stop further erosions that we wish to put it in legislation.
But I say to the Labor Party that what is disappointing about its reaction, now that we are getting towards an election, is the hypocrisy and the comments that its candidate has made on radio suggesting that all excursions into the curfew should be wound back when it was, in fact, the Labor Party which made those breaks in the curfew. That is all I wish to say at this moment. I understand that the opposition does have some amendments to the bill, and I will be speaking on those amendments.
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—There are certain perennial features of Australian politics that characterise history over 
 an extended period of time. One of them is that, as you approach an election, people bob up and start talking about railways. Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suddenly found that he could give his endorsement, if not any money, to a grand visionary rail project and, presumably, it will not be all that long before the other feature starts to surface; that is, the turn the rivers inland project.
But it would now seem that we have to add another to the list of the regular, immediate pre-election period announcements as a basis for getting an idea as to when an election is imminent. That is the Adelaide airport curfew legislation. We had the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) introduce this legislation—albeit in slightly different form—in 1995, shortly before an election was due. Not much has been heard of the issue since then, certainly not in this parliament, but lo and behold, just as we are in the immediate pre-election period and we are months away from an election, it has resurfaced; she has bobbed up again. No doubt we can look forward to the prospect of this matter actually reaching the Senate, if it passes this House, roughly around the year 2001, just in time for another election.
So we in the opposition are somewhat sceptical about the motives behind this bill. It really is a sign of the desperation of the member for Hindmarsh, who clearly has both the Labor candidate and fear about One Nation on her mind. It really is a sign of desperation that she suddenly decided that, after having let it sit there for three years, this now needs to be revived.
I think it is also worth pointing out that it is a sign of the hypocrisy of the government that it is prepared to have this bill, a private member's bill, brought on for debate and resolution in this chamber but not the bill which the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) wishes to move and debate on very similar issues, on issues associated with the management of aircraft noise at Sydney airport. He is not allowed to have his bill debated. I cannot see any real difference between the two pieces of legislation. They both seek to protect local residents in the immediate vicinity of major airports, yet one of them— 
 from a government member—is seen as being appropriate to be debated in this chamber and the other—that just happens to be moved by somebody who has actually resigned from the government because of its mishandling of the airport noise question with respect to Sydney airport—is deemed unsuitable for consideration by this parliament.
I turn to some of the details. I would indicate that the opposition supports the bill because essentially it entrenches the status quo. However, we do wish to move some amendments which would put the heat on the government to actually act on what are substantially greater problems with respect to Adelaide airport aircraft noise and to reaffirm the commitment that was made by the former minister, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is sitting at the table today, with respect to insulation for the worst noise affected homes in the immediate vicinity of Adelaide airport. It will be very interesting to see how the government actually responds to that proposal.
The bill that is before us, the  Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 , imposes a curfew on all aircraft over 34 tonnes between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Some smaller aircraft are excluded from operating during the curfew period if they do not meet certain noise criteria. There is a range of exempt categories which allow for things like aircraft in distress, search and rescue, medical emergencies and the like, all of which are perfectly reasonable exceptions. There is a shoulder period between 11 p.m. and midnight and between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., and the minister can make regulations with respect to this period to prescribe a maximum number of takeoffs and a maximum number of landings by international passenger aircraft during this period. The effect of this is that the curfew applies only to international passenger aircraft between midnight and 5 a.m. The minister can also make regulations to allow for up to eight movements per week during the curfew period by heavy freight aircraft, provided that there are no B727 movements and no more than four DC9 movements.
These issues are always difficult for governments because governments have to ensure 
 that airports provide maximum economic development for the hinterlands that they serve and, at the same time, minimum disruption, noise intrusion and environmental damage to the local communities in which they are situated. It is always a case of reaching a balance between those two, often conflicting, objectives. We must ensure that the local community is protected but at the same time that the city or the broader community served by the airport has its economic development maximised. If there is anywhere in mainland Australia that is in desperate need of greater economic development and more aircraft taking freight from it and bringing passengers and tourists to it, it is Adelaide. It is of great concern to the opposition that that balance is correct—that the protection for people in the immediate vicinity of the airport is maximised but not at the cost of substantial reductions in the opportunities for economic development and jobs in South Australia.
The bill effectively enshrines the existing arrangements which have been described by the term `administrative curfew' and it does allow for a significant expansion of international traffic during the shoulder period. It does nothing to ensure that the current international services operating into Adelaide during that period are not replaced by larger services with larger and louder aircraft. The current curfew does nothing, and this legislative curfew will do nothing, to assist those people who live in the immediate vicinity of the airport under the flight paths and who have substantial problems with existing noise, particularly in the early to mid evening when they are, for example, trying to get young children to sleep. They have to suffer the disruption caused by the normal operations of the airport. It will not help the occasional shiftworker, for example, who lives in the immediate vicinity of the airport and who has to sleep during the day. Nor will it help the elderly or a range of people who live near the airport and who are seriously affected by aircraft noise.
It does not deal with other noise problems associated with Adelaide airport which have been drawn to my attention on several occasions. I have had several meetings with 
 residents and representatives from groups of people who are affected by aircraft noise around Adelaide airport. A number of issues have been raised with me that are not addressed by this bill, such as the testing of jet engines on the ground, sometimes at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. It does not deal with the fact that Adelaide airport is currently being used for helicopter training purposes, which means that residents are affected by helicopters flying around, doing circuits and the like, which should not be occurring over residential areas.
So this bill is by no means a panacea for the problems of aircraft noise associated with Adelaide airport. It does entrench the status quo in legislation. It does raise some questions about the integrity of the sale process for the Adelaide airport, but I understand that the new owners have agreed to support the legislation. The key thing is that it does not really address the one critical issue that the Commonwealth government should be addressing, and that is the issue of insulation for people living in the immediate vicinity of the airport. As I have indicated, I will shortly be moving amendments that do relate to that proposal.
The opposition supports the legislation. We will watch with some interest to see how it goes. If it is successful in passing through this chamber we will watch with some interest what happens in the Senate. We suspect that it may well surface in the Senate at some time shortly prior to the federal election scheduled after the one that is due within the next six or seven months or so. The residents of Hindmarsh are entitled to be a little cynical about the motives of their member, who introduced this legislation just before the 1996 election and is reviving it just before the 1998, or perhaps early 1999, election.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—I am happy to second this motion today, not only because of the effect that it has on some of the residents in my own electorate of Adelaide, but also because I am keen to support the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who is indeed a very good member who stands up for her 
 electorate and is always conscious of the needs of her own constituents.
I was a little surprised to hear the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), embark on a story about hypocrisy and railways. That gives me the opportunity to briefly comment on some of those remarks. It is way out of line for Labor to talk about hypocrisy and railways in the same speech. Labor's mismanagement of Australian National over the years prior to the sale saw thousands of jobs go from that industry in South Australia. It was only when we came to government, and I pay tribute to previous Minister Sharp and current Minister Vaile for some of the reforms that have taken place in that area, that rail got back on track—no pun intended. The sale of Australian National went ahead with the support of the public transport union and other unions. It was a privilege to work with those people. The new owners have increased passenger services and freight haulage, and they are making a profit instead of a loss.
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to debate these issues with the honourable member for Adelaide at any time, but they are hardly relevant to the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill that is before the House.
—The honourable member for Adelaide will return to the bill, although I understand that the honourable member is making passing references to some passing references made by the honourable member for Melbourne in his speech. I hope that the honourable member for Adelaide will return very quickly to the bill.
—I shall do that. It was astute of you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to so keenly understand precisely what I was doing. I had not intended to mention any of these things if it had not been for the comments made by the previous speaker. In passing, I just say that the new owners of Australian National have increased passenger services and freight haulage. That is good for jobs in the rail industry because we can see them only increasing in the future. In reference to the bill, he quite wisely commented on the economic 
 need for Adelaide to be well connected with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world. I was pleased to hear him supporting this bill and recognising that the economic advantages must be in harmony with the needs of the local community. That is exactly what this bill is doing and I again compliment the member for Hindmarsh on bringing it before the House.
I would hope, as the last speaker mentioned, that this bill will progress rapidly to the Senate. As one who these days has to get legislation through this chamber and then to the Senate, I can only say that it is very much easier to get it through the House of Representatives. It gets bogged down in extraordinary ways in the Senate. Even when the opposition in this chamber is in absolute agreement—as in the legislation I hope to be through the Senate shortly—we can still have stumbling blocks because, of course, they do not have the gag up there. Even when you have the numbers, things can get bogged down. So I do not think we can blame the member for Hindmarsh—or, for that matter, the government—for the delays in what happens in the Senate sometimes.
To return to the detail of this bill—and the member for Hindmarsh has spoken extensively about the detail—the curfew will be enshrined in legislation as is currently available through the administrative arrangements. As the member for Hindmarsh has already pointed out, that gives security and predictability to those people who live near the airport and those who are in the flight path of planes coming into the Adelaide airport. Yesterday I telephoned Airservices to find out the number of complaints from people in my own electorate and what they were about. In the last three-month period—from 1 April to 30 June—there have been nine phone calls: two from North Adelaide, two from Mile End, three from Thebarton, one from Thorngate and one from Parkside. Interestingly enough, none of those, when I sought the detail of them, were actually about the curfew. That means that people who choose to live where they are living now—relying on those curfew arrangements—are happy with them. The people who have rung in have had concerns 
 when something unusual has happened—such as police helicopter flights—but of course we know that law and order is an issue, so I am sure that when they understood what that was about they were happy with that. Weather conditions sent a plane or two over Parkside and I think somebody from there rang in to find out why that was the case.
I again congratulate the member for Hindmarsh for understanding the needs of her constituents, and in fact my own, and bringing this bill before the House, so giving me the opportunity to speak briefly on it.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-07-02,"—Last night I spoke on the suspension of standing and sessional orders, which I was very pleased to support. I will not make much reference today to the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 , except to say that I support the bill. I would like to make a couple of passing comments and draw those to the attention of the House. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said absolutely nothing about a cap on the airport, and there is nothing more important than to have a cap in legislation. I would like the honourable member for Hindmarsh to know and to listen to some of the experiences that we have had in Sydney over a very long time. It is a very difficult issue, but an issue that can be resolved. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh is fair dinkum—as the saying goes—then I would urge her to include as an amendment or addendum to her bill that there be a cap.
How many planes is the honourable member for Hindmarsh prepared to accept over her residents—60 planes an hour, 70 planes an hour, 80 planes an hour? I might just say that only two days ago the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly)—a member of the government—said that Sydney airport should lift the cap and go from 80 movements an hour—wait for this—to 120 movements an hour over one million residents of Sydney. This is what a member of the government is saying. I am suggesting to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that, if she is fair dinkum, she should put forward an addendum to her bill and enshrine in legislation a cap on the airport.
The other thing that I want to draw to the attention of the House is the matter of the health of the residents. There has not been a definitive test conducted anywhere in Australia that can prove to the residents under the flight paths that the carcinogenic effects of the emissions from the aircraft—known colloquially as black rain—are nothing to worry about. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has heard me raise in this parliament the matter of the aircraft emissions. In fact, I took it upon myself to send her a copy of the 1997 report on the effects on health of residents under flight paths, especially the effects on children. I think it would have been a good thing if, in her comments to this House, the honourable member for Hindmarsh had made some reference to the concerns she has, as I have, for the health and wellbeing of people who live under the flight paths.
I want to raise one final item before I resume my seat, and this matter is in regard to insulation. I am very surprised that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said absolutely nothing about compensation for insulation for those who are so badly affected by aircraft notice that it affects not only their health but their marriage, the way that they work and their psychological wellbeing. While a curfew is a very good idea—and we obviously all have to support it, as we have supported it in Sydney—let me remind the member for Hindmarsh that the curfew is intended between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Is that what you are proposing?
—Yes.
—Like Sydney airport—between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.—and that is fine, but I would ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh whether she has taken any surveys as to how many people in her electorate are shiftworkers. I have done that survey in my electorate. I would like to mention to the honourable member for Hindmarsh how difficult it is for us to say that it is fine to have a curfew but no cap. There are people who finish work and get home at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning after having worked at night, and all of a sudden that is when the planes start—and the planes continue and continue. Those people cannot sleep because 
 they have just come home from work and then they have to go to work later that evening.
All in all, in summing up, I am concerned that there was no mention of a cap, I am concerned that there was no mention of the effects on the health of the residents and I am concerned that no mention was made of compensation for insulation. I heard the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), make reference to possible amendments that he wishes to put forward on behalf of the opposition. I will be glad to see the amendments before I support them or otherwise. I thank the House for giving me the time to mention these few matters. My  Sydney Airports Bill 1998  would have gone a long way to addressing some of the concerns of the member for Hindmarsh. I note that, every time I have raised this matter in this parliament, the member for Hindmarsh has voted against me bringing the bill forward.
—I call the member for Hindmarsh.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand that you are only allowed to speak once in a second reading debate.
—The member for Hindmarsh is the proposer of this bill; she moved the motion. She can close the debate and has a right of reply.",REPS,<title>ADELAIDE AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—in reply—In summing up the debate on the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 , I will first address the remarks of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). I invite you to Adelaide airport sometime. You will find that a cap on the movements during the daytime is not actually a problem. We are not Sydney airport; we do not have flights going over every two minutes. In fact, the owners of Adelaide airport, the government and, I believe, the residents would like to see an increase in the number of flights during the day to help the economic wellbeing of South Australia. I note that the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), did mention that we need more economic development in South Australia and, indeed, would welcome more 
 flights during the daytime to assist in the opening up of both the export of goods and the import of tourists into South Australia. I say to the member for Lowe: this is not an issue for Adelaide airport at this time.
The shadow minister was very unfair in suggesting this is somehow an election ploy, and, if I can catch the attention of the shadow minister at the table, I would like to actually address my remarks to him. I did not take over the electorate which includes the airport until the 1993 election.
—I am not attacking you for what happened before 1995.
—It was not actually until after the Labor Party allowed in the pre-curfew flights at 5.05 in the morning that aircraft noise became an issue. It became an issue because of a number of things: firstly, these early morning flights; secondly, some heavy freight aircraft were allowed in during the night; and, thirdly, there was a great increase in helicopter traffic—that has also been mentioned, and I will get to that later.
These concerns of the residents did build up, and, with that, came the recognition that there was a need for a curfew to be enshrined in legislation so that the current administrative curfew was not further eaten away. In response to that, I did bring up the possibility of enshrining the curfew in legislation. I remind the member that we were actually in opposition at that time. There was nothing I could do from opposition, but I did get the agreement of the then shadow ministry that we could go ahead. At that stage, I started looking at a curfew bill.
I found that, once you are in government, these things are not as easy as they first appear. From the minute we got into government in 1996, I have been working on this bill. If you went to my constituents, you would be aware of this; they have followed my progress on this matter in my newsletters. There were a number of things to be taken into consideration: firstly, how this was going to effect potential bidders on the airport as it was going to be up for lease; and, secondly, at first, the state government was very strongly opposed to a legislated curfew. It took a lot of meetings with the South Australian trans 
 port minister, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, who was very sympathetic but had to be convinced, as did the Premier, that this was not going to be detrimental to the economic development of South Australia.
There was a long period of negotiation with the state government. We then had the problem of the tenderers for Adelaide airport. It was finally agreed with the cabinet that they would give permission for a legislated curfew, but this had to be conveyed to all those people who were tendering for the airport so they could take it into account, to see if it affected their desire to tender or the amount for which they were prepared to tender.
Again, this was a long and involved process. It is not just that you snap your fingers and say, `Today, I will enact a curfew.' It takes negotiation, you have setbacks, you have people against it. Also, there were some business interests who felt that this was not an appropriate way to go, and I needed to consult with them. In fact, it was not until quite early this year that cabinet agreed to give approval for a legislated curfew, and, following that, we had to inform all the tenderers for Adelaide airport. That could not go ahead until they knew and accepted that that would be part of the tendering process.
I say to the honourable shadow minister that I have answered what were simply point scoring and extremely unfair exercises on his part. Getting this curfew into legislation is something that I have been working solidly on for the last two years. It is not something that I arrived at easily. It took an enormous amount of work and many meetings. I am very happy now to get it into this House.
The shadow minister also mentioned helicopter noise. I am pleased to tell him that I have been working very hard on the matter of helicopter noise, because it affects residents in my electorate who live near Brooklyn Park. That is where the helicopter base is and the residents hear them take off. We cannot move the helicopter base, but I have an agreement from both Lloyds Helicopters and Norris Helicopters that they will attempt to reach a height of 1,500 feet before they move laterally over the suburbs. That is the first concession. 
The second concession is that, when they go to the city or move to the north, they will go across Kooyonga golf course and not across the residences. Also, when they go out to the west and the south, they will go across the Glenelg sewerage treatment works, and again not across residences. The third concession I got was from Starforce. Obviously, if there is an emergency they go straight to it, and we would not want to change that in any way, but they will not do any practice runs over the residences of Brooklyn Park and Lockleys, as they are already the ones affected by the helicopters taking off. This is a concession from them that, when they do their practice runs, they will not be over the areas near the airport but that they will move away from the airport to do that.
I am pleased to tell the shadow minister at the table that I have indeed been dealing with helicopter flights, and since I have had those negotiations we have seen an enormous improvement. Over the last month there have been only two complaints whereas in the previous month there were something like 25 complaints, although I will not swear to that exact number.
The shadow minister has also raised the question of insulation. That is not as easy a subject as he would like to suggest. Although the Labor Party did not do it in the 13 years they were in government, suddenly, now that the election is coming up, the shadow minister has said that the next Labor government will insulate the houses within the 30 ANEF band. There is a bit of a problem with this. The 30 ANEF band is an average. Microphones are not set in the residences which show that some people have more noise than others. It is an average over an area. That means that some people who are affected more by the noise of aeroplanes do not qualify for the insulation while people who may be affected less do qualify. In one street you might find somebody on one side who receives insulation and another person directly opposite who does not. It is not an ideal solution.
Further, the present ANEF bands are not appropriate (a) to the extended runway and (b) to the different height of the extended 
 runway. I have discussed this with Airservices and they say that basically the current 30 ANEF band is absolutely useless for working out who would be noise affected. Taking these two matters into consideration, I am working with the state Minister for Transport and Urban Planning, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, the Hon. Mark Vaile, Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Airservices and the new owners of the airport to see what we can do for those people who are most directly affected by noise.
A third point about the insulation is that I have approached some of the people in the area and explained to them that the 30 ANEF band insulation comes as a total package. I believe that the shadow minister has said that he would copy what was done in Sydney. When I have put this to some of my residents who I think would qualify for the insulation—although I must say it is very hard to say whether they would or not—and told them they will have to hermetically seal their house, including sealing the air vents in the wall, under the door and around the windows, and put in air conditioning so there is no fresh air entering their house, they have been absolutely horrified. A couple of people have said to me, `If that is the choice, thanks, I will take the noise.'
What the shadow minister has come up with looks like a quick and easy solution. It is not an easy and quick solution. That does not mean that we forget those people who have this increased noise. It means that we try to look for an improved solution. We do not take the quick and easy `this sounds like a good electoral gimmick' solution. We need to look at the new 30 ANEF bands, with the extension of the runway and the different height of the runway, and we need to work harder on what we can do for those people.
As I said, this is something I am devoting an enormous amount of time to both with the state Minister for Transport and Urban Planning, the Hon. Diana Laidlaw, and the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. Mark Vaile. We hope to come up with a solution, but let's not take a bad solution. If we have to spend the $30 million which it costs to put in this insulation, for 
 heaven's sake, let's do it properly and not simply as an election gimmick.

"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998  is not opposed by the opposition. It gives effect to the farm business management scheme funding and, as I have said in a number of contributions in other debates surrounding components of the rural adjustment scheme, this is, in fact, re-funding a program which Labor previously had in place under different names and under different categories. It constitutes part of what I have constantly described as a rural hoax.
I think it is hellishly pertinent to some new information which came to light yesterday. Yesterday we saw published the media comment about the recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics farm survey on the financial performance of farms. Despite the fact that this survey result confirms what I have actually been saying for the last 18 months, I still have to say it was a sad piece of information that warrants an urgent response by the government.
I will quote from the Australian's summary, which is absolutely correct. It says:
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics' latest Farm Survey has found that farm profits have been slashed by 80 per cent under the Howard Government.
It says that that decline in farm profits has mostly hit farmers at the low end of the income scale. The 25 per cent of farmers in the small family farm category are the ones whose incomes have declined most in the last two years.
This bill like this, which provides for funding to assist farmers to run their farm businesses better and which provides for assistance with technology skills and with farm business skills, is not only needed in the general sense; in the economic climate that farmers now find themselves in, absolutely and completely directly because of the policies of the Howard-Fischer coalition govern 
 ment, this farm business skills assistance legislation becomes almost a talking point. They are not going to need better skills in running their farms; they are going to need to be money magicians. They are going to need to be Houdinis of the money bag to find some way in which to work through the situation they now find themselves in and this sorry tale.
If there are any members of the coalition opposite who doubt the efficacy of these figures, I would just refer them to graph 1, section 1 on page 2 of the ABARE report and invite them to look at the figures for farm business profit. The average farm business profit in 1995-96—that is, the last year under Labor—was $9,979. Last year it was $2,000. It has fallen by 80 per cent across the board. For many farms, it is a negative figure. In fact, the figures confirm that almost 70 per cent of Australian farms are now running at a loss or break-even at best.
The first question I want to ask is: why is this so? I think there are two reasons for this. First of all, the government has severely underestimated the impact of the El Nino effect on agriculture in Australia. The evidence from day one was that it was going to be more severe and was going to have a longer effect than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the cabinet ever anticipated. Secondly, the government has hopelessly underestimated the downturn in demand from Asia for product.
If there is any doubt about what the government actually thinks about this as an issue in the Australian economy, listen to this. I notice the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in the chamber. I very well remember the member for Murray on an ABC television program a few years ago with a National Party former member who was on the same program and who was asking this very question: why are farmers being treated so badly by the National Party? Her answer was: because you are in the B team. That is the fact of it. The National Party find themselves around the cabinet table in the B team and unable to win support.
There can be no doubt about this view. I mentioned to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) this 
 morning that I intended to quote him authoritatively. In the Australian Financial Review on 4 September 1997—about nine months ago—the Treasurer was asked:
What would be the effect on the Australian economy if there were to be a major downturn in demand for agricultural products either through the downturn in Asia or through the El Nino effect being worse than anticipated?
The Treasurer's answer was:
There is no need to get too pessimistic. Farm product is not a huge part of GDP.
And that is the fact of it. That is how the farm sector is regarded around that cabinet table. I have no doubt that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have been pleading the case, but they are faced with the position of being in the B team and having a Treasurer who sees the farm sector as not a huge part of GDP—so why would you worry? The reason you would worry is that there is a very direct impact on the families concerned.
It is not as if I have been alone in predicting that these problems would need to be faced up to. In the Australian Financial Review of 1 April 1998, there was a headline, `Rural exports drop 9 per cent in 6 months.' That ought to have been a pretty significant signal to the government that there was going to be a problem in the Australian economy, particularly in the rural sector, with a downturn in the demand for products from the agriculture sector.
The problem is due not only to the fact that the Liberals in the coalition do not see agriculture as significant in GDP or the National Party and their members who represent country areas as significant in this debate. The minister himself has created the problem. From day one they have done two things: first, they have gone back and continued the populist cant that Labor in the bush does not care about country people and has no programs that worked for country people and, second, they said that they were going to bring in a suite of programs that would make the difference. I could quote the speech given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when they introduced the AAA package that this 
 bill is part of. He talked about this major bundle of money that was there to provide a support base for farmers in need in the country. It was, if I remember correctly, a $517 package called AAA: Advancing Agriculture—Australia.
The very day after it was launched with great fanfare, the National Farmers Federation came out and said, `Hang on. We can find only $30 million of new money in the whole $517 million.' They had to use a microscope to find the $30 million because I went through and the best I could do was $17 million. Even the National Farmers Federation were in effect saying that $517 million worth of programs were all programs that Labor previously had in place. The only thing they have done is to divide them up, dissect them and bring them forward piece by piece as new legislation a la this bill today, call it something new and say, `Hey, look what we have done for you.'
The evidence supports that what I have been saying is absolutely correct—there has been a failure to properly understand the effect on agricultural output of El Nino and the downturn in Asia. Now, faced with farm profits slashed by 80 per cent in two years, they are wondering what is happening to them in rural Australia. In the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday there is an in-depth article on page 16 about two branch officials of the National Party in the minister's own electorate—Mr Roydhouse and Mr Gossage. The story tells how these fellows drove from one end of the electorate to the other helping the minister get re-elected. At last they were going to get rid of Labor; at last they were going to have a National Party primary industry minister; at last the bush was going to be cared about. Mr Gossage resigned from the National Party in disgust after going to see the minister about an issue he was concerned about. He says:
When I went to see Anderson to complain . . . he asked, ""Who else would you vote for?""
As this fellow said in yesterday's article:
By Christ, he wouldn't ask us that now.
That is the fact of it. He also says in that article: 
I never felt so let down, so disillusioned and angry. Today people in the bush are angrier than they were with Labor.
And there is only one reason for that: these people have been bitterly misled and bitterly disillusioned about the cant that has surrounded the nonsense about support for them. Just take one little example. In its first year in office, the government announced its great savings incentive. If you had so much in the bank, you were going to get a tax bonus and a saving incentive. I came in at the time and I said, `I must be missing the point. The Nationals are supposed to be representing farm people and country people. These people have the lowest incomes in Australia at the moment. Therefore, they won't have any savings. The tax figures show us they all run at a loss. How can they get any benefit?' And that, of course, is exactly the situation—and one stunt after another has been unfolded as nothing more than a rural hoax, badly exposed in this article yesterday about the decline in farm profits. With the FarmBis bill—the provision of assistance for farm management skills with the rural adjustment package—the budget allocations are going to have to get greater and greater because these mistakes have been so severe.
I cannot help but refer to an article that was published in, I think, the Financial Review. I cannot see the actual date on it to quote, but I am sure members of the National Party will know it well. It is under the heading `The National Party has lost its plot'. It is written by Tom Connors, whom they will know because he is a Canberra writer whose doctoral thesis was on the National Farmers Federation. He concludes:
The Country Party is unrecognisable from today's National Party. The leaders are no longer down in the paddock with the grassroots membership but have moved in with the economic rationalists. While Tim Fischer argues the case for free trade in global forums, his deputy, John Anderson, continues to ease the government out of farmers' affairs.
And that is what has been taking place. This decline in farm profit and this need for drastic assistance in farm business management skills from here on—and it is a hoax to say to these people, `You are going to be able to trade 
 your way out of this situation with better farm business management skills'—goes back to the core position of this government versus Labor's core position on primary industry issues. The minister was quoted in the Australian  on 1 January last year as saying:
Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries.
He was quoted further on as saying:
It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding.
There is no sane person in this parliament, in this whole building, who could conceive of a cabinet minister believing that Australia's future lies in getting better at exporting raw materials rather than value adding.
The only hope we have for lifting the incomes of these people and the only hope we have for putting jobs back in country towns is very firmly directed polices that push value adding, that push innovative agriculture to actually grow products that people want to buy and that produces products that are processed and value added and sophisticated in their marketing, et cetera. That a cabinet minister could actually breathe that tripe is beyond comprehension. Yet that is the statement of today's primary industry minister, and it has been raised many times in many forums and he has never once tried to walk away from it. I raised it on the Landline program and at least he came in and thumped the table and said, `I'm a value adder too.' Every policy decision that has been taken, every budget cut that has been made and every philosophical position taken with respect to farm issues has been directed in accordance with the original statement: raw materials; not value adding.
I might just draw one very public and understandable example. For the first year that we were in opposition, I was placed in our resources portfolio by Kim Beazley. Not long after we went into opposition, I conveyed to the minister, Mr Anderson, a letter which offered that, if he would keep the ceiling on woodchip exports in place, Labor would guarantee bipartisan support for the construction of a pulp mill anywhere in Australia. We 
 were saying, `Don't lift the ceiling on woodchip exports. That is just more raw materials. For heaven's sake, take the offer to put in place a pulp mill and do the value adding in Australia.' But that offer was never taken up. Instead, he lifted the ceiling on woodchips. We have been exporting more and more export woodchips, and we now have reached the point where the Burnie pulp mill is being closed. That is completely consistent with the philosophy stated in that article in the Australian back in January of last year.
I will be raising that point all through the election campaign we are moving into. It will be no surprise to anybody. We will be spelling out the alternative approach, which is a value adding approach, which is a `jobs in country towns' approach.
Given all that, a couple of little issues are also going to come up that people on farms are going to need every one of their business management skills to deal with. If this article, published in Wednesday's Australian entitled, `Diesel fuel sweetener for the bush' is in any way accurate—and, given the nature of the author and his links into the government, I am sure that this is the way the leak is unfolding—there will be a big win in the cut in diesel fuel price for farmers. It says that farmers are going to be zero rated for diesel fuel excise for on-farm use.
Fabulous! They already get the diesel fuel rebate. They are going to have a continuation of the existing arrangements, dressed up as a win. I do not think they are silly enough to fall for that. Then they will be told that diesel purchased by a transport business will be cheaper and, if diesel is a business input, it will be cheaper. That might mean that, if you are driving kids into town in the Toyota Hilux and it is a diesel one but it is off-farm use, your fuel bill may be a little bit cheaper—if you can count the farm as being in the transport business. We will wait to see what unfolds in the tax package about that one. The vast majority of country voters in country areas live in country towns. They are looking for cheaper fuel prices for ordinary cars.
—What about the truckies—running the business?
—There is no question that the transport industry will be thrilled. We will be able to say to the country people: let's take the example of country fuel prices—which of course you characters on the other side of the House campaigned mercilessly against Labor on—and, guess what, the gap between city and country fuel prices is actually wider now than it was in 1995. If you do not believe me, check it for yourself. After all that populist cant about country fuel prices, let us take a little example: in Mildura and Melbourne there is a 10c a litre difference. Cartage costs are 1c per litre. The other 9c has nothing to do with transport.
If anyone in the government is going to try to tell country people that reducing the cost of fuel to the transport industry will lead to very nice reductions in the cost of goods in country towns, you had better start fixing up petrol. It is very publicly known that 1c a litre is the cost of the transport. Even if the fuel cost is reduced to the transport industry by, say, 30 per cent, it will result in about a two-tenths of 1c per litre reduction in the transport cost. Get real if you think people are going to fall for this stuff, or fix up petrol if you want to sell the package.
Let us go back to the point that I started to make about the ordinary punter driving around in his Falcon or Commodore in country towns. This article in the Australian yesterday said:
City motorists will miss out on the fuel tax relief because there will be no big reductions to the excises on leaded and unleaded petrol.
Fabulous! The government will be running around telling country people, `The city motorists are not getting this,' but how long do you think it is going to be before the country punter suddenly says, `Hang on, I am not getting it either'? I should not be spelling out in advance how dopey this is, but you are leaving yourselves wide open.
The final point I want to make is that these people are going to need all of their farm business management skills with the application of GST to farming. Even though farmers will be paying GST on inputs to their farm operations as they do their business and then later claiming a rebate—and, presumably, 
 getting it all back—there is a little problem. If you are planting the average wheat crop and it is costing you in the order of $400,000 to put it in and you are having to pay 10 per cent on the way in—$40,000 worth of inputs—or even if you bring it right back to a small farm, of whatever kind, with $100,000 worth of inputs, paying the 10 per cent on the way in and then claiming it back some time later in the system, someone has got to carry the cost, someone has got to do the accounting and someone has got to do the paperwork. Unless the package will pay for accountants to do this for them, you have just added another little need for some farm business management skills a la this bill.
But the real cruncher comes when you look at the latest ABARE figures on the cost of operating a farm in the beef industry. I have looked them up and I have found that a farm family in the bottom 25 per cent, which actually runs at a loss and, therefore, has no money to live on at the end of the business operation, has to actually have income support. That family has probably got about $300 a week to spend—$15,000 a year. What do they do with that? They go into town and they buy food, newspapers and clothes, pay for school excursions and so on. Even if you allow that there is a little bit of sales tax on some of the things they buy and you discount that out—and my calculations are not questionable; I have not got time to go through my calculations absolutely, but I will do it outside this place for anyone who wants it—my calculations show that a family earning $15,000 a year of after business income, having to pay the 10 per cent GST in town, is between $20 and $23 a week worse off in spending power.
—So you have no idea how a GST works.
—I know exactly how the GST works. If you are going to tell us that food, newspapers, clothing and all of that is exempt, then fine; I will redo the calculations. But if it is as I know it is going to be, those people's after-farm take home pay—after buying ordinary things in the town and paying the GST—will be $20 a week less. From the same ABARE figures, the top 25 per cent of 
 farms will actually be $32 a week worse off, which is $1,500 a year.
I find this bizarre. The National Party has rolled over for it. It has actually rolled over for a policy that will make its very own constituency between $1,500 and $2,000 a year worse off. That is totally demonstrable, unless they are going to tell us that all these things that people normally buy with their after-farm income will be exempt from the GST. Of course, if they are exempt, then there is no GST. We will finish up with so many exemptions that we actually do not have a GST.
We will all wait with interest, but until you can demonstrate to me that you are exempting the things that people in country towns buy—those things that I have listed—then these people are being sold a pup by the very people who are meant to represent them. I go back to the comments made by Mr Gossage, because these are the very reasons why this is the case. He is a former National Party branch official in Mr Anderson's own electorate who said:
I never felt so let down, so disillusioned and angry. Today people in the bush are angrier than they ever were with Labor.
I can understand why.
Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned.",REPS,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Stone, Sharman, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—At least it is good that the Labor Party was spared the embarrassment of their shadow spokesman for primary industries this time round: at least he got the bill right. You will remember last time when he rose to speak to 
 represent Labor's interests in agriculture he spent his entire 20 minutes talking about Farm Start. The bill under question at the time was about farmer retirement assistance. It is that lack of attention to detail which has led the previous speaker, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), to also suggest that this government is entirely responsible for a downturn in farmers' incomes. He did mention the El Nino effect—I guess he understands that the rain does not always fall—and he did mention in passing the Asian situation, but he did not seem to somehow understand that Australian farmers are export dependent and that any business, agribusiness in particular, that is totally dependent on export trade has a great deal of difficulty when it comes to domestic policies being able to do much about the swings and roundabouts in prices that they receive. Australian farmers are price takers. That is a tragedy for them.
The previous speaker talked long and hard about the fact that you cannot simply offer some training courses to farmers and they will all suddenly have their cows come home and be better off. This particular bill, the  Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 , looks at farm business improvement programs, but it is part of a whole jigsaw puzzle of pieces which are together providing such improvements as the farm management deposit schemes to help farmers with incomes that fluctuate over time; the farm family restart scheme; the retirement assistance for farmers scheme—the one that the previous speaker had a great deal of difficulty understanding and remembering—and welfare assistance for farmers so that they get access to entitlements in a much more speedy, reasonable and fair way.
This bill is extremely important for farmers. I will speak later about the National Farmers Federation research which has shown that farmers who participate in additional training and education have a substantially better prospect in terms of farm viability and additional productivity.
Let me begin by saying that this particular bill is the final link in the government's comprehensive AAA package. It is about 
 helping farmers become and remain world best producers of agricultural product. As an example of how well our farmers do, despite the extraordinarily difficult seasonal conditions they have been facing over the last decade, in the latest trade figures, released in May 1998 by the Bureau of Statistics, we saw that the exports of rural goods were up, including a 28 per cent increase in meat and meat preparation exports. What a fantastic effort by our hard-pressed primary industries. Unlike the shadow spokesman for primary industries, who can only speak gloom and doom and suggest that agribusiness is finished, our primary producers are exporting into the Asian crisis in such a way that the trade figures show they have increased their exports—a phenomenal program of work.
This bill aims to provide a basis for encouraging and assisting change in the industry. It will help all people involved in farming, including farm employees, through education and training aimed at increasing their skills and, ultimately, their farm businesses' profitability and sustainability in these increasingly changing times—changes that are well beyond domestic policy; changes that in a population as small as Australia's are well beyond our ability to influence the international agribusiness marketplace. Farmbis will provide financial assistance towards the cost of programs and training for key activities such as farm business and financial planning and advice, skills development, quality assurance, risk management, farm performance benchmarking, rural leadership, marketing and natural resource management.
Farmbis will replace the rural adjustment scheme. It follows the release of the McColl report titled Rural adjustment—managing change. The McColl committee concluded that the rural adjustment scheme had not reached a large proportion of farmers. The report acknowledged the importance of education and training but stated that, apart from these areas, the effectiveness of the old RAS was not really clear. The previous government might have tried, but it simply did not succeed when it came to assisting farmers to respond to a dynamic international marketplace. 
Farmbis takes over the education and training components of the rural adjustment scheme with an improved focus on developing and encouraging a profitable and competitive farm sector. There is just no room in this day and age for anything but the most skilled agribusiness in Australia. For example, a typical market structure in agribusiness is a large number of farmers dispersed over a wide geographic area and a large number of consumers, and they are linked by a very small number of intermediaries on whom both are dependent—that is, the farmers and the consumers. This dependence is a source of power for those intermediaries. These are often then in the position to employ monopsonistic practices in the purchase of the produce and monopolistic practices in the sale of the products to consumers. That means that our farmers are typically the price takers. They are not able to pass the costs of their inputs in their agricultural production onto consumers at the end of the chain.
It was stunning to hear the shadow spokesperson for agriculture argue against tax reform, because a consumption tax or a GST relieves the primary producer of the accumulated costs of wholesale sales tax on inputs in their production process. It would allow them to get a credit for the tax paid on inputs. If they are exporting there is no GST on that product as it goes to a consumer offshore. It is quite stunning to imagine the shadow spokesperson on agriculture in this place stating that there is no need for tax reform when it comes to primary production. In fact, he was mounting quite a scare campaign.
Trade in food has always operated in a different sociopolitical and economic environment compared to the environment affecting the exchange of other goods and services. For example, if you are in the business of farming you are exposed to much greater insecurity. You cannot tell what the weather will be like. You cannot tell if an overseas marketplace will suddenly reject your product on the basis of some domestic policy in, for example, Japan or Korea or the Philippines or Thailand.
The largest proportion of primary food production, like crop growing or livestock management, has always been in the hands of 
 family farmers. This is especially the case in Australia. Why? Because Australian primary production is a high risk enterprise and the returns on capital are small, often below five per cent. This tends to make farm activity much less attractive to corporate investment. It is the family farmers who have survived year after year because often they do not take salary out for all of the workers in the farm enterprise. Their spouses, partners and children may labour on those farms for long hours without being remunerated. While a corporate enterprise could not continue, farming families do it tough year after year, often with assets valued high but with incomes very low.
Having described the fact that farmers are very much at the bottom end of the activity chain, with little power, our farmers in Australia are also producing product well beyond the volume that can be absorbed by the domestic market. They are export dependent. And the supply and price distortions that you find in the international market are far and above the sorts of price distortions you find in any other sale of goods and services, say in the manufacturing sector.
There are a plethora of government production incentive or disincentive policies which you will find factored into the price of product in international food trade. For example, in 1974 in Australia we had virtually guaranteed markets for our beef and our butter in the United Kingdom. Both New Zealand and Australia lost those markets and our preferred nation supply status when Britain joined the European Common Market. Suddenly our primary producers had to find a whole new range of marketplaces for, in particular, their beef and their dairy product. That is why farmers need to be flexible and need to be able to change. Instead of packing up and going home, our Australian farmers looked for markets in Asia. Today, our best returning markets for primary production, especially dairy, wheat and beef production, are the nations of Japan and Korea. In 1974 we were dependent on the United Kingdom. Likewise, other countries have had similar shocks to their agribusiness marketing. Japan, for example, lost access to Taiwan and Korea's 
 supply of low cost rice when it was defeated in World War II.
There is a great deal of government intervention in international global food markets. Some other examples of influences move more slowly, for example the greening of world politics and the protection of, and induced growth in, subsidised farm exports from the European Community after World War II. Such factors mean that in Australia farmers can no longer anticipate competing against product which is always priced fairly. A lot of competing product is dumped and subsidised.
Different export competing economies have responded differently to the international food trade forces. These responses depend on the political power of those who are most affected domestically, for example the farmers. So, when the European Union subsidies led to substantial slumps in food trade prices in the 1980s, the USA was in a position where it simply increased its own agricultural subsidies to its own farmers to match the low costs of the dumped products in the markets that Australia was also trying to compete in. Unfortunately Australia and New Zealand had less influential agricultural interests and a lesser ability to transfer the resources required to subsidise their disadvantaged primary producers. We could not afford to subsidise our growers, even if we had wanted to. Rather, we initiated the Cairns Group, a forum of 14 agricultural exporting nations.
With the Cairns Group we argued that world agricultural trade had to be fairer. It had to be liberalised. At the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations, the Cairns Group was able to influence the introduction of a new era aiming for reduced government intervention in the world trade for food. The Cairns Group also encouraged the non-farm groups in countries with protected agriculture sectors to voice their concerns at the high domestic costs of farm support programs. They tried to make sure, for example, that people who consumed rice in Korea and Japan understood that they were paying substantially more for that cereal when compared to a situation of open market access for Australia or Thailand.
During the 1986-93 Uruguay Round many countries, like Korea, argued that subsidies, tariffs or quotas were absolutely necessary to protect their food self-sufficiency. They claimed this was critical for national security, environmental protection, equitable national income distribution and the maintenance of their very own cultural integrity. Each of these were very powerful arguments and in their countries their advocates held a great deal of sway. Meanwhile, back in Australia, a country with a small population and a small domestic market, our countries continue to be export dependent. Our farmers were unable to have much influence over those in countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan, who did not necessarily understand that the protection of their farmers was at the cost of farmers in countries like Australia and New Zealand.
Despite the work of the Cairns Group and the GATT Uruguay Round, barriers to food importation remained significantly higher than for manufactured products in most countries. Thus, a concept of free market forces in an openly competitive market applies least when it comes to international trade in agriculture. Consequently our farmers need all the help they can get to be flexible and to adapt to change—a lot of it unpredictable, like the UK joining the European Union. Our farmers have to be highly trained and well educated to understand the international forces and to make sure their properties environmentally are totally sustainable.
Even though we now have, under the World Trade Organisation, a lot of lip service being paid to the need to bring down tariff barriers, at the same time our farmers are facing continued non-tariff barriers—for example, through dynamic labelling laws in different countries—ad hoc port of entry quarantine actions, distribution system impediments, non-standard phytosanitary compliance requirements or the timing of bureaucratic processes. These all continue to protect some domestic industries in our export marketplaces against competition. Australia has to continue to work hard in fora like the World Trade Organisation to bring home to other nations the total cost to their economies of continuing to subsidise their primary producers, often at the 
 cost of their own environment and their own consumers' access to cheaper foods.
Export competitiveness depends on the ability of farmers to predict, respond and change to opportunities arising from changes due to institutional factors in international markets and the evolution of food demand, changing patterns of food consumption and domestic food demand and self-sufficiency policies. The National Farmers Federation, that peak body which represents the different state farmer organisations, in November 1996 produced a research paper called `Change, training and farm profitability'. The NFF understands, unlike the previous speaker, that education and training are powerful influences on decision making on farms and, hence, are very important contributors to farm profitability and long-term viability. Learning events, including accredited training courses and informal programs such as field days and crop monitoring groups it says play an essential role in making farmers aware of new management strategies and practices.
The NFF in the 1996 report also made a point that this government understands only too well: that Australia's farmers are relatively poorly educated, especially when compared with our overseas developed nation competitors, and they are poorly trained and educated compared with those in other Australian industry sectors. Not only does this limit their productivity directly, but it also has a compounding effect by inhibiting further training, which then further limits their capacity to be flexible, adaptable and responsive to change.
In particular, under the conclusions, No. 1 in the NFF report stated that farm businesses which have agricultural qualifications within the management team are more profitable than other farm businesses; that farm businesses which engage in training are more profitable than other farm businesses; and that farm businesses which engage in training are more likely to make changes to their practice which improve or are expected to improve long-term profitability and viability.
That is the background to this bill which will introduce Farmbis. We also acknowledge that there are education needs for regional communities which go from primary through 
 to secondary education through to their trade skilling and tertiary education. This government has addressed the needs of rural and remote students by addressing issues such as lack of access to apprenticeships, lack of access to tertiary education and the costs incurred by having to go to cities to study. In fact, just yesterday, by changing our policies in relation to Austudy, we made sure that off-farm students having to go to cities to train will get some rent assistance through a program incorporated in what we now call `youth allowance'.
This government understands how difficult it is to survive in agribusiness. It understands that, being export dependent, very often our farmers are confronted with forces well beyond their immediate control and that of our own domestic policies. Our farmers' training and their ability to adapt and take on board their industry's world's best farm practice are essential for their survival.
This bill contains measures that the National Farmers Federation has been calling for. I know that it has received the strongest support from all sectors of agribusiness across this nation. I am very proud to be part of this government and to be representing a regional electorate at a time when we need to respond to the extraordinary difficulties facing our farm sector, with the Asian crisis as it is. I am proud to say that today we are putting forward legislation that is another practical response to these problems. This bill make farm training and education more possible.",REPS,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998  is a bill that the government has decided to put forward to wind up a perfectly good scheme, the rural adjustment scheme, and replace it with another. It has done this in the context of the 1997-98 budget and as a result of the findings of the McColl report. The scheme being put in place is one which is very similar to RAS and is called farm business improvement programs, `Farmbis'. It is part of the government's AAA package, which is aimed at assisting farmers improve their management skills.
Assistance will be provided by way of direct financial assistance for activities such 
 as financial planning, performance, benchmarking, quality assurance, risk management, marketing and natural resource planning. The program funds will be divided into state and national components, with funding for the state component shared on a fifty-fifty basis between the Commonwealth and the states. The scheme will operate for three years from this 1998-99 financial year. The only thing that appears to have changed is the amount of money involved and who provides it.
The opposition is not planning to oppose this bill. It is really one of our old schemes renamed and rebudgeted. But I think those who are looking to get assistance under it will need to look very closely at the small print.
The review itself could have had more merit, but I think it failed to go far enough. The committee was requested to take a long-term view of future adjustment challenges and to identify private and government sector strategies to most effectively facilitate rural adjustment. Of course, this is the whole issue we are dealing with: trying to assist farming people and their families in readjusting with retraining and reskilling to be able to face the challenges of today and tomorrow—just as has occurred in so many industries throughout Australia.
The committee was to explain the appropriateness of the RAS program, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the delivery system and the effectiveness of the support elements to it. Also, it was to include an examination of the need for transitional arrangements for any move to new adjustment strategies and consider the exceptional circumstances provisions and the impact of these on the rural adjustment process since the inception of the scheme.
Many of these points needed updating from the old scheme because circumstances have changed since the inception of that scheme—and we know only too well the dilemma of the pork, the chicken and the wheat industries. This government has tried to deal with each of those industries—in a very bad way—but it has not been able to facilitate changes to them very well at all. It has been the same with changes in sugar selling, agroforestry 
 development, et cetera, and the list can go on and will go on into the future.
Any additional information that can be developed and incorporated into this scheme for farmers is worth while. At times I mourn the passing of the old agricultural department extension officers who, when I was a boy, turned up on the farm to give advice and assist the farmer. They worked with farmers on the ground to help introduce new ideas, provide information to help solve problems and generally to be a one-on-one adviser in the latest farming techniques. This service, which I saw as being a useful one for the government to provide, went early when the razors were out. The government, by doing away with that service, probably robbed itself of the opportunity of helping rural people cope with the changes that they have had to adapt to over the last 20 years or so. That service could have been used to help facilitate those changes.
Farmers now have to pay for any advice they receive and, therefore, in these stringent times they tend to struggle on, until it is too late for advice. They tend to struggle on until the problems they are weighed down with are enormous—bank debts, no rain and, of course, no income. They then may seek some counselling and assistance, although it is at the other end the assistance is needed—that is, with up-skilling, new skills that one can take on board.
Strategic plans and fancy courses are all very well. But on farms, where existing is the name of the game, very few who are eligible to take up some of these schemes can, because of other pressing commitments. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) was very hot on this very matter. She is a very well educated person, and she can spout this. But out there you need schemes that farmers can get their teeth into—the half-day seminar, the activity of learning and taking new skills on board, understanding what is going on, the field day, the video.
Last year, when I toured New Zealand with the member for Murray, we looked at the beef board in New Zealand and talked to that authority. The board had a video which it sent out to its farmers on its attitudes and what it 
 thought was going on in the beef industry. That video was sent out, I think, twice-yearly and had something like a 90 per cent hit rate with the beef farmers of New Zealand. That sort of information is what it is about, continuing from there by getting people to acquire more skills. We can talk about fancy ideas, but I think it is more about practical ideas.
For instance, yesterday in the Hobart Mercury an article appeared headed `Farming—dead loss for most'. It claimed that two-thirds of Australian farmers are running at a loss—and this is under a conservative government. The latest ABARE annual farm survey shows that the average farm profit is $2,000 a year. The average farming couple spend 69 hours a week working and juggling farm duties and a non-rural job, child care or volunteer work.
The annual snapshot of Australian farming shows that poor seasonal conditions, very low world prices and reduced demand from Asian markets helped to erode profitability in the rural sector. When you look at those figures, it certainly has been eroded. The survey also showed that cash receipts for farms in 1997-98 dipped by about five per cent and profits slumped by almost six per cent, with 64 in every 100 farms making a loss. So 64 out of every 100 farms made a loss last year. It is hardly a picture to encourage new people into farming or to get money into farms, or to get people back on the land or to revitalise our small towns. In fact, quite the reverse.
The member for Murray attacked our shadow minister, saying that he was too gloomy. These figures are reality and truth, and you have to face up to the reality. Reality is about government putting things in place perhaps in policy terms to assist changing that around.
Yet the very scheme we have here to which it is suggested that farmers turn when experiencing changes in their particular part of the industry is asking for a financial contribution towards the cost of the training program. In so doing, the government is going against everything that is being said of the farm sector. That leaves one option for most, that is, to leave the farm, to get off. In Tasmania, 
 that is what is happening. Small farms are going to the wall every day of the week.
The primary industry sector is one of the rural area's key fields which is ripe for development. Government has tended to ignore the role it can play in helping industry move into a viable primary produce role. The outlook for agriculture in the next century is for continuing change, which comes from increasing globalisation and greater integration in the marketing chain, with pressure to increase quality control and manage natural resources sustainably.
Those pressures will be there; no matter what is said and done, they will continue to be the main pressures impacting on the farm sector. They will bring both opportunities and challenges to the farm sector, and they will place new demands on the management capacities of Australian farmers—particularly their ability to handle risk better than they deal with now.
Government needs to help in a whole range of areas, particularly in infrastructure, which includes such things as transport, water assistance through irrigation schemes, drought proofing schemes and things like that. People in rural areas have been given a raw deal by this government. There has been a massive reaction, as witnessed by the Queensland situation. I think the government has listened to what has been said; I hope it has. I think the government needs to take action to rein in some of the gung-ho approaches to world trade—for example, with our leading in cutting away at our own protection but others not seeming to want to give us the same opportunities.
The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the Opposition shadow minister, pointed out some of the frustration felt by people in the bush who are members of the same party as some of those on the government side.
We have to recognise that we cannot be the leader in the matter of the liberalisation of trade. Opening up the market is fine, but not at the expense of our workers and our jobs, particularly when other developed countries are not prepared to drop their barriers to our products. But by the same token, our rural industries need to get together and look at 
 how they can become more competitive both in the local market and in the international field.
I believe there is a need to do some hard thinking and some precise restructuring to deal with some of the problems that are facing our farmers. It is those who are best equipped to make the changes who are the ones that really should be developing the policy, and I do not think that happens very much at all.
Any rural assistance type programs should be drawn together to allow some of the smaller farmers a small window of opportunity to take part in that restructuring to assist them and the family farm, whether it be by developing farm machinery circles, by employment circles, by developing producer cooperatives with people working together in networking schemes, or by looking at the latest in agricultural schemes such as the fodder factory. If anyone has not heard of that, it is worthwhile knowing about, particularly for drought affected areas and many other areas as well. It is a very worthwhile scheme.
The use of the Internet is becoming popular, especially with bigger farmers with Internet access, but it is almost inaccessible to many of those on small holdings. Many people in my electorate would not have access to the Internet even though there has been some community access provided. Hopefully, we can extend that access in the future.
Access needs to be assured to cover such issues as the sale of Telstra and the effect that that will have on rural and regional areas. When you talk about supplying information assistance, training and skills development, the Internet and other ways of communicating directly with people in their own homes becomes vital. The sale of Telstra is certainly a major issue for people in rural and regional Australia, as is the effect that the privatisation of the Hydro Electric Commission could have in my own state of Tasmania.
While I am sure that this bill is supposed to be only a simple adjustment to an already existing scheme, these sorts of bills roll through without too many people really knowing what the implications are. By chan 
 ging a word just subtly it can make a lot of difference to what somebody ends up getting in assistance.
Tasmania needs help in most areas of its economy, and I see the rural and regional area as one of the key sectors in the future in developing our production. Certainly, our vegetables and poppy industries can expand. It is about having farmers with the skills in this generation and the next to be able to take advantage of those opportunities. The sooner we get on with that and help our constituents the better off we will be.
The figures that the shadow minister raised in relation to the GST were very interesting. He has done some work in relation to farm income and worked out that with a GST, farmers would be $32 per week worse off. The figure was something like $1,500 a year. When members opposite say how the GST will be good for farmers, farmers and the farming community of this country should have a damn good look at how it will affect them. I do not think a GST will help very much. We will be supporting the bill.",REPS,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Marek, Paul, MP",NP,1998-07-02,"—I wish to speak in this debate on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 . Farmers in the central Queensland region of Capricornia are still doing it very, very tough. The drought is now rolling towards its eighth year of devastation and commodity prices are continuing to fall to meagre levels. On top of this, the Asian economic crisis is about to make a big impact on our farming sector.
Although the coalition government has made a number of changes to assist the rural industry adjust to a changing world economic climate, a lot of these changes have not had the desired effect of improving farm profitability. The farm management deposit scheme, an adequate welfare safety net and the farm family restart scheme will help farmers reorganise themselves to be able to fight their way through the system that is really affecting them, in particular, this bad drought. And Farmbis, which we are talking about here today, will provide farmers with skills and advice on how they can best manage their property. This is another great initiative that we are putting forward.
I must say that the National Party has always been, and always will be, very representative of regional and rural Australia, particularly the people out there in country Queensland.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The interjections from the other side of the House just go to show the opposition's ineptness in relation to this issue. They are obviously too close to the city dwellers; they do not understand what is going on; and we saw that in the Queensland election, when Labor was significantly rolled by One Nation.
Further, this new system is enough to rectify some of the serious problems facing the people that provide all our food and 25 per cent of the nation's exports. According to the latest farm survey of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, farm profits have dropped by a massive 80 per cent over the last two years, with almost two-thirds of farmers still making business losses.
The statistics show that the average farming family works about 69 hours a week for an average profit of $2,000 a year. Those figures are absolutely staggering: 69 hours a week for an average profit of $2,000 a year. We have to work to ensure we can keep those people out there on the land not only maintaining a profitable business but also looking after the city dwellers. This is just one-fifth of the profit they earned in 1995-96.
If you take out the big end of the market, you will find that most small farmers, such as those earning less than $100,000 a year, are recording substantial losses as well, especially on the dairy, beef, mixed livestock and cropping farms, where they are making losses of $20,000 to $30,000 per farm and negative returns of 3.5 to four per cent. According to the survey, farmers are racking up debt averaging $136,400. This again begs the question: are we doing enough to help these people adjust to the trials and tribulations of farming in today's environment?
As far as the bill is concerned, there are four key objectives of the Agriculture—Advancing Australia package. These four 
 objectives are: to help the individual farm business profit from change; to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net system; and to provide positive incentives for continual farm adjustment. The fourth, of course, is to encourage social and economic development in rural areas.
As well as this, it is known that Australian agriculture accounts for about 25 per cent of the nation's exports. I must say that for employment factors, for the development of jobs in Australia, we must work to value add our products, particularly within the beef industry, something that is very, very important. That, of course, in some ways works against live exports to other countries but value adding does provide jobs for Australians and value adding is something that needs to be looked at and, of course, worked on a lot more.
Further, Farmbis will give farmers an opportunity to identify, access and participate in the skills development activities most relevant to enhancing the performance of their business. Farmbis will achieve its objectives through a range of strategies. These strategies are very, very important and it is very pertinent that we put them on the record in this debate.
Firstly, they will increase farmer participation in learning activities, which will enhance the profitability, sustainability and competitiveness of their businesses. Secondly, they will develop greater acceptance of the benefits of continuous learning and skills development and their relevance to the changing management needs of the competitive farm sector. Finally, they will enhance farmers' capacity to identify and access appropriate learning activities and over time influence more flexible delivery of such activities.
Farmbis will give farmers an opportunity to identify, access and participate in these skills, as I have said, and the development of the skills most relevant to enhancing performance in their business is absolutely imperative to their survival. Very importantly, they will build on the excellent training that is being delivered round the nation by the property management planning campaign, which is a joint Commonwealth-state initiative that 
 introduced farmers to strategic business planning at the whole farm level and is delivered through farmers workshops.
Further, Farmbis will achieve its objectives through other strategies that are important, such as assisting farmers to participate in learning activities, to coordinate flexible, responsible delivery, and to communicate with, contribute to and work with other farmers close to them. Often you hear of the scenario of one person on his property who has learnt to do one thing a particular way and whose sons may have left the property to do an apprenticeship in boilermaking, electronics, fitting and turning, or diesel fitting and then come back to the property. That property has changed the way it has done things and then some weeks, months or even years down the track they will be talking to the farmer next door and he will be talking about how he is doing things and they will say, `Gee, listen, we stopped doing that a couple of years ago. This is a significant benefit. This is how we are doing it.' So what you have got is the farmers interacting with each other, and this gives another significant benefit. That is why it is important that people from property to property have the ability to communicate with each other and, of course, to develop the way they do things.
There are another couple of points I would like to make as time draws on, particularly in relation to the national competition policy. As far as country Queensland is concerned, particularly from my point of view as a National Party member for Capricornia in central Queensland, there have been some words said in the past weeks, particularly within the media, of course, in relation to Australia Post and the national competition policy.
It is important for people to know where I stand: I do not support the breaking down or the further deregulation of Australia Post. It is the lifeline to many of the people out there in the country, and it is imperative that it maintains its hold and is there for the people out there in country Queensland.
We have seen the withdrawal of the banks and those sorts of financial institutions over years past, and that has led to the breaking 
 down of small towns in country Queensland—and, of course, across Australia. More often than not, the post offices are the final link that a lot of small communities have, and it is absolutely imperative that they are maintained and that they have a presence. That presence is obviously in the form of an establishment in the town, not just somebody dropping in on a weekly or daily basis. Once again, there is no backing down on that. The issue is not negotiable. Australia Post remains.
Further, as far as the national competition policy is concerned, I believe that the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 should be amended somewhat so that newsagencies, pharmacies, taxis, and the dairy and sugar industries have a greater ability to maintain themselves rather than be attacked by the national competition policy; that as well inland and regional local government bodies should be excluded from the ambit of the act; and that the government should be given the power to designate, at their discretion, any other industry or parts of industries or government services to be similarly excluded from the ambit of the act.
I feel very passionate as far as national competition policy is concerned. I was a councillor in local government in the Belyando Shire, and we often saw situations where it was basically destroying small towns like Clermont in central Queensland. The council would need a new vehicle, and under the competition policy they would have to buy a vehicle from Mackay, some hundreds of kilometres away, rather than being able to buy the vehicle from the local Ford dealership. There may have been a difference of only several hundred dollars, or even $300 to $500, between buying the vehicle in the town of Clermont or buying it in the city of Mackay several hundred kilometres away.
This only destroys those small communities. The local councils should have the ability to spend that money in their local communities. This is an area where national competition policy is not helping local government or country Queensland and, as I said, I intend to take this issue further in the parliament as the weeks draw on.
Drought relief is another issue that has been in place for some time. I remember campaigning very strongly around the March 1996 election that, if the Liberal-National coalition were in government, it would ensure relief for the people in country Queensland, particularly because the drought was taking so long not so much to wear off but to wear on. We need to go down the track to keep the people on the land. We have just started to have significant rainfalls in country Queensland, and it will be some years before these people start to make it back and become self-sustainable.
It is important that government, in particular, act for the people, and I am a great believer in government governing for today, not just for tomorrow. I think that is where we have seen government in past years, and even now, falling down. We are too busy governing for tomorrow, the future, rather than governing for today. It is the bread and butter issues that really affect people. The everyday man on the street needs to know that he is going to have that income at the end of the week to be able to pay his mortgage, et cetera.
That is where national competition policy and drought relief stand. There are a couple of major issues, but as far as the changes in the bill are concern I commend them. They will go a long way to helping people in country Queensland.",REPS,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998  gives effect to the government's decision to wind up the rural adjustment scheme and to replace it with the farm business improvement program. I cannot go too much longer in this debate without challenging some of the views that have been put here today in this debate by the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek). As Labor spokesperson on Northern Australia, I have an understanding of the great hurt and the anger being felt in the bush by the betrayal of their interests by people like the member for Capricornia.
The National Party has comprehensively betrayed rural and regional Australia, and you can always tell when the National Party is under attack, because they come in here to deliver their speeches beating their breasts 
 and saying that they are sorry for the hurt and damage that they have done to people in rural and regional Australia. You can always tell when the National Party members are running scared, because they come in to deliver these platitudes to people in rural and regional Queensland and elsewhere in Australia.
I note the presence in the chamber today of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who, in the debate on industry policy, suggested that all that opposition members did was to read from their speeches. I do not need to read my speech on the floor of this parliament today, because you do not need notes to speak about the performance of the National Party.
The reason why the National Party members are in here apologising to people in rural and regional Australia is that they got creamed in Queensland. They comprehensively betrayed rural and regional dwellers, and now they are in here on the floor of this parliament beating their breasts and hoping that the One Nation steamroller will not go right over them. I do not think anybody in rural and regional Queensland is listening.
The honourable member for Capricornia has a really big problem, because he gets up and tells the parliament how he is all for value adding: `Yes siree; let's get that value adding out into rural and regional communities and create jobs and preserve the fabric there.' I suggest he talks to his leader. That is the first place to start. Don't come in here telling the opposition how you are going to create jobs in rural and regional Queensland; don't put it out over the airwaves how you are going to do it; go to your leader and tell him your views, because this is what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), your National Party minister, had to say in the Weekend Australian of 11-12 January 1997:
Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries.
Further on he said:
It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value adding. 

The member for Capricornia should not come in here telling us how he is all for value adding. Go to the leader of your party and convince him that this is the correct strategy. You will obviously get support from us because, once again, you are stealing the policies that Labor have put up so that rural and regional Queensland and rural and regional Australia can develop employment opportunities and get those communities moving again.
I say this to the honourable member for Capricornia and to those people in rural and regional Queensland who are listening to this debate today: it was not the Labor Party that withdrew the $150 million for regional development; it was the Liberal-National Party coalition. It was not the Labor Party which withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars that went into rural and regional Australia in the form of assistance for labour market programs to skill people in the bush so that they might take advantage of employment opportunities; it was the Liberal and National parties.
The great exporting cooperatives of Australia—the people who create the value adding opportunities in provincial Australia, the great companies that export value added produce off the back of the raw materials of our primary industries—suffered because a Liberal-National Party government denied them access to export development schemes that would enable them to get into export markets, to sell more value added produce and to create more jobs in rural and regional Australia.
It was not Labor that withdrew the basic services that form the fabric of rural and regional communities; it has been the Liberal Party and the National Party, of which the member for Capricornia is a proud member. I would say that, if we get a couple more public opinion polls, it will be the member for Capricornia, along with the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and another National Party member from Queensland, who will jump ship to One Nation. They could not even stand and draw the line in the sand, and now they want to jump ship to go to the other side because people in the bush are sick of them. 
Let me tell you something about people in the bush: once you make a promise to them, they expect you to keep it. I went through some of the commitments that we gave, and delivered, to the bush, and they were the things that were taken away by a Liberal-National Party government. That is why the anger in the bush is so deep.
It is no good for the member for Capricornia to come in here and say that he wants to support the retention of Australia Post, when he is part of a government that wants to sell off Telstra to foreigners. That is the position: he wants to keep Australia Post in public ownership and then he wants to sell the rest of Telstra in the private marketplace and damage the interests of rural and regional Australians. What is worse, his Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has allocated 35 per cent of this great Australian asset to foreigners. There will be no sale of Telstra to foreign interests and no further sale of Telstra to private interests when the Labor Party is in power—simple fact—and it will not be the case with Australia Post.
Mr Marek interjecting—
—Here they go! The member for Capricornia is going on about the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas.
—What happened to Qantas?
—I think the honourable member for Capricornia ought to tell us how many of his constituents flew on Qantas and on Australian Airlines before they were privatised.
—You sold it.
—Don't come that nonsense with me. What is the great king hit by the National Party on rural and regional Australians? It is the GST. The member for Capricornia gets up here and says, `Farm profits are down by 80 per cent.' The latest farm survey by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has found that farm profits have been slashed by 80 per cent under the Howard government. What is the response by this spokesperson for the National Party and by the National Party itself? `We are going to privatise Telstra. We 
 are going to impose a GST on farmers and on farm families.'
I think it is about time that the National Party had a strong, hard look at itself, because members of its coalition cabinet were sacked for rorting. That is a fact, and people in rural and regional Australia know it is a fact that some of the big rorters in the coalition were from the National Party. While farmers were struggling out on their farms to make ends meet, National Party ministers were in this parliament rorting their travel allowances. Those are the facts of the matter.
The reason why the bush is so angry is that the government they placed their trust in has comprehensively betrayed them. They have a Prime Minister who cannot uphold ministerial standards, and they have a government that has had seven resignations in 27 months—that is one resignation every four months. If that is not a sign of a government in decay, I really do not know what is. They could not even go through a footy season without a resignation from the coalition ranks. That is the government that we have here today, and that is the government that is introducing this particular piece of legislation to improve the management skills of farmers.
Let me say to the rural communities of Australia, and especially to farmers in the northern parts of Australia: we will support this piece of legislation because we believe it is an important step to take to improve the management skills of the Australian farm sector. The Karpin report, delivered at the time when the Labor Party was in government, identified the Achilles heel of the Australian economy: it was not the inability of the workers to work hard; it was not the fact that we were not investing in capital equipment; it was in the human resource called management. Management was ripping off the profits of Australian companies with large salaries while farmers were earning negative incomes, and our Achilles heel, as far as getting the economy going, was the poor management practices of the Australian business sector.
We welcome this particular program because it is going to put resources at the disposal of farmers to improve their manage 
 ment skills. But I have to say this in all honesty to the farmers who are listening to this debate today—the farmers in their tractors now who are tilling the ground, who are coping with climate change and who are coping with the effects of the Asian economics firestorm: you are going to need every cent of this money. You are going to need to improve your management practices to keep you in the race, to overcome the shock waves that are now moving across Australian agriculture, and the Australian Labor Party will stand with you in sponsoring these particular programs.
The government has made it quite clear that the aim of this program is to improve the management skills of farmers, to lift their productivity and to lift their profitability. The activities that can be selected by farmers to improve their skills go to the general areas of farm management, quality issues, marketing issues and financial planning issues. In all of those areas there may be farmers who wish to upgrade their skills, who see an advantage in acquiring new skills and in positioning their farms in the marketplace so that they are better able to withstand the shocks that are upon the rural sector today. A pleasing aspect of this legislation is the partnership that is being called for between community groups, farm organisations and the states. This will be a program that will be funded conjointly.
The process of structural change in agriculture has been extremely dynamic over the past decades. We have seen a reduction in farm households; we have seen an increase in farm sizes. The process of structural adjustment has been fuelled by increasing cost pressures, a desire to achieve economies of scale on amalgamated farms, the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of markets. Agriculture has become more efficient and productive, and it needs to be supported by the sorts of measures that we are debating here today.
I know a bit about the pain of structural adjustment because I come from a dairy farm in the Western District, a sector which underwent significant structural adjustment in the 1980s to prepare it for the 1990s.
Mr McArthur interjecting—
—I notice the presence in the House today—he always comes in—of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) who is saying a few words from the back benches there. Of course, he was one of the ones who went around rural Australia in the 1980s being very critical of the actions that were being taken by the Labor government of the day. But I will give the honourable member for Corangamite some credit: whilst he did couch in general terms his criticisms of the government of the day, he was supportive and he did indicate to farmers that they had to undergo this process of structural adjustment to prepare themselves for the challenges of the 1990s. We went through that period. My community suffered greatly from that restructuring process. But we knew at the time that, if it did not occur, then the dairy industry in Australia would be run over by the New Zealanders and the competition that would come from the Europeans. If you go into the rural sector now, you will see that the dairy industry is one of the industries that has done better than others.
There are significant pressures facing our farmers in today's economic climate, beyond their control. Farmers cannot anticipate the effects of El Nino, but they can certainly prepare for them, and that is part of the upgrading of management skills which is the object of this particular legislation. They cannot really insulate themselves from the adverse effects of the Asian economic meltdown. These are conditions that have existed in economies elsewhere that are going to impact greatly on Australian farmers.
The rural sector, unfortunately, has to put up with the Treasurer (Mr Costello), a suburban lawyer who knows nought about agriculture in Australia and the way he prepares the nation for the effects of these sorts of things. The Treasurer had some very interesting things to say about the El Nino threat. He said that there was no need to get too pessimistic about the El Nino effect. I suggest that the member for Capricornia go up to his farmers and tell them that his Treasurer said that they do not really have to worry too much about the effects of El Nino. What did the Treasurer say to the Australian people and 
 the Australian farm sector when the Asian economic crisis broke? The Treasurer said, `You don't really have much to worry about.' You know how the Treasurer comes into this House arrogant and grinning and smiling to the press gallery, `How am I doing today?' It was sheer arrogance of the Treasurer to tell Australian farmers that there was no need to get too pessimistic about the El Nino effect, that they should not worry about the Asian economic meltdown and that they should not worry about the fact that commodity prices would slump through the floor and that their profits would be down about 80 per cent. `She'll be right,' he said. Well, it will not be right.
The Australian farm community expect more from their Treasurer and they expect more from this government. They have been comprehensively betrayed by the National Party. They come into this House now in all these rural debates. They are like rabbits in the One Nation spotlight, quivering away there, not knowing which way to jump—left or right, forwards or backwards—because they are not sure whether the Hanson bandwagon is going to roll over them.
There is one certainty that rural people in this community can count on, and that is the integrity of Labor and the fact that Labor will defend their interests in the bush. When you see the comprehensive betrayal of rural people by the National Party, and the backlash in Queensland, then you can understand why they are upset.
Let me put this on the public record: if we had done to the Liberal Party what they did to us in Queensland, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) would now have 21 representatives in the Queensland parliament. There would be no Liberal Party and there would not be anything much left of the National Party. You chose that course of action so you have got to live with it. But I say to the people of rural and provincial Australia: we will restore the regional development program; we will give you the back the labour market programs that were taken from your communities that helped skill your people and position them to take jobs; and we will restore those services that have been ripped out of

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-07-02,"—Honourable members would be aware that my electorate of Gippsland has been devastated by the worst floods in history over the last few days. In fact, the rain started falling on Tuesday, 23 June with disastrous consequences, as in some districts in East Gippsland rainfall of 17½ inches was recorded over a less than 20-hour period.
Gippsland also suffered enormously from floods in 1990 and it has to be said that, to the credit of all involved, because of the lessons learnt from that disaster, many of the mistakes in emergency response were not repeated this time around. In fact, it is true to say that the disaster plan worked extremely well, and you would be hard pressed to find any fault with it. Much of this is due to the leadership provided by the various heads of government agencies, the East Gippsland Shire and also the volunteer organisations. So much so that Senior Sergeant Shane Downey actually called together all of the emergency response organisations early on the afternoon of Tuesday, 23 June before flood warnings were made apparent. Some instinct on his part, which he modestly explains away, prompted him to have a drill anyway, and if a flood did not eventuate, nothing would be lost. In fact, some knowledge of bringing together everybody in a mock emergency situation would be of benefit. That meant that everything was in place when, later in the evening of Tuesday, 23 June, floods were all too apparent.
I should therefore extend, on behalf of the Gippsland community, and indeed all Australians, our thanks to the emergency response organisations: the shire itself, the police, the State Emergency Service, the Country Fire Authority, VicRoads, Eastern Energy, Telstra, the Red Cross, the Victorian Farmers Federation, church groups and individual volunteers. When I visited headquarters—or the command centre—it was a remarkable sight of extraordinary activity. All of the representatives of those named organisations were brought together in one room around a circular table, each with communications—phones. 
 That meant that, unlike 1990 when people were confused, unsure of where to go and what was happening to relatives, they could phone in direct to one central point and receive assurance, assistance and guidance.
Tragically, it seems, as of this moment, that the missing yachtsman on the Gippsland Lakes has been lost to us. However, we expect, perhaps in the next few hours even, to confirm that. That would be the sole and tragic loss of life. The loss of property has been tragic, particularly for a region coming off drought. There had been seven inches of rainfall across East Gippsland a fortnight before the floods, which meant there were the beginnings of some grass growth. But, in actual fact, most of the paddocks, particularly in the Tambo Valley, were utterly unprotected and the loss of topsoil was horrendous and most upsetting to see. In fact, we believe that, even before the flood, we had lost some two inches in wind erosion on those unprotected paddocks.
It is not just the farmers who have suffered enormous loss; we are still counting it up. We expect there to be more than 8,000 sheep lost, 1,500 cattle, more than 130 kilometres of lost or damaged fences and far more than 40 properties with silt damage. But the toll-free phone line, which continues to operate, is available to farmers to report losses.
The tourist industry also suffered heavily, particularly in Lakes Entrance, Paynesville and Metung, and of course a great deal of effort has been made since to encourage people to continue to visit East Gippsland. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has visited the area with me as recently as yesterday and saw for himself the toll that has been taken, in physical and emotional terms, on the region. I will, Mr Speaker, return to this subject at a later time today.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you agreed, as claimed by the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, today, that the Commonwealth will pick up 75 per cent of the compensation costs for all future acts by the states and territories extinguishing or impacting on native title? Doesn't this hand to the states, effectively, a blank cheque to proceed with the complete extinguishment of native title on both vacant crown land and pastoral leases? Have you received from Treasury or Finance an estimate—and, if so, what?—of the potential liability of the Commonwealth and its taxpayers in this respect? Prime Minister, having bought your way out of an embarrassing and unnecessary early election, is the price setting up the Commonwealth and Australian taxpayers for billions of dollars of open-ended liability?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Native Title</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—I am aware that the Australian Labor Party is unhappy that a deal has been reached on the native title legislation. I am aware also that it is the Australian Labor Party that has wanted to fan division on this issue within the Australian community. I have also been wanting to know—as have many Australians—whether the Leader of the Opposition will give an undertaking to the Australian community that, if the Senate passes the amended bill in accordance with the arrangement reached between the government and Senator Harradine, the Australian Labor Party will give an undertaking that, if it is ever elected to office, it would not seek to repeal that bill. I think the farmers of Australia will want to know whether Kim Beazley is in favour of the settlement or is against it.
—Mr Speaker!
Opposition members interjecting—
—The House will remain silent. The members on the government benches!
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question sought to establish whether Richard Court was right when he said the 
 Commonwealth would pick up 75 per cent of the costs of future acts.
—The Leader of the Opposition will not argue the question. That is not a point of order.
—I think the Australian public will want to know where the Labor Party stands on certainty for Australian farmers. Does the Australian Labor Party support a settlement that gives security and predictibility to the rural community of Australia or does the Australian Labor Party want to continue the five years of uncertainty that it created commencing with the 1993 Native Title Act? It ought to be said very firmly that the source of this problem lies in the Keating Native Title Act.
—Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. There was a specific question asked about the compensation arrangements. It dealt with nothing else. Not remotely, in anything the Prime Minister has said, has he got to grips with that.
—The Leader of the Opposition would know that, if he asks a long question and does not ask a precise question, there is the same opportunity that he exercised as a minister for the Prime Minister and other ministers to reply—
—What about the other side?
—If the member for Brisbane will remain silent while I am talking—there is the same opportunity for ministers of the present government to respond as did ministers in the preceding government. The Prime Minister is in order.
—I know that every farmer and every person interested in the mining industry in Australia knows that the uncertainty, the doubt and the hesitation in relation to native title are a direct consequence of the Keating Native Title Bill. At long last an arrangement has been reached that will resolve that uncertainty.
On the question of compensation, an arrangement was reached in relation to compensation provision of 75 and 25. I have indicated already that there will be further discussion on that issue. The assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition is again wrong. 
 There has been no buying off. The doubt and concern that he raises about billions of dollars are, once again, a fanciful exaggeration.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Native Title</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,answer
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen this document prepared in your office, headed Waterfront Strategy, for distribution to you, John Sharp, Peter Reith, Greg Bondar and Peter Wilson? Prime Minister, doesn't this document recommend an interventionist approach as the only strategy for your government and define it as requiring `active involvement by the Commonwealth and the stevedoring industry to bring about a national MUA stoppage allowing the stevedores to sack their existing work force and restart their operations with a new non-union work force'? Prime Minister, isn't this the document you endorsed on 21 April 1997 and which you told Ministers Reith and Sharp the same day that they should proceed to implement?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—It is very interesting that there has been one question on native title—very instructive. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to table the document and I would be very happy to have a look at it.
—Don't you know what was in it?
—The honourable member for Brisbane will remain silent.
—As to the substance of the issue, of course the government wanted waterfront reform; of course, we were going to be active; of course, we were going to work hard to achieve waterfront reform—because that is what we campaigned on.
Mr Bevis interjecting—
—I warn the member for Brisbane.
—I am very proud of the fact that the government I lead wanted to deliver a reformed Australian waterfront and it remains to the eternal discredit of the Australian Labor Party that it opposed those efforts.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for:
(1)	 his authorisation and funding of a secret Government strategy to provoke an industrial dispute involving stevedores dismissing their employees and rehiring new non-union workers under different arrangements;
(2)	 his evasive denials of the existence of such a strategy;
(3)	 his willingness to embark upon potentially illegal actions in contravention of the Workplace Relations Act, and the potential exposure of the Commonwealth, and all taxpayers, to substantial damages;
(4)	 the collusion between the Government and Patrick Stevedoring in, and Government encouragement and foreknowledge of, a scheme to sack Patrick's workforce and replace it with an alternative workforce; and
(5)	 undermining the employment security of all Australian workers through the use of aggressive tactics involved in the strategy adopted on the waterfront.
Where is Danny Sankey now that we really need him? Where is a person prepared to take a legal case to protect the rights of ordinary Australians, to deal with a conspiracy that has been organised and coordinated out of this government to deny Australian citizens their lawful rights? Where is a person going to emerge to hold to book this government for its paranoid, near-Nixonian behaviour in this area? What the document that we tabled today reveals is this: it completes the cycles of documents. It is the one to which John Howard was responding in his letter to John Sharp of 21 April 1997 and in which he said:
I support the interventionist strategy you have outlined, and it is the forerunner of the proposal that went to cabinet on 7 July. Significant passages are the same in both documents.
When you read through this document, you will understand that it is not an options document; it is a document headed in one direction. Any mention of alternative options is there simply to dismiss them, and dismiss them in detail. The object of this document is to arrange a set of circumstances, to put in place a team, to set down a set of principles, to organise an industrial dispute on the waterfront and to put a shade over that industrial dispute to ensure that it occurs at a point in time when it is seen as tactically most convenient for the government.
As you read through the document there is one thing missing from it: that is, any conception of the national interest, any conception of the needs of the Australian people, any conception of what ought to be done about waterfront reform. Indeed, when it dismisses the so-called evolutionary approach, the basis of its dismissal lies largely not in the view that that approach would fail—how could it, because the evolutionary approach had been succeeding repeatedly when used?—but that there was a risk that it would be operated on a basis or would occur in circumstances that were not to the government's political needs or liking. That is all. This is a document about the political interests of the Liberal Party. It is a document about the ideology of the Liberal Party. It is a document about the paranoia of this government about a set of Australian workers. It is a classic Nixon document aimed at the destruction of people they consider as enemies, not people whom the public consider as enemies.
It is a document which is a link in a chain of one of the most massive abuses of power any minister or government has engaged in in this country—a massive abuse of power at the taxpayers' expense. Let me quote from a number of elements of this document. Let me go to the pros and cons of the so-called two approaches in this document, which states:
The interventionist approach is undoubtedly the only strategy that holds out the prospect of achieving the proposed objectives in this term of parliament. Major change is unlikely to occur under an 
 evolutionary approach for a number of years. The interventionist approach undoubtedly entails substantial risks and would inevitably involve a major waterfront stoppage in which the government will be actively involved and which will in the short term impose a high economic cost. Our opponents will attack us for the cost of this dispute and will attribute our conduct to an ideological hatred of the MUA and the union movement.
How surprising! It continues:
There is no doubt that if the government decides to go down this track, it would be imperative to achieve as swift a victory as possible. It needs to be appreciated this strategy leaves us, to some extent, in the hands of the existing stevedoring companies. There is always a risk that they will cave in and/or make tactical errors. These risks would have to be managed. The MUA will try and protect its position of power while minimising its vulnerability to legal action. The courts and the AIRC cannot always be relied upon to act in a decisive and timely manner against the union.
That was about the one perceptive part of this document. Indeed, that is what they did.
What you see when you go through the rest of this document is a statement that says, `These outfits involved in it may be weak; therefore, we have to put in place the mechanisms that will underpin a position that both convinces them that the government will be wilful in this regard and will take the lead as far as they are concerned.' This document goes on to talk about how you organise it. The document has a section in it called `Triggers', which shows how you get your industrial dispute. It reads:
The use of a maritime issue would make it easier to sack stevedores for striking over an issue which was not directly relevant to their own employment. . . There are three maritime and shipping issues which could cause a strike: the sale or wind-up of ANL, the abolition of cabotage and the award simplification process, including the abolition of the seaman's engagement system. Of the three, cabotage has been cleverly manipulated by the MUA using ships of shame and the spectre of oil on the beaches, while the importance of abolishing the SES would be an obscure issue to the general public. The sale of ANL is a clearer issue and would be readily understood by the public, especially as the MUA has already prevented the previous government from doing it—
so they say. It goes on:
There is some doubt that the sale of ANL by itself would be sufficient to bring the stevedores out on 
 strike. However, it may be possible to combine ANL with one or two other issues and to keep the debate focused on the sale of ANL.
This is a truly extraordinary document, this conspiracy document. It goes on to examine further opportunities for putting in place triggers, and says this:
Further work will need to be undertaken on possible triggers. In the meantime, no action should be taken that will neutralise any such possible triggers. In terms of timing, it is important not to engage the MUA until both stevedoring firms are in a position to commence restarting operations without the existing work force. On current indications, that is unlikely to be before September or October this year, though planning should proceed as quickly as possible to deal with any industrial action in the meantime. We will need to engage in extensive planning on how to manage a dispute. This includes investigating all legal avenues as well as other action necessary to keep the waterfront operating.
What you then do is go out and argue public relations; who are the people that you ought to involve in all of this? They go on to say, for example, in getting the propaganda together:
In this regard, some of the work being undertaken or planned by the Productivity Commission—
this is to encourage third party individuals to come out in support of themselves—
could be brought forward and refocused for the use of these groups.
Recollect the use of the Productivity Commission. Are we now expected to believe, in relation to that work being brought forward, that it was conducted on a basis of full and open disclosure and honest intent? Are we to believe that, when it was part of a strategy ticked off by Prime Minister Howard to put in place a process whereby a cloud of lies could be put around a strategy aimed at sacking illegally Australian workers for the simple reason that they belonged to a union?
What an utterly dishonourable position to have placed the Productivity Commission in. We wonder how knowing of it they were. Or was it simply an assumption that they could be relied upon to put highly biased accounts down of what was going on on the waterfront? Whatever else there is here, you have compromised the Productivity Commission.
—You are surprised they would find a lack of productivity; and you reckon there is a conspiracy. You must be joking!
—And you have put this position in place, Mr Minister. You are responsible for it. They go on to recommend to ministers:
Ministers' comments in public can afford to be far more restrained and reasonable.
—They failed that test.
—No, actually they were.
—Not him!
—No, you will recollect that they had nothing to do with any of this. Would they sack Australian workers? `No,' said the Prime Minister, `we do not have anything like that on our plate. We would not contemplate that for a minute. We would not do anything like that.' Then we had Mr Reith out there saying, `I am sitting down with the waterside workers. I am having a chat to them. I am here as an open-minded fellow. We are very happy to hear what they are prepared to do. We are going to put positions to them with integrity.'
A key part of this interventionist strategy is that the MUA should be caught by surprise. Then it goes to this—one of the most deceitful and mendacious sentences in it:
To this end, it would be quite appropriate to keep the unions wondering whether the government would settle for an evolutionary approach.
Then we get the Prime Minister coming out and saying, `The only reason we have this dispute now before us is that the workers have rejected a whole set of reasonable propositions from Patrick and a whole set of reasonable propositions from us, and will not sit down and talk to us.' But at the very beginning of this trouble, before those negotiations took place and the enterprise agreements resulted in the latter part of this year, the government was telling Patrick and everybody else, `String them along until we have in place the position that we want to set them up in.'
We had the Prime Minister saying on 13 February this year—almost a year after this document was produced:
We don't seek a huge national barney with the MUA over this. We never have. . . . But it would be preferable for any major dispute to be one which the government has planned in accordance with its own timetable.
When you go through all of those statements by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), what possible confidence can any Australian have in anything they say to them? In particular, what possible confidence can they have when there has been a point of disagreement with objectives by the government at any particular point of time, be it with ACOSS, on where you might intend to take a tax policy, or be it in regard to the Business Council and where you might intend to take industrial relations?
What this public now knows about this government is that, whenever they sit down with the waterfront unions, there is a high likelihood of a sub-agenda that is utterly deceitful and driven by Liberal Party prejudice. Their sub-agenda is ideologically driven by the bitterness of 13 years in opposition during which they sat like Rip Van Winkles as Australia passed them by. This is their desperate effort to take Australia back to being the divided, disunited community that it was when they were last in office. This is what everybody can anticipate from this government. This is the basis on which this government has engaged Australians in the past.
Then there are the minister's statements in which he said, `Oh, no, we haven't spent any money on this. No, there's a few consultants out there. In so far as there are consultants, we have spent money on their consultancies. But all that bunch is doing is firing up options to us. They're presenting the facts to us. They're talking to us about the awful occupational health and safety problems of the waterfront. That's what we're spending the money on—not on anything else. No, we haven't spent a cent of money on planning an industrial dispute. We don't know that there are industrial disputes out there. We haven't spent any money on engaging in any planning at all. Others might be planning, but we aren't. We have no part of that. That is not 
 us.' Then, when we pick up this document, what do we read? It says:
There will need to be a small team of people to undertake the necessary planning and activities. Some of these people could be full time with others working initially on a part-time basis, but to be made full time if required. The skills would need to include a strategic thinker with IR experience, a good lawyer, basic research intelligence, law and order, public relations, business liaison and a person with practical experience. Security will be critical with information shared on a need-to-know basis. There will have to be close liaison with major stevedoring companies throughout the process. Finally, the situation will need to be kept constantly under review with scope to alter the strategy if circumstances change. In particular, there will need to be constant monitoring of the commitment of the key parties and the actions of the MUA.
They need the John Deans for legal work, the Chuck Colsons for the dirty tricks and the Gordon Liddys for the break-in capacity—people to keep these folk under surveillance. Can you think of a more un-Australian approach to public affairs? We pride ourselves on a sense of democracy and openness in relationships between the elected governing representatives and the people who put them there—all the people who put them there, whether those people happen to have voted for the representatives or not. That is what is reasonably anticipated by the Australian public, and that is what they have not got from this government.
This has been an extraordinary episode. The minister is attempting to clothe himself with his last fig leaf. In defeating him utterly, the waterfront unions have signed up to a best endeavours effort to achieve his targets. But what paltry targets. Most of the targets were being achieved anyway. In a couple of ports they were not, and they have now signed up to best endeavours. Let me tell you this: there is not a single darn thing that has been achieved that could not have achieved by the so-called evolutionary approach. Indeed, there is nothing in this document to suggest otherwise—nothing at all. What did we get when we were in office? We got a 75 per cent improvement in crane rates.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—The member for Melbourne will remain silent.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—I warn the member for Melbourne.
—We got world best practice on the movement of bulk cargo, which just happens to be 60 per cent of our exports. More than 4,000 stevedores exited the waterfront. Compare that to the few hundred who are leaving now. Compare that to the improvement in crane rates at a couple of ports if best endeavours of 20 to 25 per cent are achieved. And that is it. That is what has been achieved. The government are trying to dress it up by a few other mechanisms. They say that the waterfront workers have settled for an annualised income. The waterfront workers put a proposal on the table on day one that they would settle for that. They have settled for an annualised income. They said they put that proposal on the table on day one of the negotiations. The government have settled for 400 watersiders leaving the waterfront. The waterfront workers' opening position was 200.
What have we had since this government put its creepy hands all over this? That word `creepy' is used advisedly in this regard. It relates to the committee for re-election of the president. What they managed to achieve was what could have been achieved before they even started negotiating. Half of what was achieved was put on the table as an ambit claim by the waterfront unions before negotiations began. Really! The minister has clothed himself in some heroic position in his desperate efforts to find some joy in the misery he has inflicted on himself—the same misery he has inflicted on everyone else. All he has emerged with are false claims and utter dishonesty.
Here we have it: Watergate, the Gordon Liddys, the E. Howard Hunts, the John Deans and the many party room deep throats grassing to his enemies and leaking nightly to the press in the faint hope of snatching some honour from the noisome episode which has enmeshed you and enmeshed your Prime Minister as they seek to have a piece of his carcass before he goes on the way out. This Prime Minister cannot be trusted. This 
 minister cannot be and is not trusted by anybody in the Australian community. This is an episode of infamy in the history of the politics of this nation, not just in the industrial relations history of this nation. This is an episode that puts massive discredit on the governing process and makes our people insecure. That is what it does. Prime Minister, you should be censured for it, you hopeless case.

—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,16,1,speech
"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—The government rejects this vacuous motion from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The Leader of the Opposition has moved this motion after the dispute has been settled because he has had a very bad day. He has had a bad day because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday was able to secure the passage of the government's native title amendment legislation.
When the rest of Australia has appreciated that the waterfront dispute has been settled for a couple of weeks now, why is it that the opposition today come in and ask questions about it? We who have been around politics long enough know that, when you are having a bad day, you set up a distraction. This is a distraction for the opposition which have for months been hoping to stir social division on the question of Wik and which are now disappointed by the fact that the Prime Minister has secured an honourable compromise and, therefore, the passage of that legislation.
Rather than the Prime Minister being the subject of a censure motion, I think the Australian community today will be congratulating and applauding him for his leadership in achieving a tremendous breakthrough on what has really been a difficult and long-running issue for the Australian community. I congratulate the PM on a job well done. He has applied the authority of his office to achieve an outcome which is good for farmers and for miners—which means that it will be good for investment and for jobs—which is fair to indigenous Australians in the treatment 
 of their rights and which provides a system where people are treated equally. That is a huge step forward on the Wik issue and it is largely due to the authority and the negotiating skills of the Prime Minister.
So the first thing to be said about this censure motion is that it is just a distraction. It is these sorts of political games that politicians, particularly those in opposition, play that attract people to vote for people like Pauline Hanson. The public see through these silly games and it only puts them off the major political parties.
The second reason why the opposition have gone on the attack on this issue is that they are embarrassed at the government's success on waterfront reform. As an indication of that, the Leader of the Opposition said, `There will be a reduction of only 400 in the manning levels of Patrick.' That, of course, is not true. The expected redundancies, as agreed between Patrick and the MUA, are about 743. That is the agreed number. That number will come down in net terms because some people will pick up jobs with the national firm which will end up with the contracting-out maintenance job. There might be 80 people in that, so the 743 will come down to 650 or a figure of that order.
The figure is important because it demonstrates that you can run the Patrick organisation with half the people you had at the start of the dispute. That demonstrates in turn that we have had massive overmanning in this organisation, which is the point that we have made all along. The details of the agreement show that this operation can be run much more efficiently—and that is a benefit which is then passed on to consumers and to producers alike. For example, in the agreement there is an agreement to abolish what are known as double-headers. Double-headers is the infamous rort whereby people are paid double time and a half and can, therefore, earn incomes up to $90,000 and more a year.
Prior to the start of this dispute, you could be a crane driver and earn $90,000 a year for sitting on the crane 14 hours a week. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that those days are over. They are over because the agreement contains a requirement that 
 there be one man per machine—one man, one machine. That is commonplace in every other industry in Australia, except on the Australian waterfront. So it is the end of a crane driver working 14 hours a week for $90,000. That is no more.
One of the other problems was that, because they had twice as many people than they needed to run the operation, a lot of people would say, `I might as well be paid for sitting at home because there is no job for me here to do.' So, instead of having one person per machine, you would have two people per machine and what would the other one do? They used to nick off. That is why they call it the nick off. They go home and still get paid—and, if they were on a double-header, they would be getting paid double time and a half. It is a pretty good deal. The Labor Party said, `We fixed it all.' What a complete nonsense. We have abolished the nick. We have abolished double-headers. We have imposed one man, one machine. That is a revolution on the Australian waterfront.
—They've all nicked off now.
—The opposition have all nicked off now, exactly; they cannot help themselves. From the government's perspective, in the reform agenda, I do not mind saying that we did not get absolutely everything we wanted. So what? That's life. You do not always get what you want. But I will tell you that we have the biggest set of reforms now about to be put in place on the Australian waterfront since containerisation started in 1969. As far as the freedom of association provisions are concerned, the union has acknowledged that in the agreement. It is actually in writing in the agreement with Patrick.
Secondly, we do have contracting out. Anybody with real experience and understanding of what happens in industrial relations would know that it is the case that contracting out breaks down the position of a monopoly or a closed shop. So legally it is broken and, I think, also technically it is broken in the sense that those people who have been in the MUA who end up in mainte 
 nance will end up in the AMWU anyway, so that is technically a breach of the union shop.
Thirdly, I think the changes are significant because the union will never be what it once was. Part of that is because a lot of the older members of the union are going to retire, including the leadership of it, and also because they have now got half the members. They have spent a lot of their stockpile on legal fees and in future they will have half the income coming in off the subscriptions. They will not, therefore, be in a position to exercise the industrial muscle which they have used in the past to maintain, or some times to grab back, their perks.
One of the ironies of this dispute is that, whilst the union has been bucking and reluctant to undertake any change, in the end it is going to sign an agreement which is under our legislation—the Workplace Relations Act. Under our law, which they will have to abide by like everybody else—which is a change for the MUA—once you have entered into an agreement, you are not to take industrial action during the life of that agreement. That is another curtailment on this union, which in the past has had the record of having taken on average nine times the level of industrial action compared with the national average, which is one reason why we have had such poor levels of productivity on the Australian waterfront. They are far too often not at work, far too often on the nick, far too often taking strike action. That is much more difficult now for them to do.
It has been an incredible achievement and it will go down as one of the significant micro-economic reform achievements of this government. I do not mind saying it has been a bruising, battling, difficult dispute, and that is the way of the MUA. The MUA is the successor union, amongst others, to the painters and dockers—and they are a pretty tough crowd to deal with. You have to be prepared to be pretty tough in dealing with them. We as a government always had an expectation that they would take national industrial action against an incoming coalition government—and we were not the only ones to have that expectation. Therefore, when we came into office we had a national responsi 
 bility to make sure that we were prepared for any dispute that they might want to pull—and we make no apology for that. If you elect a national government, part of their responsibility is to ensure that, if there is an argument, the ports are kept open and business and jobs are not lost as a result.
Why would the Labor Party be surprised at that? They faced exactly the same thing when they were in office. They are full of these conspiratorial claims. I thought Pauline Hanson was the only one full of conspiracies. Conspiracies are catching on in the national parliament, the whole front bench of the Labor Party have got conspiracies coming out of their ears. The Leader of the Opposition today said it was basically part of the government's plot to ask the Productivity Commission to give a report on productivity levels on the waterfront—`If you ask them, part of the conspiracy is that they will tell you how bad the waterfront is.' This is pathetic from a leader of an opposition; what a pathetic claim to make. Of course we had a productivity problem on the Australian waterfront. In a sense, you do not need a Productivity Commission to tell you, but it is sensible to get independent, authoritative advice on the state of the problem so that, as you address the problems, you are fixing the things that need to be fixed. Is that a conspiracy? I do not think it is.
You talk about conspiracies. Back in 1991 the then Labor government, according to a senior member of the Labor Party then, actually considered a range of options which included using the armed services to man the wharves. They are accusing us of conspiracy! The federal cabinet, when Labor was in office in 1991, were actually having a discussion about bringing on the troops. I have had plenty of letters from people saying, `Why don't you put in the troops?' but this government never had a cabinet discussion saying to the Minister for Defence, `When can you get regiment No. 1 down to the wharves?' That is laughable. And in 1994, when they were trying to sell off ANL, there was a national strike. What did the Labor Party do? They got some advice—what a conspiracy that is. What was the advice they got? The advice they got 
 included cancelling the MUA's awards and agreements.
—So what!
—I am glad he says, `So what!' It is good that you say that because since these documents were revealed we have had confirmation from Labor frontbenchers that you actually had a subcommittee, exactly the same way that we did, and you considered some of exactly the same issues. Why would we be surprised in the end about that? Because, in the pilots dispute, you cancelled their awards, you brought in foreign workers, you forced people onto individual agreements, you deregistered the union and you brought in the troops—you brought in the air force—to fix a union dispute. What incredible hypocrisy!
This document that the Labor Party have brought in today is dated April. A few weeks ago we had a cabinet document dated July. This predates the July document, so there is hardly anything new in it. The interesting thing is that I asked how many questions the Labor Party had asked me on the waterfront up until the date they dropped that document. Do you know how many they had asked through what they say is the greatest betrayal since—
Government members interjecting—
—Record all interjections! Yes, it was the greatest dispute since time immemorial, the greatest betrayal, the greatest this, the greatest that. How many questions were there? Six questions. Today I get three questions—three questions in one day. What a bonanza! This is giving me a chance to finish off on a high. Thank you very much. The fact is that there have been discussions about alternative labour supplies in the event of a national strike on the Australian waterfront for as long as anybody can remember. I remember that, when I was first a minister, the then member for Gilmore told me that P&O had a plan to bring in foreign workers. Was this a conspiracy, a secret plan, to break the law? No, it was not. Why wasn't it? Because it was being publicly talked about. In August 1997, it was reported:
Richard Hind, the Managing Director of P&O Australia, one of the two major stevedoring firms 
 operating Australian wharves confirmed yesterday a plan to use foreign crane drivers had been drawn up for some time but declined to give details. `It is always an option. We would have to bring in another work force with some expertise.'
—What a big secret!
—What a big secret and big breach of the law. And the Labor Party is in here today saying this is a conspiracy. You ought to take a redundancy package with the MUA. This is a truly pathetic operation.
—And a cover-up.
—And a cover-up as well! This government has had the guts to do something about an issue that for years needed to have something done about it. When Labor was in, in the end they always just caved in. They say, `Oh, we had the same advice but we didn't do anything about it.' That was the problem for 13 years. The fact is that the union ran rings around you. You were a disgrace. The Labor Party were bought off by the MUA, because they had been making donations to the Labor Party for years, so that they could nick off and so people could go on enjoying double-headers. We reject this censure motion. It is one of the most pathetic censure motions ever moved in the national parliament. The shadow minister ought to get up and explain why he has been opposed to reform. We reject it out of hand. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,16,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—We now have the smoking gun. The final piece of the puzzle is in place. We have now got the precise details of everything that has gone on in this whole disgraceful episode over the past 18 months—everything that this government has been involved in, everything that it has had to do with orchestrating the dismissal of 2,000 Australian workers.
I ask you to think back a bit and think of all the light and colour there has been in all this dispute. Think of all the things that have occurred. We have had the Dubai episode, the dogs and the batons and the goons on the waterfront and all those things. Just think about the fact that this document that we have revealed today was actually created in April 1997, long before any of the high-profile spectacular events occurred. What this docu 
 ment reveals is that the origins of the events of April 1998 go back at least as far as April 1997. What it shows is that this government got advice, that it approved the interventionist strategy that was contained in that advice and that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was directly involved in organising this exercise. He wrote to the minister for transport at the time, Mr Sharp—another expert on the nick—and said, `This is approved. The interventionist strategy is approved.'
What I ask you to do is to compare what was in that document, the nature of the strategy that was approved, with what actually happened. Take a step back from all of the high-profile events, all of the exciting things that have occurred, all the things that have been great TV and great media coverage, outrageous events though they may be, and compare what happened with what is in the document.
Let us have a look at what the Prime Minister approved. He approved a strategy that says, `We will deliberately provoke a massive dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia at a time and on an issue of our choosing. We will create the dispute and we will sublimate the interests of public policy on other issues, such as the sale of a major asset, ANL, to the need to create, to engineer, to manufacture, this dispute.' Then it says, `We will encourage and we will assist the stevedoring company involved to sack its entire work force, not on the basis of their individual characteristics or performance but sack every last man jack of them. We will create and orchestrate the dispute in order that they can do it. We will make sure that the MUA does not realise this is happening. We will lie to them. We will keep them strung along. We will make them think that, ""I am Peter Reith, I am the nice guy. Forget about John Sharp. I am the person you can deal with. I am realistic, I am practical,"" and we will string them along. But we are going to catch them by surprise.'
What they did was to create a small team, as they described it very disingenuously, of people including a strategic thinker, a lawyer and an intelligence person. I am not quite sure what that is a reference to but, nonetheless, 
 there is an intelligence person there. This small team would be funded to the tune of $2 million, courtesy of the approval of the Prime Minister, and it would engage in detailed planning and implementation of this strategy. I ask you to think about some of the quotes from this document, which today we have seen the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) deal with so dismissively. I quote:
The most likely scenario would involve using an element of the Government's maritime reform agenda, eg ANL, or an event arising out of the application of the Workplace Relations Act, to bring about a national stoppage.
To bring about a national stoppage—not to respond to a national stoppage but to bring about, to cause, to engender one. Then:
The stevedores would use this opportunity to sack their existing work force and restart their operations with a new non-union work force.
Then:
It would be preferable for any major dispute to be one for which the Government has planned in accordance with our timetable.
And:
We need to further develop plans to involve the MUA in a dispute on an issue and at a time of our choosing.
It is very straightforward. This government was planning, it was orchestrating, it was organising, a dispute. It was not planning how it might respond to a dispute; it was saying, `How can we create one? We want to create a cataclysmic dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia.' This was the minute of the conspiracy to do it. This document was formally approved within the Prime Minister's office. It was created in his office and he approved it as the basis for a plan to cause that dispute, to create that dispute, in order that 2,000 Australian workers could be sacked.
It is very clear from this document that this was all done for political reasons, for political payback and revenge against the Maritime Union. The so-called evolutionary strategy, the alternative to the interventionist strategy, is discussed. Why is it rejected? Because it would not produce results within this parliamentary term. What is that code for? `We 
 won't get any results before an election. We are under pressure from various sections of the business community to show that we are strong, that we are hairy-chested, on this issue; so we are not interested in negotiations, we are not interested in trying to work constructively and productively with the union, port users, shipping companies and the like because that will not give us any outcomes before the next election.' In other words, `We are prepared to create possibly the biggest dispute in recent Australian history, with all of the consequences that that entails, purely in order to ensure that we can go to the next election with a bit of a big bang showing that we have had a hairy chest on the waterfront. So it is all for political reasons. We turn to the next delightful quote, the surprise agenda:
A key part of the interventionist strategy is that the MUA should be caught by surprise. To this end it may be quite appropriate to keep the unions wondering whether the government would settle for an evolutionary approach.
In other words, deceit. That is what this is: deceit. It is simple, pure deceit—no more and no less. Do you remember the new Minister for Industrial Relations, as he then was, standing up and saying, `I am a reasonable person. I negotiate with everybody, I talk with everybody. I'll sit down and talk with John Coombs and Greg Combet for hours.' Then he complained that they walked out of one of those discussions. They knew what they were dealing with. They had every reason to walk out, because they were dealing with a snake, with someone who was not bona fide, somebody who was there to deliberately deceive them and to ensure that they were not dealing in an honest environment where people could actually put their cards on the table.
Think of some of the deceit that has been part of this overall pattern: the doorstop interview at Treasury Place that the minister did on 8 May where he said, `No-one to my knowledge had any knowledge of any plans, nor did anyone have any plans of which we were aware. The answer is no, absolutely not.'
He tries to obfuscate over this and suggest that this was a question about the Dubai exercise. It was not. This was in answer to a question, `What did you know about Patrick's 
 plans to sack its entire work force?' Straightforward. That is what the question was. His answer: `Didn't know a thing.' Yet what we see in this document, which he knew of, which his name is on, which the Prime Minister approved, is a quote that says:
Patrick's have: `embarked on planning for a major dispute during which they would sack their work force and recommence operations using alternative labour'.
What does that tell us? Is there any possible way that those two statements can be reconciled? The answer is no; the minister lied, he lied blatantly, he lied outrageously to the Australian people on 8 May.
—Order! The honourable member will withdraw that.
—It is a censure motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am allowed to say that.
—So it is. You are; you are right.
—Let us look at the Prime Minister's statements. He is not about getting the MUA: `We've never advocated attacking the union.' Yet this document says that they are planning to bring in a new non-union work force—not a work force where people have the right to choose, as they claim, but a new non-union work force.
Then there is the question of money. The minister says on 4 June this year, `Basically the funds that we've expended on this were about obtaining reports, consultancies'—which are an issue in themselves. `Basically they were only about consultancies; no big deal.' Yet he knew—and in fact he had reported to cabinet—that a small team had been created to implement their plan, and the Prime Minister had approved $2 million to fund that small team. That was substantially more than the $1.3 million that they had approved for consultancies. Yet he still tells this parliament, `Basically, the only money we have spent is on reports.' That is another absolute, outrageous lie. We go to 22 October last year: `We are prepared to sit with people and constructively talk. We'll listen to anybody.' Yet the document tells us what was really in his mind, which was: `We're going catch the MUA by surprise.' Again, another 
 lie to this parliament and another lie to the Australian people.
Their only defence in all of this—and it comes through time after time in response to every question and in every speech that is made—is that they are in favour of waterfront reform. We hear it ad infinitum—endless, gross exaggeration about how bad things have been and how good they are now. What does that tell you? It tells you that their defence to these accusations is that the end justifies the means. That is their only defence: the end justifies the means.
Think back to the events; think back to the cargo that has been held up, to the massive damage that was caused by the dispute, to the damage to the families of those workers as a result of the time they were unemployed, to the damage to the poor workers of P&C Stevedores, who were conned and led to believe they were going to be looked after by the government, Chris Corrigan and the NFF and who have now just been discarded.
They do not care about any of that because they say the end justifies the means—and it is all organised by the government. The whole tawdry, outrageous, disgraceful conspiracy is all organised by the government. This is something that Labor is alleged to have considered. His main defence was, `You actually had a committee talking about waterfront reform.' So what? Yes, Labor had a cabinet committee dealing with these issues and, yes, it did receive some form of advice which had some rather hair-raising propositions in it. But was the advice sought with respect to those specific proposals? No. Did the Labor minister say, `I want advice about how to sack thousands of workers?' No. That advice may have been given, but was it sought and was it acted on? No and no.
The key point in this whole issue—which I think, unfortunately, many commentators are missing because of the heat and light associated with Dubai, the dogs, the lies and all of those things—is: what was this government actually doing? What have been the actions of this government? What has it been doing? Not just its state of knowledge, not just whether this parliament has been lied to—these are all issues—but what has this govern 
 ment actually been doing? That is the critical issue.
The full enormity of this government's actions in this instance has not been properly acknowledged. We have a government that is conspiring to engineer, create and manufacture one of the biggest industrial disputes in Australia's history—not responding to it, not working out how to deal with it but conspiring to bring it on, to create it. To sack 2,000 Australian workers, it is creating an industrial dispute which could have been far greater in proportion and far greater in impact than it actually was, and that impact was substantial as it was. It has developed a strategy, it has funded it, it has prepared it and it has progressed it in secret—with taxpayers' money—and it has lied all the way through to the Australian people about what it is doing.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is supposed to resolve disputes. He is supposed to prevent disputes. He is supposed to ensure that people can go about their business. Here we have the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business conspiring to cause a dispute—orchestrating a dispute—and not just preparing for battle with a union, knowing that a dispute is going to happen, but actually saying, `We can create this issue as the basis for the dispute and we can cause the timing to be about this time. Here is how we will go about it: we will have a small team that will actually implement all of this.'
I do not think that many people have fully realised just how outrageous this proposition actually is. This government is completely beyond the pale. This document is the final piece of the jigsaw in this exercise. It shows we have a sneaky, mendacious, vicious government that is using all of the levers of power that it has been eyeing off for years. It has finally got its hands on them and it is now endeavouring to use all of the levers of power to get its enemies. This is about attacking a union that it has hated for many years. This government has hated the maritime union, and this whole exercise has been about abusing the power that elected government gives you in this country in order to get that union and its members.
As I say, I do not believe that people really fully understand how extreme this behaviour actually is. Yes, the dogs, the batons and all of those things are outrageous. Yes, the Dubai exercise was outrageous. But the really outrageous thing in this exercise is that you have a government of Australia that is deliberately conspiring to orchestrate a massive industrial dispute in order to sack 2,000 Australian workers.
As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, this has all the hallmarks of the Nixon White House: the paranoia, the law-breaking, the secrecy, the misuse of power; and it has even got a minister that looks like John Erlichman. It has got the whole lot all in one.
—And the cover-up.
—And, as the honourable member for Denison points out, the cover-up. This document reveals that this minister and this Prime Minister are unfit to hold public office. They stand condemned before this parliament for orchestrating, for creating, for manufacturing one of the most extraordinary industrial disputes that this country has seen. They stand condemned for that and they should retreat from public life in this country because they are not fit to hold public office.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,16,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—It is a matter of fact that when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) found that he no longer had the support of the voters of Swan he packed his bag and got Wendy Fatin to resign so that he could run down to the seat of Brand. But the seat of Brand adjoins the seat of Fremantle, held by Carmen Lawrence. As a result of this close geographic association, the Leader of the Opposition has caught the Lawrence disease: he has lost his memory. He has amnesia. He has forgotten what he and Bob Hawke did to the pilots. At the time they painted a picture of all these guys on $100,000 a year when 90 per cent of pilots in general aviation around Australia were lucky to get $30,000 a year. But they dealt with the lot of them. He has forgotten what plans his government had to deal with the waterfront, and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has advised him of that because all their documentation is now 
 down at the court. He has forgotten that his government actually spent—it was not a loan arrangement—$130 million trying to sort out the waterfront and he seems to have forgotten that the 4,000 jobs he said he got rid of all came back as casuals.
He has forgotten his unAustralian breach of promises on taxes after the 1993 election. Anybody who can stand up in this place and claim one iota of credibility after those actions in 1993 is a hypocrite of the highest order. He has forgotten that it was his party in government that introduced competition policy and bludgeoned the state Premiers into implementing it. His colleagues run around here day after day as though we invented and implemented it.
—What?
—Beazley's amnesia. He can't remember that. He has forgotten his and his government's actions when they introduced progressive and massive tariff reductions. Why did they do that? They did it because they did not have the guts to front industrial relations reform up-front, so they put the workers out of work and bludgeoned them into accepting their form of workplace agreements. That was their tactic and they have forgotten. If not, they are lying by their interjection.
You reduced the tariffs, you caused all the job losses and you knew what you were up to. He has forgotten that he sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and spent the money. I think he has even forgotten that he and his government borrowed $75,000 million using the kids of Australia as security and nearly destroyed the Australian economy.
—What about the waterfront?
—I'll tell you about the waterfront. You have the most selective memory in the country when you come in here and pontificate and carry on. We know what you did. We saw you do it to the pilots, we saw you do it to the workers through tariffs, and you did it deliberately.
They say, `What about the waterfront?' Let us get down to the fundamentals of the Patrick dispute. At mass meetings around Australia, hundreds and hundreds of MUA 
 members met and decided—surprise, surprise!—that about two-thirds of their numbers could continue to deliver the services of Patrick Stevedores, and quicker. That is what they decided. You can conclude from that that all the time they knew that their operation was grossly overmanned. What else did they know about that? They knew that in that process they were killing off the jobs of other Australians. They thought that, through their stranglehold on such a sensitive part of the Australian economy, they had a prior right to big dollars and job security at a cost to other people who were unemployed. They thought that they had a right to $90,000 a year and 14 hours of work a week, adding to the cost of working women when they went shopping. That is what they did. They thought that they had a right to gain economic rent from people who were trying to export from this country. The Leader of the Opposition tells us that they fixed the bulk ports. The NFF and the Wheat Board fixed the bulk ports and you never had a hand in it.
—This is just gobbledegook.
—It's gobbledegook, is it? All right. Let me remind you of what I just said: the members of the MUA did not get up one after another and say, `We can't manage, this will be a disaster.' They all put their hands up; they all voted that two-thirds of their number could continue all the services that were previously supplied by 100 per cent of their work force and, what is more, they agreed to lift the crane rate. That is what they voted for. You cannot deny that. That is not gobbledegook. You are just demonstrating your embarrassment. Your own MUA members have admitted that they have been conning the Australian community. That has been the outcome.
—You're against economic rationalism.
—There we go. The fundamental facts proven by the vote of the MUA workers are that the Australian waterfront was grossly overmanned and that was building through the cost structure not only in waterfront charges but also in freight rates. The highly expensive ships of today were being 
 delayed in the ports and ship owners were putting up their freight rates. What must necessarily arise from that? The first question in those circumstances was: was it appropriate for a government to intervene? The answer must be yes. Those people who were shopping at K Mart and those who were unemployed were relying on the government to address this outrage.
The second question in those circumstances was: how might I address this in the known circumstances of the behaviour of the MUA? I am not talking about some mystical supposition; I am talking about hardcore history. Let me give you a simple example of unAustralianism. The Western Australian government let a tender to a new entrant in the Fremantle waterfront. The man had the capacity to unload state ships and they gave him the contract. God almighty—it was about one ship a fortnight! And because he would not guarantee the employment of MUA workers, the MUA closed down Australia. They did not just close down the Port of Fremantle or the Port of Kwinana; they closed down Australia. And you are arguing that a government seeking to redress a wrong on the Australian people should have come out and said, `John Coombs, come to our meetings. We are going to talk about how we are going to change the structure on the waterfront.' I have given you an example of how they operated.
Your government had the temerity to say, and I might say it almost in a whisper, `I think we should sell the Australian National Line.' And what was the response of the MUA? They closed down Australia—nothing moved. We have had the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) saying that we have just had the worst set of industrial action in the world. It was the worst for the MUA, but ships were being loaded and unloaded every day of that dispute. That was not the case in your time. When you guys tried to do anything on the waterfront other than throw buckets of money at them, they closed Australia down—and you are trying to tell this parliament that a responsible government should not have met in secrecy to decide how they were going to deal with that matter.
—So they did meet in secret?
—Of course they did, and I am saying that it would be damned stupid if they did not. They had to—and you did when you discussed these matters.
—They deny it.
—No, they do not deny it. They have denied one thing. They have denied that they had any direct knowledge of the Dubai arrangements—and what a farce that is on your behalf.
—You just said they met in secret.
—Of course they met in secret, and the secrecy would have continued if you blokes had not been around stealing cabinet documents.
—I think the two members might desist their dialogue.
—You are a mob of thieves.
—I suggest the honourable member for O'Connor might direct his remarks through the chair.
—You stole cabinet documents.
—No-one has done that.
—But, anyhow, we have yours in the courts now, and you tell us they are different. When our party gets advice from the bureaucracy, you invariably tell this House that that is our policy. When you get advice from the bureaucracy, you say, `Oh, no, that was only advice from the bureaucracy. That was only an options paper.' What a load of garbage! It is an options paper for the Liberal Party if it is written by a public servant, and it is an options paper for the Labor Party. If it is not, it is policy for you and it is policy for us.
But do not bring this garbage in here where you fellows want to rewrite history, as you have on competition policy, on tariffs and on privatisation. You have done all that. You have rewritten history. But you have a problem: everything in this place is a matter of 
 record, and let me remind you that I have not forgotten anything you did in those 13 years. My memory will never be changed on all this. So what did the government do? The government put a strategy in place to ensure the people of Australia were protected from these arrangements. It is said to us that that was a strategy to sack people because they were in a union. No; it was a strategy to replace bludgers with a group of people who would do a bit of work.
Why oh why, in the context of Australia, would it ever be that any employer seeking to give people some job training would have to contemplate sending them to another country? Webb Dock proved to us why you had to do it. When you people stopped that process—or, in other words, when you called upon the international unions as you did when you called upon them to refuse to load good Australian freight in America—what did you do? You had pickets at the front of Webb Dock and you had pickets wherever else you could. You abused those people in the most outrageous way when they just wanted to be trained to get a job.
—What did you do? You put the dogs in.
—The member for Cunningham will remain silent!
—You know why they had dogs there? They had dogs there to protect themselves.
—The member for O'Connor will direct his remarks through the chair.
—They had dogs there to protect themselves from the members of the painters and dockers. Tell me why the minister had to have two guards follow his wife around? Tell me why the federal minister in this process had to have the Federal Police protect him other than that some of your union members would have shot him if they could have got the chance? Why did they have dogs? They had dogs to protect themselves from the sorts of capers that went on. That is a fact, and it is proven by their activities.
—Put a poodle in there, not a rottweiler.
—I challenge you to cancel your union membership and go down to the port and try to drive a crane, and see if people do not start chucking rocks through your house window. I challenge you to do it. You know the sort of response you would get, and you know why it was considered necessary to have guards inside the premises—to save the property. That is the reality, and do not give me that sort of garbage that people were not going to get punched up.
—I suggest that the member for O'Connor might direct his remarks to the motion before the chair and ignore the member for Cunningham.
—Mr Speaker, you might like to tell me, from your long experience in this place, how difficult it has been for a government to `negotiate' and have an `evolutionary process' with the MUA. You boast of a victory. There have been no victories for the workers in the MUA. There have been no victories for the people in all of this. The only victory has been for John Coombs. He and his union bureaucrats still have jobs. John still has his first-class trip to England for the International Transport Federation meeting which—surprise, surprise—is on at the same time as Wimbledon. Did you ever go, Martin?
—John Howard went via the Lords Test.
—And you criticised it, but now you are trying to defend Coombs. Don't give me rubbish! If you want to stand over there and not be called a hypocrite, do not criticise people for things you do yourself. Don't do it. You do it too often. You set out to kill off Colston and you dragged your own people down and you dragged the reputation of this whole parliament down, and your leader was on again the other day talking about some pay rise for politicians. You have done a lot in opposition to destroy the reputation of yourselves and your colleagues and everyone else as individuals, and for what? For a little tiny bit of political gain. You are dreadful people in the way that you behave. (Time expired)
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Mr Beazley's ) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,16,1,speech
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-07-02,"—For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 4 December 1997, the date of the last schedule, and 1 July 1988. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and will be incorporated in Hansard .
The schedule read as follows—
THE SPEAKER'S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE REPORTS
On 25 June 1998, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 4 December 1997. The Government had earlier in the Parliament affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented 

during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.
The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.
The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 4 December 1997. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.
The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—by leave—Mr Speaker, 
 this is a statement in which you will have considerable personal interest. It gives me great pleasure today to table the report of the Constitutional Convention held in February this year. The convention was a unique moment in Australian history. Over the two weeks of the convention 152 Australians came together to discuss the future of our country. All had Australia's best interests at heart. All were concerned to progress the debate on whether or not we should become a republic.
The report includes comments by the Chairman of the convention, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, and the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor, Barry Jones, who both take an opportunity in the report to reflect on the contribution of those who participated and on the emotion of the occasion. Both comment that the convention demonstrated our inherent national unity despite the wide range of views expressed. This is a view with which I wholeheartedly agree.
The experience of the convention gave me a great deal of confidence in the capacity of the Australian people to play an active part in the evolution of our democratic institutions. The debate was spirited but for the most part conducted with respect and goodwill. I have great confidence that the forthcoming referendum will be held in an environment of healthy and constructive debate.
This full record of the events of the fortnight of the convention will provide an invaluable resource for anyone interested in debate about our system of government. The report is available on the convention web site. Copies will be sent to municipal and university libraries and will be available for purchase at government bookshops. All the convention delegates will receive a copy.
At the time of the convention, people all over the country gave more than a passing thought to our constitution and what change might mean. While the debates were widely reported in the media at the time, it is well worth casting an eye back over the transcripts in volumes 3 and 4 of the report. The words on paper can still evoke the passion and commitment that delegates brought to their arguments for and against change.
Clearly, the next steps are important. In line with a resolution of the Constitutional Convention, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has written to the state Premiers, the territory Chief Ministers, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to seek their assistance in developing the referendum proposal. The referendum will be our opportunity to make a choice between the model supported at the convention and the system we currently have. I am sure there will be further robust public debate as the time to cast a vote draws nearer.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report of the Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,1,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—by leave—I join the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in welcoming the report of the Constitutional Convention on behalf of the opposition. The convention was a great display of the nation we are and the nation we hope to become. Through the diversity and commitment of the delegates attending, the convention illustrated the strength of Australia's multicultural achievement, the interest of young people in our constitutional future, and the needs and concerns of indigenous Australians.
The general public's interest in the convention emphasised the necessity to address the questions of who we are and the type of constitutional change needed to reflect the Australian situation at the end of the second millennium. Central to the proposition, of course, is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic and the form that republic takes.
There is a need for leadership in this debate. Anyone who is familiar with Australian constitutional history is familiar with the fact that, unless political leadership is given across a wide spectrum, Australians are reluctant to change their constitution. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been reluctant to take a lead with this agenda but we did end up with a Constitutional Convention, albeit with only half of its members elected. The Prime Minister should be congratulated for at least that much commitment to Australia's constitutional future.
The Constitutional Convention gave us direction on the question of constitutional change. It has clearly backed a model for constitutional change. It is up to us to respond 
 to the direction given by the convention. The Labor Party for some time has been committed to the ideal of an Australian republic. We support the model chosen by the convention and have committed ourselves to introducing the necessary legislation, followed by a referendum to put that model to the Australian people. It is the Australian people who, in the end, will decide if we become a republic and what form it takes. But it is our duty to give Australians this chance to decide and at the earliest time possible.
The Labor Party has stated its support for the outcome of the convention and welcomes the report of the convention. We have illustrated our commitment to the debate and have fully participated in it. We welcome the Attorney-General's confirmation that the coalition, if in government, will introduce the referendum proposal, but it should be sooner rather than later and clear leadership needs to be given on the question which will be put to the Australian people in that referendum. The Australian people deserve a choice and they deserve to be informed of the positions of the major political parties.
We urge the Prime Minister to commit his party to support the Constitutional Convention's proposed model. History has shown that ambivalence on behalf of the government of the day on these questions of constitutional change is equivalent to a negative stance. The convention has demonstrated the public's support for change and it is certain that the Australian Labor Party, if given the opportunity, will not take a backward step in supporting the decision of the Australian people to make that change.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report of the Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,1,speech
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—Over past days and weeks and months the One Nation Party of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has projected itself throughout this land as a new, democratic grassroots force in Australian politics. It has represented itself from one coast to the other, from north to south, as the saviour of the people, as a party that will enable ordinary Australians to have a say in their future.
From the revelations that have come out over the past few days and weeks from inside the One Party Nation itself, we can see that this is a gross misrepresentation and that the party is nothing but a sham. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) pointed out today, even when policies are released by the One Nation Party, those policies are based on incorrect and unfactual statements which in a sense are saying to the Australian people, `Believe one set of things; do not look too much into the detail.'
Leaving aside the fact that the policies espoused by this party will create not one nation but two, leaving aside that these policies seem to be motivated by an intolerance of some sections of the Australian community, leaving aside that, if allowed to govern with these policies, it would wreak economic havoc on this country and the many ordinary Australians who have rushed to support One Nation—leaving aside all of these very important matters, there is one issue that goes to the heart of One Nation at the present time, and that issue is this: who controls this political party? How is it funded? Or has it become the captive of one or 
 two individuals for their own selfish financial and personal motives?
These are questions which ordinary Australians deserve to have answered for them, and they deserve to have answered for them here and now today. Because the questions have been addressed in this place over the last few days and the last few weeks, and there is essentially one person who can answer these questions. They cannot be answered, for example, by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) or by any other Independent member or by a member of the Labor Party. Indeed, they cannot be answered on this side of the chamber. There is one indisputable, unavoidable fact about this matter, that is, one person and one person only can answer these questions, and they deserve to be answered.
This week a One Nation insider revealed that One Nation is not what many decent and ordinary Australians think it is. As we have read in the media over the last few weeks, Barbara Hazelton was a confidante, a friend and a personal secretary of the member for Oxley, yet she is only the latest in a long line of supporters and candidates of One Nation to walk away from this movement or, in many other cases, to be pushed out for failing to toe the line in the increasingly autocratic way in which it is done. In the Herald-Sun yesterday under the heading `Betrayal' pictures appeared of a few of those who have been disenchanted by One Nation or those who have been sacked. Barbara Hazelton, a confidante of the member for Oxley, resigned; Morrie Marsden, who has things to say about the member, was sacked; Bruce Whiteside, who started a supporters group, has been banished, told that he was no longer wanted, yet he was one of these people supporting the member for Oxley; David Thomas was sacked; even the biographer, Helen Dodd, was sacked and told to get out, presumably because something that she wanted to say did not fit into the scheme of those who are controlling One Nation. That is the central issue. And we all know about Mr Pasquarelli.
One Nation is being exposed increasingly around this nation as something of a puppet show, a particularly violent and undesirable 
 episode of Punch and Judy. Let us remember that Mrs Hazelton is not an operative of the Liberal Party or the Labor Party or the National Party; Mrs Hazelton was a close confidante and personal friend of the member for Oxley.
—She used to work for some of your mates.
—This is not someone, as the member at the table, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), knows, who started out taking a view that she is opposed to what One Nation stands for. I presume by the comments and the interjection made by the honourable member at the table that he is not defending the policies of One Nation either.
Let us hear what Mrs Hazelton herself said in this week's Australian. These words ought to be heard not just by all honourable members in this chamber and in the other place but also by all decent ordinary Australians. She said this:
What needs to be exposed is David Oldfield's One Nation. I dislike using harsh language about people—both to avoid seeming vengeful and because most people deserve the benefit of the doubt. But the danger facing One Nation is too serious to mince words. Oldfield is a manipulative, hypnotic, hugely narcissistic individual who has taken almost complete control of Pauline's life whether she realises it or not.
We have seen examples of that. Who can forget the memorable episode on television on the weekend where you had not simply the member for Oxley answering questions but also Mr Oldfield sitting beside her, crossing over and saying, `No, this is what we really think. Let us get it right.'
Could you imagine the situation in this country if the Leader of the Opposition or the Prime Minister or any minister or shadow minister—or any of us for that matter—went to a press conference and had a staff member sitting beside us saying, `No, that is the way in which you answer the question'? What would the media say if the Prime Minister of this country went to a media conference with his senior adviser and the answers were given not by the Prime Minister but by the senior adviser? What would we say about that? Yet that is precisely what happened.
—A ventriloquist.
—A ventriloquist; I fully accept that interjection. We saw in yesterday's media a press conference held in a highly manipulated fashion called at 1.30 in the afternoon. Everybody around here knows that there is question time at 2 o'clock and that the ladies and gentlemen of the media have to cover question time and that members themselves are expected to go to question time. We had a 15- or 20-minute speech allowing little time for any questioning about the policies that had been put forward.
But that was not the end of it. The honourable member for Oxley said to the ladies and gentlemen of the media—and I wonder what treatment we would get if any of us did this—`I am not going to answer questions that may be of some public importance that are taxing the minds of Australians at the present time. I am simply not going to answer any questions that have been raised about the corporate structure, the financing or any other arrangements so far as One Nation is concerned. Do not bother asking me about that. In fact, I will get angry if you ask me some questions which are legitimate questions about the democratic or otherwise nature of the party which bears my name.' These are examples showing that what Mrs Hazelton said in the Australian this week was true.
Barbara Hazelton says that there is widespread concern in One Nation about this manipulation of Pauline Hanson by David Oldfield, her adviser, and by the National Director of One Nation, David Ettridge. It would be easy to say in these circumstances that Mrs Hazelton is somebody who is just disaffected. She has left and we could simply say that this is what you would expect her to say in these circumstances. The member for Oxley might say, `It is sour grapes. She has left me. We have fallen out. You do not have to take any notice of Mrs Hazelton at all.'
But let us go to the actual charges that Mrs Hazelton makes. You cannot simply dismiss what this woman has said, having been a confidante of the member for Oxley and having been one of the key people in the One Nation Party, without directly answering the allegations and the charges that she has made. 
 Unless those allegations and charges in their specific detail are answered, then those questions remain unanswered; they remain questions which ought to burn large in the minds of Australians.
Mrs Hazelton charges that Pauline Hanson has so little control of One Nation that she is unable to obtain a membership list from David Ettridge. Imagine the Prime Minister of Australia not being able to obtain a membership list of the Liberal Party. Imagine the Deputy Prime Minister not being able to obtain a membership list of the National Party. Imagine Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, not being able to obtain a membership list of the National Party. Sometimes they fall off trucks and even we find them.
—It will be a bit hard to get a list for the National Party.
—Even in your case sometimes they fall off trucks and we get them. But membership lists exist.
—How do you get into the 500 Club?
—Even those membership lists, because people are proud to be members of the 500 Club, they really are. And more and more are joining, so don't worry. Those membership lists are available.
Imagine if it were said that the leader of a political party, even a member in a particular area, could not obtain a membership list. We even know that branches cannot speak to each other within One Nation. She charges that hundreds of people have contacted One Nation complaining about mismanagement by the head office in Manly. She gave an example of people who have joined their so-called 500 Club and have not received receipts some months later. She charges that Pauline Hanson has no control over the endorsement of candidates. She recounts how two South Australian One Nation candidates came all the way from South Australia to Canberra to seek assurance that they would not be disendorsed. Ms Hanson assured them that they would not be disendorsed; and less than two hours later they had been, by Mr Ettridge. Who has control? 
Mrs Hazelton charges that there is widespread concern among One Nation members about the quality of One Nation candidates for the federal election. She says the Queensland state director and others wanted to declare all positions vacant, readvertise and start again. One candidate, for example, sent a drawing of how Jesus looked when he appeared to him in 1969. She says this is not atypical of some of the people involved with this party. When Mrs Hazelton approached Ettridge to complain about this lack of quality of candidates, she received the comment, `Don't discourage them. We need the $250 registration fee from each one of them.'
She further charges that David Oldfield treats ordinary One Nation members with total contempt. He is dismissive of their policy ideas and, Mrs Hazelton says, he `can barely conceal his revulsion for the type of people who make up One Nation'. This is Mr Oldfield, the so-called adviser. She concluded her article saying:
It is painful to write these words and it is one of the saddest days of my life but people need to know that One Nation has been hijacked and that people are being hoodwinked if they think Hanson is in control.
People are being hoodwinked if they think that the member for Oxley is in control. These revelations have lifted the lid on the paranoid little secret society that is One Nation—David Oldfield's and David Ettridge's One Nation.
The assassination video that we would like to forget but remember from late last year in which the member for Oxley was recording her thoughts for the Australian people in the event that she was assassinated was the work of Mr Oldfield. It is something that you would associate with some wacky cult, not a democratic political party in Australia. But a democratic political party is not what it is. In this party, supposedly representing the grassroots of Australian society, branches of the party are forbidden to communicate with each other. David Ettridge `guards the membership list with his life', according to Mrs Hazelton, and uses expressions constantly such as, `He's not our friend.' This is truly paranoid stuff.
There is an issue of the funding which has been raised by my honourable colleague, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)—the $500,000 paid by way of public funding for the Queensland election. Where has it gone? Who controls it? Can it simply be spent by the directors of One Nation Limited? Because One Nation is not structured like a normal political party; it is set up as a corporation with three directors: Mrs Hanson, Mr Ettridge and Mr Oldfield. All the other members of the party, unlike in any other political parties, are only affiliate members with no rights at all.
As I said, we know that last week the biographer, Mrs Dodd, was escorted away by security guards on the orders of David Oldfield. She said:
What we are seeing is a power play in One Nation. Anyone who queries or questions any aspect of administration or the running of One Nation is told by Pauline's minders that it is none of their business. I had been warned by David Oldfield the previous week not to investigate the circumstance around a disendorsed candidate, as it was none of my business. I replied that, as an author, I must be free to talk to any person that I choose to, and probably David didn't like my stand.
If time allowed I could go on for another 15 or 20 minutes because the material on the record and the questions that are unanswered remain there. As I said, they can only be answered by one person.
We have Mr Oldfield talking about the honourable member for Oxley as `the product', and we have no doubt that when that product passes her use-by date she will be discarded. What we are looking at here is a sham. Ordinary Australians, people who are looking for answers in the problem times that we have in Australia, are being sadly deceived by One Nation. The truth is that One Nation is a sham and we ought to have an explanation from the member herself as to why these questions have not been answered.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I, unlike some on the other side of the House, come to this debate with clean hands. I say that because, unlike those on the other side of the House, when I go to the ballot in the next federal election in the federal seat of 
 Batman I will not be getting One Nation preferences. Let us have a real debate—a debate about the real issues before the House today.
I regard it as the height of hypocrisy for the coalition government to point the finger at the structure of the One Nation Party when this week they voted against proposals to force full disclosure of donations to political parties. Let us not just have a debate about the corporate structure of One Nation; let us also have a debate about full disclosure of donations to all political parties. I think it is about time that the Australian public was told the real story. The real story about One Nation is not about One Nation alone; the real story about One Nation is its fellow travellers—the fellow travellers on the other side of the House who have acted hand in glove to put repressive and unAustralian policies in place over the last 29 months. They have no conscience.
I think it is about time that we had a real debate; not just about the One Nation Party, but about the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the frontbench of the coalition government to lead. Let us have a real debate about the dog whistle campaign that has always been conducted by the Prime Minister. The campaign has not just been conducted since he occupied the chair opposite me this afternoon—the Prime Minister's chair—but on every occasion on which he has occupied the position of Leader of the Opposition. He has conducted a dog whistle campaign of whispers and innuendo; a campaign not all that different from the policies of One Nation. What we want is a bit of honesty.
As far as I am concerned, the Prime Minister is responsible for allowing xenophobes to have the political space that they have had over the last 29 months. It is the Prime Minister who is responsible and no-one else. The Prime Minister is expected to lead the other side of the House, but he has allowed the One Nation Party of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her xenophobe supporters to grow and grow and to occupy political space in the most decent country in the world.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it will be necessary, in the 
 course of this debate, for you to rule whether the present speaker is speaking for or against the motion. Could you tell me which is which?
—Order! There is no point of order. There is no motion. This is a discussion.
—As I said, I believe that, unfortunately, the dog whistle campaign conducted by the Prime Minister and the One Nation political party has brought the most decent nation in the world to the brink of national tragedy. I am talking about the fact that what is at stake in Australia at the moment is all our traditions—those wonderful traditions that historically all Australians have been delighted to be associated with. I am talking about such traditions as the sense of tolerance, the sense of fairness and the sense of a fair go.
The problem is that, over the last 29 months, all those wonderful Australian traditions have frayed at the edge. They have not frayed at the edge because of the actions of One Nation alone; they have frayed because of the failure of the Prime Minister of Australia to stand up and be counted. The Prime Minister has failed to take up the debate. The debate is not just about organisational structures and the question of the accountability of the One Nation Party with respect to its funds. More importantly, the debate is about what the Australian nation expects at the moment: policies and solutions to the problems that confront Australia. This debate ought to be about the failure of leadership. This debate ought to be about the fact that, in essence, One Nation is in truck with the Prime Minister on all the issues that One Nation seeks to associate itself with at this particular point in time.
One Nation has had a bit part in the debate and divisiveness that now confronts Australia, the greatest nation in the world. But so has the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should have led. He should have stood up the first time the One Nation Party reared its ugly unAustralian head and basically said, `Let's have a debate.' The problem lies with the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister talked about free speech after the last election, 
 he was really saying, with a wink and a nod, `Free speech to me means hatred, division and prejudice.' That is what free speech means to the Prime Minister. He failed to stand up 29 months ago and say to the Australian public, `Yes, we'll have a debate, but it is going to be a debate about policies and options to try to bring a sense of security back to the Australian community.'
In case the government has forgotten about that dog whistle campaign, I will go back through the history of the Prime Minister. The dog whistle campaign did not start when he occupied the `oval office' in Parliament House. The dog whistle campaign really started the first time the now Prime Minister occupied the chair of the Leader of the Opposition. It started when he was elected as Leader of the Opposition. He brought to Australian political fairness a dog whistle campaign that is built on hate, division and prejudice. If anyone has any doubt about that, I would remind the House that the comments by the One Nation political party—I will give an example of these comments—go to the comments by the Prime Minister in the late 1980s about his opposition to Asianisation in Australia. Have those opposite forgotten those comments? We all know about them. Those opposite ought to hang their heads in shame. That is what the dog whistle campaign on politics is about. The Prime Minister walked away from responsibility by making his unAustralian comments.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not often agree with the member for Kalgoorlie, but I draw your attention to the standing orders on relevance. I think that the member opposite is getting right away from the subject at the moment. He is using the opportunity to bag the Prime Minister. That is not what this debate is about. I ask you to bring him back to the point.
—I thank the honourable member for Groom. The terms of the discussion are very specific. I would encourage the member for Batman to concentrate on the terms of the discussion.
—I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about a sense of 
 democracy and a fair go in Australia. The problem with the coalition is that people in glass houses ought not throw stones.
Today's debate is about Australia. The truth is that we all know that, throughout his political career, the Prime Minister has blown so hard on the dog whistle that he is blue in the face. He pretended that he stood for some values whilst at the same time secretly trying to create an environment out there for the values and the policies of hate identified with One Nation to get their ugly heads rearing in Australia.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is no reference to the Prime Minister or any other party in the matter for discussion that has been put forward.
—Do you want a discussion or do you want to keep your head in the sand?
—Put your bum on a bike, Leo.
—The honourable member speaking now is simply avoiding your ruling on the point of order that was raised. He is nowhere near the topic and he has made no attempt to come to the topic.
—I thank the honourable member for Menzies. I would again encourage the honourable member for Batman to stay within the gambit of the discussion.
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you might ask Mr Foul Mouth over there to withdraw the remarks he made.
—I must say that I am not certain what he said.
—The member for Cowan made some remarks that everybody on this side heard.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I used the phrase `put your bum on a bike'. If that offends the member for Watson, I withdraw.
—I thank the honourable member.
—The debate really is about a sense of leadership, and politicians and political parties behaving in a responsible manner. That is what the debate is about. The problem for the coalition is that it wants to sit over there in a very hypocritical way and point the finger at One Nation alone. I am suggesting that they are fellow travellers. It is the dog whistle campaign pursued by the Prime Minister over many years, both in opposition and in government, that has created the environment for One Nation and its fellow travellers to rear their ugly heads.
If you have got any doubts about that, let us go through the voting records of the Prime Minister and the member for Oxley. Let us go to the question of workplace relations. Working people out there who put their heads down and do a decent day's work will as at 1 July have their hard-won basic working conditions ripped away from them because of the decisive action taken by the Prime Minister together with the member for Oxley.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order and it goes to relevance again. This is the third time we have asked you to draw his attention back to the question. There is nothing in this matter of public importance to do with workplace relations or anything else. It is to do with the emergence of a new registered political party, being the Pauline Hanson One Nation Party. It has nothing to do with anything that the member for Batman has been drawing his attention to.
—I thank the honourable member. I certainly uphold his point of order. I urge the honourable member for Batman to speak with some relevance to the question under discussion.
—I appreciate the position adopted by the member for Longman because he, unlike the Prime Minister, stood up very early and made the very public statement that he would put One Nation last; that he would sooner not be in this House than be elected on the basis of One Nation preferences. I understand his sensitivity and the position he adopts with respect to these fundamental issues.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Batman is 
 not addressing the matter of public importance before the House. He is talking about political preferences. The matter before the House is about the structure and democratic processes within Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I ask you to draw him back to the topic. If he has not got anything relevant to say, then he should sit down.
—I thank the honourable member for North Sydney.
(Quorum formed)
—As I have said, this debate is really about leadership. It is about politicians and political parties operating in a responsible manner. I think it also goes to the fundamentals of democracy in Australia and whether or not you conduct yourself in an undemocratic way. I must say, in the context of the debate about One Nation, I believe that the Prime Minister, through his dog whistle campaign, conducted himself in a very undemocratic way in the lead-up to the last election. I can remember watching on television the Prime Minister being led by Helen Sham-Ho as he visited the Chinese community.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was looking forward to the member for Batman actually upholding your directive. I simply draw your attention to the fact that he has not used his contribution today to account for the way his side feels about matters such as probity, which is the matter before the House at the moment.
—I thank the honourable member for Moreton. There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Batman, who will speak about the content of the discussion.
—We know all about probity, a sense of decency and upholding the sense of democracy in Australia. The problem is that there are fellow travellers on the other side of the House who want to point the finger at One Nation whilst they seek to hide behind the skirts of the member for Oxley. That is the truth of the matter and the member for Moreton knows it. He does not want to be elected on One Nation preferences. His problem is that his Prime Minister, 
 through his dog whistle campaign, basically wants to associate himself with the member for Oxley.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hate to be repetitive, but the member for Batman has continued to ignore your instructions.
—Before I was so rudely interrupted by the member for Moreton, the truth of the matter is that the political parties—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Political Parties</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—Over the past fortnight, questions have been raised in this House about the real nature of One Nation. Is it a party or is it a business? Is it a democracy or is it a dictatorship? Is it really an unstable political menage a trois linking the two Davids, D1 and D2, with an antipodean version of Eva Peron? One of the key questions is the fate of the $500,000 worth of taxpayers' money to which it has always been assumed One Nation is entitled in the wake of the Queensland election result. To receive public funding, a party must be registered under the relevant act.
The Queensland Electoral Act provides `that the application for registration must be made to the Commission in a form approved by the Commission for the purposes of this section and must if the application for a party that is not a Queensland parliamentary party'—and I should point out that One Nation had no members of parliament when this application was lodged—`set out the names and addresses of 500 members of the party who are electors'. I stress that to receive public funding a party needs 500 members.
I turn now to the constitution of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. This is not One Nation Ltd, which has three directors and just five members, but the unincorporated association registered under the Queensland act, about which I tabled information in parliament earlier this week. This unincorporated association has three classes of membership: it has management committee members, it has committee members and it has affiliate members who, I submit, are not really members at all because the management committee has 
 complete and total control over this party. I quote from its constitution:
Any AGM, Special Meeting or General Meeting may be attended by the members of the Management Committee on behalf of the Ordinary Members and any Ordinary Member—
wait for it, Mr Deputy Speaker—
who has given 7 days notice in writing of their intention to attend the meeting.
You have got to give seven days notice to attend a meeting of One Nation. It also says:
Management Committee Meetings are only to be attended by members of the Management Committee and Ordinary Members as appropriate and agreed to by a majority of members of the Management Committee.
There are just three members of the management committee. I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that affiliate members are not members in any meaningful sense. They have no role in the party whatsoever, other than to pay membership fees. So One Nation, as registered in Queensland, does not have 500 members, it is not a validly registered political party and it cannot receive any public funding. I call on the Queensland government to urgently consider whether One Nation can be a registered party at all under its existing, highly undemocratic constitution.
To be federally registered, a party also needs 500 members. My office has been seeking a copy of the constitution of One Nation as federally registered. Members may be interested to know that the Australian Electoral Commission said it cannot actually provide a copy of One Nation's constitution and suggested that I approach a person described as One Nation's constitutional officer. When asked for a copy of the constitution, the gentleman in question, Scott Balson said, `I only look after the Web page. You will have to ask David Ettridge.'
The House should know that if One Nation received 13 per cent of the vote at a federal election, if it was entitled to funding, it would receive $5 million of taxpayers' money, of which D2, David Ettridge, would be entitled to 12.5 per cent or more than $500,000. Yet, if this federally registered constitution resembles the Queensland constitution of One Nation, it may not be validly registered at all. 
 So I ask the Australian Electoral Commission to reconsider whether, given the complete lack of democracy inside One Nation, given the complete lack of membership in any meaningful form, One Nation is indeed a validly registered party.
Is One Nation a constitutional entity in any meaningful sense or is it just a couple of political and financial brigands trying to hoodwink decent patriotic Australians in the way Jimmy Swaggart once tricked pious Americans? The administration of this party, One Nation, is a complete shambles. Today's Sydney Morning Herald, in talking about One Nation, states:
. . . its former Queensland treasurer, Mr Ted Bricks, said he resigned last month over concerns about financial accountability. He said two party members to whom he had spoken made donations of $5,000 and $7,000 but were not given receipts.
He said he discovered the money was not deposited in One Nation's account but in ""associated"" accounts—
perhaps Mr Ettridge's—
whose details he was unable to establish. The documentation in relation to the financial affairs of One Nation is virtually non-existent.
Could it be that Mr 12.5 Per Cent has taken more than that to which he is entitled? Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to know that I happened the other day to pick up the One Nation political party annual return for 1996-1997 and I noticed that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) had given $5,000 to One Nation in the form of a loan to the party. I just hope that better care has been taken of the member for Oxley's money than was taken of the $7,000 referred to by Mr Bricks.
We ought to point out again that D2, David Ettridge, is actually the principal of an overseas registered company operating in Australia. D2 is in fact a foreign multinational. That is what D2 is. And so I say to Scott Balson, who indicated that he would never accept any multinational company on his Web page, that the first person he should throw off the Web page is none other than David Ettridge himself.
People need to know what kind of party One Nation has become. They need to know that David Oldfield's and David Ettridge's 
 One Nation Ltd is not a political party in any meaningful sense; it is a business where no-one is allowed to ask questions. Today's Age newspaper said:
Mrs Klinghammer said she was disendorsed as One Nation's candidate for Hindmarsh in South Australia after questioning the whereabouts of $7,000 raised at a party fundraiser. She said three other South Australian candidates, Mr David Carter, Mr David Dwyer and Mr Roger Meadmore, were also disendorsed after questioning party finances.
I congratulate those decent, honest members of One Nation, or pseudo-members of One Nation, for taking the stance they did. But what happened when they raised these perfectly reasonable questions with the party leadership, D1 and D2? I am quoting again from the Age :
We were told we were compulsive liars and traitors, when all we were doing was asking them to be accountable for the money.
There are indeed some chronic and habitual liars in the One Nation organisation, but the best candidates for that title are in fact D1 and D2. The best thing the member for Oxley could do, if she has any concern for her party, if she has any concern for the decent Australians who might be tempted to support her, if she has any concern for her own reputation, if she has any thought for the people of Ipswich who voted her into this place, is to sack David Oldfield and David Ettridge. She must get rid of D1 and D2.
—She can't. They'll get rid of her.
—She doesn't have the numbers.
—I take the point of the members behind me. She doesn't have the numbers. The member for Oxley needs to understand that she is completely at the mercy of, she is completely dependent on the goodwill of, two people who go a lot further back with one another than they do with her.
I think that the nation is sending out a message: please explain, Pauline. The nation wants to know, and One Nation wants to know. When you do stand up to reply, I ask you this: please don't just read a script that D1 has written for you, because if you do you 
 are not worth the $145 travel allowance you have been paid for today.
—I call the member for Watson.
—Oh!",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Political Parties</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—Before other members get all upset, there are two hours in this debate, so we will be interested to hear not only what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has to say but maybe what some more members of the government might want to say. They have all been keen to not be too interested in One Nation until all of a sudden the One Nation train has started running down their track. For two years the opposition have been saying that we think this is an organisation that people should be taking a look at, but the government has not been saying that. Suddenly the government has become a little bit worried. The Queensland election frightened the life out of the government and they have now started to take an interest.
—And the Labor Party.
—We are the government of Queensland. You missed that, I know. That is probably why you are sitting over here with the Independents rather than with the party you got elected with.
We have become used to the coalition playing ostrich on matters which affect the social cohesion of Australia. There is no doubt that, since One Nation was created in 1997, they have been gathering support across the country. The Queensland election showed that. The impression of any of us who have watched it is that to a large extent that support comes from people who have been made insecure by the rapid changes that have been occurring to the Australian economy and who have been seeking easy answers. One Nation came into that breach and provided easy answers. They got 22 per cent of the vote in the Queensland election by supplying those easy answers. What people should understand is that these complex questions do not have easy answers. If they did have easy answers, the major political parties would have implemented them some time ago. The hard truth 
 is that there are no easy answers to these complex questions.
Apart from those ordinary Australians who are desperately seeking some certainty in their lives, there are a number of shadowy fringe groups which seem to have had a very large role in the growth of One Nation. It seems to be these fringe dwellers who wield authority in the party—not the ordinary concerned citizens. It is very important to make the distinction between One Nation voters and the One Nation Party. As every day goes by, however, more disturbing evidence is coming forward about the controllers of the One Nation Party and their extremist connections. It is now known that two state presidents of One Nation have connections with the League of Rights. Senator Boswell is a long-time fighter against the League of Rights. If the government had listened to him, as they should have listened to the opposition, they would not be in the position they are in today. Senator Boswell has told us that the Victorian president has addressed two League of Rights functions and the Queensland president has been published in the League of Rights newsletter. Indeed, David Ettridge's brother, Michael Ettridge, maintained that he had been dismissed as a candidate for One Nation because he had called in police to expel extremists from One Nation meetings. Some of these extremists had spoken of making rifles and taking over the Townsville army barracks. One of these groups, the Freedom Scouts, is very extreme indeed.
When confronted with these connections with extremist groups, the best One Nation can do is insist that they, One Nation, should not be condemned just because they are supported by these groups. But they won't condemn those groups. They just dance around the edges, in the same way as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) dances around the edges of One Nation. These extremist groups are attracted like bees around a honey pot. They see an opportunity to gain control of a party and that party's agenda. Witness yesterday's immigration statement by none other than the co-founder of Australians Against Further Immigration, who is now One Nation's immigration adviser. I believe this is 
 just another example of those fringe groups being given the right signals by the member for Oxley and her Rasputin, David Oldfield.
As One Nation is now a recognised political party in the parliament of Queensland, the third largest state in this country, the questions of accountability and transparency become important. One Nation now attracts large amounts of public funding—half a million dollars in the Queensland election. As the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) said, if they got even half the vote that they got in Queensland they would attract nearly $5 million of federal funding in the next federal election. There has been concern raised all across the country about what is happening with that money. Concern has been raised by One Nation candidates in the Queensland election about the expenditure of fundraising money.
It has already been mentioned that One Nation's former Queensland treasurer, Mr Ted Bricks, resigned last month over concerns about financial accountability. Mr Bricks was quoted in today's Sydney Morning Herald as saying:
The documentation in relation to the financial affairs of One Nation is virtually non-existent.
Examples given include two party members in Queensland who had made donations of $5,000 and $7,000 but were given no receipts. The former secretary of the member for Oxley has claimed that several supporters had made donations of $500 but had not been given receipts. A One Nation candidate in Adelaide mentioned that $7,000 raised at a function to pay for how to vote cards had vanished. What did Mr Ettridge say about that? He said that the money that was raised was used for other things. What we should ask is: what were those other things? Were they to do with the political or personal activities of One Nation's owners?
That fast and loose approach to contributions may be related to the way that the One Nation Party is set up. We have heard that the party is set up as a limited liability company. Mr Ettridge receives 12½ per cent of the money that they get. It is said by the member for Warringah—and I do not disbelieve him—that the member for Oxley, Mr Ettridge and 
 Mr Oldfield are directors of that One Nation company. But I had a look at the register of members' interests today—for which the latest date is 1 July—and there is no mention in the register of members' interests of this parliament that the member for Oxley is a director of any company called One Nation. I hope that, if the member for Oxley is a director of that company, she might explain to this House why she is not in breach of the standing orders.
The supporters of One Nation can be assured that they know who Pauline Hanson is. She has been subject to detailed scrutiny in the media. But we do not know who are the people behind her. We have heard a little bit about David Oldfield, the former staffer of the member for Warringah. Information about his history and opinions is beginning to filter out.
But who is David Ettridge, the third owner of the One Nation company? He is the man who is responsible for the finances of One Nation Incorporated. We know he is anxious to avoid paying his full taxes. One wonders if there are many One Nation supporters who would be happy to support someone who evades tax. I know that the member for Oxley has spoken against foreign companies avoiding Australian taxes by making use of international tax havens. Perhaps she should have been looking closer to home for tax cheats. But apart from Mr Ettridge's history as a tax avoider, very little is known about him, even though as a director of the One Nation company he has control over every aspect of One Nation's operations.
It is all very well for the member for Warringah to come into this House and beat his breast about One Nation and his former employee, David Oldfield. It is all very well for him to call for inquiries by the police, the tax commissioner and the Australian Securities Commission. Yesterday, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) joined in that chorus and now the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is adding his voice. But the one who should have spoken out two years ago is still hiding in the background.
This organisation, One Nation, would not be where it is today without the tacit support 
 of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who encouraged the member for Oxley's supporters at the beginning. Now those faithful followers of the member for Oxley should start to ask themselves: who is running the show—Ms Hanson, David Ettridge or David Oldfield; where are their hard-earned donations going; and where is the transparency and accountability that they have a right to?
It is time, I believe, that One Nation voters stopped and had a good look and asked the hard questions. My advice to them is that they should not vote for a pig in a poke. But my advice to the government members here today is to forget about these cheap, phoney motions where, all of a sudden, most of them have become concerned about One Nation.
—Not all of us.
—Most of them, I said. The member for Longman (Mr Brough) and his other colleague from Queensland saw that train coming down the track, but the rest of them—the National Party members from Queensland, who are not here in the chamber this afternoon—
—That is not right. You are misleading the house.
—He's from Queensland.
—From Queensland? There is one of them: Mr Marek is here. Mr Marek thought it was pretty unfair that other members got to speak in this debate, rather than the member for Oxley. He is running around one minute wanting to sit over there with the government and the next he is coming over here to give her advice. Maybe, son, they might not put you last, but I think they will!
The government got on this train too late. It is time the Prime Minister came out and said something, and that we not just hear from the leadership aspirant, who is sitting over there next to the member for Warringah. We should hear from the Prime Minister. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Political Parties</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Smith, Tony, MP",IND,1998-07-02,"—I will say something at the outset unashamedly. I may disagree a lot with what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) says, but I tell you what: I will stand here and defend 
 to the death her right to say it. I will defend to the death the right of 500,000 people in Queensland who voted for her and the 34,800 people in Oxley who voted for her.
—The member for Dickson will address his remarks through the chair and to the matter before the House.
—I have been disgusted since I entered this House at some of the personal attacks upon the member for Oxley. It is totally un-Australian. We have a problem in this country. The problem is 13 years of political correctness under Labor and an emulation by the 2½ years of the leaderless Howard government. That is the problem. We have not had any leadership on Aboriginal affairs—as the member for Banks (Mr Melham) knows—we have not had any direction in Aboriginal affairs in this country, and that is why the people of Australia are looking for something different, and the people of Australia have a right to do that.
—On a point of order: Mr Speaker, for the sake of consistency, I would simply like to draw your attention to the fact that there is a matter before the House which the member for Dickson has so far chosen to ignore.
—The member for Dickson is talking within the standing orders and within terms of the the matter of public importance.
—Well may the major parties—in particular the coalition—criticise and fear the new political forces that have emerged on the Australian political scene. The One Nation Party has been vilified by not only most elements of the ABC, which the coalition continually criticises for political correctness and alleged bias against conservative politics, but it has seen a campaign of virtual character assassination waged against its members.
No-one can say that it has received the support of the press from any element of the mainstream media. Yet, despite this, in Australia's most recent democratic election, it gained a quarter of the popular vote—and much of it was at the expense of the Liberal and National parties.
If the new forces are so base, as Shakespeare would have said, what does that make the coalition if it is losing votes hand over fist to these political forces? Frequent accusations of racism are made but it was both the Labor and Liberal parties which, for most of Australian history, advocated and enforced a White Australia policy, which is still influencing our racial mix. In the Middle Ages, if you wanted to indelibly smear someone, you accused them of witchcraft; in the 1950s you accused them of being a communist; now all that is necessary is the racist slur. For years we have had peculiar, untouchable items within this country—
—While the honourable member for Dickson can range fairly widely, I suggest he needs to have in mind the tightness of the matter of public importance before the chair. At this stage he is moving a little wide of that mark. I suggest he addresses the particular matter before the chair.
—He's a bit to the right.
—The honourable member for Moreton will remain silent.
—As has been said by Professor Corcoran in his article, this is what this matter is about. This matter is really a smokescreen to cover the inability of the conservative parties of this place to lead. This country has the worst conservative government that I can recall and I have been following politics for the last 40 years. It is the worst conservative government ever. It has no leadership or direction and that is why we have 500,000 people supporting One Nation.
—On a point of order: I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to bring the honourable member back to the subject of the debate. You have already warned him once and he is obviously straying.
—There is normally a fair measure of licence allowed in matters of public importance, but I do take up the point of order raised by the member for Robertson. Matters of public importance are designed to canvass a particular subject. I suggest the member for Dickson takes note of that and address the subject in any comments he might make. 
—This matter is not about democracy and One Nation. It is about the failure of the political process in this country to recognise that people are rebelling against the system that they have. The democracy aspect of this matter is really a farce. People in Queensland are saying that they have had enough of the system. That is what a great number of people are saying in general. A colourful thread in all of this is that the common folk are somehow at fault, as Professor Corcoran said. Australian culture has been constantly changing and, in the context of this matter of public importance, it is being enriched by internal and external influences. We have to recognise that. The United States has always had a policy of a melting pot of cultures—
—This matter says nothing about the United States. I again draw the attention of the honourable member for Dickson to the matter before the House.
—There have been members on the other side of the House that have recognised these matters and that there is an argument. But it is an argument that requires some work. As Paul Sheehan said in his book recently:
Thrashing Hanson as a racist and a fool is no substitute for actually doing some work.
When are we going to see some major work being done on issues in this country? This is a smokescreen for avoiding the real issues. Why can't the people of Australia be trusted to a referendum on native title? They are only common folk. They would not understand. The member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) said that it was a complex issue. It is not a complex matter. It is a matter that can be put to the people of Australia. They do not need to be told that that is very complex. We now have a 10-point, 7½-point plan. The 10-point never ever to change plan is now the 7½—
—The member for Dickson is way off the track on this MPI. If he does not come back to the particular issue before the parliament, I will ask him to resume his seat.
—This matter of public importance is really a mask for the policy failure of the government. That is the prob 
 lem. There is a total lack of policy. The more you attack the member for Oxley and the One Nation Party, the more votes she will get. I guarantee it. I predicted in the House on 4 June that we would see a revolution in Queensland. People said, `Oh no, that's all right.' The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who is chattering away, used to employ one of the Davids. He might want to think about that, too.
Mr Abbott interjecting—
—Oh, never ever again! The fact of the matter is that they are not focusing on policy. It is the policy vacuum that this particular matter really embodies—
—Whatever the honourable member's view, can I again refer him to the fact that this is not a wide-ranging debate. It is one that is focused specifically on the subject matter before the House. I suggest he returns to it.
—The comment in the matter `and by not being of a basically undemocratic nature' invites, with respect, comment about the democratic nature generally of the political process and of the Liberal Party itself and other parties. We should start looking at some of the processes in the Liberal Party—and we all have a store of stories about that and about what goes on within their processes.
—Tell us! Go on, tell us!
—I am saving them up. This particular matter before the House is not so much about the One Nation Party or Pauline Hanson; it is about policy vacuum, and the people of Australia know it.
—On a point of order, Mr Speaker. With the greatest of respect, I suspect the member for Dickson is defying your ruling.
—The honourable member for Dickson has the call and I am endeavouring to make sure he stays on the issue before us. He is marginally doing so at the moment.
—As far as democracy is concerned, the Liberal Party should explain why it is that it has meetings in this place 
 where it tells members what the issues are—not the other way around. I would have thought that a democratic party would allow the members to tell the executive—the secretariat, such as Mr Lynton Crosby—what the issues are, but it is the other way around.
—There is nothing in this matter of public importance to do with the matters you are now canvassing. Please return to the issue before us.
—When it comes to questions of democracy and attacking individuals, we ought, in trying to do the right thing by the people of Australia, avoid the attacking of individuals. We should be attacking issues. We should be providing the leadership that is totally lacking in this country and that the people of Australia are crying out for.

"Hanson, Pauline, MP",IND,1998-07-02,"—It has been very interesting to sit here and listen to all the concerns. Actually, it is very rare that you see bipartisanship happen in this House. You cannot have bipartisanship by either side of the House on concerns of maybe unemployment or looking after the interests of Australians, but you can when it comes to Pauline Hanson or the member for Oxley or One Nation. So Australian people will be very much interested in this.
It is interesting that the member for Menzies, Mr Andrews, only raises concerns for newly emerging registered political parties. No doubt this is because he does not wish to discuss the actual details and structure of his own party. Perhaps someone from the Liberal Party in New South Wales would like to explain their unincorporated structure that exposes all their members to huge debts. One Nation has a structure that is public and limited and without shareholders. It, unlike the Liberal Party—at least in New South Wales—protects its members from debts. The directors of this Australian registered structure have serious responsibilities under the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission. Many sporting organisations have an identical structure, yet no-one questions them.
It should be further understood that our reporting to the Australian Electoral Commis 
 sion is considerable and a matter of the public record. In fact, we are subject to audit at any time by the AEC, and our books are kept in a continual state of readiness. This potential for audit places our organisation under greater scrutiny than any company registered with the Australian Securities Commission. The smear of tax havens and questions of democracy are without substance and simply hypocritical considering the well-documented dodgy internal voting of the major parties on such things as preselections and the like. Allegations of the source of funds, work in kind and deals of an interesting nature have been levelled at all the parties, but this is conveniently forgotten in the quest to slur One Nation. With an ever increasing series of untruths, it defies logic and is only surpassed by the desire of the press to be a part of the spread of such nonsense. I suggest Mr Andrews look into his own backyard first and also bear in mind that we report to the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission, not him or his fellow politically motivated dealers in dark untruths.
It is no doubt an eye-opening experience for all Australians. We see without question that you are only united when it comes to opposing the threat we pose to your comfortable coexistence. No wonder Australians are fed up with the gutter tactics they see from the members of this House—their representatives.
—The member for Oxley should address the motion before the House.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—A member of parliament's office is like a confessional. Every day, all of us see people who provide us with personal and confidential information. All of them should be able to have the confidence to trust in us that we will never, under any circumstance, reveal this information or identify those who provided the information. I was, therefore, somewhat surprised to hear, on ABC Illawarra radio on Tuesday morning, the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) reveal on air the income of a family who live in my electorate.
In a live interview on the ABC on Tuesday morning, the member for Gilmore was spouting from the usual script provided by the government to defend the youth allowance. She had her go and then a few people called to give her the real life situation. Angry parents, none of them one bit sympathetic to the government's script, rang in to complain about the effect of the youth allowance. The member for Gilmore responded to one such caller by revealing on air what she said was the family income of a particular caller. The Edwards family, of Mount Warrigal, went public in their complaint about the member for Gilmore in yesterday's Illawarra Mercury under the headline, `Mt Warrigal mum: Gash got it wrong.'
Mrs Yvonne Edwards is a fighter, an ordinary Australian with a little fight in her, looking out for the interests of her son, and I commend her for it. Mrs Edwards is the woman who went to meet with the member for Gilmore to set her straight about the effects of the youth allowance, and for her efforts was dismissed as an `activist'.
But the member for Gilmore, on air on Tuesday, bit off a little more than she could chew. When Mrs Edwards disputed publicly that she had told the member for Gilmore what her family income was, the response from the member for Gilmore was that she was sure Mrs Edwards had told her the family income was over $60,000. I can say that Mrs Edwards, in her meetings with me, never once revealed what her level of family income was, and I never asked her.
Interesting questions need to be answered by the member for Gilmore. Where did she get this mythical $60,000 figure? Did she just make it up on the spur of the moment? Mrs Edwards says publicly that she never provided the figure to her, and I can say quite categorically that Mrs Edwards never mentioned any figure like that to me.
The member for Gilmore has caused the Edwards family some embarrassment, I believe, in making up figures and then throwing them around publicly. This is not the price they should pay because they had the fight to take on the youth allowance policy of the Howard government—which, as I remind honourable members, the One Nation Party leader, the member for Oxley (Mrs Hanson), supported and voted for. The member for Gilmore owes Mrs Edwards a public apology. She should provide that apology immediately. If not, I will continue to pursue her until she does.
I know how embarrassing it can be to have your personal financial details publicly revealed. Last year, during a bitter preselection battle for Throsby, someone, who should professionally 
 have known better, made public details of my financial situation and touted around in public what my financial situation was and what my superannuation would have been, had I been defeated. So I share with Mrs Edwards the embarrassment of having financial details revealed publicly.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—This report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled The Asian currency crisis  is a report on one of a number of seminars that the committee has held over the past 12 years. I pay tribute to the current Speaker of the parliament, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who when he was chair of the committee instigated this series of seminars. Of course, the current chairman, Senator MacGibbon, has ably carried that on.
These seminars are important. It is always a disappointment to me that they are not as well attended by parliamentary colleagues as perhaps I would like to see them being attended. We have all got tremendous demands on our time, but the seminars provide an input for members of parliament—and, indeed, the community—into whatever topic they may be discussing. As in this case—this is a transcript of the proceedings of the day—they are available in printed form. That also enables us in the Main Committee and in the main chamber to debate these issues. They are important, and I hope that these seminars will be carried on and will be well attended.
It is somewhat of a truism to say that the so-called Asian currency crisis came as a tremendous surprise to Australians—and not only to Australia but also to many other parts of the world. For many years, Asia had been held up as an example for us of the way to go and the way to deal with our economies, and constantly paraded before us were the growth rates of many Asian countries. As someone who knows Asia quite well and has visited there, I can well remember being in Indonesia a couple of years ago and being told what its growth rate was, how impressive it was and how it had continued to grow at this rate over a number of years. In fact, I remember meeting with the current president, President Habibie, in his former ministerial position, and being told about the dynamics of Indonesia.
One could repeat that theme for Malaysia. Malaysia, we were told, was growing at something like eight per cent, from memory; and we could go through all the Asian countries. I remember being on a Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegation to Thailand, and there again we were being told of the growth in Thailand. Of course, it was always held up to us in Australia that the Asians had found the secret for a rising standard of living and a continuous growth rate all the way.
Things came to a somewhat dramatic halt a year or so ago. As I say, for many of us, it was a surprise—not only because of the speed with which the crisis impacted on these countries but also because of the domino effect that seems to some of us to be occurring. It is true to say that there have been very different impacts, and there are also different future scenarios for many of those countries. For example, in countries such as Korea and Thailand, various structural adjustments will have to be made but, especially in the Korean case, because of the basic soundness of the economy, I have absolutely no doubt that Korea will continue on an upward trend and that growth will continue there. Undoubtedly, some pain will be imposed locally; nevertheless, the currency and the economy are so sound that growth will continue. To a lesser extent, the same will happen with Thailand, I have absolutely no doubt.
I am not as confident about Indonesia. Indonesia is paying the price, and will continue to pay the price for some time, for not having looked after the fundamentals of the economy and for having practised cronyism and other such things. There is a real problem with the economy of Indonesia, despite the efforts of the new President in so many fields—and one can only admire and support what he has been doing. Nevertheless, the medicine for the economic situation in Indonesia might be so severe that I worry that there could well be civil unrest there if it were given. So I have a worry about the long-term stability of Indonesian society, with problems brought on by the so-called Asian currency crisis.
Of course, no country, from a trade point of view, is more important to Australia than Japan. We all have to watch with a degree of concern what has happened in recent months with the Japanese economy. There has been no growth there, and as Japan has been such an engine house for Asia—and, indeed, for so many other parts of the world—and is Australia's most important trading partner, it has to be a matter of concern for us. We can only hope that the Japanese take the right corrective measures to make sure that that economy, which is so important for us and for Asia, continues to churn along as it should.
The worry, too, is that many of these things become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Only in the last couple of weeks, people have been talking about the impact on New Zealand and whether the New Zealand economy, because of the Asian crisis, is going to go through some of the turmoil we have seen in countries to our north. I am not sure about that; I am not familiar enough with the New Zealand economy to know if they can withstand it or not. I sometimes think that, especially in relation to Asia, we in Australia could learn somewhat from the New Zealanders because when you go through Asia you see signs for New Zealand produce, and in so many parts of the world, and much more so than you see Australian produce.
Interestingly, I saw a letter to the Illawarra Mercury one day this week or last week in which the candidate for the One Nation Party for the seat of Gilmore was talking about trade, accusing members of parliament and other people of being traitors because we had signed various trade agreements and posing the question at the end of this letter whether we should be or could be tried as traitors to the country. It is all very well to bandy words about, especially emotive words, but I would say that the real traitors to this country are those who by their actions, words and deeds have brought us into such disrepute with our neighbours to the north, in Asia.
Many Australians do not realise just how important Asia is to Australia, not only because of the fact that two-thirds of our exports go to Asia but because our future is very much tied up with Asia. Those who complain about us becoming `Asianised' and other words like that are often those people who will suffer most if Asia turns its back on us.
We are all experts on the recent Queensland state election—I have never seen so many experts so quickly in any place! The one thing that surprises me about the Queensland state election is that that part of Queensland that voted so strongly for One Nation, that beautiful coastal area, is so dependent on tourism. Much of that tourism comes from Asia. It would seem to me, as an outsider—I am not a Queenslander; I am not an expert on it—that the message that that area of Australia was sending to Asia is a wrong message because that area of Australia is so dependent on Asia. I do not know if people do not realise that or have been deluded into thinking otherwise.
This report and the seminar made it abundantly clear that we in Australia cannot divorce ourselves from Asia. Asia is important to Australia. There has been some criticism in Australia of our contribution to the rescue packages following the financial troubles in Asia. But it is not in Australia's interest to see Asian economies collapse. I know there have been arguments about whether we should have so much tied up in Asia. But our future, as I keep saying, is very much with Asia. I think there is a legitimate argument about how dependent we are on that trade; about whether we, under the Labor government or under the present government, have worked our way to being too dependent on Asia, that too much of our trade has been tied up or too much of our investment has been in that one area.
It always surprises me that Australia only seems to be able to deal with one region at a time. When China was the flavour of the month everything went into China; when Europe was the flavour of the month everything went into Europe; when Asia was the flavour of the month, we put everything into Asia. I think there is a legitimate argument that we should be looking for new markets but we should never disregard old markets for the flavour of the new market. I think we should have a very balanced approach.
In many respects, we have no option but to have most of our trade with Asia. With the European Economic Community, Europe turns its back on Australia. Countries like Britain find their future in Europe, and I have no argument with that. So Australia finds its future within Asia. But we should not just look at the narrow part of Asia immediately to our north. We should look at a wider area. For instance, India is a country that we often neglect or take for granted. Only this week we debated in parliament a report from the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, Australia's trade relationship with India—Commonwealth, common language, cricket and beyond. I do not think that got a mention in any newspaper in Australia. There is so much potential for trade with India but we ignore it and I think we ignore it at our peril.
As much as some might like, we cannot go back to the 1950s when the world wanted what Australia was producing. Europe was emerging from the Second World War and we were producing what Europe wanted. We live in a completely different society today. We have to compete. It is a very competitive world out there and we have got to be smarter than, or as smart as, the others. We have got to compete. No-one owes Australia a living and we should not expect it.
The Asian currency crisis will impact on Australia. It is impacting now and it will continue to impact. Despite what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) might say, Australia is not fireproofed from what is happening in Asia. Indeed, given the nature of the world today, I do not think any country can be fireproofed from Asia. We are so intimately tied up with Asia—and that point has been made in various places in this report—that it is impossible, as much as we might like it, to completely fireproof ourselves from Asia.
I commend this report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, The Asian currency crisis to honourable members, especially those who have an interest in what is happening in Asia. It does not provide all the answers. In fact, in many cases, it raises as many questions as it provides answers. On the day, the speakers came from different perspectives and, of course, they had different ideas and a different analysis of the problem and a different prognosis about what the solution may be. I congratulate the committee, especially the former chair and the current chair for arranging this seminar, and the staff who were involved in it. I commend it to the House, and may these seminars continue.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,36,1,speech
"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—I would also like to commend the present chair of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Senator David MacGibbon, and his predecessor, our current Speaker, the Rt. Hon. Ian Sinclair, for their initiative in bringing together what I regard as one of the most important and perhaps prophetic seminars that has been held by this parliament in this parliamentary term since the election in 1996. It brought together a wide range of views and people who are experts in their field from various parts of Australia's economy and the world. As the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, The Asian currency crisis , is hard work but it is essential reading for a lot of Australians both inside and outside parliament as a means of getting some more insight into what is going on with the Asian economies.
I mention also that, by coincidence, I noticed today in the Age a very comprehensive magazine type article on the Asian situation. It is entitled `The year that Asia shook the world'—a prophetic headline. I have the pages here. It is a pity we cannot screen them into Hansard. Also accompanying the feature in the Age today—and I commend the Age for its work in this area—is a report on a speech made by Rupert Murdoch in which he makes some comments and observations about Australia and the Asian crisis. They are very interesting comments. I do not agree entirely with all of the comments and all the analysis in the Age, but it is certainly well worth while having a look at them.
I just wanted to make a general comment first about the contributions by all the speakers. There was some conflict between them all, as the member for Throsby pointed out, as to what was going on, what was needed, what the various manifestations of the crisis were in respect of all of the countries. To me, what came out quite clearly was confirmation that, because of Australia's juxtaposition geographically with Asian countries and because of our own economy—a market economy—and because we are a trading nation, we could not ignore what was going on. That was obvious. Everyone agreed on that.
The second point was perhaps an obvious statement but I would like to make it. The various problems in each Asian country will have a regional effect with their trading partners, like Australia, and not so much an international effect. In other respects, the effect in those countries will also have an international effect. Work that one out. But, really, if you step back from that statement, you will understand that the crisis is indeed a very severe one and a very serious one. I think it is fair for me to say it will have both an international effect and a regional effect, and it is indeed having that.
The other observation I would like to make is that for those of us in the Australian parliament now, and for those who aspire to be here to replace those of us here, I do not think there has ever been a time since the Second World War that this country has needed such unity, dedication, courage and strength to face the challenges that are coming knocking on 
 our door now because of the Asian crisis. This nation and the people who are going to vote at the next election, whenever it might be, need to make absolutely certain that they fully understand the nature and extent of the policies of all the aspirants from all the political parties and the Independents, because there will probably be a lot of those as well, and the effect that those policies would have immediately and medium term and long term on the future of our country and—in simpler terms—on the future of our children and their children.
That I think is the crucial issue. This seminar and the transcript help us to grapple with that. I wish everyone in Australia who is a voter would take the trouble to read and study all this. I know they will not. I know that we have had a manifestation since the Queensland election of people, who are rightly worried and concerned about Australia's future, taking what appears to be a simplistic approach to what is needed, without going into policy in depth.
I do not want to be disrespectful to those people who voted against the major parties in Queensland and shifted to One Nation. Many of those people are decent Australians. There is no question or doubt about that. I would make an appeal to those people—excluding the fanatical ones from whom you will never get a change of attitude; indeed, I do not think we should even try because of some of the frightening extremism that they are capable of exhibiting—who have shown their dissatisfaction and concern about Australia and voted for One Nation, that whatever decision they make in the federal election should be based on research, knowledge, intense examination of the policies of all the parties and then application of the test that I think we all should apply: `Will these policies benefit or prejudice the future of my children and their children?'
They should remind themselves that, since white settlement in Australia, we have gone through some pretty hard times. We talk about our families' experiences and no doubt we have all had different mixtures of background and upbringing. But I can remember, when my late mother had to be moved to a nursing home from the family home, we found a cupboard full of tinned food and it was dated, some of it, back into the 1940s—condensed milk and all that—and this was only two or three years ago. My elder sister, who had a greater knowledge of my late mother's housekeeping, said that that was the cupboard that we were never allowed to touch because mother had gone through difficult times with depressions and wars and she always made sure there was a store of food for the family to be fed in case hard times came again.
In saying that, I would like to pay tribute to the Australians in our community who have gone through hard times and are still going through hard times, who can show, through their strength and courage and example, what a nation is really made of when we face a crisis such as the Asian crisis and what is needed.
We should also acknowledge that not one of us in our present generation should forget that, when we took over as the adults in the family and the businesses and whatever we did, and now in parliament for some of us, we were handed an Australia that was better than our parents had. They in their turn received one better than their grandparents had. There were more opportunities for us and we must remember that they put a lot of hard work in and put up with a lot and sacrificed a lot to get us there, as did our new Australians, our migrants—and my dad was not a migrant but he came from another country in the 1920s after fighting in the First World War against the Germans in France, then via America into Australia. The stories that he used to tell me about what they had to put up with in England were just frightening. Most of the new arrivals in Australia since the Second World War went through 
 terrible times, but fought through and helped build this country into the great country it is today.
All of us must remember, when we vote at the next election, having regard to the things that are there now—the serious Asian crisis—that we have a responsibility to try to hand the country over to our kids so that they have more opportunity than we had, maintaining the tradition of our parents before us and their parents before them. That, I think, is the plea that I make.
Now let me get down to the perhaps stark information that is referred to. Murdoch said yesterday that with the risk of more Asian turmoil he has urged Australia to assert itself better. He said:
This is a tremendously dangerous time. We are dealing here with more than a normal currency crisis.
And so on. In the survey of economists—and I do not want to be disrespectful to economists because my young son is an economist and I am proud of him—they are all different; they have all got different views. The majority of them thought that the economic trouble in Asia would get worse—as if we did not know that. There are a few more optimistic ones that say at the same time that it will get worse but will get better—and that is quite a challenge. How on earth can you do that when we have got so much disunity in this country now? If anyone thinks that this country can go through the Asian crisis and get better as we go, without unity and strength and courage, working together and with a decent compact of policies, they are deluding themselves. Disunity will in fact make the wheel fall off. It will make it harder.
The other point I would make is that in the same pages there is an excellent summary of each country—Japan, China, Hong Kong and the rest. Obviously it is an oversimplification in some cases, but in the case of Japan it says:
What analysts fear most is another surge in the US dollar and a weakening of the yen as international markets lose faith in Japan's willingness to reform.
Interesting. They of course are in a recession now.
There is not a lot said about China in the report but we must remember that China has so far weathered Asia's economic turmoil, although there are now signals that China is facing a serious downturn. The reference to banks is worth reading; it is pretty chilling. As for Hong Kong, the government there announced its May reforms. There will be negative growth in Hong Kong for the first time in 13 years, and most analysts now believe that even tougher times are ahead.
As for Indonesia, many analysts believe that recovery there is inevitable but that there will be problems along the way, as if we did not know. Regarding Thailand, the most common criticism about Thailand is that high interest rates are strangling the real economy, and that situation still goes on. Concerning South Korea, it is expected that South Korea's economy will shrink by a further four per cent. South Korea is one of our biggest purchasers of traded items but it will be two or three years before manufacturing there is strong again.
I have some knowledge of Asian trade but I need to learn a lot more, and I try to. There is no doubt about the Asians. There is one thing you should remember: they have been through tough times before and they have shown that they have the ability to come together and work through them. So when they do come out of all of this they are going to be the most formidable competitors that you have ever seen. They are now, but they are going to be even more formidable in the future.
That should send a strong signal to Australia. Australia has not got time to be lax. We have not got time for division. We have not got time to adopt simplistic, stupid policies that will set us back. What we have to do is go forward. We must not shirk our responsibilities. If we do shirk them over the next two or three years and think that it will all be coming to us, things will get harder, not easier. When these economies in Asia do recover they are going to be more formidable traders. Also, they will be more substantial buyers of our goods. So you can see the dual challenge that is there for us.
In my electorate I have a number of value added manufacturing industries that export to Asia. I can tell you that already we have had some retrenchments. We are fighting like mad to find new markets. One company, with the assistance of Austrade and the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer), was able to get a container into a new market in America. Picking up on what the member for Throsby said, we must try to find other baskets and not just have all our eggs in one basket. There is a lot of work going on there.
I would like to pay tribute to the staff and management of the manufacturing industries in regional Australia, in areas like mine, who are doing a fantastic job to produce high quality, value added exports. They are trying to weather the storm and find new markets while this crisis goes on. Also, they are trying to help their Asian partners as well. We must not turn our back on our Asian friends. We have to be true friends in these difficult times, as I believe we are given the assistance and all of the—
—It is in our own self-interest as well.
—Of course it is. It is in our interest from an economic and a social point of view. The natural thing to do is to help our fellow human beings. And, of course, from a security point of view it is also in our interest. We have a huge set of challenges.
Finally, I call on the other political parties to support the coalition in its endeavours. If ever there was a time for a war cabinet, it is now. Support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Trade and help us deal with the simplistic nonsense from One Nation that will destroy and threaten our trade and security. Stop obstructing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade from doing what they are trying to do.

"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate. I might say that I agree with a lot of the sentiments of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), but he seems to think that the Howard government has a solution to the problems of Asia. He was very good at quoting Mr Murdoch and other people in the newspaper, but none of those people think that. The reality is that the government has no solution to the problems of Asia.
It is true that the simplistic solutions of One Nation are obviously not going to work. They would not have any impact if ever they were to be put into place. In fact they are reactionary, with an emphasis on some kind of vague idea of nationalism, ethnic chauvinism and fear of other cultures in society. I agree with the member for Indi that One Nation has no solutions to these matters; but, as for suggesting that somehow the Howard government has shown leadership in this matter, you can read Mr Murdoch's comments very well. Mr Murdoch is saying that Australia needs to do more; it needs to show more leadership and to get more engaged in the problems which exist in the Asian region.
The report on the Asian currency crisis, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, was interesting because of the issues that it raised. It is interesting that the seminar was on 19 March. Since then, there have been dramatic changes and further events have evolved, 
 unforeseen even by the speakers themselves. Not too many of the speakers foresaw the dramatic changes that would occur in Indonesia, for example, in relation to the at least partial changing of the regime there and the stepping down of President Suharto.
The thing that is very important when discussing these issues is that we have to be honest, and the member for Indi should note this. It is true that One Nation has no solutions to these issues, but to pretend that we all have the solutions or that we have already worked it all out and that it is just a matter of putting a certain number of things into place is completely wrong.
—I didn't say that.
—No, you did not say that, but you implied at the end in your comments that all we had to do was get behind the Howard government. I can tell you this: the Howard government has not even begun to properly study the matter, never mind actually come up with solutions.
—That is not true.
—That is unfair.
—Okay: you say it is unfair, but let me back up my claim and statement. What is the Howard government's response to globalisation and to the issues which have brought these crises about? Basically, the Howard government's response to these issues and to One Nation is to say, `Oh well, there's nothing much you can do about globalisation; we've just got to go along with the flow, and whatever happens, happens.'
—We don't say that at all.
—What have you put into place? What has the Howard government put into place to protect Australia from the ravages of globalisation? Nothing.
—That's unfair.
—What lessons have been learnt by the Howard government in—
—Order!
—They are getting a bit excited, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—You are talking such claptrap.
—Is that right? You had plenty of time to give us an account of one single policy that the Howard government is putting forward in relation to this matter and you totally failed to do so.
—Order! The member for Calwell will resume his seat. The member for Indi raises a point of order.
—There are a number of points of order here. First of all, the member should address himself through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not personally to me. Secondly, with respect to the order and the proceedings in parliament when debating, sure, we can have robust debate and that is fine. But members should not be encouraged to misrepresent and lie about the coalition government's policies—and that is what the member was doing—because the whole standard of debate declines, and we are looking for a better performance from members.
—He is probably going to apologise.
—I hope he will; he is a decent man in his own heart, and I ask him to do that. My final point on the point of order is that he said that I did not make any specific points 
 about what the Howard-Fischer government was doing for this country. I therefore ask leave of the member to now add to what I said. Will he now sit down while I do that?
—I must address the point of order. On the first point of order, it is important for any speaker to address remarks through the chair: it makes the debate less confrontational. I would ask the member to be relevant to the issue, which is that the paper being considered be noted—
—And to apologise for his comments.
—I would ask all members to be quiet, please, because they will get their own opportunity to speak later.
—He should apologise.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, if you had been here to hear the broad ranging comments of the member for Indi, you would know what I am referring to. I am actually making a very substantial point, which is that—
—Are you going to apologise?
—For what?
—For the outrageous comment you made.
—Order! Members will not intervene—
—The outrageous comment!
—It was absolutely outrageous.
—The honourable member for Fisher—
—The fact of the matter is the Howard government has no response to the problems of globalisation or to the Asian crisis. There is no response. That is the fact of the matter. All you have to do is read the newspapers today. Mr Murdoch himself is quoted as saying that, so I do not know why you would take exception to what I am saying. Let me go further and explain why it is that the Howard government has no response to the globalisation issues.
—And apologise!
—Apologise for what?
—Order! The honourable member for Fisher will stop intervening, allow the member to make his contribution and then he will have his opportunity later. We are in a debate.
—Let me proceed, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the issue that I wish to raise is that, of course, there needs to be a thorough international analysis of what it is that has brought about the crisis in the Asian region. When Mr Murdoch said today that the situation is dangerous, he was right. There has not been any such analysis from any of the members opposite or from the government. In fact, what needs to be done is to look into the details of the situation and ask ourselves what brought this forward.
In the report itself, the speakers disagreed about what it was that brought the crisis on in Indonesia. They disagree amongst themselves. Some claim that Indonesia had brought the crisis on because it had overheated its economy and it had behaved irresponsibly with respect to international monetary targets. On the other hand, other speakers at the forum, including the main speaker on Indonesia, said that in fact the problem in Indonesia was not due to 
 overheating at all but to the way in which the international debt crisis was operating rather than any specific action on the part of the government of Indonesia to behave irresponsibly in overheating the economy. This was backed up by, for example, Mr Paul Kelly in his contribution, where he said that the problem in Indonesia had to do with the way in which the banking structure was operating and not to do with any obvious overheating of the Indonesian economy. So the reality is that even the experts are having trouble coming to grips with the causes of this phenomenon.
One of the things that I want to emphasise—and I actually agree with those who see this as more of a phenomenon having to do with the globalisation of the economy which has specifically hit Indonesia—is that it has to do with the way in which the international monetary system is operating at the moment and, in particular, the way in which international speculators are attacking specific currencies and the values of currencies of different nations around the globe.
People have forgotten that before the Indonesian crisis we had the attack on the Malaysian currency, although Malaysia was able to fend off that attack to some degree; we then had the attack on the Thai currency, then the attack on the South Korean currency, and it was in that series of attacks that we then had Indonesia. One has to ask: why are there these systematic attacks on the currencies of these Asian nations? Is it because they have not grown sufficiently over the years? Of course not. Is it because the economic strategies in those countries are so bad or contrary to international practice that they needed to be fixed up? That is not true either.
So what is the actual reason? The reason has to do with the decision by a number of speculators in international currencies. And I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every day on this planet one trillion dollars shifts around and changes between currencies of the world. One trillion dollars—that is one million million dollars—moves around. That is, more than the total GDP of Australia—twice the size of the GDP of Australia—moves around every day in relation to the movements of currencies.
The international monetary system has moved into an uncontrollable phase. This has been commented on by people from across the spectrum. I imagine that the son of the member for Indi has explained some aspects of this issue to his father. Speculators such as the notorious Mr Soros are moving billions of dollars around the different currencies of the world, attacking individual currencies, forcing their devaluation and they are making profits on the basis of revaluations that may occur. All of this speculative activity does not have any real relation to the growth and production of goods and services in those particular countries. It is possible to make millions—indeed billions—of dollars merely through shifting money around. Most of the currencies of the world have become deregulated in this way.
If you analyse the facts, when the Bretton Woods system broken down in 1971, the world began a series of international economic crises. Sometimes, we were able to get out of those crises temporarily. Some nations, like the Asian nations, were able to benefit from those crises and from what was happening to the Western world at that time. The Asian currencies ended up being overvalued and, more importantly, the exposure of their banks was so great that they became debt ridden. For example, in South Korea, 19 banks were bankrupted or rolled over. Why? Because the debt situation in South Korea was unsustainable.
If you think that was only the situation in South Korea, you are wrong. In many nations of the world, including Australia, the banks have been overexposing themselves. They have increasingly gone into debt and this whole international debt situation is going to come to a 
 critical point. It is unfortunate for Australia that it is coming to a critical point in the Asian region. As the member for Indi and others have said, it has meant that it is having an impact on our trade, our investment and our future prospects.
—That's why you should support the Howard government.
—Yes, but the member for Indi missed the point. The Howard government is not putting in place any policies to deal with this international debt crisis. You explain to me what they are putting in place to deal with it.
—Order! The honourable member for Calwell will resume his seat. The honourable member for Indi has had his opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. He will allow the member to be heard in silence in accordance with standing order 55. The honourable member for Calwell will continue.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. What is needed is an alternative strategy—not the Hanson strategy of excessive nationalism, but an alternative international strategy to deal with these issues that have been created and that have been referred to. Such an international strategy needs to be developed by this parliament on a bipartisan basis.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, just before I seek leave to adjourn the debate, may I just respond to a few of the things that the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) was saying? It is unbelievable that he would come up here and claim that we have done nothing to protect ourselves against what is happening in Asia. The very thing that we have done has been to sort out the mess that you left behind in 1996—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. His function is to adjourn the debate, not to speak without precedence in the debate. If he is going to speak I insist on a response.
—Order!
—I have every right to speak in this debate and make a few comments. The member for Calwell was talking about the debt in Asian countries and he has totally ignored the fact that, over the last five years, a government that he was part of whacked up debt averaging about $14 billion a year on a turnover of about $135 billion each year—an average of $14 billion each year on the Bankcard.
—The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will resume his seat. The honourable member for Calwell on a point of order.
—Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have been misrepresented. I was not referring to government debt, you fool; I was referring to the debt of the banks.
—Order! That is not a point of order. I have not called the honourable member. Does the honourable member have a point of order?
—On a point of order: I heard distinctly unparliamentary language from the honourable member, and I would ask that he withdraw it, because I can tell you now that this honourable member is no fool.
—Would you like to withdraw that insinuation?
—I withdraw.
—Thank you.
—Briefly, what we were faced with was a government that went out spending $14 billion on average every single year more than they were getting. What that did was take the debt from about $20 billion up to nearly $100 billion. If we had continued that, putting something on the Bankcard every year, what sort of mess would we be in, given what has happened in Asia? That is what we have done. We have made sure that we would not be in the same sort of mess. Under the forward estimates of the Labor government there was a continuation of it.
Can I give you a very quick comparison? It was a bit like a small business churning over about $1.3 million a year and losing tens of thousands of dollars every year, or a family on an income of about $30,000 a year having to get a Bankcard loan of $2,500 every single year for five years. That is what that is all about. That is what we did. We got rid of the debt that the Labor Party built up over five years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a further time.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—This report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled The Asian currency crisis  is a report on one of a number of seminars that the committee has held over the past 12 years. I pay tribute to the current Speaker of the parliament, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who when he was chair of the committee instigated this series of seminars. Of course, the current chairman, Senator MacGibbon, has ably carried that on.
These seminars are important. It is always a disappointment to me that they are not as well attended by parliamentary colleagues as perhaps I would like to see them being attended. We have all got tremendous demands on our time, but the seminars provide an input for members of parliament—and, indeed, the community—into whatever topic they may be discussing. As in this case—this is a transcript of the proceedings of the day—they are available in printed form. That also enables us in the Main Committee and in the main chamber to debate these issues. They are important, and I hope that these seminars will be carried on and will be well attended.
It is somewhat of a truism to say that the so-called Asian currency crisis came as a tremendous surprise to Australians—and not only to Australia but also to many other parts of the world. For many years, Asia had been held up as an example for us of the way to go and the way to deal with our economies, and constantly paraded before us were the growth rates of many Asian countries. As someone who knows Asia quite well and has visited there, I can well remember being in Indonesia a couple of years ago and being told what its growth rate was, how impressive it was and how it had continued to grow at this rate over a number of years. In fact, I remember meeting with the current president, President Habibie, in his former ministerial position, and being told about the dynamics of Indonesia.
One could repeat that theme for Malaysia. Malaysia, we were told, was growing at something like eight per cent, from memory; and we could go through all the Asian countries. I remember being on a Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegation to Thailand, and there again we were being told of the growth in Thailand. Of course, it was always held up to us in Australia that the Asians had found the secret for a rising standard of living and a continuous growth rate all the way.
Things came to a somewhat dramatic halt a year or so ago. As I say, for many of us, it was a surprise—not only because of the speed with which the crisis impacted on these countries but also because of the domino effect that seems to some of us to be occurring. It is true to say that there have been very different impacts, and there are also different future scenarios for many of those countries. For example, in countries such as Korea and Thailand, various structural adjustments will have to be made but, especially in the Korean case, because of the basic soundness of the economy, I have absolutely no doubt that Korea will continue on an upward trend and that growth will continue there. Undoubtedly, some pain will be imposed locally; nevertheless, the currency and the economy are so sound that growth will continue. To a lesser extent, the same will happen with Thailand, I have absolutely no doubt.
I am not as confident about Indonesia. Indonesia is paying the price, and will continue to pay the price for some time, for not having looked after the fundamentals of the economy and for having practised cronyism and other such things. There is a real problem with the economy of Indonesia, despite the efforts of the new President in so many fields—and one can only admire and support what he has been doing. Nevertheless, the medicine for the economic situation in Indonesia might be so severe that I worry that there could well be civil unrest there if it were given. So I have a worry about the long-term stability of Indonesian society, with problems brought on by the so-called Asian currency crisis.
Of course, no country, from a trade point of view, is more important to Australia than Japan. We all have to watch with a degree of concern what has happened in recent months with the Japanese economy. There has been no growth there, and as Japan has been such an engine house for Asia—and, indeed, for so many other parts of the world—and is Australia's most important trading partner, it has to be a matter of concern for us. We can only hope that the Japanese take the right corrective measures to make sure that that economy, which is so important for us and for Asia, continues to churn along as it should.
The worry, too, is that many of these things become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Only in the last couple of weeks, people have been talking about the impact on New Zealand and whether the New Zealand economy, because of the Asian crisis, is going to go through some of the turmoil we have seen in countries to our north. I am not sure about that; I am not familiar enough with the New Zealand economy to know if they can withstand it or not. I sometimes think that, especially in relation to Asia, we in Australia could learn somewhat from the New Zealanders because when you go through Asia you see signs for New Zealand produce, and in so many parts of the world, and much more so than you see Australian produce.
Interestingly, I saw a letter to the Illawarra Mercury one day this week or last week in which the candidate for the One Nation Party for the seat of Gilmore was talking about trade, accusing members of parliament and other people of being traitors because we had signed various trade agreements and posing the question at the end of this letter whether we should be or could be tried as traitors to the country. It is all very well to bandy words about, especially emotive words, but I would say that the real traitors to this country are those who by their actions, words and deeds have brought us into such disrepute with our neighbours to the north, in Asia.
Many Australians do not realise just how important Asia is to Australia, not only because of the fact that two-thirds of our exports go to Asia but because our future is very much tied up with Asia. Those who complain about us becoming `Asianised' and other words like that are often those people who will suffer most if Asia turns its back on us.
We are all experts on the recent Queensland state election—I have never seen so many experts so quickly in any place! The one thing that surprises me about the Queensland state election is that that part of Queensland that voted so strongly for One Nation, that beautiful coastal area, is so dependent on tourism. Much of that tourism comes from Asia. It would seem to me, as an outsider—I am not a Queenslander; I am not an expert on it—that the message that that area of Australia was sending to Asia is a wrong message because that area of Australia is so dependent on Asia. I do not know if people do not realise that or have been deluded into thinking otherwise.
This report and the seminar made it abundantly clear that we in Australia cannot divorce ourselves from Asia. Asia is important to Australia. There has been some criticism in Australia of our contribution to the rescue packages following the financial troubles in Asia. But it is not in Australia's interest to see Asian economies collapse. I know there have been arguments about whether we should have so much tied up in Asia. But our future, as I keep saying, is very much with Asia. I think there is a legitimate argument about how dependent we are on that trade; about whether we, under the Labor government or under the present government, have worked our way to being too dependent on Asia, that too much of our trade has been tied up or too much of our investment has been in that one area.
It always surprises me that Australia only seems to be able to deal with one region at a time. When China was the flavour of the month everything went into China; when Europe was the flavour of the month everything went into Europe; when Asia was the flavour of the month, we put everything into Asia. I think there is a legitimate argument that we should be looking for new markets but we should never disregard old markets for the flavour of the new market. I think we should have a very balanced approach.
In many respects, we have no option but to have most of our trade with Asia. With the European Economic Community, Europe turns its back on Australia. Countries like Britain find their future in Europe, and I have no argument with that. So Australia finds its future within Asia. But we should not just look at the narrow part of Asia immediately to our north. We should look at a wider area. For instance, India is a country that we often neglect or take for granted. Only this week we debated in parliament a report from the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, Australia's trade relationship with India—Commonwealth, common language, cricket and beyond. I do not think that got a mention in any newspaper in Australia. There is so much potential for trade with India but we ignore it and I think we ignore it at our peril.
As much as some might like, we cannot go back to the 1950s when the world wanted what Australia was producing. Europe was emerging from the Second World War and we were producing what Europe wanted. We live in a completely different society today. We have to compete. It is a very competitive world out there and we have got to be smarter than, or as smart as, the others. We have got to compete. No-one owes Australia a living and we should not expect it.
The Asian currency crisis will impact on Australia. It is impacting now and it will continue to impact. Despite what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) might say, Australia is not fireproofed from what is happening in Asia. Indeed, given the nature of the world today, I do not think any country can be fireproofed from Asia. We are so intimately tied up with Asia—and that point has been made in various places in this report—that it is impossible, as much as we might like it, to completely fireproof ourselves from Asia.
I commend this report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, The Asian currency crisis to honourable members, especially those who have an interest in what is happening in Asia. It does not provide all the answers. In fact, in many cases, it raises as many questions as it provides answers. On the day, the speakers came from different perspectives and, of course, they had different ideas and a different analysis of the problem and a different prognosis about what the solution may be. I congratulate the committee, especially the former chair and the current chair for arranging this seminar, and the staff who were involved in it. I commend it to the House, and may these seminars continue.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—I would also like to commend the present chair of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Senator David MacGibbon, and his predecessor, our current Speaker, the Rt. Hon. Ian Sinclair, for their initiative in bringing together what I regard as one of the most important and perhaps prophetic seminars that has been held by this parliament in this parliamentary term since the election in 1996. It brought together a wide range of views and people who are experts in their field from various parts of Australia's economy and the world. As the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, The Asian currency crisis , is hard work but it is essential reading for a lot of Australians both inside and outside parliament as a means of getting some more insight into what is going on with the Asian economies.
I mention also that, by coincidence, I noticed today in the Age a very comprehensive magazine type article on the Asian situation. It is entitled `The year that Asia shook the world'—a prophetic headline. I have the pages here. It is a pity we cannot screen them into Hansard. Also accompanying the feature in the Age today—and I commend the Age for its work in this area—is a report on a speech made by Rupert Murdoch in which he makes some comments and observations about Australia and the Asian crisis. They are very interesting comments. I do not agree entirely with all of the comments and all the analysis in the Age, but it is certainly well worth while having a look at them.
I just wanted to make a general comment first about the contributions by all the speakers. There was some conflict between them all, as the member for Throsby pointed out, as to what was going on, what was needed, what the various manifestations of the crisis were in respect of all of the countries. To me, what came out quite clearly was confirmation that, because of Australia's juxtaposition geographically with Asian countries and because of our own economy—a market economy—and because we are a trading nation, we could not ignore what was going on. That was obvious. Everyone agreed on that.
The second point was perhaps an obvious statement but I would like to make it. The various problems in each Asian country will have a regional effect with their trading partners, like Australia, and not so much an international effect. In other respects, the effect in those countries will also have an international effect. Work that one out. But, really, if you step back from that statement, you will understand that the crisis is indeed a very severe one and a very serious one. I think it is fair for me to say it will have both an international effect and a regional effect, and it is indeed having that.
The other observation I would like to make is that for those of us in the Australian parliament now, and for those who aspire to be here to replace those of us here, I do not think there has ever been a time since the Second World War that this country has needed such unity, dedication, courage and strength to face the challenges that are coming knocking on 
 our door now because of the Asian crisis. This nation and the people who are going to vote at the next election, whenever it might be, need to make absolutely certain that they fully understand the nature and extent of the policies of all the aspirants from all the political parties and the Independents, because there will probably be a lot of those as well, and the effect that those policies would have immediately and medium term and long term on the future of our country and—in simpler terms—on the future of our children and their children.
That I think is the crucial issue. This seminar and the transcript help us to grapple with that. I wish everyone in Australia who is a voter would take the trouble to read and study all this. I know they will not. I know that we have had a manifestation since the Queensland election of people, who are rightly worried and concerned about Australia's future, taking what appears to be a simplistic approach to what is needed, without going into policy in depth.
I do not want to be disrespectful to those people who voted against the major parties in Queensland and shifted to One Nation. Many of those people are decent Australians. There is no question or doubt about that. I would make an appeal to those people—excluding the fanatical ones from whom you will never get a change of attitude; indeed, I do not think we should even try because of some of the frightening extremism that they are capable of exhibiting—who have shown their dissatisfaction and concern about Australia and voted for One Nation, that whatever decision they make in the federal election should be based on research, knowledge, intense examination of the policies of all the parties and then application of the test that I think we all should apply: `Will these policies benefit or prejudice the future of my children and their children?'
They should remind themselves that, since white settlement in Australia, we have gone through some pretty hard times. We talk about our families' experiences and no doubt we have all had different mixtures of background and upbringing. But I can remember, when my late mother had to be moved to a nursing home from the family home, we found a cupboard full of tinned food and it was dated, some of it, back into the 1940s—condensed milk and all that—and this was only two or three years ago. My elder sister, who had a greater knowledge of my late mother's housekeeping, said that that was the cupboard that we were never allowed to touch because mother had gone through difficult times with depressions and wars and she always made sure there was a store of food for the family to be fed in case hard times came again.
In saying that, I would like to pay tribute to the Australians in our community who have gone through hard times and are still going through hard times, who can show, through their strength and courage and example, what a nation is really made of when we face a crisis such as the Asian crisis and what is needed.
We should also acknowledge that not one of us in our present generation should forget that, when we took over as the adults in the family and the businesses and whatever we did, and now in parliament for some of us, we were handed an Australia that was better than our parents had. They in their turn received one better than their grandparents had. There were more opportunities for us and we must remember that they put a lot of hard work in and put up with a lot and sacrificed a lot to get us there, as did our new Australians, our migrants—and my dad was not a migrant but he came from another country in the 1920s after fighting in the First World War against the Germans in France, then via America into Australia. The stories that he used to tell me about what they had to put up with in England were just frightening. Most of the new arrivals in Australia since the Second World War went through 
 terrible times, but fought through and helped build this country into the great country it is today.
All of us must remember, when we vote at the next election, having regard to the things that are there now—the serious Asian crisis—that we have a responsibility to try to hand the country over to our kids so that they have more opportunity than we had, maintaining the tradition of our parents before us and their parents before them. That, I think, is the plea that I make.
Now let me get down to the perhaps stark information that is referred to. Murdoch said yesterday that with the risk of more Asian turmoil he has urged Australia to assert itself better. He said:
This is a tremendously dangerous time. We are dealing here with more than a normal currency crisis.
And so on. In the survey of economists—and I do not want to be disrespectful to economists because my young son is an economist and I am proud of him—they are all different; they have all got different views. The majority of them thought that the economic trouble in Asia would get worse—as if we did not know that. There are a few more optimistic ones that say at the same time that it will get worse but will get better—and that is quite a challenge. How on earth can you do that when we have got so much disunity in this country now? If anyone thinks that this country can go through the Asian crisis and get better as we go, without unity and strength and courage, working together and with a decent compact of policies, they are deluding themselves. Disunity will in fact make the wheel fall off. It will make it harder.
The other point I would make is that in the same pages there is an excellent summary of each country—Japan, China, Hong Kong and the rest. Obviously it is an oversimplification in some cases, but in the case of Japan it says:
What analysts fear most is another surge in the US dollar and a weakening of the yen as international markets lose faith in Japan's willingness to reform.
Interesting. They of course are in a recession now.
There is not a lot said about China in the report but we must remember that China has so far weathered Asia's economic turmoil, although there are now signals that China is facing a serious downturn. The reference to banks is worth reading; it is pretty chilling. As for Hong Kong, the government there announced its May reforms. There will be negative growth in Hong Kong for the first time in 13 years, and most analysts now believe that even tougher times are ahead.
As for Indonesia, many analysts believe that recovery there is inevitable but that there will be problems along the way, as if we did not know. Regarding Thailand, the most common criticism about Thailand is that high interest rates are strangling the real economy, and that situation still goes on. Concerning South Korea, it is expected that South Korea's economy will shrink by a further four per cent. South Korea is one of our biggest purchasers of traded items but it will be two or three years before manufacturing there is strong again.
I have some knowledge of Asian trade but I need to learn a lot more, and I try to. There is no doubt about the Asians. There is one thing you should remember: they have been through tough times before and they have shown that they have the ability to come together and work through them. So when they do come out of all of this they are going to be the most formidable competitors that you have ever seen. They are now, but they are going to be even more formidable in the future.
That should send a strong signal to Australia. Australia has not got time to be lax. We have not got time for division. We have not got time to adopt simplistic, stupid policies that will set us back. What we have to do is go forward. We must not shirk our responsibilities. If we do shirk them over the next two or three years and think that it will all be coming to us, things will get harder, not easier. When these economies in Asia do recover they are going to be more formidable traders. Also, they will be more substantial buyers of our goods. So you can see the dual challenge that is there for us.
In my electorate I have a number of value added manufacturing industries that export to Asia. I can tell you that already we have had some retrenchments. We are fighting like mad to find new markets. One company, with the assistance of Austrade and the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer), was able to get a container into a new market in America. Picking up on what the member for Throsby said, we must try to find other baskets and not just have all our eggs in one basket. There is a lot of work going on there.
I would like to pay tribute to the staff and management of the manufacturing industries in regional Australia, in areas like mine, who are doing a fantastic job to produce high quality, value added exports. They are trying to weather the storm and find new markets while this crisis goes on. Also, they are trying to help their Asian partners as well. We must not turn our back on our Asian friends. We have to be true friends in these difficult times, as I believe we are given the assistance and all of the—
—It is in our own self-interest as well.
—Of course it is. It is in our interest from an economic and a social point of view. The natural thing to do is to help our fellow human beings. And, of course, from a security point of view it is also in our interest. We have a huge set of challenges.
Finally, I call on the other political parties to support the coalition in its endeavours. If ever there was a time for a war cabinet, it is now. Support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Trade and help us deal with the simplistic nonsense from One Nation that will destroy and threaten our trade and security. Stop obstructing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade from doing what they are trying to do. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate. I might say that I agree with a lot of the sentiments of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), but he seems to think that the Howard government has a solution to the problems of Asia. He was very good at quoting Mr Murdoch and other people in the newspaper, but none of those people think that. The reality is that the government has no solution to the problems of Asia.
It is true that the simplistic solutions of One Nation are obviously not going to work. They would not have any impact if ever they were to be put into place. In fact they are reactionary, with an emphasis on some kind of vague idea of nationalism, ethnic chauvinism and fear of other cultures in society. I agree with the member for Indi that One Nation has no solutions to these matters; but, as for suggesting that somehow the Howard government has shown leadership in this matter, you can read Mr Murdoch's comments very well. Mr Murdoch is saying that Australia needs to do more; it needs to show more leadership and to get more engaged in the problems which exist in the Asian region.
The report on the Asian currency crisis, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, was interesting because of the issues that it raised. It is interesting that the seminar was on 19 March. Since then, there have been dramatic changes and further events have evolved, 
 unforeseen even by the speakers themselves. Not too many of the speakers foresaw the dramatic changes that would occur in Indonesia, for example, in relation to the at least partial changing of the regime there and the stepping down of President Suharto.
The thing that is very important when discussing these issues is that we have to be honest, and the member for Indi should note this. It is true that One Nation has no solutions to these issues, but to pretend that we all have the solutions or that we have already worked it all out and that it is just a matter of putting a certain number of things into place is completely wrong.
—I didn't say that.
—No, you did not say that, but you implied at the end in your comments that all we had to do was get behind the Howard government. I can tell you this: the Howard government has not even begun to properly study the matter, never mind actually come up with solutions.
—That is not true.
—That is unfair.
—Okay: you say it is unfair, but let me back up my claim and statement. What is the Howard government's response to globalisation and to the issues which have brought these crises about? Basically, the Howard government's response to these issues and to One Nation is to say, `Oh well, there's nothing much you can do about globalisation; we've just got to go along with the flow, and whatever happens, happens.'
—We don't say that at all.
—What have you put into place? What has the Howard government put into place to protect Australia from the ravages of globalisation? Nothing.
—That's unfair.
—What lessons have been learnt by the Howard government in—
—Order!
—They are getting a bit excited, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—You are talking such claptrap.
—Is that right? You had plenty of time to give us an account of one single policy that the Howard government is putting forward in relation to this matter and you totally failed to do so.
—Order! The member for Calwell will resume his seat. The member for Indi raises a point of order.
—There are a number of points of order here. First of all, the member should address himself through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not personally to me. Secondly, with respect to the order and the proceedings in parliament when debating, sure, we can have robust debate and that is fine. But members should not be encouraged to misrepresent and lie about the coalition government's policies—and that is what the member was doing—because the whole standard of debate declines, and we are looking for a better performance from members.
—He is probably going to apologise.
—I hope he will; he is a decent man in his own heart, and I ask him to do that. My final point on the point of order is that he said that I did not make any specific points 
 about what the Howard-Fischer government was doing for this country. I therefore ask leave of the member to now add to what I said. Will he now sit down while I do that?
—I must address the point of order. On the first point of order, it is important for any speaker to address remarks through the chair: it makes the debate less confrontational. I would ask the member to be relevant to the issue, which is that the paper being considered be noted—
—And to apologise for his comments.
—I would ask all members to be quiet, please, because they will get their own opportunity to speak later.
—He should apologise.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, if you had been here to hear the broad ranging comments of the member for Indi, you would know what I am referring to. I am actually making a very substantial point, which is that—
—Are you going to apologise?
—For what?
—For the outrageous comment you made.
—Order! Members will not intervene—
—The outrageous comment!
—It was absolutely outrageous.
—The honourable member for Fisher—
—The fact of the matter is the Howard government has no response to the problems of globalisation or to the Asian crisis. There is no response. That is the fact of the matter. All you have to do is read the newspapers today. Mr Murdoch himself is quoted as saying that, so I do not know why you would take exception to what I am saying. Let me go further and explain why it is that the Howard government has no response to the globalisation issues.
—And apologise!
—Apologise for what?
—Order! The honourable member for Fisher will stop intervening, allow the member to make his contribution and then he will have his opportunity later. We are in a debate.
—Let me proceed, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the issue that I wish to raise is that, of course, there needs to be a thorough international analysis of what it is that has brought about the crisis in the Asian region. When Mr Murdoch said today that the situation is dangerous, he was right. There has not been any such analysis from any of the members opposite or from the government. In fact, what needs to be done is to look into the details of the situation and ask ourselves what brought this forward.
In the report itself, the speakers disagreed about what it was that brought the crisis on in Indonesia. They disagree amongst themselves. Some claim that Indonesia had brought the crisis on because it had overheated its economy and it had behaved irresponsibly with respect to international monetary targets. On the other hand, other speakers at the forum, including the main speaker on Indonesia, said that in fact the problem in Indonesia was not due to 
 overheating at all but to the way in which the international debt crisis was operating rather than any specific action on the part of the government of Indonesia to behave irresponsibly in overheating the economy. This was backed up by, for example, Mr Paul Kelly in his contribution, where he said that the problem in Indonesia had to do with the way in which the banking structure was operating and not to do with any obvious overheating of the Indonesian economy. So the reality is that even the experts are having trouble coming to grips with the causes of this phenomenon.
One of the things that I want to emphasise—and I actually agree with those who see this as more of a phenomenon having to do with the globalisation of the economy which has specifically hit Indonesia—is that it has to do with the way in which the international monetary system is operating at the moment and, in particular, the way in which international speculators are attacking specific currencies and the values of currencies of different nations around the globe.
People have forgotten that before the Indonesian crisis we had the attack on the Malaysian currency, although Malaysia was able to fend off that attack to some degree; we then had the attack on the Thai currency, then the attack on the South Korean currency, and it was in that series of attacks that we then had Indonesia. One has to ask: why are there these systematic attacks on the currencies of these Asian nations? Is it because they have not grown sufficiently over the years? Of course not. Is it because the economic strategies in those countries are so bad or contrary to international practice that they needed to be fixed up? That is not true either.
So what is the actual reason? The reason has to do with the decision by a number of speculators in international currencies. And I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every day on this planet one trillion dollars shifts around and changes between currencies of the world. One trillion dollars—that is one million million dollars—moves around. That is, more than the total GDP of Australia—twice the size of the GDP of Australia—moves around every day in relation to the movements of currencies.
The international monetary system has moved into an uncontrollable phase. This has been commented on by people from across the spectrum. I imagine that the son of the member for Indi has explained some aspects of this issue to his father. Speculators such as the notorious Mr Soros are moving billions of dollars around the different currencies of the world, attacking individual currencies, forcing their devaluation and they are making profits on the basis of revaluations that may occur. All of this speculative activity does not have any real relation to the growth and production of goods and services in those particular countries. It is possible to make millions—indeed billions—of dollars merely through shifting money around. Most of the currencies of the world have become deregulated in this way.
If you analyse the facts, when the Bretton Woods system broken down in 1971, the world began a series of international economic crises. Sometimes, we were able to get out of those crises temporarily. Some nations, like the Asian nations, were able to benefit from those crises and from what was happening to the Western world at that time. The Asian currencies ended up being overvalued and, more importantly, the exposure of their banks was so great that they became debt ridden. For example, in South Korea, 19 banks were bankrupted or rolled over. Why? Because the debt situation in South Korea was unsustainable.
If you think that was only the situation in South Korea, you are wrong. In many nations of the world, including Australia, the banks have been overexposing themselves. They have increasingly gone into debt and this whole international debt situation is going to come to a 
 critical point. It is unfortunate for Australia that it is coming to a critical point in the Asian region. As the member for Indi and others have said, it has meant that it is having an impact on our trade, our investment and our future prospects.
—That's why you should support the Howard government.
—Yes, but the member for Indi missed the point. The Howard government is not putting in place any policies to deal with this international debt crisis. You explain to me what they are putting in place to deal with it.
—Order! The honourable member for Calwell will resume his seat. The honourable member for Indi has had his opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. He will allow the member to be heard in silence in accordance with standing order 55. The honourable member for Calwell will continue.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. What is needed is an alternative strategy—not the Hanson strategy of excessive nationalism, but an alternative international strategy to deal with these issues that have been created and that have been referred to. Such an international strategy needs to be developed by this parliament on a bipartisan basis. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1998-07-02,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, just before I seek leave to adjourn the debate, may I just respond to a few of the things that the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) was saying? It is unbelievable that he would come up here and claim that we have done nothing to protect ourselves against what is happening in Asia. The very thing that we have done has been to sort out the mess that you left behind in 1996—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. His function is to adjourn the debate, not to speak without precedence in the debate. If he is going to speak I insist on a response.
—Order!
—I have every right to speak in this debate and make a few comments. The member for Calwell was talking about the debt in Asian countries and he has totally ignored the fact that, over the last five years, a government that he was part of whacked up debt averaging about $14 billion a year on a turnover of about $135 billion each year—an average of $14 billion each year on the Bankcard.
—The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will resume his seat. The honourable member for Calwell on a point of order.
—Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have been misrepresented. I was not referring to government debt, you fool; I was referring to the debt of the banks.
—Order! That is not a point of order. I have not called the honourable member. Does the honourable member have a point of order?
—On a point of order: I heard distinctly unparliamentary language from the honourable member, and I would ask that he withdraw it, because I can tell you now that this honourable member is no fool.
—Would you like to withdraw that insinuation?
—I withdraw.
—Thank you.
—Briefly, what we were faced with was a government that went out spending $14 billion on average every single year more than they were getting. What that did was take the debt from about $20 billion up to nearly $100 billion. If we had continued that, putting something on the Bankcard every year, what sort of mess would we be in, given what has happened in Asia? That is what we have done. We have made sure that we would not be in the same sort of mess. Under the forward estimates of the Labor government there was a continuation of it.
Can I give you a very quick comparison? It was a bit like a small business churning over about $1.3 million a year and losing tens of thousands of dollars every year, or a family on an income of about $30,000 a year having to get a Bankcard loan of $2,500 every single year for five years. That is what that is all about. That is what we did. We got rid of the debt that the Labor Party built up over five years. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a further time.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-07-02,"—This week members would have received this document from the St Vincent de Paul Society entitled In defence of the bush . The statement gives examples of how government policies, closures in essential services and industries, are hurting rural New South Wales. In many ways the hurt being felt in the bush is also being felt in the cities but the effects are slower due to marginally better employment opportunities and services in the city.
The long-term effects of economic rationalist policies are being felt right across Australia with employment opportunities in rail, Telstra, the Roads and Traffic Authority, county councils and banks dwindling as we speak. The point the government is missing in the economic debate is that people go into business to create wealth, not to create jobs. Employment is only incidental to their business and profit is the main motive. There is no incentive for business to employ people; they only do this if it assists in the profitability of their company. In a balanced economy there is a role for government enterprise, private industry and small business to complement each other and maximise employment opportunities.
The social justice statement refers to the Commonwealth government's reduction of tariffs on imported orange juice to five per cent. Australian growers can no longer compete with Brazilian orange juice concentrate which is imported at $30 per tonne compared to local production costs of $200 per tonne. The document states that citrus growers in southern New South Wales are bulldozing and burning half a million healthy 40-year-old Valencia orange trees because they cannot afford to pick and sell the fruit. The point is made that the reduction in tariffs to five per cent can be contrasted with the fact that imports of Australian juice into Brazil are subject to a 40 per cent tariff.
An example is given in the document of the effects of a closure of a central service in country towns. The example relates to the closure of a bank in the northern New South Wales town of Mungindi. This town had one bank until August 1996 when one month's notice was given that it was being closed as a result of a feasibility study showing that it was unprofitable. Customers were told that their accounts would be transferred to Moree which is 120 kilometres away. A number of alternative methods of banking were tried for this town and currently a credit union is operating successfully, but business in Mungindi did suffer and people travelled to Moree to do their shopping and banking.
The statement also refers to the closure of the Cobar mine where 260 workers lost their jobs overnight. The workers were laid off with a month's wages and accrued annual leave still owing. The work force was owed approximately $9 million. The Ghana based Ashanti Goldfields refused to meet its legal commitment to its work force. Every business in Cobar felt the flow-on effects of this closure, with at least $1 million owing to local enterprises; 18 full-time workers at the brickworks were sacked as the mining company owed the brickworks $145,000; an engineering workshop was left with a bad debt of $90,000, forcing the retrenchment of five full-time workers and the jobs of the company trainees and apprentices also under threat; a local hardware store has been forced to lay off two full-time staff and three casuals; and cafes, corner stores and other retailers have cut casual staff. The most devastating effect that happened in Cobar also happens in metropolitan areas when a company closes its doors. The effect is not so immediate but the slow drip of insecurity starts immediately the company announces its decision to close its plant.
Take the case of Dow Corning which has begun a two-year phase-out of manufacturing operations at its Blacktown plant. About 40 employees will be affected by this decision. The company representative when asked how staff had reacted to the news said, `There was shock, surprise, distress and anxiety.'
I am sure this is the way many Australians are feeling today with this government being more interested in having a budget surplus than meeting its commitment to the unemployed, the aged and the young families, particularly those in rural Australia, whose plight is set out in the St Vincent de Paul Society's social justice statement.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Social Justice </title>,Adjournment,37,1,speech
