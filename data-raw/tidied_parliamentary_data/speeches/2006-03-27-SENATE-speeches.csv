"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and McEwen today relating to changes to industrial relations.
We saw today, yet again, the Howard government’s extreme approach to industrial relations. What was confirmed yet again is that their ideological blinkers will not let them be swayed in their determination to impose further reductions in the rights which are afforded to Australian workers. We know this because Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, said in his speech to the HR Nicholls Society:
We do need to seek a mandate from the Australian people at the next election for another wave of industrial relations reforms.
And today in the Senate, on a day when four million or more Australian workers will lose their right to challenge an unfair dismissal, this minister refuses to indicate which of the few rights remaining under this government’s extreme laws will be in this government’s gun sights in the future. We have a situation where this government has already pared down Australians’ fragile rights to a bare minimum. What we want to know is: will it be sick leave? Will it be parental leave? Will it be the concept of a minimum wage? Will it be hours of work? Will it be annual leave? Or will it be all of them—will they all be up for grabs?
What we saw today is Senator Minchin again describing this as a moderate and reasonable package and saying that Australia will still have a more regulated system than a number of other countries. If what he is referring to is the United States, I say: thank goodness for that. We in this country, until this government came to power, have always opposed the American social model: the concept of the working poor and the sort of dog-eat-dog situation in workplaces that we fear will come under this legislation. So what we think was confirmed again in question time today is that there is more to come. What we saw was Minister Minchin refusing to rule out which of the few rights which remain will in fact not be targeted by this government in the future.
On top of that, Senator Vanstone, in an extraordinary flight of fancy in answer to a question from Senator McEwen, did not address the issue of the workers in South Australia at Murray Bridge and at Naracoorte but went off on a discussion of a whole range of other issues associated with visas. I say this at the outset: there is nobody in the Labor Party who is opposed to foreign workers coming into Australia if—I stress if—that is appropriate. What we say is: you do not abuse and rort a visa process to allow unscrupulous employers to employ foreign workers when Australians could be employed. You do not allow a situation where a skilled visa is used to essentially cut the cost of labour through the exploitation of foreign workers, wherever they might be from, who are performing jobs which do not comply with the visa classifications. What was put to Senator Vanstone in relation to the so-called skilled visas for the workers identified by Senator McEwen is that her own department had suggested they were not in fact doing skilled work.
So what is facing Australian workers under this government? First, there is a situation where this government does not ensure that unscrupulous employers do not rort a visa process such that it simply deprives an Australian of a job they would otherwise legitimately have had. But, more importantly, we have had clearly articulated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in his speech to the HR Nicholls Society that there is more to come.
What we do know is this: what if we have a situation where an employer unfairly dismisses employees and replaces them with people on a so-called skilled visa? First, we can have absolutely no confidence that there will be any rights to remedies for the workers involved. We know that what this government has done is to remove unfair dismissal rights from four million Australian workers. Second, do we have any confidence whatsoever that DIMA will ensure that the visa has been appropriately applied? Do we have any confidence that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will ensure that skilled visas are in fact used to bring in skilled workers where there is a skills shortage in Australia? Because our concerns are that that is not the way they are being utilised by a number of employers. The meshing of a number of Howard government policies will make jobs for Australians more insecure and will reduce their rights at work, and the worst thing about this is that we know from Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that there will be more to come.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-03-27,"—I find it fascinating that here we are back after a three-week break and we have an opposition that again is just absolutely, totally devoid of any policy input into this country at all—not one single word. This debate is characterised by a comment allegedly made at a dinner meeting. Did we hear one word today about protecting Australian workers? Did we hear one word today about an acknowledgement of the fact that strong economic growth is the quickest and simplest way to protect Australian workers? Why is it that the Australian Labor Party seems totally incapable of cutting its ties with the union movement, which invariably involves the destruction of workers’ rights in this country, but instead promotes the trade union movement?
There is nothing clearer in my view, nothing clearer at all, than to look at what has happened in relation to real wages in this country since 1996 to see who has got the policies right in relation to Australian workers. There has been a 16 per cent plus increase in real wages since 1996 compared to 1.2 per cent for the 13 years when the Australian Labor Party was last in government. It seems to me that the ALP continues to treat Australian workers as fools because, I tell you what, there is not one Australian worker who will forget the recession of the 1990s—the recession we had to have. No amount of regulation protected the jobs of those workers; no regulation protected those jobs.
I remember in my home city of Ballarat two in three shops in the main street were closed. No regulation protected the jobs of the workers in those shops. What lost those jobs for those Australian workers was the inability of the Australian Labor Party to run a strong economy and the inability of the Australian Labor Party to bring in appropriate reforms to make sure we maintained a strong economy and therefore maintained jobs growth. Since 1996 there have been 1.7 million new jobs created in this country. That is what this government is doing for the Australian worker and part of that process has been reform—industrial relations reform. I remember after the last round the Chicken Littles came out and said the world was going to collapse—the world as we knew it was going to collapse. What have we seen since? Low inflation, unemployment down to about five per cent and strong jobs growth. That is the outcome of those last reforms: a strengthened economy and a strengthened opportunity for Australian workers.
I noticed that in the Bendigo Advertiser today, the very, very marginal member for Bendigo was talking about industrial relations reform. Remember, we have to go back to the last two days. This is Chicken Little and the world is just about to collapse; the world as we know it will collapse because of these IR reforms, apparently. This is what the member for Bendigo said:
“It will be a slow burn,” the Opposition MP said. “It won’t be for 12 or 18 months that workers look back and see that their wages and conditions have been reduced.”
Australian workers know exactly what their wages and conditions are. Australian workers know exactly what has happened to their wages and conditions under this government. If the Australian Labor Party spent less time trying to remove people such as Ann Corcoran, a hardworking local member, from politics—if they spent less time trying to remove the Ann Corcorans of this world—and actually did something about policy development then they would be substantially stronger. The Australian Labor Party owes Ann Corcoran— (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I rise today to support the motion to take note of answers to questions that were provided by Ministers Vanstone and Minchin. Today is a red letter day for the Howard government, we have to say, because finally today it gets to impose on Australian workers an industrial relations agenda that is so extreme that even the ultra-extremist HR Nicholls Society is critical of it. All of the government ministers’ finest rhetoric and quotes cannot disguise the reality of more than 1,000 pages of legislation and regulations—more than 1,000 pages that will undo more than 100 years of struggle by the workers of this country to build an Australian workplace system based on the notion of a fair go for everyone. It was a system that had as its centrepiece the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It was a system that had as its starting point industrial awards that guaranteed all employees a fair wage and which meant that employers were not forced to reduce wages to give themselves an advantage against their competitors.
It was a system that gave employees who were unfairly dismissed the right to challenge their termination of employment and seek redress. It was a system that allowed the states to have their own industrial relations systems, systems that were by and large simple for employers and employees to use. It was a system that enabled unions, through test cases, to apply for changes to working arrangements that benefited all workers and their families, not just union members. Let us not forget that it was unions, in 120 years of struggle, who fought for paid annual leave, paid sick leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, redundancy pay and a plethora of other workplace benefits. The legislation that comes into effect today is a shameless attack on the ability of unions to continue to do that work on behalf of all Australians and their families. As we know from Senator Minchin’s comments to the HR Nicholls Society, there are people in the government who do not think the legislation has gone far enough and who want to implement an even more extreme agenda to send us further down the path of the American system of low pay, no security, take it or leave it workplace arrangements.
It is a very curious thing that a government that engages endlessly in rhetoric about freedom, choice, individual rights and doing away with third party interference has today implemented an industrial system that has a centralised federal government on front and centre stage, a government that will now be able to wield power to veto arrangements that employers and employees may want to willingly enter into. The hypocrisy of the government’s legislation is astounding. It is a curious thing indeed that the government that talks about reducing the ability of third parties to interfere in workplace arrangements has just imposed on the employers of Australia a whole gamut of regulatory organisations and government bodies that can legitimately meddle in an employer’s affairs, even if the employer does not want them there.
That is just an extension of the extremism and out-of-control ideology that we have seen from this government—and they call us centralists; they call us communists! You have to ask! I can only assume that the government ministers who spoke today think they will be able to dupe the Australian workforce with their weasel words and their rhetoric. I do not think that will work. Australian workers were not duped by the $21 million Work Choices booklet, five million of which still remain stored in warehouses in Sydney and Brisbane at a cost of $8,000 a month to the Australian taxpayer. They were not duped by that and I do not think they will be duped by the words that we have heard here today.
The meatworkers at Teys abattoirs in Naracoorte in South Australia certainly will not be duped. They have already seen what can happen when an out of control government’s legislative agenda enables them to be forced to sign AWAs when they really want to be under a collective agreement. They have seen what happens when an uncaring, incompetent Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs allows her department to bring in foreign labour to do the work of Australians for lower wages. The workers at Teys Brothers will not forget, just as we on this side will not forget. Those Teys workers should be applauded for standing up on behalf of all Australian workers to try and defend— (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-03-27,"—I want to assure Senator McEwen that I have not—and I do not know of any of my colleagues who have—called her a communist. The wall fell down a long time ago. Rest assured, Senator McEwen, we do not accuse you of communism at all. We say, though, that you and those on the other side are out of date old socialists. There is a slight difference. You are defending an old, regulated, centralist system of the early 1900s. That is what we accuse you of: a protectionist attitude to defend your union masters. We quite understand that you have to come in here. Your preselections depend on that, and the latest round of preselections in Victoria is evidence of it. It is evidence of just how the union movement controls your preselections.
We understand you have to come in here, as desperate as you are, trying to throw up haunting scenarios that may occur under the new industrial relations laws. But as Senator Ronaldson said—and he put it as plain as day; you ought to go out and market test what he said—the Australian public, let alone the Australian workers, know the results of the first round of industrial relations reforms in 1996. They are not going to be scared by you ever again. Under any analysis, the first round of reforms in 1996—having introduced Australian workplace agreements, the Employment Advocate and those sorts of first introductions—was more extreme, if you like to use that word, and more reforming than this one. Yet what have we seen? We have seen that the results are on the board, the jury is in and the proof is in the pudding. Regardless of the rhetoric you ran in that time, you cannot defend the score on the board. We have an employment rate of around five per cent, the lowest in some 30 years.
What is the essence of any government policy? What does every portfolio actually boil down to? It boils down to the employment rate. Employment is the true acid test of a government. It is something that, when you were in government, you failed miserably at, setting records of unemployment. This government is setting records of low unemployment. You had a million unemployed at your peak; we have some 500,000 to 600,000 unemployed—five per cent. My point is that that is the test of any government. It is the essence of any industrial relations system that gets people employed. Workers have, over the past 10 years, enjoyed real wages growth. It is not just employment that they are achieving, but also real wages growth. So their standards of living have improved. Those dual figures prove beyond doubt that the first tranche of industrial relations reforms in 1996 was a success, yet you come in here and run the same old arguments against this second tranche of industrial relations reforms. It simply will not wash out there, whatever market testing you seek to do.
This new reform process is a continuation of the government’s earlier reform. It is an integral part of maintaining the productivity, modernisation and flexibility of our economy. It is integral to all other reforms that we have introduced economically. Again I say that the score is on the board—not just in the unemployment rate but also in low interest rates. They do not just come about. That just does not happen because you have a booming economy, you are selling your minerals to China and therefore you have that cascading effect. A government has to work at managing its economy. At all points it has to reform. Surely a rigid, inflexible and out-of-date industrial relations system is the first port of call for reform.
The core principles were outlined by the Leader of the Senate when he was answering questions—they are to improve the conditions of individual workers, and that has been done; to increase the flexibility and meet the changing needs of the modern economy and of families and individuals; and, of course, to improve the productivity of individual workers and business. What do we hear from the Labor Party? Should they get into government, they will revert all of these reforms back to the old industrial relations system. (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I rise to contribute to the debate taking note of answers provided by Minister Vanstone on alleged misuse of 457 visas approved by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and also to the answers provided by Senator Minchin. I speak about this issue on a day that should see a black armband on every working Australian and a ring of shame around the Howard government for its extreme industrial imposition on working Australians. Today we observed the introduction of an industrial relations system that sees more than four million Australians lose their job security. We see a system that exposes millions of Australians to unfair dismissal and millions of hardworking Australians to uncompromising and unchallenging conditions.
The working men and women of Australia may well say: ‘At least I can still rely on the award safety net. At least my boss cannot impose an individual contract on me. At least I can still collectively bargain. At least I will not lose my overtime.’ Well, that changed today. Today the rights of working men and women in Australia have been drastically reduced. Gone are the unfair dismissal rights for workplaces with fewer than 100 staff. Ninety-five per cent of businesses in my home state of South Australia have 100 or fewer staff. Gone also are the rights to pursue unfair dismissal for workers who are dismissed for genuine operational reasons. One must ask the question: who determines what genuine operational reasons are? Gone are the significant role and powers of the independent Australian Industrial Relations Commission through the transfer of control of collective agreements to the Office of the Employment Advocate.
Workers are confused about the changes. Perhaps they should ask Senator Minchin to explain them to them. While he is doing that, he can explain why he is part of a government that is implementing a system that is grossly unpopular with the people of this country. He did give us a small insight the other day, when he openly stated that most Australians ‘don’t agree at all with anything we’re doing on this.’ He said, ‘We have minority support.’ This statement contravenes the Prime Minister, who claims that the government majority in this chamber gives him a mandate from the Australian people to do as he pleases.
The government is using today as a measuring stick for the public to gauge how the new law will affect them. The Prime Minister wants working Australians to disregard the constant warnings not only from the union movement but also from independent study groups, academics and even some in the business community. The Prime Minister is likening today to a ‘sky is falling’ scenario. In fact, Senator Ronaldson referred to that earlier. It is a sentiment being echoed by Peter Vaughan from Business SA, who also claims that we should ignore the rhetoric—the world will not end today, he says.
For some Australian workers—for example, some workers in South Australia—the sky is caving in today. At the meatworks in Naracoorte in South Australia workers have for some weeks been locked out by their employer. Today workers have been allowed to return to work. The employer withdrew the lockout. But, when the workers returned to work, gone were their skilled jobs and gone was the pay they received for them. The company has placed them in labouring jobs, not their previous skilled positions. The union representing them, the AMIEU, has been informed that these workers will be receiving up to $400 less pay per week than they previously received.
This is just the beginning of the effect of the Howard government’s extreme and uncaring attitude, leading to the changes to the industrial relations laws which we see implemented today. The sky is caving in on these workers in Naracoorte, on their job security and on their guaranteed wage, which translates to putting food on the table and paying their bills and medical expenses—the necessities of life. On the issue of the 457 visas, Minister Vanstone said that all allegations of abuse of this visa would be investigated and this applies to the workers at Naracoorte. Minister Vanstone was written to in January. Another letter was written in February. But there was no reply. DIMA did go out and inspect both—(Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-27,"—I seek leave to take note of the government response to the Community Affairs References Committee report on poverty and financial hardship entitled Renewing the fight against poverty.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I know these documents get spilled over onto the Notice Paper for Thursday afternoons or late Tuesdays and Wednesdays but I think it is appropriate on this occasion, given the significance of the topic, to take note of this document when it is formally presented to the Senate. It is particularly appropriate to note that this government response, which was produced last week out of sitting, actually took just over two years. It took over two years to respond to this very comprehensive report that looked at the issue of poverty and financial hardship in Australia.
I will not go through every aspect of the government response now. There were a lot of recommendations in that report. I therefore acknowledge that perhaps it might have been a bit harder to respond in the usual three months that is supposed to be required in responding to committee reports. But let us not forget that this government has an appalling record of responding to committee reports across the board within that time frame. Virtually no report is responded to within that three-month period. To wait two years is simply inexcusable, particularly on a topic as fundamental as poverty within Australia and particularly given that the government’s interest in the matter was so negligible that it dismissed every single recommendation contained in that report.
I do not dispute that there were some politics and politicking involved in that inquiry, but to simply say that the entire thing was a politically motivated exercise set out to embarrass the government and can therefore be entirely dismissed, which is the essence of the government’s response, is a joke. If they were going to take that response, they could have taken one day to respond to the committee recommendations and just said: ‘We’re not interested. This is politically motivated. We won’t engage.’ To take two years is not just an insult to the Senate, the Senate committee and the secretariat who did that work but, much more fundamentally, it is also a massive insult and a slap in the face to the many Australians who took the trouble to provide evidence to that committee, whether it was through written submissions or through presenting evidence at public hearings into that inquiry. It reflects very badly on the Senate as a whole. It reflects badly on the government, and I hope it does, because they deserve it. Unfortunately, it has a flow-on consequence of reflecting badly on the Senate and the Senate committee system through no fault of the Senate.
People may recall that the Sydney Morning Herald published a series of articles towards the end of last year looking at the government’s poor record in responding to parliamentary reports, including House of Representatives committee reports that are dominated by the government. The government’s poor record on responding to reports also had the inevitable consequence of portraying the Senate and the Senate committee system in a bad light. Given how widely recognised that committee system is as being one of the crucial mechanisms to enable public input, to educate the senators and to enable information to be provided to the wider community—to parliamentarians, to our advisers and to people with an interest in the topic—I think it is a tragedy that that process is being reflected in a bad light because of the contempt of the government.
This inquiry was used in those articles as an example of a comprehensive inquiry that went to cities all around Australia and took evidence from a whole lot of people—people who are working at the coalface and usually working so flat out trying to deal with the impacts of poverty that they do not usually have time to put together submissions and present evidence to committee hearings. Despite this, they thought that this issue was so important and so significant that they would take time out from their enormous workloads of dealing with the reality of poverty to let the Senate and the senators know, because they seemed to be interested in doing something about it. The Senate is still interested in doing something about it. Senate committees are still interested in doing something about it. I am still interested in doing something about it. This response shows that the government is not interested in doing something about it. I think that is a disgrace.
I think we are probably all trying to take the chance to score political points off the visiting Prime Minister Mr Blair, but one thing he has made clear and has had the courage to do in the UK is not just talk about making poverty history with respect to Africa but actually setting some targets in the UK about tackling poverty in his own country. That means political risk, because it means you set targets that you might fall short of and then your opposition can point the finger. At least he has had the guts to take responsibility for it and set some targets to say, ‘This is a problem we will try and tackle, because it impacts on our entire society, not just the people living in poverty themselves.’ Obviously, they feel it most directly and immediately, but our society as a whole is dragged down and held back by having poverty—and I mean poverty of opportunity, not just poverty in the financial sense—being inflicted on so many in our community.
To me, that is the core failure of the government in responding to this. They were not just dismissing various specific recommendations; they totally refused to even consider the prospect of having a national strategy to deal with poverty. The simple reason is that the government do not want to be seen to be having to take responsibility and put that burden on their shoulders and say: ‘We’re the national government. There is poverty in Australia. We will establish a national strategy to deal with that and we will take responsibility for it.’ They do not have the courage, and Australia is the loser for it. It is a common pattern we have seen. Similarly, this government will not adopt a national strategy to deal with housing affordability. That is another problem for which responsibility falls on state governments, but it is a national problem that needs a national solution working in cooperation with the states. I am not saying that the federal government is doing nothing about that, although I probably would if I was going to talk about that topic now. What I am saying is that adopting a national strategy about issues like that which relate to economic disadvantage is something this government do not want to do. We have even seen it with the motion that I have had on the books here for some time and which I will move sometime this week about adopting a national approach to tackling the problem of child sexual assault. It is a motion that was supported by the Australian Local Government Association. The government do not want to set up a national strategy for anything that is a social problem that they are not confident they can fix, because they do not want to be seen to be accepting that it is a responsibility that they have to do something about. I think that is a failure of leadership. It is a failure of political courage, and our nation is the loser.
I am not saying that the government should have accepted every single one of the recommendations; I am saying that it is simply beyond belief that not one of those recommendations was deemed worthy of adopting, particularly the straightforward and simple one of recognising the need to take a national, holistic approach to dealing with poverty. The only reason for not wanting to do that has to be because the government do not want to acknowledge that poverty exists in a clear-cut and undeniable way. They want to break it down into bits and pieces here and there and dilute the whole issue so that the comprehensive reality of it is not given the recognition it deserves. Again, I do not say that just to say, ‘The government are failing on it and all of us over here have the solutions.’ None of us have the solutions. State governments have to bear some significant responsibilities for the failure. All of us in the political arena have to. All of us recognise the old adage that the poor will always be with us in one form or another. We can all have the arguments about where the poverty line should be and how you define poverty, but all of that should not be used as a smokescreen to divert attention from the reality that there is a significant group of Australians throughout various parts of our country who are in clear-cut situations of undeniable financial and social poverty and poverty of opportunity.
The real problem is that, the more that situation remains, the more difficult it is for people to catch up. As the prosperity that is there within significant parts of our community does develop, those people who are not able to get on the bandwagon—or the merry-go-round or the ladder of opportunity or whatever you want to call it—are left further and further behind and it is harder and harder for them to get on.
The gap between those with wealth and those without is growing. Again, there are different ways that people like to use statistics to dispute that, and there are different statistics about whether or not there are growing gaps in income, but there is undeniably a growing gap in levels of wealth and in the levels of opportunity that go with it.
I do not dispute that there were political aspects to the inquiry—and I am one who has repeatedly said we could do with less of that in Senate committees, and that is an approach I try to take when I can—but that should not be used as an excuse to ignore the reality that was undeniably put forward. Some of the senators may engage in political game playing or political point scoring, but the people that presented evidence time after time, with a common theme throughout it all, were not politically motivated.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I also wish to take note of the government’s response to the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship in Australia. I want to reiterate that it is nearly two years since the committee brought down this report. I remind senators that there were 250 submissions and 17 days of hearings throughout the country, during which a lot of Australians had an opportunity to put before their elected representatives what they thought some of the difficulties were for men and women and children in this country.
One group that came and gave evidence before us in Sydney—and Senator Humphries may recall this—were the Country Women’s Association. The Country Women’s Association would hardly be full of bolshies or Australian Democrats or Greens. They came and gave us evidence about their views about what was happening in country New South Wales. They told us about the degree of rural poverty and the difficulties that people were having in maintaining a roof over their heads. These were not the types of public service sector people that the government says are out there all the time and tries to lampoon. These were women who were concerned about what they saw as a growing level of poverty in this country.
It is an insult to have this report responded to two years after we brought it down. It is a very cursory and, in ways, childish dismissal of our report. Most of the first part of the government’s response is telling us how good the government is in terms of its economic policies. You would have to look and see whether it is actually referring to the report or to a compilation of government press releases. That is what most of it seems to be.
—Who is the minister?
—I am not sure who the minister is now. They change. You know, as I do, that they change. But the first part of this government response essentially deals with government press releases. The second part has a few pages dealing with the criticisms of the government in relation to the report. The third part deals with the minority report recommendations, which were clearly written in the minister’s office so that the minority report senators could get up and argue the government’s case. The fourth part of the report is once again government press releases.
I just want to make this clear, and I hope Senator Humphries will respond on this: we knew that there could not be any agreed definition of poverty. We made that comment in the report. But we also said in the report that poverty was not, as the government response says, just about income:
Poverty in Australia is regarded as fundamentally about a lack of access to the opportunities most people take for granted—food, shelter, income, jobs, education, health services, childcare, transport and safe places for living and recreation. However, poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond just material deprivation; it also includes exclusion from social networks and isolation from community life.
If you read the government’s response—two years after we brought down the report—you would have to think that all this is about is income. We clearly knew, from the 17 days of hearings we had and the 250 submissions we received, that poverty was not just about income, and we put that in the report.
We had a long debate about what the definition of poverty would be. The minority senators did not agree with what we saw as the definition of poverty, and we understood that, but we had evidence time and again, from every city and town in this country that we visited, that poverty was growing, that income disparities were occurring and that our citizens were being deprived of the social needs that we take for granted in a wealthy nation like ours. That is what we saw in this country. We never said that there was one view or one definition. But, if you read the government press releases and what the government lackeys say in the minority report, you will see that they believe there is.
We also said, as Senator Bartlett has referred to, that we believed there should be a national strategy to combat poverty, that a body should be established to oversee it and that that body should report to the Prime Minister. If you read the government’s response to our report, you would think that it was our idea. Well, let me just tell you, these are the mobs that were in favour of that report: such ‘bolshies’ as the St Vincent de Paul, ACOSS, Catholic Welfare Australia, Mission Australia, UnitingCare, the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and, indeed, state Labor governments—and why wouldn’t they? And where did the idea come from for a national poverty strategy and to have some streamlined involvement of the national government? It came from Ireland—another hotbed of red bolshevism!
That is where I see parts of the government’s response to our report. I could go through page after page, and I hope that at some point Senator Moore, who was as involved and distressed by the growing levels of inequality in this country as I was, will have an opportunity like me to go through, chapter and verse, a number of the things in the government’s reply that need to be addressed. I would also like to report on the government’s reply. Remember, we are talking about a report that was given to this Senate in March 2004. Bear that in mind, Mr Deputy President. A number of initiatives by this government have occurred, which we may not agree with, after March 2004. As I said, we do not necessarily agree with them, but it seems to me that an opportunity has been grasped by the government, by their definition of life, to address these issues of poverty. There has been the Welfare to Work program, announced in the 2005-06 budget. There are the family relationship centres and the family law system changes announced in July 2004. There has been a $33 billion package for government and non-government schools. There has been ‘Building on success’, the CDEP futures direction paper released in April 2005, and subsequent things occurring. There has also been the part A initiative, announced as part of the 2004-05 budget for the FBT. These things occurred after the poverty report came down in this Senate.
As I said, we may not necessarily agree with the direction of those initiatives, but something has definitely occurred in the government as a result of our report on the inquiry in March 2004. You would have to conclude that the government and the minority senators saw something going wrong and that the ministers’ offices were reading the reports and coming to some conclusion that there was something out there that needed to be addressed. I think we can claim some sort of victory—that we widened their scope and opened their eyes to what has been going on in this country under their stewardship. One of the things that I find disturbing, despite the fact that if you read this document you see that the government is addressing poverty, is that it seems to me that it suggests that in a way it is their own fault that the poor are poor—not that they have not had the opportunity to advantages of life that others have—or they have not got off their bums. It seems that that is the way the government approaches it sometimes.
Let me read you a letter to last week’s Age, from a Melanie Raymond from Youth Projects, in which, as I said, it seems that under this government poverty has been eliminated:
Over the past year, our agency has seen a sharp rise in poverty and hunger among disadvantaged and homeless youth. They are sometimes too weak to fully participate in the training that the Government requires them to attend to receive benefits. Add to these problems their poor mental health, generational unemployment, substance abuse, physical and sexual abuse and homelessness, and the picture is bleak. The hundreds we see daily are an accurate human indicator of poverty. They are nobody’s political tool.
This is what this government said this report was: a political tool. Not according to Ms Raymond.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,10,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-03-27,"—I am very happy, as one of the ‘lackeys’ to whom Senator Hutchins referred, to rise in this debate and make some points. Let me say very categorically at the outset that this government does not deny and has never denied that there is poverty in Australia, that the extent of poverty in Australia remains unacceptable and that as a community we have an obligation to identify and to assist those Australians who have not shared in the benefits that a lucky country has brought to so many people. Inequality, in a sense, is inevitable in a free society, where people are free to make choices and to reap the benefits of their initiative and labour. But it is equally important that society set limits on the extent of inequality, to the extent that those who are seriously unable to provide for the essential basics of life should be provided for and assisted to ensure that they enjoy that essential standard of living that Australians would regard as everyone’s entitlement.
The Senate Community Affairs References Committee agreed on the fact that poverty in Australia demanded further action. It disagreed on many other aspects of this particular debate. It disagreed on whether poverty was becoming more serious or less serious. It disagreed on the measures that might be taken to address poverty in Australia. It was the government’s view, in presenting to this committee, and it was the view as well of the minority members of this report of this committee, that the most important way that any government can address poverty in a nation like Australia is to act to lift the general economic standards and economic performance of the country so as to create the wealth that will benefit those Australians not yet experiencing the phenomenon of greater national wealth and productivity.
We felt that by ensuring that the workforce continued to grow there was a greater likelihood that a person leaving school and going into the workforce would have a job there. We felt that was the most important way of tackling poverty in this country. We felt that freeing up the labour market so that businesses, particularly small businesses, were not discouraged and inhibited from taking on new staff was a substantive and clear benefit for those who sought to enter the workforce and who could not previously do so. We wanted to make sure that economic growth was nationwide and occurred in regions as well as in cities, in all states and territories of the country. We wanted to broaden the economic miracle that Australia has enjoyed in the last decade, to make sure that as many Australians as possible could benefit from that.
But consistently throughout this debate those who took part on the majority side in the committee failed to make that acknowledgment. They persisted in seeing the glass as half-full when a better analogy may have been that the glass was in fact three-quarters full and there was benefit in the approach the government had taken in generating employment, in creating jobs and in lifting real wages. Members should consult the figures that were relied on for that in the minority report. That was the evidence that was in front of us but that was the evidence that was consistently ignored by the majority in this inquiry. It is to the majority’s discredit that they continued to see this inquiry as an opportunity to bag out the Howard coalition government. That is what so much of this inquiry was about; that is what so many days of evidence were all about. How can we give this government a hard time over its performance in this area?
How little time was spent acknowledging progress that had been made. How little credit was given to the government for having created jobs, for having reduced unemployment to five per cent, for having lifted real wages of Australians over the last eight or nine years by something in the order of 14 per cent when in the previous 13 years of Labor government the net increase was in the order of about 1.5 per cent. None of that received any lip service in this inquiry at all.
There were witnesses before the inquiry—not the Bolsheviks that Senator Hutchins referred to, although there were witnesses certainly who persisted in that line as well—who wanted to make this inquiry about why the government was wrong, wrong, wrong.
—You want them to say the government is right all the time?
—No, we do not, but we need to give credit where credit is due, Senator Sherry. That was not the approach that was taken by a majority of members on this inquiry. You might think it is quite satisfactory for so much public money, so much effort and so much work on the part of individual submitters and senators and their staff to be ploughed into an exercise where so little was there at the end of the day to show for it. I for one did not feel that was the case. I regretted greatly that the bipartisanship which that particular committee has achieved on so many other issues was not possible on that question. It was obvious to anybody taking part in the inquiry that that was in fact the case.
Senator Bartlett, I think, acknowledged the political aspects of the report and said that perhaps they should have been less. Indeed, I would agree. There was an opportunity there to build a consensus on what was happening in Australia with respect to poverty, to work out what steps might be taken actively to change that reality and to address it in the context of government policies which were and are succeeding in reducing poverty in Australia. That opportunity was missed by this inquiry, and it need not have been missed. There was nothing inevitable about that factor in this debate. There was nothing inevitable about us being in a position today where we have retreated to our respective sides of the ideological debate and the Labor Party uses the report to attack the government and the government uses the report to attack the Labor Party. It is a sad state of affairs but one which, I would argue, was made inevitable from the very outset of this inquiry by the approach that so many took, an approach which could have been reversed by a different mindset but was not.
We have a great deal to be thankful for in this country. We have a great deal of work yet to be done in addressing poverty among those who have not experienced the benefits of growth and rising living standards in the last 10 years or so. That task remains notwithstanding the fact that there is profound disagreement between members of the Senate and its committees about how poverty might be tackled. But I believe that it is fundamental to any approach to tackling poverty that we see this as occurring in the context of a broader debate about management of our economy. We cannot eliminate poverty by selectively targeting those who are poor and only addressing the issue of how to alleviate or address in some way individual cases of poverty. We cannot make that equation work.
We have a chance of making that approach work if it is part of a strategy to lift Australian living standards across the board. That sometimes results in the phenomenon of the gap between rich and poor actually widening. This is one of the fundamental issues that divide the committee. There was a view, a mindset, by many in the committee that if that was occurring it demonstrated that Australia was sinking deeper into poverty and that there was a major social problem. Others did give evidence that in fact the widening of the gap indicated a growth in opportunity and a growth in productivity as long as those at the bottom of that gap were not sinking further behind what might be considered an acceptable standard of living for Australians. That was the clear evidence before the committee: the most poor in our community were benefiting from government policies that saw their standard of living rise.
Again I say that this task remains ahead of us. It can yet be tackled; it should yet be tackled. The government has a program to tackle poverty and that program is clearly working. Every indication of the wealth of Australians and the benefits to Australians of the economic miracle points to that fact being real. We are getting more benefits to Australians but the task of targeting those who are not benefiting from these changes lies ahead of us.

—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I know these documents get spilled over onto the Notice Paper for Thursday afternoons or late Tuesdays and Wednesdays but I think it is appropriate on this occasion, given the significance of the topic, to take note of this document when it is formally presented to the Senate. It is particularly appropriate to note that this government response, which was produced last week out of sitting, actually took just over two years. It took over two years to respond to this very comprehensive report that looked at the issue of poverty and financial hardship in Australia.
I will not go through every aspect of the government response now. There were a lot of recommendations in that report. I therefore acknowledge that perhaps it might have been a bit harder to respond in the usual three months that is supposed to be required in responding to committee reports. But let us not forget that this government has an appalling record of responding to committee reports across the board within that time frame. Virtually no report is responded to within that three-month period. To wait two years is simply inexcusable, particularly on a topic as fundamental as poverty within Australia and particularly given that the government’s interest in the matter was so negligible that it dismissed every single recommendation contained in that report.
I do not dispute that there were some politics and politicking involved in that inquiry, but to simply say that the entire thing was a politically motivated exercise set out to embarrass the government and can therefore be entirely dismissed, which is the essence of the government’s response, is a joke. If they were going to take that response, they could have taken one day to respond to the committee recommendations and just said: ‘We’re not interested. This is politically motivated. We won’t engage.’ To take two years is not just an insult to the Senate, the Senate committee and the secretariat who did that work but, much more fundamentally, it is also a massive insult and a slap in the face to the many Australians who took the trouble to provide evidence to that committee, whether it was through written submissions or through presenting evidence at public hearings into that inquiry. It reflects very badly on the Senate as a whole. It reflects badly on the government, and I hope it does, because they deserve it. Unfortunately, it has a flow-on consequence of reflecting badly on the Senate and the Senate committee system through no fault of the Senate.
People may recall that the Sydney Morning Herald published a series of articles towards the end of last year looking at the government’s poor record in responding to parliamentary reports, including House of Representatives committee reports that are dominated by the government. The government’s poor record on responding to reports also had the inevitable consequence of portraying the Senate and the Senate committee system in a bad light. Given how widely recognised that committee system is as being one of the crucial mechanisms to enable public input, to educate the senators and to enable information to be provided to the wider community—to parliamentarians, to our advisers and to people with an interest in the topic—I think it is a tragedy that that process is being reflected in a bad light because of the contempt of the government.
This inquiry was used in those articles as an example of a comprehensive inquiry that went to cities all around Australia and took evidence from a whole lot of people—people who are working at the coalface and usually working so flat out trying to deal with the impacts of poverty that they do not usually have time to put together submissions and present evidence to committee hearings. Despite this, they thought that this issue was so important and so significant that they would take time out from their enormous workloads of dealing with the reality of poverty to let the Senate and the senators know, because they seemed to be interested in doing something about it. The Senate is still interested in doing something about it. Senate committees are still interested in doing something about it. I am still interested in doing something about it. This response shows that the government is not interested in doing something about it. I think that is a disgrace.
I think we are probably all trying to take the chance to score political points off the visiting Prime Minister Mr Blair, but one thing he has made clear and has had the courage to do in the UK is not just talk about making poverty history with respect to Africa but actually setting some targets in the UK about tackling poverty in his own country. That means political risk, because it means you set targets that you might fall short of and then your opposition can point the finger. At least he has had the guts to take responsibility for it and set some targets to say, ‘This is a problem we will try and tackle, because it impacts on our entire society, not just the people living in poverty themselves.’ Obviously, they feel it most directly and immediately, but our society as a whole is dragged down and held back by having poverty—and I mean poverty of opportunity, not just poverty in the financial sense—being inflicted on so many in our community.
To me, that is the core failure of the government in responding to this. They were not just dismissing various specific recommendations; they totally refused to even consider the prospect of having a national strategy to deal with poverty. The simple reason is that the government do not want to be seen to be having to take responsibility and put that burden on their shoulders and say: ‘We’re the national government. There is poverty in Australia. We will establish a national strategy to deal with that and we will take responsibility for it.’ They do not have the courage, and Australia is the loser for it. It is a common pattern we have seen. Similarly, this government will not adopt a national strategy to deal with housing affordability. That is another problem for which responsibility falls on state governments, but it is a national problem that needs a national solution working in cooperation with the states. I am not saying that the federal government is doing nothing about that, although I probably would if I was going to talk about that topic now. What I am saying is that adopting a national strategy about issues like that which relate to economic disadvantage is something this government do not want to do. We have even seen it with the motion that I have had on the books here for some time and which I will move sometime this week about adopting a national approach to tackling the problem of child sexual assault. It is a motion that was supported by the Australian Local Government Association. The government do not want to set up a national strategy for anything that is a social problem that they are not confident they can fix, because they do not want to be seen to be accepting that it is a responsibility that they have to do something about. I think that is a failure of leadership. It is a failure of political courage, and our nation is the loser.
I am not saying that the government should have accepted every single one of the recommendations; I am saying that it is simply beyond belief that not one of those recommendations was deemed worthy of adopting, particularly the straightforward and simple one of recognising the need to take a national, holistic approach to dealing with poverty. The only reason for not wanting to do that has to be because the government do not want to acknowledge that poverty exists in a clear-cut and undeniable way. They want to break it down into bits and pieces here and there and dilute the whole issue so that the comprehensive reality of it is not given the recognition it deserves. Again, I do not say that just to say, ‘The government are failing on it and all of us over here have the solutions.’ None of us have the solutions. State governments have to bear some significant responsibilities for the failure. All of us in the political arena have to. All of us recognise the old adage that the poor will always be with us in one form or another. We can all have the arguments about where the poverty line should be and how you define poverty, but all of that should not be used as a smokescreen to divert attention from the reality that there is a significant group of Australians throughout various parts of our country who are in clear-cut situations of undeniable financial and social poverty and poverty of opportunity.
The real problem is that, the more that situation remains, the more difficult it is for people to catch up. As the prosperity that is there within significant parts of our community does develop, those people who are not able to get on the bandwagon—or the merry-go-round or the ladder of opportunity or whatever you want to call it—are left further and further behind and it is harder and harder for them to get on.
The gap between those with wealth and those without is growing. Again, there are different ways that people like to use statistics to dispute that, and there are different statistics about whether or not there are growing gaps in income, but there is undeniably a growing gap in levels of wealth and in the levels of opportunity that go with it.
I do not dispute that there were political aspects to the inquiry—and I am one who has repeatedly said we could do with less of that in Senate committees, and that is an approach I try to take when I can—but that should not be used as an excuse to ignore the reality that was undeniably put forward. Some of the senators may engage in political game playing or political point scoring, but the people that presented evidence time after time, with a common theme throughout it all, were not politically motivated.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I also wish to take note of the government’s response to the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship in Australia. I want to reiterate that it is nearly two years since the committee brought down this report. I remind senators that there were 250 submissions and 17 days of hearings throughout the country, during which a lot of Australians had an opportunity to put before their elected representatives what they thought some of the difficulties were for men and women and children in this country.
One group that came and gave evidence before us in Sydney—and Senator Humphries may recall this—were the Country Women’s Association. The Country Women’s Association would hardly be full of bolshies or Australian Democrats or Greens. They came and gave us evidence about their views about what was happening in country New South Wales. They told us about the degree of rural poverty and the difficulties that people were having in maintaining a roof over their heads. These were not the types of public service sector people that the government says are out there all the time and tries to lampoon. These were women who were concerned about what they saw as a growing level of poverty in this country.
It is an insult to have this report responded to two years after we brought it down. It is a very cursory and, in ways, childish dismissal of our report. Most of the first part of the government’s response is telling us how good the government is in terms of its economic policies. You would have to look and see whether it is actually referring to the report or to a compilation of government press releases. That is what most of it seems to be.
—Who is the minister?
—I am not sure who the minister is now. They change. You know, as I do, that they change. But the first part of this government response essentially deals with government press releases. The second part has a few pages dealing with the criticisms of the government in relation to the report. The third part deals with the minority report recommendations, which were clearly written in the minister’s office so that the minority report senators could get up and argue the government’s case. The fourth part of the report is once again government press releases.
I just want to make this clear, and I hope Senator Humphries will respond on this: we knew that there could not be any agreed definition of poverty. We made that comment in the report. But we also said in the report that poverty was not, as the government response says, just about income:
Poverty in Australia is regarded as fundamentally about a lack of access to the opportunities most people take for granted—food, shelter, income, jobs, education, health services, childcare, transport and safe places for living and recreation. However, poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond just material deprivation; it also includes exclusion from social networks and isolation from community life.
If you read the government’s response—two years after we brought down the report—you would have to think that all this is about is income. We clearly knew, from the 17 days of hearings we had and the 250 submissions we received, that poverty was not just about income, and we put that in the report.
We had a long debate about what the definition of poverty would be. The minority senators did not agree with what we saw as the definition of poverty, and we understood that, but we had evidence time and again, from every city and town in this country that we visited, that poverty was growing, that income disparities were occurring and that our citizens were being deprived of the social needs that we take for granted in a wealthy nation like ours. That is what we saw in this country. We never said that there was one view or one definition. But, if you read the government press releases and what the government lackeys say in the minority report, you will see that they believe there is.
We also said, as Senator Bartlett has referred to, that we believed there should be a national strategy to combat poverty, that a body should be established to oversee it and that that body should report to the Prime Minister. If you read the government’s response to our report, you would think that it was our idea. Well, let me just tell you, these are the mobs that were in favour of that report: such ‘bolshies’ as the St Vincent de Paul, ACOSS, Catholic Welfare Australia, Mission Australia, UnitingCare, the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and, indeed, state Labor governments—and why wouldn’t they? And where did the idea come from for a national poverty strategy and to have some streamlined involvement of the national government? It came from Ireland—another hotbed of red bolshevism!
That is where I see parts of the government’s response to our report. I could go through page after page, and I hope that at some point Senator Moore, who was as involved and distressed by the growing levels of inequality in this country as I was, will have an opportunity like me to go through, chapter and verse, a number of the things in the government’s reply that need to be addressed. I would also like to report on the government’s reply. Remember, we are talking about a report that was given to this Senate in March 2004. Bear that in mind, Mr Deputy President. A number of initiatives by this government have occurred, which we may not agree with, after March 2004. As I said, we do not necessarily agree with them, but it seems to me that an opportunity has been grasped by the government, by their definition of life, to address these issues of poverty.

It seems that that is the way the government approaches it sometimes.

The Senate Community Affairs References Committee agreed on the fact that poverty in Australia demanded further action. It disagreed on many other aspects of this particular debate. It disagreed on whether poverty was becoming more serious or less serious. It disagreed on the measures that might be taken to address poverty in Australia. It was the government’s view, in presenting to this committee, and it was the view as well of the minority members of this report of this committee, that the most important way that any government can address poverty in a nation like Australia is to act to lift the general economic standards and economic performance of the country so as to create the wealth that will benefit those Australians not yet experiencing the phenomenon of greater national wealth and productivity.
We felt that by ensuring that the workforce continued to grow there was a greater likelihood that a person leaving school and going into the workforce would have a job there. We felt that was the most important way of tackling poverty in this country.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-03-27,"—The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 being considered by the Senate today proposes to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 and, according to the explanatory memorandum, the specific provisions in this amendment bill have the following objectives: to move uncommitted capital infrastructure funding for government schools from 2005 to 2006 and to bring 2008 funding forward to 2006; to move unspent funding under the Tutorial Voucher Initiative from 2004 to 2006; to allow funding to be carried over or brought forward to another year for all non-per-capita programs, such as capital grants, targeted programs and national projects; to provide maximum general recurrent grants for a small number of non-government schools that cater for students with emotional, social or behavioural difficulties; and to make a minor technical correction to one of the defined terms in the act.
The bulk of the taxpayer funds provided through the principal act—that is, the States Grants (Learning Together—Achievement Though Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004—are provided as general recurrent per capita grants, and these grants are not affected by the proposals in the bill under consideration. However, there is also significant funding provided for capital works and for targeted programs for schools and students with special needs, and it is this type of program which is the focus of the amendment bill before the Senate.
The government’s major 2004 election commitment for schools was its Investing in Our Schools program, where supposedly $1 billion over four years was provided for capital projects in schools—$700 million for government schools and $300 million for non-government schools. However, an integral feature of the design of this program was the Howard government’s ideological obsession with bypassing the states and the government school systems that deliver education to most Australian children. For government schools, the government has decided to bypass state authorities by calling for applications directly from schools and local parents and citizens associations.
The previous minister announced that Australia’s 6,900-plus public schools would be eligible for up to $150,000 each under this process, but unfortunately the Howard government has been overwhelmed by its own processes and has failed to deliver the funds to schools. Most schools are still waiting for the money announced in the 2004 election, and schools around Australia are getting sick of funding dates getting pushed back. The previous minister for education promised that grants would be announced by May 2005. It is now almost April 2006. The new school year started some months ago. Many schools promoted their facilities to parents on the basis of the projects they expected to have completed—not commenced—in time for the 2006 school year. Now many parents are questioning schools on what happened to the promised shadecloths, computers or the like.
The government’s incompetence has caused all sorts of collateral damage. There is one contractor in South Australia who has had to send employees on leave, some without pay, as a direct result of the delays in getting the promised money out to the schools. In this case, the jobs of over 20 South Australians have been put at risk because of former Minister Nelson’s administrative incompetence. I do not even need to go into the round 2 larger grants process. Schools were first told that successful round 2 grants would be announced in October. Then this was pushed to December. Then we heard February, and now it is supposed to be April. It is irresponsible behaviour by this government to raise and then dash again and again the hopes of schools which are desperately in need of funds.
Although this program was clearly targeted in the election at all government schools and their parent associations, the minister has trotted out the flimsy excuse that the department was surprised by the volume of applications. DEST has been unable to administer the program in a timely way, despite significant increases in staffing for the program and despite the fact that this was a major election commitment. The bill before the Senate is a direct and inevitable result of government incompetence. All government schools were promised additional funding for capital projects in the election, so why is there any surprise at all that most schools and P&C organisations were keen to apply? There can be no excuse for not preparing to handle applications from many of the nation’s schools. As Minister Nelson sowed, so Minister Bishop now reaps. She is today saddled with trying to clean up the mess left for her by Dr Nelson—and the incompetence of the Investing in Our Schools program implementation is only the first example of Dr Nelson’s incompetent hand grenades he has left for his successor. No doubt she will uncover many more in the coming months.
The fact is that the Howard government has bungled its management of this program by trying to become a small-scale capital developer for Australia’s 6,900-plus government schools. It tried to paint itself as rescuing school communities from state bureaucracies but has instead created its own administrative monster. The government set up a duplicate administration for getting capital funding to schools, and it did so for blatantly political and ideological reasons. Now we see the inevitable result of this ideological obsession, with an ad hoc administration overwhelmed by its own application process. If there is a salutary lesson in all this for Minister Bishop—if she is to learn at all from the schoolboy mistakes of her predecessor—it is that it is much better to work in cooperation with state authorities for the benefit of all Australian schools. Proper consultation with the states, which after all do run school systems day in and day out, would have led to a much more effective and efficient means of getting capital funding into schools.
Labor does support the involvement of parent organisations in planning decisions about the allocation of capital funds, but this should be done in a strategic, efficient and targeted manner—in other words, done in cooperation with the states and territories. Labor’s concerns with the implementation of this program are not only about incompetence. The approvals so far also reveal a high degree of inequity in the allocation of funds between electorates. The figures clearly show that political advantage was a primary motivation in the decisions behind the Investing in Our Schools program. What has become clear is that the approvals process has been handled differently across the electorates, with Liberal and, especially, National Party electorates being far more successful in winning substantial funds than Labor held electorates.
Let us briefly have a look at the figures Labor has drawn out of a reluctant government. The average funds per Labor electorate are $550,000. The average funds per Liberal electorate are $705,000. The average funds per Nationals electorate are $1,350,000. The average funds per coalition electorate are $1,025,000. The average grants per coalition marginal electorate are $830,000. Of the top 20 electorates in terms of total funding to an electorate, guess how many are coalition held? Nineteen—19 out of the 20 top electorates in terms of total funding to an electorate are coalition held. The first Labor held electorate appears at 20—Bendigo. And nine of the top 10 electorates in terms of average grant per school in an electorate are—guess what?—coalition held. Reid is the only Labor held top 10 seat. How can the government possibly justify such huge discrepancies? How could a credible, accountable and transparent assessment process possibly arrive at such a flawed distribution of funding?
What has been clear throughout this process is that the fix was in early. Coalition members had the details of the program first, had more detail about the application requirements and were given extra material to encourage schools to apply. Is there any possible reason for the Howard government distributing million-dollar handouts to its own blue-ribbon seats? Does the former minister, Dr Nelson, really expect the parents of Australian schoolkids to believe that the schools in St Ives and Pymble in his North Shore seat of Bradfield deserve significantly more funding per school than those in Cabramatta in the electorate of Fowler? Like many other areas of education funding distribution, Labor wants to know why this funding was not allocated on the basis of real and objective need.
The combined effects of incompetence and political pork-barrelling have discredited this program, which should have been targeted at meeting the real needs of schools and students in partnership with parents and school communities. In light of the demonstrated incompetence and politicisation of this billion-dollar fund, Labor only supports the increased flexibility in the bill for the minister to move funds around within the funding quadrennium so that schools actually get the money they have been promised. This flexibility includes the capacity to bring forward 2008 funding to 2006. Students certainly deserve to have this money put to good use in supporting their education. But be warned: this flexibility ought not to be used for political purposes, for media releases and stage-managed activities for coalition politicians. Labor and the public are onto the political misuse of this fund.
I will turn now to the Tutorial Voucher Initiative. This tutorial vouchers program is yet another example of the Howard government’s incompetence when it comes to administering programs, with unspent funding from both 2004 and 2005. It is another example of ideology over good sense. The government has insisted on tendering out for brokers to provide tutors for the children who need literacy support, including some brokers with doubtful qualifications and operations. In 2004 the government introduced the payment of tutorial vouchers of up to $700 to parents of children who had failed to meet national benchmarks of reading literacy in national testing of year 3 standards in 2004. Once again the Commonwealth has tried to implement this scheme without discussion with the states. Now that the pilot program has failed to deliver, the government is trying to blame the states instead of working with them from the beginning. As part of the original design of the pilot, the initiative is administered by brokers that are responsible for facilitating the contracting of tutors, confirming child eligibility, providing parents and caregivers with choice of tutors and managing its administration. Some of the brokers are, sensibly, school authorities, but others are private providers and enterprises.
Answers to questions at Senate estimates revealed a nationwide take-up rate of 36 per cent by mid-November last year. However a state-by-state analysis of the figure shows a much poorer performance on the part of commercial brokers for this program, particularly in comparison to the performance of school authorities. For instance, state education departments in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania topped the table of take-up rates, ranging up to 69 per cent of eligible students. The most notable failure of this program is the performance of a private company, Progressive Learning, which has spectacularly failed to deliver tutorial programs to eligible students in Queensland and Victoria.
Figures provided by DEST show that just 656 of 5,717 eligible Victorian students received any help through the tutorial vouchers program, only 12 per cent of eligible students. The vast majority of students assessed at their year 3 benchmark testing as requiring extra literacy assistance have now sat the year 5 literacy benchmark test without having received any tutoring whatsoever. Progressive Learning also charged a $250 administration fee, so the few students in Victoria who actually received any tutoring at all only got $450 of the value of their $700 vouchers.
The federal government issued contracts to companies to deliver the tutorial voucher program with the full knowledge that the companies could not talk to the parents because they were not legally able to obtain their contact details, nor were the companies authorised to talk directly to the state governments, which actually had the contact details. This sounds like a Yes, Minister program. The program has been an administrative disaster, being more about an ideological obsession with bypassing state school authorities than about helping students who desperately need support.
The government has established a cautious evaluation exercise of this pilot program and engaged a commercial consultant, Erebus International, to undertake this evaluation. The opposition is, of course, very interested in what this evaluation concludes about the efficiency of delivering a program in the way insisted on by this government and the effectiveness of delivering literacy programs while cutting schools out of the equation. For this reason, the opposition lodged a freedom of information application to get access to relevant material, including any summary, analysis, report or documents prepared by Erebus International for this evaluation. On 13 March the department refused to release those documents on the basis that, amongst other things, disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. And, yet, within two days, a selective summary of those evaluation documents was prepared by Minister Bishop’s office and released to a national newspaper. Isn’t it amazing how in one context something may be contrary to the public interest but, if you are able to determine precisely which aspects of the documents you disclose, suddenly they can appear with the minister’s apparent approval in a national newspaper? Clearly, disclosure of the original, unedited documents would have been contrary to the interests of the Howard government or they would not have hidden behind the public interest claim to refuse the FOI request.
We in the opposition will continue to pursue this evaluation because we actually believe the Australian public has a legitimate interest in knowing just how this pilot program did operate and what effect it had on the literacy development of students identified as needing extra assistance. Labor will support the carrying over of unspent moneys from 2004 and 2005 because there are children in this country who need literacy assistance and support. But we also need to protect the integrity and value of this funding.
I am foreshadowing that Labor will move a substantive amendment to strengthen the conditions of funding to ensure that only qualified and accredited educators deliver. This amendment would require persons and organisations other than already approved school authorities to meet national standards of quality, such as professional teaching standards of tutors, and probity, such as financial and administrative records of private enterprises. I urge the Senate to support this amendment at the committee stage.
We have also circulated in the chamber during the course of my contribution our second reading amendment. I have set out in reasonable detail Labor’s concerns regarding the administrative incompetence and the political misuse of the two significant funding programs dealt with in this bill. Both the Investing in Our Schools program and the Tutorial Voucher Initiative highlight the operational and political mess left to Minister Bishop by her predecessor—a mess this bill only starts to deal with. For these reasons I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
         (a)    condemns the Government for:
               (i)    failing to deliver urgently needed capital funds and literacy support in time for schools and students to achieve the benefits of those funds,
              (ii)    failing to protect the integrity and probity of its program for tutorial literacy vouchers, especially in the appointment of brokers for the delivery of tutorial assistance in some states,
             (iii)    approving capital funding under its ‘Investing in our schools’ program in an unfair and unequal way between schools and regions, and
             (iv)    failing adequately to take into account the relative educational and financial needs of schools in the allocation of capital funding under the ‘Investing in our schools’ program; and
         (b)    calls on the Government to:
               (i)    ensure that all programs are administered in ways that deliver maximum educational benefits for students,
              (ii)    take steps to assure the educational integrity and probity of its tutorial assistance for students with literacy needs,
             (iii)    direct some of the unspent funds for tutorial assistance for students with literacy needs to use by schools to develop appropriate programs for their students, in consultation with parents and for the professional development of teachers to improve their literacy teaching skills, and
             (iv)    support improved accountability provisions for funding under the capital grants and tutorial assistance programs”.
I urge the Senate to support this second reading amendment. In doing so I note that it ought not to have been necessary for this amendment to call on the government to ensure that all programs are administered in a way that delivers maximum educational benefits for students. One would have thought that was self-evidently required. It should not have been necessary, but on the Howard government’s performance specifically on these programs this statement of the obvious unfortunately needs to be explicit.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-03-27,"—I also rise to speak on the so-called Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. This make-do piece of legislation is designed to overcome the problems that arose with the government’s own half-baked schemes of a couple of years ago. Before going into the details of the bill I would like to say that the Democrats will reluctantly support this legislation, but not because we think the programs the legislation refers to are the best way to address the needs of students in schools. Very clearly, they are not—something we strongly pointed out when the original legislation was introduced at the end of 2004. We will support this legislation today because the simple truth is that funding for education in this country is inadequate and, if nothing else, this bill provides some money for education, albeit mostly shifted from other programs. Whether you talk about preschool, primary or secondary school, TAFE or university, this government is not investing enough in education. We say it is essential for the future of Australia that we put more money into those purposes.
It was very encouraging to hear that the government is finally considering the benefits of a year of preschool for all children before they start school. There is a wealth of evidence that shows that preschool education has immeasurable benefits for children, particularly those from more disadvantaged backgrounds. It is time that the focus was not only on how access to early childhood education and care helps parents manage the balance between work and family but also on the innumerable benefits of early childhood education and care for children themselves. Early childhood education lays the foundation for children’s effective learning and improves their social, cognitive and emotional development. It is vital in breaking the cycle of poverty and in reducing crime, teenage pregnancy and welfare dependency. Early childhood education stops children from dropping out of school at an early age and leads to a better skilled workforce. All children deserve the best possible start in life, and Australia has fallen way behind overseas counterparts in providing the sort of substantial and sustained investment needed to make sure that children get off on the front foot.
So I hope that this announcement is not just another political football that gets thrown back and forth between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments. I would like to see that the federal government, having said that preschool is important and should be mandatory, continues on with that idea and does not then turn around and say, ‘It’s the states’ responsibility to fund it,’ while the states then turn around and say, ‘Child care is important but that’s a federal responsibility.’ We do not need that kind of duck-shoving. Every single Australian child needs to be able to get early childhood education and care that is provided by enough qualified staff to make sure that the focus is on the children’s development, not just on babysitting so that financially pressured parents can do their bit to keep the economy going.
It is not just at the preschool end of things where Australia is lagging behind. We need to be doing more to meet the educational needs at all levels of all our children, not just those lucky enough to be able to attend the most well-resourced schools. Education should be a national priority, but unfortunately, in comparison with other countries and even in comparison with Australia a few decades ago, there is an inadequate commitment on the part of governments to bridge the gap in the educational achievements of the haves and the have-nots. Kids who are bright and who have supportive, well-educated and well-resourced parents are still doing much better than those who happen to be born into poor or isolated families or who might have a learning disability or a language problem or who are Indigenous. Unfortunately, attention in this place has been focused on which schools should or should not be receiving more or less money. The real question should be: what are the educational needs of the child and how can we best meet those needs? Funding decisions should be made on the needs of the child, not on whether the school is non-government or government—but that is not what this government has done, and we see that again in this legislation.
I will now look briefly at the provisions in this bill. They are aimed at providing additional funds for a small number of non-government schools that cater for students with emotional, social or behavioural difficulties. The government is not concerned with providing additional support for all students who require the intensive support that their special circumstances necessitate. If that had been the case, it would have come up with a system to provide resources for all students. As I said, the government has not done that. Instead, we have a system where the government is providing additional funds to a new category of schools, a separate classification of so-called ‘special assistance schools’. These are schools that ‘primarily cater for students with social, emotional or behavioural difficulties’. This new classification means that these schools will be able to receive the maximum level of general recurrent grant available to non-government special schools for students with other disabilities.
The Democrats support additional funding to support students with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties—we certainly need it, as we do extra funding for all students with a range of disabilities. These are high-needs students who need intensive support. But the funding in this bill will not be available to all students with these needs, as I said; it is just available to support students who are in that small number of non-government schools. Government schools that cater for these high-needs students are not eligible, and students with these high needs who are not in specialist schools but may be in a special classroom within a mainstream school or even within standard classes in mainstream schools, whether government or non-government, will not receive additional funding.
So while the government talks about needs based funding there is no real effort to develop an approach that is based on the needs of children whether they have behavioural difficulties, learning difficulties or whatever. Again, the focus is on the school, not on the needs of the students. But hiding behind the mantra of so-called choice—again we see that in the title of this bill—the government continues with its flawed SES funding model that, whichever way you look at it, leads to an unfair and inequitable distribution of funding. Again, the distribution of funding is not based on the needs of children. Nowhere in this model does it take into account the needs of a child with language problems, the needs of Indigenous students or students with learning disabilities.
I would like to take a moment to speak specifically about students with learning disabilities. The recognition and funding of students with learning disabilities is a subject I have raised a number of times here in the Senate, and the 2002 Senate inquiry into the education of students with disabilities very clearly identified the special needs of students who have learning disabilities and the lack of support that is available in schools. The Australian Learning Disability Association’s submission to the national inquiry into the teaching of literacy last year reiterated that the compulsory education sector does not differentiate between learning disorders and learning difficulties. The submission also made the point that funding is not available to support those students with learning disabilities as required. In simple terms, having a learning disability means that a child will not learn in the same way as approximately 90 per cent of the population—that is, these children and students need to be taught differently.
It is estimated that, like in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, approximately 10 to 12 per cent of Australian students have a learning disability of some kind, but unlike these countries in Australia disabilities such as dyslexia, poor visual and motor control and short-term memory problems have been largely ignored, at least at the official level. Students with learning disabilities do not get a satisfactory education, so we test them, we benchmark them, but at the end of the day there is very little by way of services, at least from the federal government’s perspective, that assists them with their problem.
There is still a lack of understanding, awareness and acceptance amongst the public, policy makers and practitioners with relation to learning disabilities generally, and in particular of the need to differentiate between—and I would say diagnose—learning difficulties and learning disabilities. There needs to be a national push to promote the needs of these students, particularly within school communities, because they will take their learning difficulties with them throughout life. Teachers have told me that even in those areas that may have developed policies for assisting students with learning disabilities there are no resources to support teachers to improve their skills, and there are often no facilities to provide the accommodations that students need. Teachers are having to work in spare classrooms if they are lucky, and staff tearooms or even storage rooms if they are not. There is almost no access to note takers, readers or scribes, or any of the technologies like laptop computers, that would so help these students.
Another key problem is that schools are unable to even identify students with learning disabilities correctly. There is a lack of guidelines and procedures for assessing the needs of students and little help within the school system to organise an assessment or to pay for it. Parents face costs of hundreds of dollars just to have an assessment of their son or daughter made. We need national guidelines for testing for learning disabilities and we need funding to support that testing. Teachers and schools cannot be expected to adequately cater for the needs of these students if they do not know how extensive the problems are or what the exact nature of them is.
Current funding for programs to support students is ad hoc and inadequate. The federal government will no doubt argue that the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program provides assistance for these students, but this simply demonstrates the failure of the government to recognise the difference between the needs of students with learning difficulties and those with learning disabilities. This is a failure shared by the many state and territory government education departments. They chose to provide support for students with learning disabilities through umbrella programs that are primarily designed to help students with difficulties.
We would not want to see students with learning difficulties miss out. These students are also educationally disadvantaged and need additional support. However, their needs are generally very different from those with disabilities and, while some students with learning disabilities might be assisted by programs which target those with learning difficulties, it is very likely that many students with learning disabilities are missing out. This is a really serious issue and it is time that the government sorted out what needs to be done in order to fund learning disabilities and what the differences are with the current set of disabilities that are funded through the states grants legislation—that is, students with physical, intellectual and emotional disabilities. We need to look at the group that has difficulties that can be overcome by literacy programs and then examine the other group that is much more difficult to assist.
Unfortunately, taking a coherent and thoughtful approach to funding the educational needs of children seems to not be what this government is about. What it is about is ad hoc, ill-conceived add-on programs that are driven by ideology, badly administered and fail to provide any real contribution to the quality of education of Australian children, and certainly the Tutorial Voucher Initiative fits into that category like a glove. That is the reason why we have this legislation before us today. It is mopping up the mess made by two of the programs that this government put in place 12 months ago—the Investing in our Schools program and the Tutorial Voucher Initiative. When they were introduced we did not support that approach. We argued that it was administratively inefficient, inequitable and would ultimately be ineffective. One of the reasons the tutorial voucher system did not work was that the government was so opposed to that system being done through schools, and so, as I understand it, the schools at the end of the day became brokers and became involved—but only because the government simply could not make the system work that it had planned. That idea of brokers and tutors coming from nowhere and being available to do this work was a gross failure.
We welcome additional funding for education. We do not, however, welcome the way in which those funds have been administered. There must be a shift in this process from government schools across to nongovernment schools, and the Democrats are always opposed to that notion. We need more money for capital works in schools. Overall, Commonwealth expenditure on capital works has dropped since 1993 by around 30 per cent. But the Investing in Our Schools program was always going to benefit most those schools that have active, committed parent organisations that can write good grant applications for that shade over the sandpit or other small item that schools may be able to put forward that fits within the limit of the grant amount, a limit which only applies, of course, to government schools.
There was no mechanism in this program for any sensible or equitable prioritising of the funding. We desperately need a national standard for basic school amenities but there is still no sign of that turning up any time soon. We need an audit of school buildings and facilities, so that we can all see which schools do not have basic infrastructure. We then need to fund the necessary development in a coordinated manner, but that just has not happened. We also need a better approach to literacy development. Giving $700 vouchers to parents of grade 3 students who fail the reading tests so they can access private tutors was never going to be an efficient or an effective way to help those children.
The Democrats argued at the time that the $20 million should have been used to support existing programs in schools. Schools already have the structures and the expertise; all they need are the resources to work one on one or in small groups with struggling children. Again, the reason this has been put in place is that the Commonwealth cannot reach agreement with the states on how to do this, and we constantly have this bickering about cost shifting, who is paying for what and who is getting the plaudits for putting programs in place. That is what this is about; it is not about any sensible approach to improving learning outcomes.
There were many questions raised about the voucher scheme when it was first proposed, such as the availability of suitable tutors, the capacity of some parents to seek help for their kids and how this tutorial assistance would tie in with what students are learning at schools. Now we are seeing the results of that failure to pay attention to those questions. The government cannot say that those in the Senate did not point this out to them. I hope that this time the government have learnt something from this kind of fiasco.
We need more investment in schools, more money for capital works, more money for literacy development and more money to support students with additional educational needs. In this respect, the government must do much better. All Australian children deserve and need a quality education regardless of their circumstances, the state or territory in which they live, the resources of their parents and which school they go to.
I indicate that the amendments circulated in my name will be withdrawn.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-03-27,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Greens on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006, the first schools bill introduced by the new Minister for Education, Science and Training, Ms Bishop. It is unfortunate for the new minister that the first bill that she has introduced is a bandaid bill to amend the obvious problems that inevitably arose from the shoddy, populist policy follies of her predecessor—but that is what this bill is. The Greens sincerely hope that future bills from the new minister will set a new course for this government regarding schools, one that puts education first rather than the ideology or electoral game playing that we are used to seeing not only in education but also in other portfolios.
This bill seeks to slap bandaids on two programs that have been introduced by the former minister in the past couple of years. They have failed and, as a result, have let down young people, parents and teachers. The bill also amends a provision of the funding act to allow the government more power to manipulate funding spending. The remedies this bill seeks to introduce will simply allow these poor policies to limp on until the next major funding decisions are made in 2007 and 2008. The increased flexibility in funding delivery creates a powerful temptation for political abuse of this funding in the hands of the minister of the day, whoever it may be.
The first program dealt with by this bill is the Investing in Our Schools program, which was announced in a flurry in the last federal election campaign. This program sought to deliver $1 billion of federal funding to schools for capital improvements: airconditioning, shadecloth, repairs and the like. This $1 billion was to be spread over four years, with $300 million going to private schools and $700 million to public schools. There was no consultation with state governments about this program, and the thrust was to cut the state governments out from managing this new capital funding, even though the states have a long established admin infrastructure to manage capital investment in schools. Instead, this cash was to be doled out directly to schools that had applied through P&C committees and school boards—that is, unless you were a private school, in which case the funding went to block grant authorities that already distribute recurrent capital funding to approved projects.
The problem is that just about every public school in Australia has applied for some funding. Many people may think that is not surprising—unless they are the minister for education or a senior official at the Department of Education, Science and Training. They tell us that the program has failed to deliver the promised funds to public schools because they have been so surprised at the overwhelming number of applicants for money. This bill aims to roll over the funding allocation for the program from 2005 to 2006 in order to catch up with the demand and eventual delivery. We are getting used to this sort of frequent incompetence by the government, but it is worth questioning whether there are not other motives at play here.
By rolling over these funds, is the government simply back loading the delivery of these much needed capital projects later into the electoral cycle by delaying the completion of these projects from the first year and a half of the scheme but seeking to deliver the full promised funding in the second half of the four-year funding term? Does that not mean that schools will get their new shadecloths, library extensions or netball courts in an election year? Some people might think this a cynical or uncharitable perspective to take. But let us look at where the funding is already being distributed under this scheme. Others have noted with concern that the funding has been distributed at a ratio of three to one, favouring Liberal held electorates over Labor held electorates. The average funding that coalition electorates have received is $792,010, compared to $549,303 for Labor electorates.
Nine out of the 10 top electorates in receipt of capital funding are coalition seats. This looks like a reasonably obvious case of pork barrelling—that is, spending government funds to benefit sitting members with the hope of retaining government at the coming election. If anyone is confused when trying to understand the reasoning behind the flow of education public policy coming from the Howard government, it is revealing how helpful it is to look at it through the prism of electoral self-interest. Suddenly it does not seem all that confusing at all.
Of course, this could just be a coincidence, but I suggest it is not. The only other reading of this situation suggests that, if you put funding applications in the hands of parental bodies or P&C committees, the number and speed of qualifying applications will favour schools from areas where the parents’ education level and familiarity with the administrative process is highest. That will favour areas of higher socioeconomic status, which in turn are more likely to be areas held by the coalition. If this is true, it is still an indication of the failure of policy that delivers money not on the basis of need but, rather, on who is best at filling out applications—a pattern that, as we have seen, had a devastating effect in the government’s mismanagement of Indigenous schools funding programs.
These problems have been bypassed by the private school sector, however. For some mysterious reason, their funding is managed through existing block grant authorities. Not only this, but also they do not have the $150,000 cap on school projects like public schools have—a funding inequity without any explanation. All in all, the Investing in Our Schools program is a mess—either by design, for cynically political self-serving reasons, or by default, as a poorly designed bit of policy on the run. Either way, the only good thing is that, in the end, new infrastructure does get built in schools. This is the only reason that the Greens have any support for this proposal.
The second failure that this bill seeks to address is the much heralded literacy voucher scheme. This policy was to issue $700 vouchers to parents whose children had failed to achieve their benchmark in year 3 literacy. The voucher could pay for supplementary literacy support for that child. The support could be delivered by approved providers including private providers. This program was again developed without consultation with the state governments that run our public school system. As a direct result, it has been a complete shambles. Only 12 per cent of eligible children in Victoria and only 18 per cent in Queensland have received any tuition through this scheme. Even in the states where the state school system has been the dominant approved provider of additional tuition, the take-up has been less than 70 per cent. As a result, the scheme has been massively underspent.
This bill seeks to roll those unspent funds into schools based literacy programs. It should be obvious—and it was said at the time—that, had this funding been spent in schools from the outset, 100 per cent of those young people needing extra help would have benefited from the money. This bill basically amounts to an admission by the government that they were wrong about the benefits of vouchers and the scheme should as a result be discontinued.
But that is not the approach that the government is taking. The government sees vouchers as a way to sell their half-baked choice based vision for education. Perhaps government polling is telling them that it sounds popular and those best placed to benefit from the scheme are those who are most likely to be voting for individualistic ideologues. So vouchers continue to stay on the government’s agenda. Indeed, one of the only things that the new Minister for Education, Science and Training has had to say about schools has been an indication that she would like to see the voucher scheme expanded. She was reported in the Australian recently as saying:
I am quite supportive of the notion of vouchers across the board ... The notion of vouchers to give parents choice is a notion that appeals to me. There are a whole range of areas where tutorial vouchers could be utilised.
We should be astounded at this continuing infatuation with vouchers in the face of the failure of this trial scheme. However, the interest in vouchers is not an interest in practical solutions to problems of educational quality. Rather, it is an application of an ideology that is flawed.
School vouchers are not a new idea. They have been used in various countries around the world with patchy impact at best. In Chile, school vouchers which could be redeemed at private schools were introduced in the late 1980s. A World Bank report in the late 1990s found that, after 13 years of operation:
There are no improvements in student achievement, contrary to the predictions of the voucher proponents.
Having weighed up the Chilean experience and with the experience of voucher systems directed only at the poorer students in Milwaukee in the United States, the same report concluded:
There is no persuasive evidence that private schools are more effective than public schools and the evidence that they are more cost-effective is mixed.
So, after years of data, there is no strong evidence to prove that vouchers improve educational quality. Vouchers are only a success in accelerating the privatisation of schooling and providing an opportunity to claim an increase in choice for parents.
But even this idea of increased choice is also flawed. In the United Kingdom, debate has recently raged over the introduction of so-called trust schools, which allow business, religious organisations and other partners to enter into administrative arrangements to manage existing schools or set up new schools. They will take control of their own buildings and land, directly employ their own staff and set and manage their own admissions criteria while remaining state-maintained schools. This is about giving parents choice, according to Mr Blair’s government, just like the voucher system. It is supposed to free parents from sending their kids to the local school and it instead offers them a broader menu to choose from.
This kind of choice is an illusion and the logic is flawed. How can everyone choose to send their children to the best schools? It is simply not possible. Schools fill up, parents cannot afford to transport their children the distances that are required and religious and other criteria exclude certain children from access to particular schools. Such models, which are designed to give choice, actually give the schools more choice, not the parents. The schools are empowered to pick the most attractive students. In turn, many local comprehensive schools suffer by having their brightest children or children from a particular section of the community picked off. This means less choice for parents who cannot get their children into alternative schools.
Just like the World Bank report found, parents are discovering that opting out of the public education system does not necessarily deliver better results for their children. Recent research that was commissioned by the New South Wales Teachers Federation has shown that, increasingly, parents are coming back into the public system after having enrolled their children in one of the burgeoning number of private schools—many of them new schools—on the promise of higher quality and a better learning environment. They have quickly found out that smart uniforms and fancy names do not equate to quality teaching and education excellence.
The Greens continue to worry that it is the view of the government that private schooling is necessarily better schooling and that any scheme that encourages parents to choose private schooling should be encouraged. The evidence is that this is not good for our children’s education and, to the extent that it distracts from the need to heavily invest in the growth and quality of public schools of all kinds, it is a dangerously flippant policy.
The Greens would like to see the $1 billion earmarked for the Investing in Our Schools program and the money earmarked for the tutorial voucher scheme be part of an investment strategy that is based on need. Rather than the criteria for funding being based on the ability of parents to fill out applications or the ability to take up voucher offers, the Greens would like to see such funding distributed on the basis of the best assessment of which investments will bring us the best bang for our education buck. That means investing in public schools, investing in Indigenous education, investing in special needs education and investing in early childhood education. In just a few weeks time we will be told by the government that they have more money than ever before for they have a record surplus, record revenue and record forecasts for more. But, if the best that the government can do to invest in all our futures through the education system is this bill, there will be record disappointment and record cynicism at that failure.
The Greens reluctantly support this bill—only because we want the $7 million to get to those public schools most in need and we support more money being spent in school literacy programs. We have deep reservations about the targeting of the $300 million that is directed specifically at the private school sector. It is disappointing to see that the government are continuing their blind faith in the continuation of a proven to be failed voucher scheme. The Greens will continue to call for the multibillion dollar investment that is needed to deliver the quality of public education that our young people deserve. Until this becomes a priority for all governments, they will find that the Greens continue to be their harshest critic in this area and the loudest advocates for public schools.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-03-27,"—The purpose of the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity Act 2004. This bill provides for funding for government financial assistance to states and territories for government and non-government schools for the 2005-08 triennium. It is an unfortunate choice of name for this bill, if we bear in mind what this government has done in real terms to school education in this country. The Commonwealth has certainly not worked together with the states and territories but has instead harried and bullied them into accepting grossly unfair and undemocratic conditions of funding which enable the Howard government to have an enormous ability to interfere with the running of government schools.
For the first time in history, the Howard government is funding the private education minority more than it is funding the state school majority. It does so, for example, by ignoring the private school income raised from ever-rising fees and other means of raising funds. It boasts that, in doing so, it is widening choice and offering more choice to parents. That may be the case in wealthy electorates on the eastern seaboard where access to private education and schools exists or where parents can actually afford to pay enormous amounts towards their school fees. But, for the majority of the Northern Territory constituents whom I represent, this bill offers nothing. It offers no extra choice and certainly offers nothing at all if you happen to be an Indigenous parent living in a remote community who relies on CDEP every fortnight.
We have the totally inequitable situation under this government where a rich grammar school in Sydney or Melbourne can have huge playing fields and a gymnasium and still get very generous taxpayer funded moneys, whereas schools in places like Ngukurr or Umbakumba in the Northern Territory struggle along with limited per capita funds and have no playing field or other equipment.
In my travels around the Northern Territory, I had the privilege two weeks ago to spend 4½ days with Barbara McCarthy, member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the seat of Arnhem. We managed to get to six Indigenous schools in six Indigenous communities in that time. The conditions in those schools have not changed significantly in the last 25 years. The reason for that is that the Northern Territory government is working extremely hard to get Indigenous kids to school, and it is working—there are more kids going to school out bush than I have seen before, particularly in the secondary school program—but the resources that those schools have are diminishing.
It was put to me by a principal of one of those schools that funds provided by governments, particularly the federal government, only allow these schools to cope—that is, the schools are funded to cope rather than funded to succeed. When I went to the Ngukurr school I found a class of 29 Indigenous kids. They are second language learners of English—so ESL kids technically. There were 29 kids in a grade 5, 6 and 7 composite class with only 25 desks and chairs. That is because the school never anticipated that they were going to have such an enormous number of kids come, certainly for the first eight or nine weeks consistently of this school year.
What we have out there in the bush, which is unrecognised by this government and also by its education department, are strategies by Labor governments working out there through people like Barbara McCarthy, who is out there talking up the benefits of education in her communities, but those schools are now seriously struggling to survive because of the poor funding arrangements handed out through the Northern Territory government to help these schools cope and exist. So much for learning together and choice!
This bill allows the minister to move funds between program years within the quadrennium for all non per-capita programs, such as the Tutorial Voucher Initiative and the Investing in Our Schools program. In addition, it also has other provisions, such as allowing for the payment of maximum general recurrent grants to non-government schools which cater for students with emotional or behavioural problems. There is nothing wrong with that on the face of it. In broad principle, Labor actually supports the bill, but we believe this government has absolutely failed in supporting all schools, having shown a total bias towards private schools in general and, with the Investing in Our Schools program funding in particular, a bias towards Liberal and Nationals electorates in particular.
The Investing in Our Schools program provides funds of $1 billion over four years for capital projects. That includes $700 million for government schools, yet only $300 million for non-government schools. For government schools, the Howard government could not resist bypassing the state and territory governments and calling for applications directly from local parents associations. That in itself makes things pretty tough for Indigenous people in the remote schools in the Northern Territory where, due to the disastrous changes made by the previous minister for education to the former ASSPA program—that is, the Aboriginal support program that used to encourage and draw Indigenous parents to participate in the schools—Indigenous parents have now voted with their feet and walked away from schools because these committees no longer exist and are not encouraged to exist by the funding actions of this government. Parents have voted with their feet. Parent groups have collapsed throughout remote schools, particularly in the Northern Territory. When you then introduce a funding system such as the Investing in Our Schools program that relies on an Indigenous parent body to either write that funding submission or sign off on it, it makes it even more difficult for those schools to access these funds. In terms of accessing funding from this federal government, it is a policy decision that has given no consideration at all to life and difficulties faced out in remote communities and the impact that changes on one funding program have in getting these Indigenous parents to access another funding program.
Figures provided by the government from the previous minister, when analysed by our shadow minister, showed that, of the total IOSP allocation last year, 66 per cent went to schools in government held electorates while 32 per cent went to ALP held electorates. The average funding to coalition electorates was $792,000, while that to ALP electorates was only $549,000.
The Tutorial Voucher Initiative announced in 2004 is another election promise that has been similarly poorly administered. With respect to the funding tutorial assistance for children who failed the benchmark reading test, this program has failed to reach many of those students who were ineligible. I should point out though that, around the states and territories, the voucher system is to be paid directly to parents other than in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, it is going to be funded through the Northern Territory government. The federal government should come to the table and start talking to the Northern Territory government about how this is going to be done. We are almost at week 8 in the Territory and none of this money has filtered through to the Northern Territory government—not one cent of it. An answer to an estimates question on notice revealed that there are 763 eligible students in the Northern Territory. I sincerely question that figure. I would say that is an incredible underestimation of the number of kids out bush who have failed to meet the year 3 benchmark and who would need assistance.
This is where we come to another situation in which this government fails to appreciate and understand the difficulties in trying to get money out to where it is severely needed. We have a government that stands on rhetoric of trying to improve Indigenous outcomes, encourage Indigenous people to lift their game and encourage Indigenous parents to get involved, but it has a funding system that does not enable Indigenous parents to get involved at all, because the funding is now not channelled through a parent committee. Secondly, we now have a situation where the voucher system will be channelled through the Northern Territory government rather than be paid directly to the schools. If there are 30 kids in a place like Ngukurr who would be eligible for that voucher system, why isn’t this funding system flexible enough to pay the money directly to the school and let them employ part-time instructors, because there will not be privately employed tutors in a place like Ngukurr or Numbulwar? Pay the money directly to the school. Get around some of the bureaucratic red tape that currently holds back Indigenous kids. Recognise that your policies are failing to achieve any sort of outcomes in terms of Indigenous education out there. They are simply not working.
The figures provided to us in estimates showed that, at best, in New South Wales only 69 per cent of those eligible had taken up the vouchers by the end of the last school year. Of course, in the Northern Territory, we are now nearly 12 months down the track and not one cent of that money has flowed to the Northern Territory government under the voucher initiatives yet. Of course, the Howard government has blamed the states for significant delays and underspending. Again, one of the classic hallmarks of this government is: ‘Never take any blame or responsibility; just take control and no responsibility.’ However, the real problem again lies with this arrogant government failing to work together with the states and territories. This program was announced on the run, with no consultation and, based on my experience in my last fortnight’s travel, with absolutely no understanding or appreciation of how a funding program like this works when you are in the back of nowhere in a remote Indigenous community that has significant barriers and hurdles to overcome.
Rather than working with all the states, this government put out the program to private tender to get private brokers to run it in many places. Some providers ended up being state and territory departments; many were not. These brokers were to administer the scheme: contract tutors, confirm child eligibility, manage the administration and report on the program. Just how accountable these private brokers will be we may see when the report on the program comes in. But at this stage, because of the enormous amount of bureaucratic red tape, none of the money for the voucher system has yet flowed through to any kid in the Northern Territory.
Figures provided to us in the estimates committee show that the best take-up rates were found where the state departments were the providers. The lowest take-up was found in Queensland, where it was 18 per cent, and Victoria, where it was only 12 per cent—and the same private broker, Progressive Learning, was contracted for both.
So this program has been an administrative disaster. Large numbers of students in dire need are not getting the help for which they are eligible. In particular that means Indigenous kids in remote communities. So, while Labor will support this bill, only because we put the funding needs of the schools and the students first and foremost, we do need to ensure that the consequences of this government’s incompetence and unfairness go down firmly on the record.
As a significant number of my constituents are Indigenous, I want to take this chance to again comment on the appalling handling of the changes to Indigenous education I have seen, particularly in the last four to five years. When you get out there in the bush and you actually talk to the teachers and you see a teacher like I saw at Ngukurr last week struggling to occupy and teach 29 children from years 5, 6 and 7 in a composite class, really the policies of this government beggar belief. They totally lack any educational credibility. I have an educational background and I would be struggling to teach 29 children from years 5, 6 and 7 here in a place like Canberra—or in Darwin or Melbourne or Sydney—let alone these kids who are learners of English as a second language. Someone somewhere in this government has just got to get the message through that this is not working and that the resources are not getting out there, let alone that they are nowhere near adequate.
How any minister could believe that a change that gives funding only after students have failed is appropriate is beyond me. But this is what happened under the previous minister with the in-class Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme. The in-class tuition was made unavailable until and unless an Indigenous student failed the year 3 literacy tests. As a former early childhood teacher myself, I find the logic of this beyond me. It is sheer stupidity—funding on the basis of failure. You have to fail to get help, by which time, of course, it will be too late. How this sort of policy will help to narrow the disadvantage gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students I am yet to work out.
Despite a departmental review concluding that ASSPA, the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program, was, if not without faults, a very successful way of involving Indigenous parents, the previous minister took it on himself, in his infinite wisdom, to abolish it. This was in total contravention of the views of Indigenous parents. In its place we have not the automatic funding of ASSPA but a competitive scheme requiring hours of submission writing, at the end of which decisions are made elsewhere and no funds are guaranteed anyway.
As a result of this, Indigenous parents are confused and annoyed and feel disenfranchised. Many have voted with their feet and no longer play a part in any school committees. How then do you expect them to be around to sign off on, to consult with the principal about or to apply for any of the money under the Investing in Our Schools program?
Many formerly funded programs and schools have been cut out of the action. Previously successful sport or cultural programs have been cut. For example, at the Maningrida school this year they have been unable to send a sports team into Darwin, so their kids will miss out on possible Territory selection for a national competition. Furthermore, on a recent trip around schools in Arnhem Land, I found that the Bulman school got nothing last year under these arrangements.
At the Bulman school, there is an Indigenous principal called Annette Miller. She is a teaching principal. That means that for five days of the week she is in front of a classroom, so she does all of the administrative work required to run the school after hours or in her spare time. This government then expects someone like her to get on a computer—that is if there is one functioning, because when I went to Numbulwar the school there had not one functioning computer in any of its classrooms or in the principal’s office—after hours and write these submissions. Well, they do not do it. They do not have the time to do it and, to be quite frank with you, it is not a priority for them when they are trying to coordinate a curriculum, send in enrolment or attendance figures or put together testing results. The government is denying this. So it is a very difficult situation out there in the bush for these people.
A reply received from the now minister, while perhaps trying to be helpful, was quite a classic smoke-and-mirrors trick again, as we have come to expect from this government. It told me that this group of schools, such as Bulman and Amanbidji, which is another school in that area, got $124,000 last year, up by $26,000 on the previous year. Good news? Not really. Amanbidji also got nothing under this new scheme. They may not have got huge dollars under ASSPA, but small, remote schools such as those need and value every dollar. A few thousand dollars under the old scheme was much better than nothing under the new scheme. In the case of Bulman and Amanbidji, I ask: where did the $124,000 go to? I do not know, but I do know that at least two of the small, remote schools in that group got nothing. The small, remote schools have been disadvantaged, both under the Investing in Our Schools program and the new PSPI program. The larger schools, usually in more urban areas, have gained at their expense.
Let me emphasise the situation of many of these small, remote bush schools. Many are one- or two-teacher schools. Many of them in fact have a teaching principal. The principal has to teach during the day and then go and do admin functions after school or at weekends. In the case of Amanbidji, since the school is so small, it is a one-teacher-principal school. Not only does the principal there do all of the above, but the school has no money for cleaners at the weekend, so he and his wife go in and clean the school on the weekend as well.
Another teacher-principal, at Milyakburra on Bickerton Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria, has 25 kids between transition and year 7 to teach all day. She then has to do all the admin work and then, just to top off her day, she also prepares all the food that is sold in the tuckshop each recess and each lunchtime. These are hardworking, highly dedicated and committed education workers. The government long ago ceased to frame education policy on educational grounds. They have become so ideologically blinkered that educational thought does not enter into their heads. We can only hope the new minister brings back a bit of reasoned— (Time expired)

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-03-27,"—Normally I like to thank senators for their contributions, but I would have to say that given the quality of the contributions it would be a touch hypocritical of me to do that. Sitting back here listening to the speeches, I thought, ‘Gosh, the Labor Party seems to have learnt nothing—the same old attacks on private schools.’ Of course, a number of the senators who spoke went to private schools so they would know whether those private schools provided an education of value or not. But my view is that a lot of parents value private school education. Increasing numbers seem to want to send their children to private schools, and I would have thought after the Latham experience the Labor Party would have actually learnt something.
—Why don’t you justify how much money you spent in coalition electorates?
—It is the same old thing. The Labor Party learnt nothing. The truth is, Senator Wong, that you are going to remain on that side of the parliament until you understand that parents want choice. This government is very comfortable with choice. Parents want choice and, until you understand that, the Labor Party is going to fail on education. I listened to Senator Crossin, who spoke earlier. I generally do listen to Senator Crossin, because she is one of those senators who like to get out and about. She is not like most Labor Party senators, who just stay confined to the city areas. Senator Crossin does get out and about—I think that is true. When I listened to Senator Crossin I thought, ‘Well, Labor was in power for 13 years; I wonder what happened to their policies in 13 years with the Indigenous schools.’ And then I thought, ‘Gosh, those government schools that Senator Crossin is talking about must be largely funded by Clare Martin’s Territory government.’ And then I thought, ‘Could Senator Crossin be attacking Clare Martin and her government?’ And I thought, ‘Gee, that’s a surprise.’ The Labor Party is in power in six states and two territories. These governments have very significant responsibilities in the area of education. Why aren’t they doing anything?
—If you have any idea how education is funded, you would know that Indigenous education is funded over and above the education budget.
—No, we listened to you, Senator, and we understand the passion with which you come to this issue. No-one disputes that passion, and no-one disputes the serious problems there are in the area of Indigenous education. What are wanting are the highly politicised ramblings that go on as though the Labor Party had no responsibilities to develop a coherent policy on this. You had a policy at the last election and it went very badly. People thought it was a very ordinary and very poor policy. I do not know: Senator Wong probably was not responsible for that, but I urge you, Senator Wong, to learn what happened in the last election, listen to the people, listen to the public and frame your policies accordingly. Do not frame them because you have been given instructions by teacher unions.
All the time I have been in this parliament, the Labor Party get their policy in the post. It is written by the teacher unions and then they release it, and then the rest of the community throw up their hands in horror. So I have to say I thought the contributions were very ordinary indeed. I am sorry to say that, because as senators know I am a senator who likes to listen and to learn, and I learnt so little from those contributions.
The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006 was passed in the other place on 1 March 2006 and was introduced by my colleague Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan on 2 March 2006. The measures in this amendment bill address the immediate needs of school communities throughout Australia by providing increased Australian government funding.
If you listened to all those contributions from the other side of the chamber, you would never have guessed that there was increased funding being made available. This bill will enable more funding in 2006 to directly benefit schools and students. So what happened? The Labor Party attacked this bill. It is a very ordinary performance. Let me just make this very obvious point: under this government, schools across Australia has been funded at record levels. The government seeks to improve outcomes from schools—
—Especially those in coalition electorates!
—and provide a better future for all Australian students through increased financial assistance to schools, particularly to those schools serving the neediest communities. Senator Wong, I am a bit surprised to hear you attacking private schools, because you of course went to a private school.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Kemp, address your comments through the chair, please.
—I just wanted to record—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—that Senator Wong went to a private school. She may have felt that her experience showed that this school was not providing a suitable education. Alternatively, she might have thought, ‘Because of the education provided at this school I have had opportunities and now at a comparatively young age I am a frontbencher in the alternative government.’ People will draw their conclusions—
—Justify the funding to private schools in coalition electorates. That is what I am talking about.
—Oh, well, Senator Wong has clarified the issue. She actually is in favour of private schools. That is a good thing, and that is entirely appropriate because it means that we have at least some agreement there. Then of course we had this rather sleazy attack on this bill, and I do not think it becomes some senators—Senator Wong in particular—to stand up here and make allegations about improper use of government funds. So let me just quote from a briefing note I have here on advice from the minister, who completely rejected any claim that there is any bias or rorting of the program, or that funds are being directed to coalition seats: ‘The minister is satisfied that there are robust processes in place for selecting projects and that the sort of bias alleged cannot happen.’ So, from my understanding, the claims are completely unfounded.

Senator Wong interjecting—


Senator Crossin interjecting—

—Order! There are too many interjections in the chamber. I ask that the minister be heard in silence.
—Thank you very much for the protection you are affording me, Mr Acting Deputy President. As you know, I am one who likes a considered debate and I am somewhat shocked at the abuse which is coming from the other side of the chamber on this important bill. As I said, the minister has indicated that there are robust processes in place for selecting projects and the sort of bias that is alleged cannot happen. Indeed, under this program the government is working hand-in-hand with peak national bodies, parents and primary and secondary school principals to make sure assessments are done as impartially as possible.
I am distressed that Senator Wong, who kept on yelling out ‘Speak about bias in funding’—so I go to a briefing note and I am now tackling that particular issue and answering Senator Wong’s question—is walking around the chamber and showing no interest. This is not a good look, Senator Wong, I regret to say. You are meant to engage in these debates.
—Senator Kemp, please address your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you for your instructions. Of course, I will abide by them totally.
—It would be helpful if you came back to the bill before us.
—Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, very rarely do I query your ruling but the debate revolved around some bias in funding and this is exactly the question that I am tackling. I think it is entirely appropriate to address these very unfortunate comments from Senator Wong and others. The point I am making is this: it is the parents and principal representatives who vote on the state based assessment advisory panels which assess applications, and the minister states that neither the department nor the state government adviser has any vote on the project. I hope that lays to rest the accusations which have been made. It is entirely appropriate if senators think—

Senator Crossin interjecting—


Senator Wong interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek your protection from this constant abuse from the other side of the chamber.
—Of course you have it.
—That is most helpful and greatly appreciated. I think that lays to rest these accusations of bias, which are totally and strongly rejected by the minister. I would like to say that there is a range of other issues from the speeches in the second reading debate that should be addressed, but there are not—that is the truth; they were very ordinary speeches. There was a bit of discussion on the tuition voucher and I thought that may be worth some comments. I make the point that this is one of a range of measures introduced by the Australian government to ensure that all students achieve a satisfactory level of literacy and numeracy. I would have thought that that would have been widely welcomed.
My summing up on this matter simply is this: I urge the Labor Party to go back to basics, to not accept registered letters from teacher unions posting their policies out to them, to listen very carefully to parents, to embrace concepts of choice, to welcome the increased funding which this government is putting towards schools and to work with the government in the very important area of Indigenous schools and education. I commend the minister. I am delighted to have had this opportunity to complete the second reading debate on this bill. I congratulate the minister and indeed the government on putting forward these measures. Naturally, we will not be accepting the second reading amendment.
—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.
Question negatived.
Original question agreed to.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006. Labor welcomes the introduction of this bill into the parliament and supports the overwhelming majority of the provisions in it. Family law is not and should not be a political battle between the Liberal and Labor parties, or the minor parties, for that matter, or a tug of war between mums and dads. Family law is about providing for and protecting children. It is children’s interests that we are tasked to take care of when debating this bill. We must not forget that the children are the very reason—really, the sole reason—for the parliament’s role in intervening at all in this tricky area of family relationships. It is easy to see how the media and certain lobby groups are attracted to sensational battle-of-the-sexes rhetoric, but it is a trap politicians should avoid.
Family law is about something much more important than mothers’ or fathers’ rights; it is about children. Given this, we should be more concerned about parents’ responsibilities than parents’ rights because this is what will benefit the children. In the other place my colleague the member for Gellibrand stated Labor’s position on family law in detail. We support this bill for reasons I will explain. However, we do have serious concerns about the effect of some of the changes, especially their effect on those cases involving family violence. Accordingly, I will be moving amendments when we come to the committee stage, which may be as early as tomorrow. These will address our four most important concerns about the bill: the new definition of violence, the cooling-off period for parenting plans, costs for false allegations and the use of the word ‘equal’ rather than ‘joint’ to describe shared parenting responsibility.
Those who have followed this debate closely will note that these are only some of the amendments that Labor moved in the House. This is not because Labor is no longer committed to all those amendments; we are—and if the government were to have a change of heart, we would gladly bring them back here—but it is clear that the government has arrogantly refused to give many of those commonsense amendments the consideration they deserve. At this point, therefore, we want to focus attention on these four critical issues, issues that go to the heart of making the family law system fair, accessible and able to meet the needs of those children and parents who have suffered the tragedy of family violence.
Let me explain why Labor supports this bill. We support the measures that encourage shared parenting. It is a positive development that more parents, mums and dads, realise the value of staying in active contact with their children after separation. In particular the last decade has seen a great change in the number of fathers wanting to play a significant role in the care of their children. It is appropriate that the law recognises that patterns of parenting are in fact changing. We also support the measures that aim to simplify court processes involving children and make them less adversarial. This picks up on the ideas that are being trialled in the Sydney and Parramatta registries of the Family Court. We note that the final assessment of that trial has not yet been completed. We do hope that the government will commit to reviewing these changes, if necessary, in the light of that report when it comes down.
Labor supports changes that will promote family dispute resolution outside the courtroom. It has the potential to save a lot of time, money and frustration. This bill is part of a package which includes a significant new government contribution to the funding of family relationship services. This includes $200 million towards increased funding of services under the existing family relationship services program. Labor does enthusiastically welcome this new money. Indeed, we have been arguing for some time that these services have been sorely neglected by the Howard government. We also welcome the plan to establish a network of 65 family relationship centres. Well managed and properly resourced, this network could provide an invaluable addition to the family law system: a shopfront and entry point for advice, referral, counselling and mediation services. But being well managed is the key, and we will be closely watching these services to make sure they are—an issue I will return to shortly.
It is clear that many of these good ideas in this bill are very much supported by Labor. This is no surprise, because many of them came out of the bipartisan work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which produced the important Every picture tells a story report. Labor is proud of the contribution that our colleagues made in that report. Further, a number of aspects of this bill we are debating today come from a later review conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which scrutinised an earlier exposure draft of this bill. I will also come to that later in a number of recommendations made by the committee. Finally, the bill has been considered, albeit hurriedly, by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. That committee has also made some sensible suggestions.
At this point it should be noted that this bill includes two important provisions that originated from the member for Gellibrand in the dissenting report from the House’s legal and constitutional committee review of the exposure draft. These provisions will temper the rights focus of the earlier draft bill with two new, important responsibilities for parents. Section 60CC, which outlines the best interests of the child test, will now require the court to consider the extent to which each parent has taken up opportunities to spend time and communicate with the child, be involved in major life decisions and pay maintenance. Section 70NCA will allow costs to be awarded against parents who make repeated nuisance claims that the other parent has breached parenting orders. Yes, they have the right to complain, but now they also have a responsibility not to abuse that right.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm
—Those sections I mentioned before the break are tremendously important new provisions which we believe should help make sure the balance of the Family Law Act is right. Our concern was that if we focus too much on rights we risk turning a blind eye to irresponsibility. The law cannot promote rights without responsibilities. When you do so you run the risk that people will abuse their rights. While the vast majority of non-resident parents, as with the majority of resident parents, take their responsibilities seriously, the exposure draft would have rewarded those who do not. In the process it would have created huge problems in those situations where a non-resident parent is more concerned with controlling their ex-partner’s life than actually maintaining a meaningful involvement in their children’s lives. So these changes are important and are welcome.
I now turn to some of the concerns Labor have with this bill. Labor’s most significant concern is to make sure this package protects people from family violence. We believe there are parts of this bill that could be better worded to afford greater protection, and I will be moving amendments accordingly during the committee stage. Labor believe that the issue of family violence has to be taken seriously; it cannot be brushed aside just because it is too difficult. The first area for improvement of the bill involves recognising the way violence affects mediation and parenting plans. While resolutions of disputes outside court are to be encouraged, we must be sure that these resolutions are genuinely made in the best interests of children, which means they must be absolutely free of bullying, coercion and/or intimidation. If we are to make mediation compulsory and give new force to parenting plans agreed to without any professional or legal advice, we need new precautions to make sure violence and fear are not influencing agreements. Some of the Labor amendments go directly to these issues—for example, a cooling off period for parenting plans.
But one change proposed by the government could in fact make matters worse, and that is the change to the definition of family violence. Only last month the government announced an Australian Institute of Family Studies research project into family violence and family law, but before it gets results from this inquiry it wants to change the definition of violence, with next to no reasoning or basis for it. The bill before us would move from a subjective to an objective test of family violence—that is, it would now require a person to show that they had a ‘reasonable’ apprehension of violence.
This is an unsatisfactory approach. First, there is an implication that some forms of violence or threatening behaviour are acceptable as long as a ‘reasonable’ person would not feel afraid. This gets courts into the very tricky business of deciding what conduct would scare a ‘reasonable’ person. We should not put courts in this position. Parliament should be very clear that there is no such thing as acceptable violence. Second, this definition does not provide scope to consider the particular circumstances of the victim—for example, a person who has previously been exposed to violence may be more sensitive and fearful in circumstances where another person might not be. Third, an objective definition is not helpful where we are dealing with who should or should not attend mediation. When it comes to mediation, it does not matter whether or not one party is ‘reasonably’ fearful of the other. Even an unreasonable fear will affect the power balance between the parties. It is simply not fair for us to force people into mediation in those circumstances. At the very least, a subjective definition should apply for the purposes of the exception to compulsory mediation.
This bill does effectively introduce a new system of compulsory mediation, with some limited exceptions. Labor are happy to support this shift, as it could help that category of cases where a separating couple has not been able to reach agreement on their own but are not so entrenched in their attitudes and disagreements as to require final orders from a court. Indeed, we can recognise that court proceedings, because of their adversarial nature, can in themselves make reaching agreement even more difficult. In these cases, compulsory mediation before litigation could act as a useful circuit-breaker before a dispute escalates. However, compulsory mediation could carry serious consequences if it is not implemented in the right away.
In our view, compulsory mediation will require the following conditions. First, it must be accessible. We welcome the government’s promise of three hours of free funding in every case, but we want this in the legislation as a precondition for compulsory mediation. If the government changes its mind, if this becomes another of Mr John Howard’s ‘non-core’ promises, we cannot require people to attend mediation at their own expense. The second condition is that staff must be well trained. We all agree that cases involving family violence or entrenched conflict are not suitable for mediation and should be dealt with in the formal court setting. In practice, in order to get this right we need to be confident that the FRC staff can recognise the signs of violence and entrenched conflict and understand how to make appropriate referrals. If mediators do not do this, and try to force mediation in inappropriate circumstances, we may have some disastrous, even tragic, outcomes on our hands. Similarly, acknowledging the complex emotional context of family separation, FRC staff need to be adequately trained in dealing with violent situations when they arise in the course of mediation.
Next, the government must assure quality of services. Training staff is not enough—the government must also ensure that the quality of mediation services is to a consistently high standard. I have to say I am alarmed that the government’s operational framework document contains key performance indicators which seem to prioritise the quantity of parenting agreements reached rather than the quality of services provided. We need to make sure that the incentives for centres are right: too much focus on quantity could actually encourage staff to push people into agreements that are not sensible—or, in fact, appropriate—because they are rewarded on their churn rate. We are talking about dealing with complex family relationships here, not sausage factories, and Labor will be watching this aspect of this implementation very closely. It is a matter that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs learned at their cost—that, in fact, quantity should not put aside quality outcomes.
Centres must not pursue ideological or religious agendas. These centres will be funded by government to provide services, not to promote their own agendas. We know that there are many views in the community on issues like relationships, divorce, parenting and so on. These are complex issues and our society benefits from hearing many points of view. But government funded relationship services should not be used as vehicles for this sort of advocacy or social engineering. The Attorney-General has to take personal responsibility to make sure that this, in fact, does not happen. And of course, lastly, centres must not discriminate. If centres are to be accessible to all people, the government must ensure that they do not discriminate on the grounds of gender, ethnicity, religion, disability or socioeconomic disadvantage.
At the end of the day, the implementation is the personal responsibility of the Attorney-General and his colleagues. On passage of this bill the opposition will continue—as it has done in other areas—to closely watch the FRC roll-out, and we expect the Attorney-General to be completely transparent about the process. We will make sure that he is held personally responsible for any failures.
As I have indicated, although we do have some significant amendments that will improve the bill, Labor supports the key principles involved in this package of family law reforms. There is bipartisan agreement on the important issues: encouraging shared parenting responsibility, encouraging non-litigious resolution of disputes, allowing more flexible and less formal court procedures and others. The amendments we propose will simply strengthen the family law system’s capacity to deal effectively with those cases where family violence is an issue. They do not undermine any of the fundamentals of the plan—indeed, most of them simply revert to the Attorney-General’s original plan in the exposure draft he produced. This is an important bill and Labor believes it will improve our family law system. Labor’s amendments will simply make it better and I urge senators to support our amendments and the bill itself.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-27,"—Today I would like to address some specific concerns with the particulars of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 as highlighted in the Greens’ and Democrats’ minority report to the committee’s findings on this issue. But I would also like to reflect on the wider debate on how parenting responsibilities are shared within Australian families—those who stay together, those who go through tough times and those who separate. Beyond the specific issues I have with the changes to family law and the changes to support services for families in crisis that we are considering, I have some wider concerns about how this debate is being conducted and the particular subset of issues that the government has chosen to focus on in this legislation.
I strongly support the direction of social change within Australia that has seen fathers playing, and seeking to play, a much more active and substantial role in the parenting of children than in decades gone by. I believe that we should do more to encourage and support genuine sharing of parenting roles and responsibilities within our society. I think that this social change reflects changing attitudes and expectations within our society, and we are seeing increasing numbers of young Australian men and women who are moving away from the traditional notion of the distant, authoritarian father towards notions of active and nurturing coparenting.
I believe that the government has an important role to play in supporting these developments—in supporting community education about positive parenting, in providing resources to help parents develop their parenting skills and in providing support services to help families in trouble find positive means of resolving their disputes. I also support government’s role in reforming family law to ensure that there is justice and fairness for all. To this end, I support improving family law in Australia.
At this point I think that I should point out that I am a coparent. I coparent my son through an equal, shared parenting arrangement and I have personal experience in the Family Court. I also have an ongoing commitment to the care of other children who have experienced significant trauma in their lives and lost their mother to domestic violence. I know the personal anguish and heartbreak that is associated with family break-up. I know first-hand what it is like to go through mediation, and I have some understanding and insight into what kids go through, and how difficult it is to deal with the life consequences of abuse.
I believe that when relationships break down and families separate, in the majority of cases, the best outcome for the family is one of shared parenting responsibility and as equal a sharing of parenting time as is possible and practical given family circumstances. However, I am concerned about those situations where there is a history of family violence or abuse, or other unforeseen complicating circumstances. Under these circumstances I believe that the safety and wellbeing of the child must be paramount and that a presumption of shared parenting time is not necessarily the best starting point.
Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that domestic violence and family violence are still present in our society. I believe that the government and community, men and women, have done a lot to foster exposure of this domestic violence and to progress its debate within our society. I am deeply concerned that some aspects of this legislation—and the debate that is going around it—have in fact regressed that understanding, and they need to deal with domestic violence in an open manner.
I would like to quote from the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children in a submission they made to the hearings on this bill:
There is significant research to show that domestic violence and child abuse are very real issues for many women and children, and that separation from an abusive partner can be the most dangerous time for women and children. The proposed reforms not only do not address how the family law system will be improved to protect women and children from ongoing violence and abuse following separation, but in fact create further barriers to women and children achieving safety. The proposed changes take a punitive approach towards women in their attempts to escape domestic violence and child abuse.
I am particularly concerned about the debate around the issues of shared parenting responsibility and the changes proposed by the government to family law. I am concerned they have focused very narrowly on dysfunctional, post separation families and totally ignored the wider issues of how we encourage and support intact families to help them more effectively deal with relationship problems and separated families who are seeking constructive solutions to shared parenting. Measures to improve shared parenting in intact families could help reduce the stress and conflict that lead to family breakdown. The government could make a real difference to the pressures and stresses on modern families that contribute to failing relationships by making some positive changes to help families: by increasing the accessibility and affordability of child care, by changing the work environment to make it more family friendly and by improving access to education and support services for family and relationship skills.
Unfortunately, we have seen a whole wave of legislation in industrial relations and social services, such as Welfare to Work, a combination of which I believe makes it harder for Australian families to balance work and family commitments. There were also changes to tax law that make it economically more difficult to have shared parenting responsibilities, providing tax incentives that only apply if one parent leaves work and do not apply if both parents try to work part time. We have seen changes to industrial relations that make it harder for parents to set aside family time, creating a more flexible workforce where employers can unilaterally set work hours rather than encouraging more flexible workplaces. We have seen changes to Welfare to Work that effectively force many single mothers back into the workforce at a minimum wage without what we consider to be adequate provisions to ensure the care and wellbeing of their children. Those changes put more pressure on parents and make it more difficult for them to share their parenting responsibilities. They will arguably create more work for the courts and relationships counsellors, not less. Some may argue that I am trying to make yet another political point. I am not; I am merely pointing out that these are the issues that families are dealing with every day of their lives.
The initial idea behind increasing the focus on mediation and alternative dispute resolution was a very good one. There was a real possibility for the new family relationship centres to be an effective preventative strategy to reduce the amount of family break-up. Unfortunately, with the focus of this legislation on compulsory mediation, which I will touch on shortly, as a pre-court requirement for families that are already effectively separated, it seems that this opportunity will be lost. The family relationship centres will be swamped with difficult and intractable cases in which there is little way to go forward. It is quite likely that that will make them less pleasant and scarier places for those genuinely seeking relationship support services. It is likely to be increasingly hard to find an appointment slot for voluntary counselling or mediation when there are so many others who are required to attend.
It is also unfortunate that there has been what I believe to be skewed references to the outcomes of the Family Court. We need to bear in mind that it is the extremely difficult cases that end up in the Family Court, so it is hardly surprising that the so-called requirement pressed by some sectors of our community for always having a fifty-fifty outcome is unlikely to be reached, when these cases are the most difficult and heart-rending cases that have to be dealt with in family law. I believe that the principle by which we need to look at family law is the best interests of the child. This must remain our No. 1 priority. The system must ensure the safety of children and women from abuse and violence. We must focus on the rights of the child and the responsibility of the parents. Prevention and support is better than mediation, which is, of course, better than court. Shared parenting is a two-way street.
I will now deal with some of the aspects of the bill that we have particular concerns with. We are concerned, although there has been a move to equal shared responsibility from a presumption of equal time, that this still creates a situation in which the rights of the parents to equal time or substantial and significant time are put ahead of the child’s best interests. As the Women’s Legal Services Australia points out, this leads to a:
... pro-contact culture that promotes the right to contact over safety—
which—
... undermines the child’s best interests in that it fails to properly prioritise the adverse effects on children of being exposed to abuse.
Provisions which require consideration of specific types of parenting arrangements, whether they call for equal or substantially shared time, necessarily direct attention away from a free and open consideration of what arrangements may be in the best interests of the child in any specific case. That is why the Greens believe that a presumption of equal shared responsibility should not be introduced and that each case should be considered on its own merits. We prefer the use of the phrase ‘joint shared responsibility’. We are concerned that the two-tiered approach of having primary and additional considerations when determining the best interests of the child does not consider the best interests of the child. The Greens support the retention of the current structure of the act. We are concerned that the child’s views will be relegated to the list of additional considerations, effectively putting the parent’s desire for access ahead of the child’s need for security.
When there is a history of family violence or abuse, the two primary considerations in this section of the legislation, those of the child having a meaningful relationship with both parents and of protecting the child from harm, effectively cancel each other out, as it is impossible to maintain a meaningful relationship with an abusive parent and still protect the child from harm. I believe that the term ‘meaningful relationship’ needs to be clearly defined in the legislation to make it clear what a meaningful relationship is—that is, one where a child has not been exposed to or put at risk of violence, abuse or neglect. Without this being done, a parent can be put into an untenable situation of being required to facilitate an unsafe relationship.
This is of particular concern because the changes proposed to the definition of ‘family violence’ and the costs of false allegations create a situation in which the level of unreported family violence is likely to increase substantially. On the issue of the definition of ‘family violence’ and the costs of false allegations, significant concerns have been raised in committee hearings about the proposed changes to the definition of ‘family violence’. The Family Issues Committee of the Law Society of New South Wales submitted:
Family violence is complex. In all but the simple cases family violence is not just an action, it is a course of actions. It is not just an event, it is a progression of events. Family violence often follows a complex cycle. Therefore, to treat family violence in a mono-dimensional manner in legislation is to treat family violence in an extremely simplistic manner, which is potentially dangerous and disempowering to victims and survivors of violence.
The Australian Greens are concerned that the introduction of the objective test as proposed will discourage victims from seeking the protection of the court where they lack the confidence that they have sufficient documentary or third party evidence to be able to substantiate their claim. This is raising the bar on the issue of family violence significantly in the absence of any evidence that there is a need to do so.
We support the chair’s recommendation that the government use the results of research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies into family violence, but we contend that the definition should remain the same as in the current act until the results of that research are known. Where the changes to the definition of ‘family violence’ are taken together with the provisions relating to costs orders for false allegations, it seems likely that this will create a situation in which there will be a significant increase in the amount of unreported family violence.
I would like to point out here that, in a paper by Michael Flood from the Australia Institute, there is a significant amount of evidence that in fact debunks the notion that mothers in particular—because the allegation is made mainly against mothers—make false allegations. There is an impressive array of research that finds that in fact that is not the case. Mothers do not use allegations of violence to prevent fathers from having access to their children, nor is there any evidence to suggest that, even if they did, that has any outcome on Family Court proceedings. I therefore support recommendation 7 of the committee’s report which is that the clause dealing with allegations of family violence and the costs associated with false allegations should be removed. As the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children told the inquiry:
I want to particularly address the notion that raising allegations of violence and abuse gives you a tactical advantage in court processes. The reality is quite contrary to that; it is a disadvantage. Every day we hear women and grandparents being told by their lawyer not to raise domestic violence or child abuse issues because they will be seen as hostile and will risk losing residency.
I will move on to the issue of compulsory mediation. I do not want anybody to be under any illusions that we do not support mediation. We do support it. But we are extremely concerned about the use of compulsory mediation where there are cases of domestic violence. I would like to read a few quotes from women who have been involved in mediation. This is from a paper called ‘Family Violence and Family Mediation’ by Relationships Australia in Victoria. It says:
Violence and abuse does impact on women’s capacity to mediate. As one woman said, ‘The violence was like a shadow in the room so I could never talk about my wishes.’ Many went ahead with mediation to try and find resolution with a man of whom they were fearful rather than out of a desire to mediate for their own outcomes. Here are a few quotes:
‘I wasn’t emotionally strong enough.’
All women found the process of mediation extremely difficult. They felt unprepared for just how hard it was to mediate with their ex-partners.
‘Neutrality is like saying your story doesn’t exist.’
‘If I tried to talk about the violence she [the mediator] put up her hand to stop me and moved on to the next question.’
I use that quote to highlight the fact that mediation is extremely difficult for those participating in mediation in circumstances of family violence. We support initiatives to encourage families to undertake alternative dispute mediation instead of going to court. We support moves to provide greater resources to family relationship centres. We support initiatives that will improve the accreditation of centres, mediators and counsellors who deliver these services. However, we are concerned about the capacity of the sector to deal with the massive increase in demand brought about by this move to compulsory mediation.
We are also extremely concerned about the lack of skills and resources in this sector to deal with these particularly hard situations of family violence. When questioned during the committee hearing, the experts freely admitted that you need specialised training and that, at the present time, there were not enough people with this specific type of training. In the Greens and Democrats dissenting report, we highlight a list of issues that we believe need to be urgently resolved and addressed in the area of accreditation and training in family dispute resolution services. These tackle the issues of forward programming—how we are going to find sufficient people with expertise and how we are going to train those people. We need to have separate entrance rooms, for example, in situations of domestic violence. There are a range of issues that need to be dealt with if mediation is truly going to work in these difficult and complex situations.
I would also like to mention quickly the urgent need to address counselling and mediation services in rural and remote areas. It is totally unacceptable to be mediating in these difficult situations in teleconferences and over the phone. This situation will fail rural and regional services.
In conclusion, I would like to make the point that we support progress in family law in this country. We are deeply concerned about some of the proposals contained in this legislation. We made a series of recommendations on how to deal with them and I will be putting a series of amendments in committee of the whole to try to address what we believe are serious concerns with this legislation.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-03-27,"—Family First recognises and honours the unique and irreplaceable role of mothers and fathers. Parents have the most important and the toughest job of all—raising children. They have the primary responsibility for nurturing, raising and educating their children, who are our nation’s future. As a society, we should do everything we can to support parents in this vital role. Family First salutes them.
Turning to the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006, Family First’s top priority is the welfare of children. It is a sad and unfortunate fact of life that many relationships end. It is crucial that we find the best way of dealing with these situations to minimise the damage, particularly to children, but also to parents. When I first looked at this legislation I went over the statistics on divorce in Australia. In 2004 there were almost 53,000 divorces granted in Australia—and of course there are thousands of de facto relationships that also end. Looking at those 53,000 divorces as couples, that represents 100,000 people in relationship breakdowns, in the formal sense, for that year. Almost half of the divorces in 2004 involved children under 18 years of age. Of those, about one quarter involved children under five, and more than a third involved children between five and nine.
The Family Court is not a good place for Australian children. In almost 98 per cent of cases, a child will effectively lose one of their parents after a Family Court decision—creating a stolen generation of children. Only 2½ per cent of Family Court orders allow children to have equal time with both parents after a relationship breakdown. That does not make sense and it is not in line with what people would expect. Many would be surprised, as I was, to find out that it was only 2½ per cent.
Family First believes the first question we must always ask is: what is in the best interests of the child? Shared parenting is the best outcome for children, because children can continue to have a real father and a real mother. The current system is clearly not working, and this is having a damaging effect on children. Family First believes a new system is needed—and, to its credit, the government has realised that there is a problem and has introduced this bill. However, it needs to go further, which is why Family First is introducing amendments to ensure shared parenting is the norm.
The way children see it, in a household, they have equal access to their parents. When a relationship ends, the way to maintain equal access for children is shared parenting. If a parent has not done anything wrong, why should the child be penalised by effectively losing one of their parents? For this to work, the parent has to want to exercise their responsibility and be with their child. It is not our purpose to force parents to exercise shared parenting, but Family First would hope that all parents would want to. Just because a relationship ends does not mean the job of being a parent ends.
The value of relationships with extended family, such as grandparents, should never be underestimated. They are so important to children’s development, providing a greater sense of purpose, belonging and inheritance. Participation in extended family life improves children’s chances of building resiliency.
In summary, Family First strongly supports the introduction of a rebuttable presumption of equal parenting time for children after a relationship breakdown. Equal parenting time must be the starting point when considering arrangements after parents have separated—and I emphasise ‘the starting point’. It could be rebutted in a number of ways. One parent may argue to the court that equal parenting would not be in the interests of their child in their particular circumstances, perhaps due to work or travel commitments. The court may determine it could not be ordered because residing with one parent could pose a threat to the physical, psychological or emotional wellbeing of the child.
We all know that sole custody arrangements have caused much distress to children and their non-custodial parents—in most cases, fathers. Because of the way the Family Court follows precedents in determining residency orders, most parties have strong incentives to pursue sole residency orders, and too often the father loses out. Family First amendments are central to the hopes of many people in the community, particularly children, parents and extended families, who have been damaged by the entrenched views of the Family Court against equal parenting. Family First strongly supports their cause and will continue to champion it. Shared parenting is the best outcome for our children—and surely that is argument enough for Family First’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I rise this evening to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006. Labor support the majority of the provisions in this bill. We believe that the bill will go some way towards smoothing the rough edges in family law and will ease the process for many people who are going through separation and divorce. We commend the government for taking up some of Labor’s amendments to improve this bill. I am a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and we have just concluded an inquiry into the provisions of this bill. The report was tabled on Friday and made available today. I am pleased to say that Labor senators agree with almost all of the recommendations of the majority report. We are particularly pleased that the committee has recommended changes, including a redraft of the definition of family violence and a removal of subsection 117AB in relation to allegations of family violence. As I said, Labor support the main thrust of this legislation. However, we do believe there are several shortcomings. A number of those were covered by Senator Ludwig is his comments earlier today. I intend to talk about some of those in a moment and also about the inquiry.
Firstly, I would like to make some general comments about families in Australia, in particular about the area of family law. I have read recently that there are now one million children in Australia who have one parent living elsewhere. Of those, somewhere of the order of 250,000 children rarely or even never see their non-resident parent. This strikes me as a very sad situation. Of course, there are a variety of reasons behind this. Tragically, some non-resident parents do not want to spend time with their children. Some live a long distance away. In other cases, there are issues of violence or, tragically, even child abuse. Unfortunately, divorce has become a commonplace event in Australian society. In just a few generations, divorce has gone from being a rare occurrence to the situation we have now whereby we are told that around one in two new marriages will not last.
I am not attempting to make any value judgment here. I am not saying that divorce is necessarily a bad thing. We know that women in earlier generations—for example, those who suffered family violence—usually lacked the financial resources or the work skills that would have allowed them to leave the relationship. I make this comment simply because the rise in divorce has led to a dramatic change in our social landscape in Australia. For example, we now accept that a family is no longer just the nuclear family of mum, dad and the kids. All of us here will know or perhaps even belong to a sole-parent family, a step-family or a blended family. This change in the social landscape has brought about great challenges for those of us in the parliament as we seek to make laws to cover a diverse group of families who find themselves in a variety of circumstances. We are aware that any changes we make to family law will not magically help everyone. They will certainly not remove the pain that comes with a family break-up. Even in the most amicable of circumstances, a divorce or separation is a very stressful time. Indeed, the experience of divorce is known to be one of life’s most traumatic experiences, and it is often said that it is second only to the death of an immediate family member.
Parents who are used to seeing their children every day have to adjust to seeing them on a part-time basis. They also have to work out how best to help their children who are also suffering. At the same time as they are trying to adjust to life without their partner, they are also negotiating division of property and, for at least one parent, this often involves moving house and buying new household items, including quite often another set of just about everything for their children. It is not just parents and children who are affected by divorce and family breakdown. Grandparents too may find themselves unable to see their grandchildren as often as they would like, or being unable to alleviate their children and grandchildren’s distress.
Like most senators and members, I receive a very large number of letters on the issues of family law and child support. I estimate that, along with immigration, this is probably the area in which I receive the greatest amount of correspondence. Many of the letters I receive are from non-resident parents, usually fathers, who want to spend more time with their children. I also get letters from grandparents and from new partners in support of non-resident parents. I get letters from resident parents who complain that non-resident parents refuse to contribute their fair share financially or have little interest in seeing their children. Some of these letters are very disturbing. I add that there are also letters that turn stereotypes on their heads. I will give one example of a letter that I received not long ago from a man who is disabled. His wife had left him and he was raising their children alone. This man was living on a disability pension, and his wife, who was in work, refused to contribute financially to the children. On top of that, she was not interested at all in seeing her children. I give this example to indicate that this is a complex issue and that there can never be a one-size-fits-all solution in an area such as this.
I would now like to move on and discuss the substance of the bill and some of the findings of the committee. The first thing I would say is that I welcome the fact that this bill, for the first time, introduces the concept of responsibility into this area of the law. When a parent does not fulfil his or her responsibilities, whether that be a failure to pay child support or through breaching contact orders, this will now be taken into account by the courts. I might add that this notion of responsibility was one of Labor’s amendments, and we are very pleased, as I said, that this has been taken up.
There are other key issues in the bill which have bipartisanship support. Labor supports the promotion of out-of-court dispute resolution though the establishment of family relationship centres. We do, however, have some reservations about the family relationship centres, and I will come to those in a moment. Another area that has Labor’s full support is the provision that courts be required to consider equal or significant and substantial time with each parent where that is appropriate. Many senators here will recall that the idea of a rebuttable presumption of equal time custody was covered in the landmark report of 2003 entitled Every picture tells the story.
At the conclusion of that lengthy House of Representatives inquiry it was decided, on a bipartisan basis, that the rebuttable presumption should be rejected. Instead the committee proposed section 65DAA, which requires that, in making a parenting order, the court must consider whether an equal time or substantial and significant time arrangement is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practical. If such arrangements are in the best interests of the child and reasonably practical, then the court must make an order for those arrangements.
We were also pleased that the government supported our amendments which guarantee that parenting plans must not be made under duress, coercion or threat. When the bill was debated in the House of Representatives, the government, as I said, accepted some of Labor’s amendments, but unfortunately they did not accept all of them. We are particularly disappointed that the government rejected the following amendments: firstly, a reversal of the requirement that an apprehension of family violence be ‘reasonable’; secondly, removal of the requirement for parties to make a ‘genuine effort’ to resolve their dispute in mediation; thirdly, a reversal of the move to equal shared parental responsibility; and, fourthly, a bid to mandate the provision of information to separating couples encouraging them to go to court.
I will now attempt to explain some of these four points in more detail. I will begin with the issue of family violence. I have spoken in this place on many occasions about the prevalence of violence against women. Almost a quarter of women who have been married or in a de facto relationship have experienced some form of violence. We know that the most dangerous time for a woman is just after she has left a relationship. This bill seeks to change the way that violence is assessed so that it becomes an objective rather than subjective definition. You might ask: ‘What is the difference between objective and subjective? Why does this cause a problem?’ The problem is that it implies that there is some acceptable level of threatening conduct. It also fails to take into account a history of abusive treatment.
Under this legislation it is no longer enough to be afraid of someone; you have to prove that you are afraid of them. Just to take an example, let us say that Mary’s husband has a history of violence and Mary knows from past experience that, when he is yelling and leans over her and goes red in the face, he could lash out and hit her. On the other hand, if Suzie’s partner exhibits this behaviour she may not be frightened. I find most disturbing this failure to recognise that there are many different forms of threatening behaviour. It is unreasonable to expect someone to attend compulsory mediation when they are afraid. I also find it ironic that the government’s own advertisements—which we have been seeing on the TV again just recently—on violence against women, as part of the ‘Australia says no’ campaign, give a range of warning signs such as threatening, controlling or possessive behaviours which may be indicators of later violence.
I mentioned earlier that I applaud the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in relation to this issue. The committee recommends:
The proposed definition of family violence should be redrafted to clarify that the test is the ‘reasonable person in the shoes of the individual and whether they would fear or have an apprehension of violence’.
There is no level playing field for parents when one person fears for their safety. This problem is compounded by the government’s requirement that the parties need to make a ‘genuine effort’ to resolve their dispute in mediation. This is a matter on which the committee received a considerable amount of evidence.
If one person sits through compulsory mediation in fear, unable to contribute, the question is: will she be given a black mark or judged as not making a ‘genuine effort’? The government announced an independent inquiry into family violence on 26 February this year. This research is being conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Labor is concerned that the government is changing the definition of family violence without waiting for the results from this research.
I now move to the question of equal shared parental responsibility. Labor wanted to amend the word ‘equal’ back to ‘joint’, as was originally proposed by the government. Parental responsibility is a separate issue from residence and contact. It is not focused on how much time a parent spends with a child. It is defined as ‘all the duties, powers, responsibilities, and authority which, by law, parents have in relation to children’.
For a start it is nonsense to presume that this can be neatly carved into two equal parts. In addition, the reason why Labor wanted the word ‘joint’ is that we think that the government is trying to create a false impression here. We believe that, if the word ‘equal’ is used, there will be people who assume that the government supports the idea of equal shared time, which, as I said, actually has very little to do with responsibility.
We are disappointed that the government voted against our amendment to guarantee in law that the move to compulsory mediation be coupled with three hours of free mediation. There are also question marks about the family relationship centres. So far we have no details about whether or not there will be proper accreditation standards, quality control or training in how to recognise family violence. As I said, family violence being the very serious issue that it is, this is absolutely critical if these family relationship centres are to operate effectively.
There is one final comment I would like to make, and again it is on the issue of violence. I am quite concerned that the government has rejected our suggestion against allowing cost orders against people who make false accusations of family violence. There is little evidence that false accusations of violence are a major problem. From time to time we hear anecdotal stories, but there is no research or statistics to back this up. On the other hand, we do know that violence against women is grossly underreported. I am pleased that the committee could see this point, and the committee has recommended that there should be no change towards imposing costs until such research that I have referred to is commissioned by the government and is made available. It is unclear whether this is an area that needs solving, and therefore the proposed obligation on the court to make costs orders against parties found to have knowingly made false allegations should not be included in this piece of legislation.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Labor agrees with almost all of the recommendations of the majority report. As a consequence, we support most of the provisions in this bill. We do not agree with all that the government has proposed. We believe that there is significant room for improvement and, as Senator Ludwig indicated, Labor will be moving amendments to the bill along the lines that I have suggested. In addition, the seven-day cooling-off period will be addressed. Finally, Labor supports most of the provisions of this bill but we would like to see some amendments that would improve it in the way that I have suggested. I urge senators to support Labor’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-03-27,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats as their Attorney-General spokesperson, to address the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 and comment on what are significant—extremely significant in some cases—changes to the Family Law Act. The Australian Democrats recognise that the intention of this bill is to generate a less adversarial approach in some of these matters, particularly in resolving custody disputes and attempting to improve outcomes for families in the event of family breakdown. We acknowledge the government’s comment in the bill’s explanatory memorandum that these changes are intended to bring about a cultural shift in how family separation is managed—that is, away from litigation and towards cooperative parenting. We also recognise the process that this bill has been through prior to its arrival in this place for debate this evening, so it has quite a significant contemporary—if you like—parliamentary history.
The bill primarily implements a number of recommendations from the 2003 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on child custody arrangements, entitled Every picture tells a story. Following the release of that report, an exposure draft of the bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported last year. The bill was first considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee during a single-day hearing conducted, I think, on 3 March—this month. Despite the lengthy consideration of this bill by the House of Representatives committees, the Senate committee process was truncated. Certainly we believe the time allowed for consideration of this legislation was inadequate under the circumstances, particularly given the significance and volume of the legislation and the changes.
The Democrats do recognise that the chair’s report contains a series of recommendations for improving this bill. The Democrats do not believe that those recommendations go far enough. A dissenting report was therefore drafted and submitted by Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats family services spokesperson, and me on behalf of the Democrats and also by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens. It is noted in the dissenting report that the 36-hour time frame that we had to comment on the chair’s report and recommendations and then provide our supplementary or dissenting report was an inadequate time for such a far-reaching piece of legislation. Despite the limited time available to comment, we did seek to elaborate on some key concerns that we felt were not adequately addressed in the chair’s report.
I might note at this point that one recommendation from the chair’s report that we resoundingly support in its current form is recommendation 7. This recommendation opposes the introduction of section 117AB, the provision allowing for the awarding of costs where an allegation of violence is proven to be false. We will move an amendment to this effect, to ensure that the intention of that recommendation is upheld. We have concerns that this provision would have the effect of further promoting the existing problem—one that I am sure many would agree exists—of underreporting of family violence. We believe that currently the bill as it is structured would have a deleterious impact on people reporting instances of family violence, and that is obviously something we want to prevent.
During the Senate committee process, evidence was provided by groups suggesting that without changes this legislation could actually have disastrous consequences for the safety of vulnerable family members, especially women and children in our community and especially where there is a history of family violence. In the submission by the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children, evidence was provided which said:
There is significant research to show that domestic violence and child abuse are very real issues for many women and children, and that separation from an abusive partner can be the most dangerous time for women and children.
They go on to say:
The proposed reforms not only do not address how the family law system will be improved to protect women and children from ongoing violence and abuse following a separation, but in fact create further barriers to women and children achieving safety. The proposed changes take a punitive approach towards women and their attempts to escape domestic violence and abuse.
I want to be very clear about this. We agree with the position outlined by the opposition, that this bill has become politicised. Of course; it is always going to be, considering the political nature of some of the subjects under discussion and the political views perhaps driving some of the provisions. But we also recognise that the focus needs to return to what is important, and what is important is that better outcomes are created for children and for families. What is also important is to return that focus to protecting children and also people—specifically and usually women—who have been exposed to violence or abuse in a family setting and continue to be at risk post separation.
The issue of funding has been raised by a number of groups. Family Services Australia expressed concern during the inquiry about what they perceive to be inadequate consideration of approaches to ensure equitable impacts across target groups. There is a concern that the funding to be provided to supplement these changes will be insufficient, in particular to cater for those groups with special needs or those groups that cannot access services for any particular reason. The Democrats sincerely hope that in allocating funding the government hears the concerns of these groups and responds to them.
The Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 will fundamentally change the way parenting orders under part 7 of the act are determined. Firstly, before a court can hear an application for a parenting order, with a few exceptions, parents will be required to adhere to a new regime of compulsory family dispute resolution. Then, if an agreement is not reached and a court application is made, the court is directed to apply a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in determining parenting orders. If this presumption is upheld, the court must consider whether spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable, and if it is must consider granting this distribution of time with each parent.
The bill will also change the way in which a child’s best interests are to be determined. The bill creates a new two-tier regime for the determination of a child’s best interests. It relegates the considerations currently in 68F of the old act to the position of additional considerations. It introduces two new primary considerations for the determination of a child’s best interests. These are the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents and the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm or being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.
As you have heard, a new definition of family violence will be introduced as a result of this legislation. The definition will become an objective one where the alleged victim’s experience will be tested by reference to a reasonable fear or apprehension in relation to their wellbeing or safety. The bill also contains a provision that will allow for cost orders to be made against a person found to falsely allege family violence. As I have mentioned, the Democrats have circulated a number of amendments, including ones that address these issues in particular. We have certainly addressed a number of issues that we hope will ameliorate some of the worst aspects of the bill.
The Democrats note the government amendments that passed the House during the last session. These amendments did address various issues of concern but they did not significantly alleviate these concerns, as articulated by groups providing evidence of the overall harmful effect this bill will have particularly on women and children, particularly those with a history of family violence and/or those who are disadvantaged in some way. One amendment that we are keen to make clear on the record has a positive effect is (7), which will allow for parties to be exempt from compulsory dispute resolution where their safety is at risk or where there is a risk that a child may suffer abuse. We consider that, subject to a number of further amendments which we will propose, this bill will be improved and more closely achieve its stated aims. As a caveat to this, we specifically note the difficulties posed by the existence of family violence or child abuse.
The issue of consent orders was raised during the committee inquiry by Relationships Australia. The discussion on this issue clearly demonstrated the need for further safeguards to prevent violence as a consequence of these changes. Ms Susan Holmes, representing Relationships Australia, a peak national counselling body, submitted:
... a lot of abuse is quite well hidden and it is a matter of reading the clues. I am very concerned about consent orders. A couple, where there is a lot of intimidation, can present consent orders.
                  …         …         …
I understand some judges and registrars who approve consent orders read them and some do not.
                  …         …           …
... with domestic violence, there is a real risk that consent orders might slip through without anyone identifying that this seems a peculiar arrangement.
I have used this example to demonstrate that this area of the law has many complexities, as we all know. These complexities, if not addressed, may actually mean greater tragedy than we have already seen examples of, following the breakdown of families. Protections for the vulnerable are essential. Protections need to be strengthened.
The Democrat key concerns are as follows. We consider that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility as a starting point for determining where a child lives after parental separation generates more of a focus on parents’ rights than on what is actually in the child’s best interests. We should not be talking about rights and entitlements for parents; we should be focusing on the best interests of the child. We consider that the child has become objectified by this process, objectified in this discussion, and the issue is becoming one of entitlement.
I note the comments earlier from Senator Kirk and, I have no doubt, others. The use of the term ‘equal’ has been criticised widely. It is considered quite a divisive term that focuses more on parents’ rights than on the responsibility component. The Australian Democrats will move an amendment to alter the language of the bill to the term ‘joint parental responsibility’ which, as you have heard articulated in previous speeches, is a more appropriate reference and a less divisive term.
The Democrats also oppose the inclusion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility on the basis that it is unnecessary to apply a presumption as the court should have the child’s best interests as its primary focus. We are worried that we are losing focus on this. Why should we presume and ensure that the court works within that set of presumptions? The court should have as its primary focus the best interests of the child.
Evidence was provided in a submission to the Senate inquiry by Women’s Legal Services Australia. They claim that ‘the presumption of contact has permeated family law practice and led to a pro-contact culture that promotes the right to contact over safety’, which ‘undermines the child’s best interests in that it fails to properly prioritise the adverse effects on children of being exposed to abuse either directly or by witnessing the abuse of their parent’. These are serious, fundamental, complex, difficult issues, and they are not satisfactorily dealt with in this legislation. The effect of this presumption, when coupled with the court’s requirement to consider whether equal or substantial and significant time is arguably to create a de facto presumption and compounds the divergence from consideration of what is best for children. The Democrats have serious concerns about this. Women’s Legal Services Australia submitted to the inquiry:
... the provisions in sections 65DAA and 63DA, which require consideration or direct attention to specific types of parenting arrangements—namely, equal time or substantially shared time arrangements—derogate from a free and open assessment of what arrangement may be best for children in a specific case ...
The Democrats agree with this statement. We agree that this is the case under the bill before us as it is currently drafted. We acknowledge that a stable environment encourages healthy child development. However, there has been no conclusive evidence to prove that a presumption of equal time rather than a consideration of the child’s unique circumstances in each case would be of any benefit to a child. And surely that is the focus here.
The new structure for determining what is in a child’s best interests includes conflicting primary requirements that a child have meaningful relationships with both parents and that they should be protected from harm. We note the difficulty caused by situations where the child may have an abusive or violent parent. The additional considerations forming part of this structure resemble old provision 68F but now include a ‘friendly parent provision’: a willingness by one parent to facilitate a close relationship with the other parent. This provision is problematic, as the requirement that a parent facilitates a relationship between the child and a potentially abusive parent has the potential to override the safety of the child.
The Democrats also object to the fact that children’s views have been relegated to additional considerations. The Law Society of South Australia has noted its opinion:
The Bill is extremely parent-centric and in no way supports the child or young person in negotiations or proceedings.
I thought that we were leaving that culture behind. I thought that we were supposedly strengthening and supporting the rights, views and interests of children, not framing legislation that diminishes them. We understand the intention of these provisions but we consider the structure in 68F the preferable option for truly determining a child’s best interests. The requirement that mediators will have to judge if parents are making a ‘genuine effort’ to mediate is also problematic. This means that their role is no longer that of a traditional mediator who remains impartial and neutral.
I have referred to the issues surrounding funding for services provided for by this legislation. The Democrats also note the concerns around appropriate accreditation of staff providing these services. We hope that this will be an equitable and transparent process focused on providing the best outcomes for families.
We will move an amendment to address this and other concerns. Consideration especially needs to be given to disadvantaged groups. These include people in remote regional areas, people with culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, Indigenous people, people with health and mental health issues, those on low incomes and those who cannot access technology for financial or other reasons. The Democrat amendment proposes to review the impact of this bill on these groups within two years of the commencement of the bill, and I hope other parties will consider that.
The new definition of family violence proposed by this bill, as I have said, requires an objective assessment of whether or not the victim’s fear is reasonable. We believe this undermines the known facts provided by those with experience and understanding of domestic violence. The experience is that often only the victim knows the signs.
The Democrats propose an alternative definition of family violence. It is modelled on the Western Australian domestic violence legislation, which removes the objective assessment and includes intimidating behaviour. We will propose an amendment to retain the current structure in 68F of the act in the new 60CC, in relation to determining the child’s best interests, so as to remove the two-tiered approach to assessment. We will also seek to remove from the bill the presumption of equal shared responsibility and the equal, substantial and significant time considerations, so that cases will continue to be judged on the best interests of the child—that is, on the child’s unique circumstances.
We want to ensure that there is greater consideration of children’s needs in this bill. We have proposed a series of amendments to return the focus to children. The focus needs to return to children and their best interests. The focus should be on parental responsibilities rather than rights. If the Democrat amendments are supported, which we believe will improve this legislation, then we will support this bill as a piece of legislation that hopefully will move forward and improve the family law system.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-03-27,"—The conceptual basis of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 has been drawn from the findings of several inquiries, beginning with the 2003 report Every picture tells a story, from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation. This report recommended amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 which aimed to bring about a cultural shift in how family separation is managed.
The inquiry was the result of concerns articulated by Prime Minister Howard about the high level of ‘unhappiness with the operation of matters relating to the custody of children following marriage breakdown’ and ‘the operation of the Child Support Agency’. In his comments, Mr Howard focused on his concern that too many young boys were growing up without proper male role models. The fact that young girls were left out of these influential remarks to the House of Representatives was significant, as it set the tone of bias that permeated the following reports and inquiries that led to the development of this bill.
Given rapidly changing social circumstances and attitudes to relationships, marriage and separation, the Greens believe that some reform of the family law system would be useful. However, this government seems unwilling and unable to balance the ever-changing concerns and needs of fathers with those of mothers and their children. Every picture tells a story was followed by the release of the exposure draft by the Attorney-General, who described it as the most significant change to the family law system in 30 years. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was then asked to look at the exposure draft bill to find out if it adequately implemented the previous report. This resulted in further refinements to the bill. The third inquiry was by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which took a further 200 submissions and reported its findings on 24 March this year.
Family breakdown is undoubtedly a very difficult and sensitive issue and a highly emotional experience for all those concerned. Despite this, we know that 95 per cent of family law matters are resolved without the need for court orders—in other words, most people can eventually work it out for themselves. This means that it is a very small minority of the most difficult cases that end up with complex court proceedings that result in court orders. Yet it is from this small percentage of intractable cases that the most heat is generated.
While there is no question that genuine instances of injustice have occurred, it would be safe to assume that the family courts are capable of assessing the individual circumstances to find a proper balanced outcome on most occasions. This is borne out by statistics from the Child Support Agency. Where parents agree by themselves, in 90 per cent of cases they agree that the child or children will end up in the sole principal care of one person, and that is usually the mother. The latest statistics from the Attorney-General’s Department on cases with a court order show that only 75 per cent of orders are made in favour of the mother and 20 per cent in favour of the father.
The fundamental premise for these family law changes as promoted by the Howard government is that the courts do not have the balance right because they frequently discriminate against non-resident parents, who are usually fathers. This view—that the courts get it wrong--—matches the message that the highly organised fathers groups have been promoting. They argue that fathers have been getting a rough deal. Some prominent experts do not support this view. Last December, the former Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alistair Nicholson, stated that the government, through this bill, was simply pandering:
... to the strong pressure that’s been put on the Government by various militant fathers’ groups.
The academic Michael Flood from the Australia Institute shed further light on who these fathers groups are and what they believe in the report Fatherhood and fatherlessness. He described these groups as maintaining their momentum by focusing ‘on men as victims of injustice in family law’. He also noted that these groups also work:
... in alliance with conservative Christian organisations to lobby for changes in child custody and child support policies.
The author has recently argued:
The fathers’ rights movement is defined by the claim that fathers are deprived of their ‘rights’ and subjected to systematic discrimination as men and fathers, in a system biased towards women and dominated by feminists.
These descriptions are supported by the submissions to the various inquiries that have influenced the development of this bill. Many of the submissions were form letters or close derivatives from these fathers’ rights groups.
These circumstances reminded me of the RU486 debate, where specific interest groups were also able to muster a great deal of noise in the form of well-organised campaigns and multiple submissions. Yet, just like with RU486, a point made loudly does not mean it necessarily represents the best policy outcome for greater society. I agree with Alistair Nicholson and many others who argue that these very noisy fathers groups have been particularly persuasive in having their message heard by the Howard government. It is a mistake to think that a large volume of submissions necessarily represents genuine widespread community concern. In this instance, it also very important to note that single mothers, due to the obvious and necessary prioritisations, are one of the most time deficient groups within society. They are consequently not necessarily able to muster the spare time required to effectively lobby, write submissions or attend committees.
One of the most concerning aspects of this bill is the move to introduce a formulaic approach for the Family Court based on the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. While this appears to be a step back from earlier drafts that were based on a presumption of equal time to be spent by children with both parents, there remain similar concerns about what is effectively a watering down of judicial discretion. While the government implies there is a softening of the equal time approach, the Greens and others argue that the two presumptions are essentially the same. Even Senator Fielding, while coming to a substantially different conclusion, agrees in his dissenting report that these concepts are essentially the same.
The problem is that any move to introduce such a presumption moves away from the needs and, indeed, the rights of the child to an emphasis on the rights of the parents. This is illustrated by the shift in emphasis from the child’s views or wishes to a list of secondary considerations for the court to use in determining the child’s best interests. The child’s views are now listed below the two primary considerations for determining the child’s best interest—that is, the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both their parents and the need to protect the child from neglect, abuse or violence. The Greens agree with the comments by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that this significantly downgrades the importance of the views of the child. Similarly, the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility or time creates the situation where children are viewed as a commodity belonging to parents. Family Services Australia put it concisely when they said:
The minute you bring in the situation where you are talking about ‘equal’, it is almost like talking about property.
Children are not property, and their views, where attainable, should be paramount to any considerations.
Just like the devaluation of the needs and interests of children, this bill and the various inquiries and reports that influenced it have ignored the changing needs and rights of mothers that find themselves dealing with the difficulty of family separation. Recent evidence shows that single mothers are most vulnerable to suffering from mental health problems. Research recently published in the Medical Journal of Australia showed that sole mothers were more likely than other women to have experienced suicidal thoughts, to have used medication for depression and to suffer from depression or other psychological disorders.
In addition, many single mothers have great difficulty in correctly accessing child support payments. Recent announcements by the Howard government to overhaul the child support system have compounded these concerns and drawn criticism from groups such as the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children, who are concerned that ‘financial outcomes for an estimated 60 per cent of children of separated parents in their primary place of residence will decline under the government’s adoption of the recommendations of the ministerial task force on child support.’
In addition, there has been widespread unease about the ability of the changes advocated in this bill to adequately deal with the issue of violence, specifically domestic violence. It must be recalled that this legislation will in the main only effect the small minority of cases that require the assistance of the courts to resolve disputes. It is equally significant that domestic violence and safety concerns are one of the key reasons that many women and children end up in the family law court. Research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that violence was present in 66 per cent of all marital breakdowns and 33 per cent of this was identified as ‘serious’ violence. A 2003 family law court survey also showed that over 66 per cent of the women and children who make it to the final stage of judgement in the Family Court have issues of serious physical domestic violence. The Greens are additionally concerned that the definition of domestic violence adopted in this bill is inadequate and does not provide adequately for family members at risk of family violence. This will clearly affect many women.
Yet in addition to such daunting evidence weighing against the interests of mums, there is also a troublesome new provision that effectively enforces mediation. The onus will now fall on the sole mother to find exceptions to get out of this dispute resolution process even though the statistics suggest that most of these cases will involve some level of violence. On top of this are the new provisions and substantial fines and costs to be awarded against those found to have provided ‘false allegations’. Yet this is in an area that is notoriously difficult to ascertain as the majority of cases will be his word against hers. As suggested by research published by the Australian Journal of Family Law this year, overseas experience suggests such compulsory attendance will simply add to the cost of the family law system.
The Law Society of New South Wales argued in their submission to the Senate inquiry that for some, especially self-represented litigants, such provisions will simply be a statutory licence to ‘have a go at the ex’. The list of problems with this bill points to an overall bias against women and children, the balance tipping disproportionately towards the rights of fathers. The Greens believe that to succeed any alterations to Australia’s system of family law must work to balance fathers’ concerns with the significant needs of mothers and their children. In addition, concepts such as shared parental responsibility are best applied before problems that lead to separation occur, as the game is nearly always over by the time it gets to court. Where courts are necessary, the Greens believe it is essential to empower the judiciary to find out all they need to know so they can evaluate the circumstances of individual cases and not simply enforce a regime, such as highlighted in this bill, that risks replacing all important judicial discretion and flexibility with an ideologically driven acquiesce to a vocal lobby group.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-03-27,"—I too rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006. That bill sounds innocuous, even positive. What could be better than shared parental responsibility? Women have in fact been calling for men to take on their fair share of the tasks of raising children for a very long time. Some do, to their great credit. Some would like to, but work and other commitments keep them away from the family. Others are neither good fathers nor good parents.
The Family Court has the unenviable task of trying to sort out custody arrangements when parents break up their relationship and live separately and who are unable to reach agreement. As I understand it, that represents a very small proportion of those who separate: just five per cent of cases actually go to the Family Court. These are necessarily the most difficult and most contested cases of family break-up, and the result of their deliberations almost always leaves one, sometimes more, parties deeply aggrieved at the outcome. I think we all understand that. There would not be a person in this place who has not received hundreds if not thousands of emails, mostly from men—sometimes new partners—who describe the trauma, anguish and emotional state they are in as a result of not having access to their children. I do not want to suggest that there is no understanding for those left in this position. But these are almost always families that are in crisis, and, very often, they are dealing with violence, according to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics women’s safety survey in 1996 showed that 23 per cent of women who had ever been married or in de facto relationships had experienced violence. A quarter of intimate partner homicides occur between separated, divorced or former couples. Family breakdown, according to recent New South Wales research, was a precipitating factor in almost 20 per cent of child homicides. We have all read with great alarm the dreadful cases of children becoming the victims of disputes between parents—and paying for it with their lives. So often it is a recently separated couple where this occurs.
Violence and safety worries are the key reasons many women and children end up in the Family Court. Sixty-six per cent of cases that reach the final stage of judgment contain issues of serious physical domestic violence. Children witnessing parental domestic violence are left with scars and behaviour that very often last them a lifetime. In our mental health inquiry we were told that if parents stopped acting violently in front of their children this would have huge preventive benefits to the mental health and resilience of their children. Witnessing parental violence causes a range of behavioural and emotional problems amongst children and is the strongest predictor that young people themselves will later use violence in their own intimate relationships. It is easy to understand that because parents are role models. If a child does not see a role model which includes a respectful relationship then they are more likely as adults to repeat the sort of relationship that they observed as a child. It is a cycle of abuse and failed relationships that repeats itself generation after generation. And there is no equality for the individuals, almost always women, in this cycle.
On Wednesday the Senate will vote on the terms of reference for an inquiry into sexual health and relationships education. This will be because many of us in this place believe it is important that we find out how to break those cycles of violence and that schools might be able to assist. I sometimes visit a small primary school just out of Bendigo which began an anti-bullying program some years ago. The program started when the domestic violence centre in town came to the school and said: ‘We need to stop the cycle of violence and we would like to head it off with children. We want to start by dealing with grade 3s and grade 5s. We want to experiment to see if it is possible to change the relationships which exist in that cycle that goes on for generations and to encourage and facilitate much more respectful and positive relationships for those children.’ The program has been a huge success, though we will not know that finally until those children reach true adulthood, but certainly those children behave very differently as a result of that program. There are programs of that sort in schools right around the country, and relationships are an important aspect of sexual reproductive education because they are so closely connected.
To return to the bill: with almost a quarter of women experiencing family violence at some time, it can be expected that many of them will find themselves at the Family Court in a contested case. This legislation shifts the balance away from what is in the interests of the child to give more equal weight, firstly, to the child having a so-called meaningful relationship with both the child’s parents and, secondly, to protection of the child from physical and psychological harm due to being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. The views of the child, as has already been said in this debate, are given only secondary consideration. What that means is that it is less likely that evidence from a child about not wishing to spend time with one or other parent is not going to be considered and therefore child abuse is less likely to be avoided.
Another very alarming aspect of this bill is the cost penalty that can apply to so-called false allegations of domestic violence. Usually there are no witnesses to violence in the home, other than children who may or may not be able to give evidence to this effect. It will be very easy to intimidate women, to dissuade them from making accusations of domestic violence, particularly if they have very little money. It is a very frightening prospect indeed, and there is almost no doubt in my mind that women will be very shaken by that threat. I want to go to what the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission said about false allegations in their submission to the inquiry:
HREOC is well aware of the concerns of some individuals and community organisations that false allegations of family violence are regularly made. For example, in its submission to a review of legislation regarding protection orders, the Lone Fathers’ Association states that protection orders “are employed as a routine separation procedure” by women to force their husbands out of their homes, without any violence having occurred, “and/or as a vindictive retaliatory act”.
HREOC would caution against accepting this contention uncritically. There is no doubt that Family Court proceedings often are accompanied by allegations of domestic violence and the use of protection orders. However, this may reflect the fact that domestic violence often escalates when couples separate. Australian data demonstrate that women are as likely to experience violence by previous partners as by current partners and that it is the time around and after separation which is most dangerous for women.
As I have indicated, this bill is about parents’, mostly fathers’, rights to equal access to children. But equal access will not solve domestic violence situations, it will not deliver responsible parenting and it is not in the best interests of the children or, indeed, their mothers. In fact, equal shared parenting presumptions are about entitlements. I think this is an attack on single mothers, the vast majority of whom are disadvantaged in any case with the break-up of a marriage or even of a de facto relationship. It is unfair and it is not in the interests of families, children or single mothers.
Back in December last year Women’s Legal Services Australia provided members of parliament with what I think was a very useful assessment of this bill. They said:
Positive quality relationships between children and parents are not dependent on parents having equal time with children. Substantially sharing parenting time is only successful in some limited circumstances—including where parents can communicate well about their children, live close together and respect each others views about parenting issues.
From the many hundreds of messages that I have received I cannot think of a single one where I could say, ‘This man’—in some limited cases this woman—‘does not have a respectful relationship with his former partner and certainly does not reflect their views about parenting issues.’ Women’s Legal Services go on to say:
Families in rural and remote areas have less access to services and support. Women in rural and remote areas have limited access to protection.
I think we are going down a very dangerous course with this legislation. I think it is unwise, as the government has obviously done, to listen to a very vocal minority group of people; in this case, mostly groups associated with the Lone Fathers Association. I do understand their grief and I do understand the trauma of separation, but there are not necessarily answers which satisfy both parties, and children should not to be in the middle of this—being torn between one and the other. As Women’s Legal Services Australia say, it is not always appropriate for children to be transported from one household to another. In my own experience teenagers resent this—some do not, some do, depending on the relationship they already have with their parents—and for many this can be a really traumatic time.
I think that the current law should stand. I think the Family Court does an extremely good job at trying to sort out these problems and to find answers which are the most satisfactory for children. It is true that that usually means, in those five per cent of cases which come to the family courts, that mothers have the principal custody of children. That is usually my experience too, and I am sure there are plenty of submissions that pointed this out to this inquiry. It is also true that mothers are usually the ones who have had the principal responsibility for raising the child or children prior to the separation. This is a very difficult area but, in my view, this bill heads in the wrong direction and the Senate should reject it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-27,"—The Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 is a very important piece of legislation. As we all know, it is immensely controversial. It is a core example of the fact that the most important work that the parliament does is not, by and large, the part that gets most of the media coverage. It is not the finger pointing, the name-calling and the point scoring. It is the consideration of policy issues and the determination and passage of legislation, because that is what directly affects people’s lives. Of course, this type of legislation is one that affects some of the most painful areas of people’s lives and for that reason it will always be contentious, it will always leave people dissatisfied and it will always fall short of the ideal.
I come to this piece of legislation having sat through the day’s worth of public hearings into the legislation as it reached the Senate, but also having followed the progress of it through previous inquiries—from a distance as it were, I suppose, but certainly as an interested observer. As a legislator and a senator who tries to keep across issues of significance and complexity and also from my own previous background as a social worker, I am aware of the difficulties of these issues and aware of the almost impossible task of trying to put in place a legislative framework that will adequately address the competing interests.
We are all aware—I imagine most of us are, anyway—of the biblical parable of King Solomon being asked to decide the fate of a baby who is being claimed by two different women, and coming up with the solution to try and determine who the genuine parent is. That might have worked once and it might have worked in that case but I think, frankly, Solomon would have a lot of difficulty trying to work out a solution for many of the most difficult cases that come before the Family Court.
I should say that, whilst we can always find reasons to criticise specific judgments and specific institutions—and I am as willing to do so as others—we should pause for a moment to consider just how difficult a task that court has, those judges have and the others that work in that area have, including, I might say, the social workers—those that try and work with people beforehand to try and get an outcome and try to get results that can be agreed to by all the people involved, rather than having to get an outside legal determination. That is the best way, where possible, but the simple fact is that at times it does get to a circumstance where that determination has to be made. And in the vast majority of such circumstances where a determination like that has to be made, where these things are in dispute and cannot be resolved by other means, you will not be able to get an outcome that will satisfy both parents, and in many cases you will not get an outcome that will satisfy either parent.
The other aspect that I bring to the legislation is as a parent and as a father—as many of us in this chamber are. And I bring a reminder that, despite all of the advocacy we get about this aspect of family law—the aspect to do with shared parental responsibility, looking at the title of the legislation—it is about responsibility towards the child or the children. It is not about us. It is not about the parents. It is not about the fathers. It is not about the mothers. It is about the children. The simple fact is we all get lobbied about this time and time again, very forcefully, with very genuine stories. The people we very rarely get lobbied by are the children, because they do not have a voice. We will always as parents, I am sure, convince ourselves that what each of us wants in regard to contact with our child is best for that child, but we are not always, when we get in these circumstances, in the best position to judge.
As I am sure all of us here do, I get a lot of emails and other contact from people who are going through the pain of limited contact with their children. I read many of those. I certainly read all of those that come from my own state of Queensland and I read some of the others as well. It is quite clear from many of those that the pain is enormous and genuine. But the simple fact is that it is not possible in many cases for parliaments or courts to come up with a formula that will take that sort of pain away. People expect a lot of politicians, as they should, and politicians hold themselves out as having the magic solutions to lots of things—more than we should. But we do not have the magic solution to these sorts of situations and we should not present ourselves as doing so. And most of us do not, particularly in this area.
This legislation, as it has finally reached the Senate, is the result of a long process. As has already been outlined by most speakers, it is still in a situation which certainly has significant room for improvement. But it recognises that this is not a situation that can produce satisfaction for all parties and particularly not for all parents. The simple, cold and very harsh reality is that it is not about producing satisfaction for the parents; it is about producing the best outcome for the child. All of us need to try and be more realistic and more brutal about that very unpleasant reality—that that is not the ultimate goal; the ultimate goal is the best outcome for the child. It is not always the case that maximum contact with each parent will equal the best outcome for the child. That is a simple fact and there is a vast amount of research in this area that demonstrates that.
There are a couple of aspects of the legislation that I want to touch on in a little bit more detail. The lack of attention being paid to the voice of the children and the ultimate long-term needs of the child is a serious problem in this debate. It is almost inevitable, given the way the process works, that it will be the adults who get all the attention. It will be the political pressures from the adults that focus and shape the way we as politicians deal with the situation, because adults get the vote. Children do not get the vote; children do not have a voice. I am not using this as an argument to say they should, I might say, but it is a reminder that, to some extent, we have to look over the top of the understandable, nonetheless very prevalent, advocacy from adults and look at the children. It is that aspect of the legislation in particular that really concerns me.
One of the problems that were clear from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 is that all of us, to some extent, are making judgment calls about how courts will interpret this legislation into the future. Clearly, we would not be having this debate if most, if not all, of us did not believe there was some scope for improving the law as it currently stands. As I said earlier in my speech, we cannot ever get this legislation to a situation where it will be perfect and deliver satisfied people all round, but we should certainly always strive to continue to improve it as much as possible. What is being done in this legislation in regard to determining the best interests of the child is of concern. It remains to be seen how these sorts of provisions will be interpreted by courts in the future. That is something none of us can be definitive about, but we can make educated guesses about how it is likely to be interpreted.
Personally, I think it is concerning that the way the best interests of the child are determined is being altered in this legislation. It implements a two-tiered approach. In the second of those tiers, just under what are listed as additional considerations, is the issue of children’s views. I recognise that children of the age of two, three or four may not be in a position to give comprehensive, definitive views about what they see and what they want and, of course, that parents can influence children in what can be very stressful situations about what they might say their views are about particular situations. But, on principle, it is most concerning to have children’s views listed as an additional consideration rather than a primary consideration. That is one thing I really want to emphasise.
There are other aspects of the bill I have concerns about. Issues to do with the definition of domestic violence is one. With my background in the area of social work, it is something that is the subject of a lot of assertions as part of the wider debates in this area that I think are quite dangerous. Others in this debate, including my Democrat colleagues, have covered that area, so I will not revisit that or go over that same ground. But I also believe that the broader risk with the legislation—and just how big a problem it will turn out to be depends, firstly, on how many amendments the Senate chooses to make and, secondly, how courts end up determining it down the track—is that it puts the issues of parents’ rights and parents’ demands over and above children’s rights and parental responsibilities. It is something of a mantra, but a mantra that has a lot of accuracy to it, that ‘with rights come responsibilities’. I think there has been too much in the politics surrounding this debate in the community that has focused too much on the parents’ rights and what the parents want and not enough on the parents’ responsibilities, which have to go back to what is best for the child.
Of course, there are overlaps there. I am not suggesting that all of these things are totally discrete and separate. Nonetheless, it is a matter of different emphases. I think we are at risk of making the emphasis wrong in this regard. I have specifically attempted to take a measured approach in relation to the legislation and the language that is used because we are dealing with an issue that is very delicate and sensitive. It is an issue, as I said at the start, that is the subject of an enormous amount of pain in the community and amongst many people. Certainly, as a parent, it is an issue that I can empathise with. I certainly recognise why it causes such distress. Whilst we have to take account of that distress, we cannot allow that to dominate the decisions that we come to.
In the context of trying to ensure that we take as measured an approach to this as possible, there are two more points I wish to make. This legislation deals predominantly with the issue of legal proceedings regarding family breakdown and particularly with what happens with children and other aspects as a result of the separation of an adult partnership. It does not deal with issues of child support, the Child Support Agency and the formulae surrounding that. As we all know, there have been separate inquiries and decisions going on in regard to that. There is legislation coming through on that.
I should say that, whilst I do not agree with all of the detail of what is being proposed in that regard and I think it also warrants further investigation, clearly the formulae and results of child support arrangements as they are currently occurring do create unnecessary injustices that can be improved on. That is something that I think also needs to be examined as promptly as possible. But, on this aspect of the legislation and in this area in particular, we do need to recognise that the ultimate decision has to be focused on the child.
The other point I want to make is in regard to the comments made by Family First in their dissenting report. I heard the speech of the Family First senator earlier. I suppose that, whatever position or amendment anybody puts forward on this legislation, they will preface it by saying that it is in the interests of the child because that is the magical phrase—and so it should be, because it is the most crucial issue. But you do have to look beneath the phrase at what the actual issue is that is being proposed.
I find the assertion put forward by Family First that it is about equal parenting time rather than equal parenting responsibility a very dangerous assertion. It is not just dangerous to put something like that into law. Also, frankly, as a principle, if the way we assess who is being a good parent and who is not is on the basis of how much time each of us spend with our children, I imagine that all of us in this place for starters would be automatically lumped into the bad parenting category. Anybody who is in a situation, voluntary or employment related or otherwise, where they spend a lot of time away from their child should not automatically therefore be seen to be part of a situation that is contributing to a harmful circumstance for their child.
There are more things than time. Time is important—again, all of us here would be more than aware of that as well as the difficulties that can come from the absence of time. But it really does have some very unfortunate overtones of harking back to an old-style approach of just seeing children as property—where, as part of the property breakdown and division, parents who are splitting up look at who gets to stake a claim in the children as well as in the house and everything else. That is a mindset that we must reject categorically. Even the tiniest hint of it is something that I think must be dismissed promptly and categorically.
The other point I want to make concerns a phrase and statistic used in Senator Fielding’s speech. It was about the Family Court being the worst place for Australia’s children. It is certainly not a place that any of us wants to end up. No-one wants to end up in any circumstance where that has to be the way the final decision is made as to how a child’s future is determined with regard to contact with their parents. But it is not the fault of the Family Court that those situations develop. It is the role of the Family Court to try to make those difficult decisions when those situations occur. But, to suggest—as has been done—that, because only 2.5 per cent of residence orders are for joint parenting, therefore in every other circumstance a child has lost a parent, I think is not only misleading but also blatantly false.
To then follow it with the statement that we are in danger of creating a stolen generation is moving into the territory of very inflammatory language. That is the sort of thing that we really need to try to avoid in this debate. I will not move across into the facts, realities and history of the stolen generation and the deliberate government-sanctioned removal of children from their parents solely on the basis of their children’s skin colour. But to try to tie the immensely difficult decisions of the Family Court process about future contact between children and their parents because the parents cannot work it out for themselves with that past disgraceful practice is disgraceful in itself. It is language that we should not be bringing into this debate because it is a completely inaccurate representation of the situation that happens now and it is also a very offensive linkage to one of the more appalling practices in our nation’s history. It belittles and diminishes the reality of that appalling practice that occurred in the past.
Having said that, I look forward to the committee stage of the debate. I hope it can be conducted in a way that does try to maintain a measured approach to the difficult issues. In the intervening period, before we get to the committee stage, I certainly urge all senators and those in the community who are interested in this debate to read the Senate committee report that was tabled today. It is comprehensive and a genuine attempt by all senators, I think, to engage with this difficult issue. There are many recommendations in there to further improve this legislation. I hope people take them seriously and approach the legislation from that perspective.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-27,"—Firstly, I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on this very important subject. The Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 represents the most significant reform of the family law system in 30 years. It will change the way post-separation disputes are resolved, so that better outcomes are achieved for Australian children. The amendments underpin the government’s commitment of nearly $400 million over four years to provide increased services to help couples resolve conflicts and agree about parenting arrangements.
I note that this bill has been the culmination of a great deal of work—in fact, a number of years work—by a large number of people. I would like to place on record on behalf of the government the appreciation of the work done by colleagues from both sides of politics who have been involved in the development of this legislation. The government has consulted extensively throughout the development of the family law reforms both within the legal profession and the larger community. The bill is the result of listening and responding to the views of a wide range of people on how the family law system can deliver better outcomes for Australian families. Recently we had the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee review this bill. I note that the report was handed down last Friday, 24 March 2006. As I recall, some 16 recommendations were made, and the government is of course considering those recommendations.
This bill reflects the government’s desire to change the culture around family breakdown and to ensure that as many children as possible grow up in a safe environment with the love and support of both their parents. It is clear from this debate that everyone agrees that the best interests of the child in each individual case should continue to be the paramount consideration in making parenting orders. This bill provides that.
The bill also recognises the benefit to most children of knowing both of their parents and having both of their parents involved in their upbringing. The bill ensures that children have a right to a meaningful relationship with both parents and that parents will generally continue to share responsibility for their children after they separate. This responsibility will be shared in an equal sense. The bill also encourages parents to sit down together to work out what is best for their children, rather than fighting it out in the courts. This is more likely to create an environment where both parents are able to maintain a meaningful relationship with their children. The bill also reinforces the primary importance of ensuring that children live in an environment where they can be safe from violence or abuse. A number of provisions in the bill ensure improved case management and protection for cases involving allegations of family violence and abuse. These are very significant changes.
In addition, on 26 February this year the Attorney-General announced the launch of the government’s Family Law Violence Strategy. The strategy will support the changes to the law by focusing on ensuring that allegations of family violence and child abuse raised in family law proceedings are handled quickly, fairly and properly. In particular, the strategy will provide a better understanding of how these important cases are managed. The government also wants to improve coordination with the states and territories, which are responsible for investigation of family violence and child protection. The government will seek to ensure that information on investigations by state and territory agencies is available to allow courts to make better decisions and to provide better outcomes for our children. The Family Law Violence Strategy is directed at improving process, not about reviewing legislative definitions. It complements this legislation and other family law reforms being undertaken by the government.
The government’s reforms to child support, announced on 28 February this year, are the other important elements of the government’s reforms to the family law system. Those changes will progressively implement the report of the ministerial task force on child support entitled The best interests of children and will support shared parenting by recognising the contributions both parents make to the care of their child. We have a holistic approach to the reforms based upon the new family relationship centres and other services, these reforms to the Family Law Act and the major changes to child support. This bill delivers a fairer, faster system for the benefit of Australian families.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ellison) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (SHARED PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-03-27,"—The first two bills that we are debating here this evening, the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Bill 2005 are designed to protect accommodation bonds held by residential aged care providers in case of a provider becoming insolvent. The third bill in this suite, the Aged Care Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005, is designed to ensure that residents of flexible care services are afforded the same protections as residents in residential aged care services. It puts in place a set of prudential standards and is designed to ensure that interest is repaid to the estate of a resident for a period between the death of a resident and the repayment of the bond. It is also designed to change the time frame of repayment of a bond to the estate of a deceased resident. Finally, it is designed to reduce the time frame in which a bond must be refunded in the event of a resident leaving a facility or if a resident dies.
The essential purpose that these three bills provide is to strengthen the prudential requirements and enhance the protections available to residents in aged care who have paid accommodation bonds. These bonds are paid, as many of us know, upon entry by non-concessional residents of low-care residential aged care facilities, by residents in high-care facilities which have extra service status and by some residents in multipurpose services. When residents leave an aged care facility, they, their family or the estate may be eligible for a refund of part of the accommodation bond that has been paid. Under current arrangements, if a residential care facility provider became bankrupt or insolvent, the resident is not guaranteed that they will get their relevant accommodation bond amount refunded. These bills are designed to ensure that residents will in all cases be refunded the amount of accommodation bond that they are owed.
The introduction of these arrangements was recommended by Professor Hogan in his 2004 review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care. There is general industry acceptance of the proposals as an appropriate way to protect residents’ funds. Professor Warren Hogan recommended that measures be introduced to protect the increasing pool of accommodation bonds that exist. Currently, approximately $4.3 billion is held by residential aged care providers as bonds, with an average bond being $127,600. Unfortunately—and I am very glad the minister is here, because he might be able to answer this in his contribution to the debate—we are still waiting for the government’s long-term response to the Hogan review. The summary report of the review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care was received by the government in March 2004. It has now taken this government longer to respond to the report than it took Professor Hogan to undertake the research and write the report for his original work.
—That is outrageous!
—That is right, Senator, it is outrageous. This legislation was referred to a legislation inquiry. As I said earlier, the sector is, by and large, quite comfortable with the proposal to protect bonds but was unsure of the potential liability that the industry may carry. We had a one-day hearing, and the question of potential liability was canvassed. The department reported that they had commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to analyse the financial risk profile of the residential aged care industry. Based on that analysis, the department indicated—and I paraphrase from the report—that the order of 0.2 per cent of the value of the industry’s accommodation bonds holding would be the potential liability. They also estimated on the very conservative assumptions that the size of the levy on the industry would only exceed 0.8 per cent of bond holdings once every 20 years. That provided an indication—certainly not a comfort, but an indication—to the sector of what they were potentially facing.
Another thing happened during the inquiry which I thought was a little concerning. Both the chair of the inquiry, Senator Humphries, and I were questioning the department on the question of who carries the liability if a provider becomes insolvent. We were somewhat concerned at the response from the witness from the department, who said on a number of occasions—and, again, I paraphrase—that any newcomer into the industry from the period of a point of insolvency to the day that the levy is struck would not have to pay the levy. She made it very clear that for any entity which changed hands in that period the purchaser would not have to pay the levy. I am not a lawyer; Senator Humphries is. Both of us thought that this was something that was anomalous. This concerns me mainly because we then got some supplementary information from the Department of Health and Ageing which, in my view, directly contradicted that advice. It is on the basis of that supplementary information from the department that I can undertake that Labor will support this legislation. If we had a circumstance in which a major provider were to go bankrupt and was not to able pay the accommodation bonds owed to people who are in the facilities, there would be a very unusual and very different driver in the aged care sector in Australia. You can imagine that people would be selling entities hand over fist simply to get out of the levy having to be paid. With that caveat and on the basis of the evidence that was subsequently provided to our committee that any entity which changes hands between the point of the insolvency—that is, 10 days prior to the insolvency—to the date the levy is struck, any entity which stays in the industry irrespective of changing hands will be liable to carry that levy. It is on that basis that I support this legislation. I thank witnesses who provided us with submissions in the short time frame. I thank those who were able to come to give evidence to the committee and the secretariat for the report. In particular, I thank Professor Hogan for his comments, given that his report was the genesis of this legislation.
In the 2005 budget, $1.3 million was allocated as consultation on the Hogan recommendations. It concerns me that here we are at nearly the end of March and we have still to see what has happened to that money and what the consultations have been. When are we going to see the final report on the Hogan recommendations that this government has been promising the industry for well on a year. When it comes to yet other recommendations made to the federal government, we are still waiting for the government’s response to the Senate inquiry report that came down 10 months ago called Quality and equity in aged care. I remind the minister that this was a unanimous report. This report was agreed to by Liberal Party senators. I think it is a fairly significant report in the committee’s history. It is 10 months now since that report has come down. We have Professor Hogan’s report. We also have the Senate inquiry report.
In the current climate, there are a number of pertinent recommendations to do with aged care in the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report. There are 51 in all but I just want to go to four of them. Recommendation 12 in the report identifies that each residential aged care facility needs to have one annual random or targeted spot check. Recommendation 16 calls for a review of the complaints resolution scheme so that it will be more responsive to residents’ needs. Recommendation 17 calls for an examination of the feasibility of whistleblower legislation so that those who report atrocities such as those that we have heard of in recent weeks are protected. Recommendation 18 calls for an investigation into the extent of intimidation of and retribution towards residents and their families. Two of those recommendations are also recommendations of the report of the ministerial aged care advisory committee, which met last week.
The Senate committee’s recommendations, Minister, have been sitting on your desk for 10 months and we are still waiting to see what the government is going to do. It has taken the events of the last few weeks to get the government to say it is going to do something about spot checks and a review of the complaints resolution scheme, but unfortunately the government has not been prepared to say what it is going to do about the 49 other recommendations that the committee made.
Further, I am concerned that the Minister for Ageing still has not clarified if there in fact has been an increase in sexual abuse or elder abuse more generally of residents in aged care facilities. In my view, it is time for an independent, arms-length inquiry that can ascertain the nature and prevalence of abuse that is occurring in residential aged care facilities. Until the community understands the scope of what we are dealing with, our ability to find an appropriate response will be limited. The only way to do that is to establish a short, efficient, tightly targeted inquiry. It would only take a matter of months, I think, but it is an inquiry that is absolutely required. In fact I asked the minister that question on 2 March this year: whether there were any other aged care facilities in Australia that had been or were being investigated for sexual abuse allegations. Unfortunately the minister did not answer the question. He did not take the opportunity to make it clear what the answer to that question was.
As I said, two of the four recommendations of the advisory committee were in fact recommendations from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry. I welcome the general support from employees and employers for the undertaking of police checks prior to employment. I also welcome the indication that employees will undertake training in relation to knowledge and awareness of abuse of the elderly and how to deal with complaints. However, I thought that the minister should have been forthcoming with more of an action plan about how that was going to occur.
The minister also missed the opportunity, in my view, to make any recommendations about staffing levels in aged care facilities. During our inquiry into aged care last year, I was concerned by the number of witnesses who came to the inquiry who talked about being on duty by themselves overnight. That is a very unfortunate circumstance, not only for the residents at those facilities but for the aged care workers themselves. They have no protection against false accusations—and, if unfortunately that person is not the right sort of person we should have in aged care, we are putting those residents at extreme risk.
The only response to date has been for the minister to call together an existing aged care committee, a committee which contains people with considerable expertise in aged care—no-one can deny that; they are all qualified and very eminent people—but which does not include advocates of residents in aged care. People who are experiencing this, people who are dealing with residents who have been through untoward, unpleasant, unsatisfying events, especially with the complaints resolution scheme, should have had representatives at that meeting. The other group of people that should have been there are those people with experience and expertise in elder abuse. There are a number of very eminent Australians, especially in the research sector, who I think could have provided some—

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-03-27,"—I want to speak tonight about the plight of a number of lorry owner-drivers and employees involved with the Tooheys brewery contract in Sydney. In February this year Tooheys advised its prime contractor, Tolls, that after July this year they would no longer be carting the grog for the brewery and that Linfox would be. About 60 lorry owner-drivers are affected by this. In fact there are still a handful of the men who are carting Sydney’s beer around who were employees of Tooheys back in the early sixties when Alltrans took over the contract and indeed forced those men to buy their trucks to keep their work.
No account has been taken of the 40-odd years of loyal service of these men—and effectively it is almost all men. The only changes of contracts in that period have been from Tooheys to Alltrans to Tolls. But the men have been advised that, as of July this year, they will be finished. There is a lot of goodwill involved with the men who will be affected by this change if it does proceed in July this year. A number of the men—some of whom are ex-footballers from Sydney—have put up not only their own homes but their parents’ homes for mortgage to pay the goodwill for the entry into the contract of carriage to cart Tooheys product.
This matter is before Deputy President Peter Sams tomorrow afternoon in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, and the claim that the lorry owner-drivers have placed against Tooheys, Tolls and Linfox is, I understand, a figure of up to $21 million. This may appear a strange procedure to take. Not only some colleagues on my side, but I am sure also those on the other side, might not be familiar with the fact that for nearly four decades these independent contractors in New South Wales have been able to be represented by a trade union before the Industrial Relations Commission in that state. That union, of course, is one that I led for some years: the Transport Workers Union. That will not be the case if the government’s independent contractors legislation is introduced and is carried by the House of Representatives and the Senate. I want to remind you, Mr Deputy President, that independent contractors occupy about 12 per cent of the transport task carried out in the transport industry in this country.
So if the independent contractors legislation becomes law it would remove the protections currently available to owner-drivers in New South Wales by removing their access to industrial jurisdictions to resolve disputes, by removing their right to collectively negotiate contracts and be represented by a union in these negotiations and by removing access to the New South Wales contract of carriage tribunal, which protects their investments in goodwill. The proposed impacts of these changes would also mean that they would have no access to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, that there would be no contract determinations to set minimum rates and conditions, that there would be a restricted choice of representation in negotiations with principal contractors, that there would be no contract of carriage tribunal to hear claims of goodwill, that there would be no ability to review unfair contracts and that there would be no ability to reinstate unfairly terminated contracts.
In relation to unfair contracts and the contract of carriage tribunal, I was quite active in making representations to the then Liberal-National Party government in New South Wales, headed firstly by Nick Greiner and then by John Fahey. The New South Wales coalition government allowed for the private member’s bill moved by Peter Nagle, a Labor member for Auburn, to go through the parliament—both the legislative assembly and the council—to set up this contract of carriage tribunal, which allowed for inexpensive means by which lorry owner-drivers could go and argue a case in relation to their goodwill. Of course, the TWU was and is intimately involved in this procedure.
If the independent contractors legislation is carried in its current form, the only avenue that the men and women who are involved in carting products and owning their own vehicles will be costly civil remedy. At the moment the lorry owner-drivers who are affected by the decision of Tooheys to change their contract from Tolls to Linfox will be, as I said, in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales tomorrow afternoon. They hope to do more than secure their investments and their livelihoods; they wish to keep, of course, their jobs with the incoming contractor. This is not unusual in the road transport industry, where men often change the logo on the side of their truck and, indeed, get told what sort of truck they need when a new successful contractor comes in. Many will have seen over the last few months the agitation by lorry owner-drivers, particularly in Sydney in relation to the intention of the government to proceed with this legislation to deprive them of union representation. This is union representation that they have had for nearly four decades. Not only did aspects of that have the support of Nick Greiner and John Fahey, but it went right back to Sir Robert Askin, when these legislative remedies were being sought to look after and represent lorry owner-drivers.
I am concerned that the procedures outlined by the government in the independent contractors legislation to deprive these men of union representation will lead to costly civil remedies that a number of men would not have access to. Already there is a significant concern amongst them that they will lose not only their own homes but their parents’ homes as they had put them up as collateral to pay for goodwill payments. If that is the case and if they do stay in the industry, where there is no regulation of rates or conditions, then the bottom line will be safety. That has been proven time and time again. When men are put under pressure to make delivery times and to cart ridiculous distances with the allocation they have got, they will speed, they will overload and they will take drugs to keep themselves awake. In the end that has become a murderous recipe so many times over the last 30 or 40 years that we have had mechanised lorries on the road. I am concerned that these men will be left out to dry and that it will inevitably lead to some terrible breakdowns in their families because of the pressure that will be put on those families. They will not have any means whatsoever to pay for the goodwill payments and for the upkeep of the vehicles.
The matter needs to be dealt with in an inexpensive and open forum, as is available under the New South Wales jurisdiction. If the government’s independent contractors legislation does become law, then that will deprive these people of an opportunity and a mechanism that they have had for nearly four decades. If that is done, then it will only behove the government to see whatever the consequences are for that—whether it is in terms of their families, their finances or terrible tragedies. I bring this to the attention of the Senate tonight because these men only have a number of months left before Linfox will take over. I understand Linfox has made it clear that these men will not be offered employment. All they will have is their vehicles. They will have no work, and a number of them have worked in this contract for nearly four decades.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tooheys</title>,Adjournment,23,1
