Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. This bill seeks to introduce a new tax-free, twice-yearly income support bonus for recipients of certain income support payments. The bill would amend the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to create a new income support payment. The bill comes out of a package which the Prime Minister announced with much fanfare called Spreading the Benefits of the Boom. The boom in question obviously is the mining boom. It was intended that the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom would be paid for by the MRRT, of which there has been a little discussion of late. 


The Prime Minister's press release of 8 May last year said:


The Benefits of the Boom package will be funded by re-directing Minerals Resource Rent Tax revenue intended for the company tax cut.


We know what happened. It turned out to be something that we have become quite accustomed to, and that is another policy failure. 


The Treasurer, Mr Swan, told us that the bill would raise $2 billion over the 2012-13 financial year. We now know that in its first six months the MRRT raised $126 million. It took a lot of effort and a lot of time to actually find out what the MRRT raised. Until very recently we have had an absolutely farcical situation where the government said that the Australian Taxation Office telling the Treasurer how much money the MRRT was raising would be a breach of the law because it would disclose to the Treasurer the identity or details of an individual taxpayer, being a mining company in this case. We were further told that, if the ATO did give that information to the Treasurer who then released publicly how much money the MRRT raised, he would be breaking the law. That was always completely erroneous because Australian tax law specifically provides for the ATO to have the capacity to give the Treasurer tax information where that is necessary for the Treasurer to discharge his duties. The tax law further provides that the Treasurer can release details of revenue to the public in a circumstance under which it might identify a particular taxpayer where the public interest benefit outweighs privacy considerations. The law is very clear on both those points so it came as no surprise to this side of the chamber when the government finally relented and released the revenue details for the MRRT.


We know why the government were hiding behind the fig leaf of some supposed advice that they could not release the information without breaking the law. It was because of the acute embarrassment that they would experience admitting that this tax, which was intended to raise billions and billions of dollars, had in fact raised little more than $100 million. It was one of the most farcical situations I have ever seen. 


I cast my mind back to my days working for a former Treasurer—the last Treasurer to deliver a budget surplus in Australia. I could not imagine him saying to the Australian Taxation Office: 'Don't tell me how much money each and every tax has earned. No, don't tell me. I know you are about to tell me, Mr Tax Commissioner, but please do not tell me. Whatever you do, please do not tell me how much money this tax has raised.' Can you imagine Mr Costello doing that? I do not think so. He would want to know exactly how much money each and every tax raised. It is one of the most farcical things I have ever seen in this place.


Coming a close second was a doorstop that Mr Swan did in Queensland last week just after he returned from his latest international foray. Mr Swan enjoys spending as much time away from Australia as he possibly can these days, for understandable reasons. Mr Deputy President Parry, I would like to read to you what Mr Swan said in relation to the MRRT. He said:


… it just so happens that it's politically inconvenient that in the second half of last year commodity prices crashed and that had a dramatic impact on revenues and that occurred more generally. But these are the facts of life that responsible economic managers take into account.


I just want to read that again. He said:


… it just so happens that it's politically inconvenient … commodity prices crashed … impact on revenues …


Politically inconvenient is the criteria that Mr Swan applies to this tax and to his determination about the policy efficacy of his MRRT. He views it through the prism of politics. He does not say, 'The failure of the MRRT to raise revenue is a failure of forecasting.' He does not say, 'The failure of the MRRT to raise much revenue is a failure of me, the Treasurer, in designing the MRRT.' He does not say that the MRRT's failure to raise significant revenue reflects on the competence of the government of the day. He does not say that the MRRT's failure to raise revenue makes a complete farce of the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom policy package, of which this legislation is a part. He does not say that the failure of the MRRT to raise significant revenue means that the government has spent money, in many cases money that it does not have, in delivering parts of the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package. He did not say any of those things. He did not make any of those observations, which would have been quite appropriate to make. The only observation he makes is that it is politically inconvenient. It is quite extraordinary that that is the Treasurer's summation of the MRRT policy failure.


This legislation was framed against the backdrop of trying to curry favour through putting particular amounts of money in particular voters' pockets. It was purely driven for electoral politics. It was, I am sure, also driven by a concern that Australians were starting to feel the impacts of the carbon tax on their cost of living. That is the genesis of this particular piece of legislation. It is pure, naked, electoral politics and nothing else. But there is one positive about this piece of legislation that is before us. It does give us the opportunity to reflect on the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package. It does give us the opportunity to reflect on the minerals resource rent tax and the revenue that it has not raised.


It was curious to note that some on the other side of this chamber spoke about the need to close loopholes in the MRRT. There are not loopholes in the MRRT. The things that are referred to as loopholes in the MRRT are in fact specific design features of the MRRT. They are features designed by Ms Gillard and by Mr Swan. You cannot blame the Australian Treasury or the Australian tax office for this particular piece of work because officials with relevant expertise were excluded from the negotiations. This was done directly between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and a number of mining companies. You cannot blame the mining companies as, I guess, they saw a pair of suckers come along and thought, 'Well, what's in the best interests of our shareholders?' You cannot blame them.


The people who are meant to be looking out for the public interest are the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They failed comprehensively to do so. For that reason, and for those I have outlined, the opposition will not be supporting this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  On the surface of things you would think that the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012 is great because it puts a bit more money in the pockets of those on Newstart, but when you look at it—and it is supposed to be about sharing the benefits of the boom—you see that they only get an extra $4 a week. This is a cohort of people, nearly 600,000 Australians, who are living more than $130 a week below the poverty line. You can understand why they are not dancing in the streets with getting an extra four bucks a week. In Perth that will not buy you a cup of coffee.


If the government were serious about helping those who are struggling to survive—and it is a struggle to survive when you are on Newstart—they would be doing something more than the $4 a week. This is a stunt to make it look as if the government care about the most vulnerable in the community. It is not genuine support for those that are struggling on income support. The government has transferred single parents and their families onto Newstart when their child turns eight. Is the child supposed to be cheaper when it turns eight? Is it suddenly easier to look after your family? They have dumped over 100,000 single parents and their families onto Newstart, lowering their income by up to $60 to $120 a week. The $4 is a drop in the ocean compared to the slug they have just taken. Of course, the Greens will be supporting this bill because to deny people living in poverty even a small boost would be wrong.


We are very disappointed that the government thinks this is the solution to those hundreds of thousands of Australians who are struggling to survive below the poverty line. The government seems content with this dog-eat-dog approach to the most vulnerable members of our community—those who are continuing to fall through the cracks—because $4 a week will not stop that fall. It does not take them out of poverty; it does not help put food on the table. Since the government announced this, they have had another indexation of Newstart that is not indexed in the same way as aged pensions and other pensions and does not keep up with the true cost of living. In fact, six months after I lived on Newstart for a week I compared the basket of goods and they had gone up by $7. Indexation did not go up by that much for those people living on Newstart. The $4 they are getting a week now does not keep up with that increase in the cost of living. 


This is not the action of a government that cares for its community or cares for the most vulnerable in that community. This is an extra $210 a year that will be paid in twice-yearly instalments. Those living on youth allowance and trying to study are trying to live at $170 below the poverty line, because they receive $42 less than those trying to survive on Newstart. This shows how out of touch they are if they think this is going to go anywhere near addressing the huge financial difficulties of those living on Newstart. Only the Greens are actually prepared to help look after the most vulnerable members of our community. We know that Newstart needs to be increased and that is why I have introduced a bill to increase Newstart by $50 a week. Although that does not fully address the gap between Newstart and the poverty line, it does at least give a meaningful additional payment to those struggling to survive. I will be introducing another bill to address the government's cuts to single parents that will provide a supplement to all of those single parents trying to survive on Newstart, because, of course, the Howard government's welfare-to-work changes, brought in in 2006, moved single parents—other than those who were grandfathered—onto Newstart, and it is those parents who are doing it even harder than those trying to survive on parenting payment single.


The bill I will be introducing will provide a supplement of $40 to all single parents, which will help those who are already struggling to survive on Newstart as well as that new grandfathered group that has been moved onto Newstart. It will also address the issues around the taper rate for single parents. The government says, 'We dumped over 100,000 single parents onto Newstart to help them, to encourage them, to find work.' We know that is a fallacy. We know from the mothers who have told us how they are struggling. We know it is even harder for them on Newstart as they struggle to keep ahead. Those who are already working are losing even more money than those who have not yet managed to find part-time work. We also know that cohort of people are the people who are on income support who are working the most—up to 50 per cent of those single parents who are on parenting payment single are already working—and yet NATSEM was reported in the media on Saturday as finding that single parents keep less per hour because the taper rates on Newstart if they are moving from part-time to full-time work. In other words, they are worse off if they are on Newstart and they are trying to work full time. 


We know that up to 30 per cent of those who are using Foodbank services and other emergency relief services are people on income support and are single parents. You can bet your bottom dollar that those are the single parents who have already been moved onto Newstart and just cannot make ends meet when they are trying to raise a family and find work on the measly amount that Newstart pays. Since single parents have been moved onto Newstart, I have heard account after account of the ways people are struggling to survive on Newstart. Let me read some examples from mothers who are struggling to survive and raise their family on Newstart. This is one mother's story:


My heart is for my children. Do they not have a right to be parented by me? Do they stop needing me when they turn eight? There is no-one else to care for them when they're sad, sick or frightened. How can I be in two places at once? If I am at work I am worrying about my children, not focussed on work. At home I worry about finding the money needed to provide for my family. I am in a no-win situation.


Here is another one: 


Dear federal government, 


I am a single parent. My son has turned 12 last September. I fulfilled the commitment of studying, working since 2008 and I have continued to be eligible for parenting payment single. Since the change of legislation on 1 January 2013 I have been plunged into despair because of the demands on me—homemaker, financier, cook, cleaner, home maintenance repairs and car costs. The pressures of looking for full-time work are impossible for me. It is negatively affecting my ability to parent my son. Trying to manage everything with less money is a Mount Everest of burden on my shoulders and my son's wellbeing is bad. He is feeling my pressure. You must change the legislation back and give more, proper support to single parents and mothers and fathers with children of all ages.


Another mother says: 


I am unable to plan! I will no longer be able to register my car!! Buy new tyres!! Replace light bulbs!! Buy new shoes!! Purchase head lice treatment! House and contents insurance, pay debts, let my daughter go to birthday parties as I can no longer buy presents. Unable to sleep!! I DO WORK in part-time employment. I DO study a full-time course. I volunteer at my neighbourhood house community school.


I have received hundreds and hundreds of emails and letters from parents expressing similar concerns. 


I have an example of a parent who was sick and could not make her interview at Centrelink. Her payments were cut because she could not make the interview. Her Centrepay payments were not met, therefore her rent was not paid. She has been made homeless. That is how Australia cares for its most vulnerable members of our community—by plunging them into poverty, making them unable to support their children and unable to pay their rent and making them homeless. That is not the sign of a caring community. 


We know that those on income support are living below the poverty line. We know they make up a large number of the people that have to access emergency relief services. We know that their children are living in poverty. We know the lifelong effects that poverty has on those children's chances. We know from Anglicare’s When there's not enough to eat report that children are going to school hungry or being withdrawn or not sent to school because parents cannot provide lunch. When children do go to school hungry, it is not a good situation to be learning in. We know that, if you cannot learn and you do not learn and do not get a good education, that lowers your job prospects into the future. 


It is not as if we do not know what impact poverty has on children’s lives and their lifelong chances. Yet this government thinks that $4 a week will fix that. This is a joke. It is a cruel joke on the most vulnerable members of our community. This is not sharing the benefits of the boom. If we were sharing the benefits of the boom, we would be making sure that we were supporting the most vulnerable Australians and caring for the most vulnerable Australians, because that investment not only helps now; it helps those families' long-term prospects and futures. An investment now is an investment for the future. An investment through a proper mining tax would properly share the benefits of the boom. If we were not more interested in keeping the big miners happy and keeping money in their pockets than we are in the most vulnerable members of our communities and the children that this government says it cares about, we would be investing a lot more than $4 a week in these families. These families are struggling to survive on Newstart, which is more than $130 below the poverty line. 


Single parents who have been just managing to survive have been plunged into circumstances where they cannot make ends meet. They cannot make ends meet on Newstart. And $4 a week is nothing but show from this government: 'Look—we're sharing the benefits of the boom. We are putting money into parents' pockets.' Well, they are not. They put $4 in and took between $60 and $120 a week out. How is that the sign of a caring government? How is that sharing the benefits of the boom? It is not. Making children homeless does not share the benefits of the boom. 


Anglicare’s report found that 45,000 households using their services were unable to feed their families properly. Three-quarters of the adults participating in the study said that they had run out of food in the last three months and could not afford to buy more. In other words, they were going hungry. Seven out of 10 said they had cut the size of meals and six in 10 are regularly skipping meals altogether. These adults and their children are going hungry. Children who are hungry are often reported to be grumpy, upset, embarrassed or withdrawn. Often they have behavioural problems, struggle to pay attention at school and are isolated from their friends. Parents in the Anglicare survey described keeping their kids home because there was nothing to put in their lunch boxes or not letting them have friends come over after school because there was nothing to eat and share. 


The Senate inquiry into the adequacy of Newstart agreed:


On the weight of evidence, the committee questions whether Newstart Allowance provides recipients a standard of living that is acceptable in the Australian context for anything but the shortest period of time. 


We know that 62 per cent of those on Newstart have been on it for longer than 12 months. That is not a short period of time. How is $4 a week going to help these people? How is $4 a week going to help them pay the bills and manage to make ends meet? How is it going to help them pay the ever-increasing cost of rent? It is not. 


Many, many people have been calling for an increase in Newstart—the Henry tax review, welfare groups like ACOSS, UnitingCare, the Salvation Army, economists and the Business Council of Australia. They are calling for at least a $50 a week increase in Newstart because Newstart is too low to live on. ACOSS reports that 25 per cent of single parents and their families live below the poverty line, and of course that data was from before single parents were transferred onto Newstart. There are almost 600,000 children living below the poverty line. 


If you are struggling to survive on over $130 below the poverty line, what do you think $4 is going to do for you? It is not going to be able to raise you out of poverty. It is not going to pay for school books, for the spiralling cost of food, for car maintenance and for the spiralling cost of utility bills. It is not going to help you study. If you are a single parent who has not started studying you might as well forget studying, because you are not going to get the education supplement either. You do not make the benefits out of transferring from part-time work to full-time work because of the government's transferring you to Newstart and the effect of the tapering rate on the payments that you can take home. You are in trouble every way you look.


And what is the government's response? Four dollars a week, because they would rather care for keeping big miners happy than those more than 100,000 single parents that have had money taken out of their pockets and those on Newstart, youth allowance and Austudy who are all struggling below the poverty line. On top of not being able to survive, they are also struggling with inadequate job services. Job service employment agencies are not meeting the needs of the long-term unemployed. They are not able to help people find work. Not one person on Newstart that I have spoken to does not want to find work. They face multiple barriers to employment, not the least of which is struggling to survive below the poverty line.


It is time that we paid attention to supporting the most vulnerable in our community. We will be supporting this bill, because of course every cent helps; but they need $50 a week at least, not a measly $4 a week. Ultimately this is about the sort of society that we want to live in. We want to live in a caring society, a society that cares for people, not in a dog-eat-dog community, which is what the government and the coalition obviously want to see. The coalition are not even supporting a measly $4-a-week increase. This is about people who have fallen on hard times. How we treat people is a sign of how caring our society is—how we treat single parents who are struggling to balance work and looking after their kids, the kids that are our future. Do we want to become a more caring society where we use some of the wealth of this country to look after those that are doing it tough, or are we going to attack them and keep them living below the poverty line, unable to support their children, unable to make ends meet and continuing that cycle of poverty? If we significantly support the most disadvantaged, it helps them and our community.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:32):  I rise today to make comment on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. As my colleague Senator Siewert has just said, it provides for a totally inadequate supplementary payment for recipients of Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment, Austudy and Abstudy. A supplement of $210 a year, paid in two instalments of $105 in March and September, is completely and utterly inadequate and unacceptable. As my colleague has just said, $4 a week is a complete affront to the idea of equality of opportunity in Australia. Oscar Wilde once said:


… to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting.  It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.


That is precisely what the coalition are doing by saying they will not support it at all and what the government is doing by saying that $4 a week is enough.


I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for the huge amount of work that she has done in recent years to try and bring the absolute inequality that is going on in Australia to the public eye. She took on the Newstart allowance and, through trying to live on that allowance herself, was able to highlight all of the issues associated with trying to provide for transport, trying to clothe and feed a household and trying to pay the disproportionate amount of money that goes to paying rents in a society where the cost of renting is now so high and so extreme—particularly in communities affected, as we have seen in Senator Siewert's state of Western Australia but also elsewhere in the country, by the huge boom in the mining industry—that it is out of the reach of many people. That is why the poorest are becoming homeless.


We really need to ask this question: what sort of society do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a society which has a growing gap between the rich and the poor—which of itself then ends up with a society with lowered life expectancy, poorer health outcomes and less educational opportunity for some because a few want to maintain the wealth that they have to the exclusion of others? I found it particularly obscene when I heard last week that Marius Kloppers had left BHP, taking $75 million on top of his wage with him as he left the company—$75 million. This is a company, BHP, which only paid $77 million in the mining tax to the Australian people for the Australian people's ore that BHP was making its huge profits with. The fact that BHP could write off its poor judgement in terms of its African operations in Mozambique, for example, and use that not to pay an appropriate tax in Australia just shows you that we have both a government and a coalition who are bending over backwards to facilitate the mining industry to the detriment of those in Australia who are struggling—and there are many of them. I draw attention to the single parents. Taking away that support from single parents because there was a hole in the budget because the mining tax was not paying and there was a refusal to fix it, letting Marius Kloppers walk away with $75 million whilst taking the money out of the pockets of single parents, is surely an affront to what a decent country would look like and to making sure you address this issue of equality of opportunity.


Over the weekend there had been much discussion about the implementation of the Gonski review and trying to get a fair amount of funding into the schools which are the most disadvantaged. Once again, the Greens have said: 'Yes, we will pass Gonski. We want this new funding formula which is fairer to go through, but we would like to see priority given to the funds going first to the most disadvantaged public schools.' If we were a society that was actually genuine about providing equality of opportunity to all children, regardless of the socioeconomic background from which they come and regardless of where they live, then we would be supporting such an amendment. But, instead of that, we have got the Treasurer, Mr Swan, who has said that making the country a fairer place is a priority for him but we have to create the wealth to sustain these programs—and of course he was referring to all the support payments. Well, he is making the country a less fair place by not creating the wealth that there is the opportunity to create at the moment through the mining tax, by not choosing to go after that, and instead trying to take money away from single parents and coming in here with a bill which gives a mere $4 extra a week—in a restaurant, a cup of coffee—for people who are struggling to pay the rent, struggling to put a meal on the table and struggling to get their children back to school.


All this is in the context of people talking about trying to get people who are currently unemployed and on Newstart allowance, or single parents, back into the workforce. This is condemning them to not being able to get back into the workforce, to having to make the choice between maintaining a computer, paying for internet access and so on and actually providing what their children need to go to school. What sort of choice is that for a single parent? Why are we putting people in that position? All of the recent evidence out of the OECD, out of the Gonski review, shows that it is the educational background of parents that is a significant factor in their aspirations and their ability to achieve. That comes down to income inequality. Income inequality has been rising in Australia since the mid-1990s, effectively, and the social inclusion report that came out last year gave evidence to that effect.


The government stand up and talk about Labor values, but the action that they take is the antithesis of those Labor values. They are refusing to raise the money from the mining industry at a time when it is making megaprofits and instead are cutting payments to single parents and then coming in here with a bill which says, 'We will give a $4 a week rise in payments.' This is nowhere near enough. It holds up a mirror to statements about values. If you are serious about social justice and go out into your electorate and talk to people—to single parents, to young people who are on the youth allowance, to people on Austudy and to people on ABSTUDY—you will soon find that what we are saying is true: they are struggling to pay the rent and to put food on the table. They are asking the question: 'Why is it that we are being so repressed and put down in a society which is becoming wealthier by the minute, where the number of wealthy people is growing and the gap between the rich and the poor is expanding?' 


The fact is that the middle is being hollowed out. People are either being pushed down or getting into the higher income brackets. The middle is being hollowed out, just as has occurred elsewhere in the world. President Obama stood up and said that this gap between the rich and the poor in America was a critical issue for the wellbeing of that society, and he campaigned on it in the election. I am not suggesting that Australia is anywhere near as unequal as the United States. It is not, and I am very pleased that it is not. That is because we have a long tradition of trying to maintain an equal opportunity for all, regardless of where they have come from or the personal circumstances in which they currently live. That is an aspiration which I think most people, if you stopped them in the street, would say that they want to see delivered and that they think they could be proud of. But the reality is that it is not the case. Senator Siewert has demonstrated that it is not, by trying to live on Newstart. As she indicated in her speech, the price of the goods that she bought during her time on Newstart has increased by $7 a week. This bill provides a mere $4 increase, so people are still falling well and truly behind. This is nowhere near what it needs to be.


It is not just the Greens who are saying this. It is not just the social justice groups and the people out there in volunteer organisations who are providing support to people in the community who are saying this. It is not just those people in the non-government sector who are saying this. It is also the business community who are saying it, who are out there agreeing that Newstart should be increased by $50 a week and that putting people below the poverty line is unacceptable in Australia.


So where is the resistance? Who are the people out in the community backing the idea that you should not get people living on Newstart out of poverty? Who are the people advocating that we do not get people living on youth allowance out of poverty? People living on youth allowance now suffer on $170 below the poverty line. Who are the people saying that they ought not to be brought up to at least getting above the poverty line? I have not found anyone out there arguing that. But effectively that is what this parliament is doing. That is what the government is doing and that is what the coalition is doing. The coalition is doing it by saying: 'No increase. They should stay below the poverty line. The miners should not pay any mining tax at all. It is fine for Marius Kloppers to walk away with $75 million and it is fine for youth allowance students to live $170 below the poverty line.' Well, I do not think it is fine. I think it is despicable and I do not think it augurs well for the long-term health and wellbeing of our society. 


But, equally, the government are pretending that $4 a week is some kind of genuine attempt to address inequality of opportunity, to address the fact that people are living in poverty and children are living in poverty. It is not enough. How many backbenchers, how many members of this Senate and how many people in the parliament are already paying for breakfast programs in our schools? I can tell you that a lot of them are, Mr Deputy President, and you probably are as well. I can tell you that around Tasmania a number of members of parliament are paying for breakfast programs in schools because they know that students are turning up hungry.


That is something that people need to take on board. Children cannot learn and cannot achieve to their full potential if they come to school hungry. That is why schools are out developing breakfast programs of nutritious food and asking people to support them. I am very happy to support them, but the point is: how we have got to this? In a society of families and single parent families why are we getting to the point where people have to live with sending their children to school without breakfast? Is $4 per week going to fix that? I do not think so.


It is also about providing nutritious food to students. As we know, children need nutritious food to grow so that they achieve their full physical and mental potential. This is not happening; more and more children across Australia are living in poverty and have poorer health outcomes and poorer educational outcomes, and therefore less ability to get work and less ability to achieve their full potential.


It is not fair; it is not a fair and just society. Nor is this a parliament that cares. If there is one thing you can say about this bill—this social security bill that is giving a mere $210 a year to people on these allowances—it is that this parliament does not care about people living in poverty in Australia. It does not care about the fact that children are going to school hungry and it does not care about unequal health outcomes.


The Greens do care. We do care, and that is why Senator Siewert has developed her own bill to increase Newstart by $50 per week. That will cost about $2 billion a year. We also have the intention to go ahead with this additional Newstart allowance. We know it costs money, but we know that the money is there to be had as well. If the government would get behind us and if the coalition would abandon their cruel and unjust policy of refusing to tax the miners and we actually got the money from the mining tax, we could do the right thing. We could care for people living on Newstart, on youth allowance, on parenting payments, on ABSTUDY and on Austudy. We could care for those people. Surely that is what we want. Long term it is not only good for the people who are given the opportunity to participate in Australian society to their fullest—which is what we would ask—but it is better for our social and community wellbeing as well. When you have less disadvantage you have less anger, disappointment and frustration in the community. You have a more cohesive, happy and optimistic community. And with that you get a happier country.


Everywhere you look around the world you find that the countries that have the narrowest space—the narrowest gap—between rich and poor have the best outcomes as a nation on all kinds of social inclusion—health, education and prosperity outcomes. The more the gap between the rich and the poor widens, the more you get all those social indicators which undermine the health of your society in the long term. This is why the Greens are standing here to say we are prepared to stand up to the miners and to have the mining tax amended so that we can raise the money and block the loopholes. We are able to achieve that.


How much money are we talking about? We had this costed; the proposed changes we were making to increase the mining tax to a 40 per cent rate to fix the loopholes and to tighten up the generous depreciation provisions. That would bring in $26 billion over the forward estimates—$26 billion over four years! On that basis—if you are going to get $26 billion over the forward estimates—why would you not spend $2 billion of that a year to help children and their families to get out of poverty, or to help students struggling on youth allowance to achieve to their best ability in the educational scenarios that they are working in?


These are Australia's children and young people, disproportionately in this category, who are being done down by an unequal system and by a government and a coalition who are not prepared to take on the big miners but who are prepared to keep people in poverty. It is a sad indictment of the way that the society is going that this can be happening and people just sit back and accept it. The Greens do not accept it. We joined single parents out the front of this parliament the last time we were here during the estimates week. Those people had heart-wrenching stories to tell of the choices that they had to make. Far from getting people into work, it has meant that in many cases it has prevented them from being able to take up opportunities for work. It is driving people deeper and deeper into poverty.


I conclude by saying again: advising a man who is starving to eat less is both grotesque and insulting. And that is what both the government and the coalition are doing. In the case of the coalition, it is refusing to give any increase at all in support, and the government is suggesting that $4 per week is somehow fair—is somehow fair!—when the mining industry is walking away with megaprofits and can say goodbye to a chief executive with $75 million in his pocket in addition to everything he has earned over the years in that position. What does that say about the gap between the rich and the poor? The Greens do care, and will continue to argue and prosecute the case for a society which cares about people as well as the environment.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I rise today to speak to the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012 along with my colleagues Senator Siewert and Senator Milne. You have to ask yourself what has happened to the Labor Party and what has happened to the party who, under the Whitlam government, introduced the single parent pension because they knew that doing things on your own was a tough job. You have to ask yourself what has happened to the Labor Party when their values to do with looking after the most vulnerable in our community are now being traded off for what is in the best interests of people like Gina Rinehart and of the big mining magnates.


This morning the Prime Minister has announced the appointment of a new children's commissioner. It is fantastic to see this country finally catching up with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we signed over 20 years ago. But it took us 20 years to even take the crucial first step that that convention required of us, to appoint somebody at a national level to advocate for the rights, needs and interests of young people and children in this country. It took us 20 years to do that and now we have a children's commissioner, appointed today, and I congratulate the government for doing that. But this legislation is precisely the type of issue that 12 months ago a children's commissioner, if we had had a commissioner in place then, would have been screaming blue murder about given the fact that single parents and their children have had to suffer as a result of the callous cuts to the budget that the government have introduced. The fact that we are debating today a bill that gives parents an increase of only $4 a week despite their copping a reduction of up to $100 a week beggars belief. The Labor Party have truly lost their way when they are slugging single parents more when they are not prepared to stand up to the mining industry. The government wants to save $700 million by making single mothers in particular—we know that the majority of single parents in this country are mothers—pay for the government's budget savings, rather than introduce a proper mining tax that actually would have covered the necessary costs. Rather than making Gina Rinehart pay more tax, this government is telling single mothers around the country that they have to skimp and save.


My office has been inundated, as many of ours would have been, by stories of hardship from single mothers and single fathers across the country about how tough the changes introduced by the government last year are and about the effects that they are already having on their family. Parents are telling us that they cannot afford rent and that they have had to tell their kids, when they went back to school at the beginning of this year, that there would be no school camps. Their kids will not be going to school camps this year because the government has cut their payments, some by more than $100 a week.


Of course, we hear from the government that this is all about making single mothers work harder. Well, I can tell them that single mothers are probably the hardest-working people in this country. Not only do they have to hold down jobs and put food on the table for their kids; as everyone knows, they have to do the hardest job of all of being a parent—and when you are doing it on your own it is a tough gig. These parents have been kicked in the guts again by the Labor government. Rather than standing up to the miners and telling Gina Rinehart she should pay more tax, it has said, 'Single parents, you cop it.' Where are the values that were introduced by the Whitlam government when Mr Whitlam said that single parents deserved a bit more support and that looking after the most vulnerable in our community was something that all of us as elected representatives had a duty to do?


This bill gives recipients an extra $4 a week despite the reduction in payments across the board. Senator Siewert, as we all know, has a bill before the parliament to increase Newstart by $50 a week. That is a minimum as to what should be done. It is just giving people a fair go. What happened to the idea of looking after the most vulnerable and helping those who need a little bit of a hand up every now and again? It seems to have been forgotten. Meanwhile, as Senator Milne points out, Mr Marius Kloppers walks away with $75 million cash in hand. That is not a fair go for the rest of the country. It is obscene. That is what that is.


In South Australia, my home state, there are 25,000 single parents and about 40 per cent of them are going to be impacted by the changes that this government rushed through the parliament, with support from the coalition, only a few months ago. Some of those impacts are already starting to be felt. Welfare agencies are telling stories of how the number of single parent families applying for charity assistance has grown and schools are reporting that children are not being enrolled in their school camp programs. In Adelaide over the last few weeks, many of the public schools have been having swimming week, and about $25 is required for your kid to be allowed to be involved in it. When you have just had a cut to your fortnightly payment of anywhere between $100 and $200, $25 to send your kid to swimming classes, along with all the other kids in their class, is a pretty tough ask and there are parents who have had to make the decision that their children would not go to swimming week classes because they simply could not afford them. This is the reality of what this government's callous policies do to the most vulnerable in our community.


Rather than standing up to the big miners, rather than saying, 'We could get our savings and fund an increase in Newstart of $50 a week, make sure that single parents are not slugged and make sure that we actually get something back for the community from this massive mining boom that we are having,' the government has gone to water, buckled at the knees and handed over to Gina Rinehart and her mates everything that they wanted. It is time this government stood up for the interests and the needs, and understood the vulnerabilities, of those in our community who need proper support instead of kowtowing to the needs and desires of the big miners.


As I said at the beginning, today the government has announced the appointment of the National Children's Commissioner, Megan Mitchell. Her role will be to make sure that people understand the full impact on the country's children and young people of pieces of legislation and policy decisions enacted by this parliament. I would be interested to hear what the new children's commissioner thinks of pushing single parent families into poverty, because that is exactly what this government is doing. Rather than taking the opportunity to lift people up, give them a helping hand and get them into work in an effective way, and a way that empowers and inspires them, we have seen this government just kick and kick and kick. It beggars belief that it is the Labor Party that has followed the coalition down this path of get tough, get mean, cruel policies affecting vulnerable people rather than standing by the principles of former prime ministers like Whitlam, Hawke and Keating, who knew that government had to stand up and help single parents and their families and ensure that children were not sacrificed just because the government of the day wanted to make some budget savings.


We should be seeing an increase to Newstart of $50 a week. The government does not have the guts to do that. From the bill on the table it looks as though it does not have the guts at all. There is $4 extra a week, when all of the social welfare organisations, industry groups and everybody who is in the know understand that a $50 increase is an absolute minimum to help people get back into the workforce and provide for their families. The big myth about cutting the single parent pension is that it will force people back into work. This is despite the fact that over 40 per cent of single parents are already working. They are juggling working the hours they can get, squeezing them in during school hours, being able to do the school drop-offs and pick-ups and being able to make ends meet and put food on the table, providing a safe, loving and caring home for their children.


Cutting people's payments by $100 does not really help them—particularly those who are already working—find more work. How do they pay for the before- and after-school care now? How do they make sure that their kids have everything they need? How do they keep themselves fit and able to go back to work? This is a backwards policy, a cruel policy, and it is absolutely a rejection of the very values that people like Gough Whitlam brought into the parliament when they advocated the single parent pension in the first place. It is a short-sighted policy, it does more harm than good and all the while the big miners, Gina Rinehart and her friends, are being let off the hook.


This government has to recognise that, if it wants to fund the services that our community needs, it has to get the revenue from somewhere. Fixing the mining tax, plugging the loopholes that the miners had cleverly had put in, would be a step towards making sure we had the money in the coffers to fund an increase for Newstart, to implement the Gonski reforms in a meaningful, effective way and to fund an NDIS program. And what about affordable child care? We have just slugged single parents with a reduction in their pension, and yet childcare costs continue to rise. What is the government going to do about that? This bill is an insult to the hard work of single parent families, to anybody who is struggling to survive on the paltry Newstart allowance, and of course to all those young people who suffer on $175 a fortnight under Youth Allowance—way below the poverty line. The Greens will continue to advocate that Newstart be raised by $50 a week and that we allow single parents to earn what they can in the jobs they have without suffering the callous cuts proposed by the Labor government.


The Greens remain in this place the only ones prepared to stand up for single parents and their children, and we are proud of that. While the Labor Party has forgotten who it is meant to look after and the coalition and the miners are laughing all the way to the bank, the Greens are the only ones with the guts to stand up to the big miners and say single parents do not deserve the kicking they are getting from the Labor Party. The government should seriously consider passing Senator Siewert's bill and fixing the loopholes in the mining tax so that we can get on and start supporting people rather than pushing them into further poverty and pushing them down to a point where they become voiceless as the government forgets totally the values it was meant to uphold.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:07):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. This particular bill was announced as part of the government's 2012-2013 budget. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill will provide many disadvantaged Australians with extra funds to count on in tough times. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security Administration Act 1999, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and creates a new indexed, tax-free income support bonus to be paid to recipients of ABSTUDY, living allowance, Austudy, Newstart allowance, parenting payment, sickness allowance, special benefit, youth allowance, transitional farm family relief payment and the exceptional circumstances payment.


The government understands that it is very tough living on unemployment benefits. Making ends meet when you cannot get a job is incredibly difficult. Many Australians are feeling the pressure on their household budgets, and families receiving government allowances are some of our most vulnerable citizens. Some recipients of allowances can find it hard to manage unexpected costs. The income support bonus will provide $210 extra per year for eligible singles and $350 to most couples, where both partners are eligible. The bonus will be paid in two instalments each year, in March and September, with the first payments on or soon after 20 March 2013, subject to the passing of this legislation. For single recipients the initial income support bonus payments will be $105. The payment to most people who are a member of a couple will be $87.50. As is the case with other supplements, each entitled member of a couple separated by illness, or a couple where a partner is in respite care or a couple where a partner is in jail will be paid the single rate of $105. Recipients will not have to apply to receive the income support bonus. Payments will be made automatically by the Department of Human Services to those who are eligible.


As I said, it is very tough living on a Newstart allowance but long-term unemployed, intergenerational joblessness and welfare dependency is beyond tough; it is a tragedy. It is vital that the Newstart allowance continues to provide a strong safety net for people who have lost their job. We know Newstart allowance now supports a more diverse population than it used to, so it is even important that we keep the focus on work because having a job is the best safeguard against poverty. It is the only permanent solution to unemployment. That is why we have invested $5.9 billion and reformed Job Services Australia to target assistance to those who need it most. The government is focused on creating jobs. Helping people back into the work is partly about targeted assistance, but more about strong economic management to create the conditions that support jobs.


The government recognises that the issue of adequacy is about lives, and it will not turn its back on the issue or the people who are doing it the toughest—some of the most vulnerable in our community. It is also why with this measure the government is providing more than $1.1 billion over the next four years to help people who receive these income support allowance payments to manage unexpected cost-of-living expenses. People on Newstart allowance will continue to have access to a range of additional payments and supports, depending on the person's circumstances, including rent assistance, the family tax benefits, childcare support, payments to help with specific costs like medicine or telephone bills and, of course, concession cards.


The budget bottom line always has to be a central consideration, which this government does not walk away from for a moment. The modest extra assistance provided through the income support bonus strengthens the existing support whilst being framed against a background of fiscal prudence, given the tough budgetary considerations of the government and the ongoing priority on jobs. This new payment, along with related measures such as the doubling of the liquid assets waiting period and the increase in the tax-free threshold, will assist some of the most disadvantaged in our community to manage their budgets as they deal with rising living costs.


The government has welcomed the report of the Senate Education Employment and Workplace Relations Reference Committee on the adequacy of the allowance payment system. The government is careful and is seriously considering the recommendations of the committee. Any increase in the rates of Newstart and other payments would come, obviously, at a significant cost. We cannot simply ignore the cost pressures in the current budget environment, and we will need to make some difficult policy choices. This measure will help both new and long-term income support recipients, including those in receipt of the Newstart allowance, to manage and be more resilient to unanticipated expenses. I thank those senators who have spoken on this bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. This bill seeks to introduce a new tax-free, twice-yearly income support bonus for recipients of certain income support payments. The bill would amend the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to create a new income support payment. The bill comes out of a package which the Prime Minister announced with much fanfare called Spreading the Benefits of the Boom. The boom in question obviously is the mining boom. It was intended that the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom would be paid for by the MRRT, of which there has been a little discussion of late. 


The Prime Minister's press release of 8 May last year said:


The Benefits of the Boom package will be funded by re-directing Minerals Resource Rent Tax revenue intended for the company tax cut.


We know what happened. It turned out to be something that we have become quite accustomed to, and that is another policy failure. 


The Treasurer, Mr Swan, told us that the bill would raise $2 billion over the 2012-13 financial year. We now know that in its first six months the MRRT raised $126 million. It took a lot of effort and a lot of time to actually find out what the MRRT raised. Until very recently we have had an absolutely farcical situation where the government said that the Australian Taxation Office telling the Treasurer how much money the MRRT was raising would be a breach of the law because it would disclose to the Treasurer the identity or details of an individual taxpayer, being a mining company in this case. We were further told that, if the ATO did give that information to the Treasurer who then released publicly how much money the MRRT raised, he would be breaking the law. That was always completely erroneous because Australian tax law specifically provides for the ATO to have the capacity to give the Treasurer tax information where that is necessary for the Treasurer to discharge his duties. The tax law further provides that the Treasurer can release details of revenue to the public in a circumstance under which it might identify a particular taxpayer where the public interest benefit outweighs privacy considerations. The law is very clear on both those points so it came as no surprise to this side of the chamber when the government finally relented and released the revenue details for the MRRT.


We know why the government were hiding behind the fig leaf of some supposed advice that they could not release the information without breaking the law. It was because of the acute embarrassment that they would experience admitting that this tax, which was intended to raise billions and billions of dollars, had in fact raised little more than $100 million. It was one of the most farcical situations I have ever seen. 


I cast my mind back to my days working for a former Treasurer—the last Treasurer to deliver a budget surplus in Australia. I could not imagine him saying to the Australian Taxation Office: 'Don't tell me how much money each and every tax has earned. No, don't tell me. I know you are about to tell me, Mr Tax Commissioner, but please do not tell me. Whatever you do, please do not tell me how much money this tax has raised.' Can you imagine Mr Costello doing that? I do not think so. He would want to know exactly how much money each and every tax raised. It is one of the most farcical things I have ever seen in this place.


Coming a close second was a doorstop that Mr Swan did in Queensland last week just after he returned from his latest international foray. Mr Swan enjoys spending as much time away from Australia as he possibly can these days, for understandable reasons. Mr Deputy President Parry, I would like to read to you what Mr Swan said in relation to the MRRT. He said:


… it just so happens that it's politically inconvenient that in the second half of last year commodity prices crashed and that had a dramatic impact on revenues and that occurred more generally. But these are the facts of life that responsible economic managers take into account.


I just want to read that again. He said:


… it just so happens that it's politically inconvenient … commodity prices crashed … impact on revenues …


Politically inconvenient is the criteria that Mr Swan applies to this tax and to his determination about the policy efficacy of his MRRT. He views it through the prism of politics. He does not say, 'The failure of the MRRT to raise revenue is a failure of forecasting.' He does not say, 'The failure of the MRRT to raise much revenue is a failure of me, the Treasurer, in designing the MRRT.' He does not say that the MRRT's failure to raise significant revenue reflects on the competence of the government of the day. He does not say that the MRRT's failure to raise revenue makes a complete farce of the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom policy package, of which this legislation is a part. He does not say that the failure of the MRRT to raise significant revenue means that the government has spent money, in many cases money that it does not have, in delivering parts of the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package. He did not say any of those things. He did not make any of those observations, which would have been quite appropriate to make. The only observation he makes is that it is politically inconvenient. It is quite extraordinary that that is the Treasurer's summation of the MRRT policy failure.


This legislation was framed against the backdrop of trying to curry favour through putting particular amounts of money in particular voters' pockets. It was purely driven for electoral politics. It was, I am sure, also driven by a concern that Australians were starting to feel the impacts of the carbon tax on their cost of living. That is the genesis of this particular piece of legislation. It is pure, naked, electoral politics and nothing else. But there is one positive about this piece of legislation that is before us. It does give us the opportunity to reflect on the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package. It does give us the opportunity to reflect on the minerals resource rent tax and the revenue that it has not raised.


It was curious to note that some on the other side of this chamber spoke about the need to close loopholes in the MRRT. There are not loopholes in the MRRT. The things that are referred to as loopholes in the MRRT are in fact specific design features of the MRRT. They are features designed by Ms Gillard and by Mr Swan. You cannot blame the Australian Treasury or the Australian tax office for this particular piece of work because officials with relevant expertise were excluded from the negotiations. This was done directly between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and a number of mining companies. You cannot blame the mining companies as, I guess, they saw a pair of suckers come along and thought, 'Well, what's in the best interests of our shareholders?' You cannot blame them.


The people who are meant to be looking out for the public interest are the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They failed comprehensively to do so. For that reason, and for those I have outlined, the opposition will not be supporting this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  On the surface of things you would think that the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012 is great because it puts a bit more money in the pockets of those on Newstart, but when you look at it—and it is supposed to be about sharing the benefits of the boom—you see that they only get an extra $4 a week. This is a cohort of people, nearly 600,000 Australians, who are living more than $130 a week below the poverty line. You can understand why they are not dancing in the streets with getting an extra four bucks a week. In Perth that will not buy you a cup of coffee.


If the government were serious about helping those who are struggling to survive—and it is a struggle to survive when you are on Newstart—they would be doing something more than the $4 a week. This is a stunt to make it look as if the government care about the most vulnerable in the community. It is not genuine support for those that are struggling on income support. The government has transferred single parents and their families onto Newstart when their child turns eight. Is the child supposed to be cheaper when it turns eight? Is it suddenly easier to look after your family? They have dumped over 100,000 single parents and their families onto Newstart, lowering their income by up to $60 to $120 a week. The $4 is a drop in the ocean compared to the slug they have just taken. Of course, the Greens will be supporting this bill because to deny people living in poverty even a small boost would be wrong.


We are very disappointed that the government thinks this is the solution to those hundreds of thousands of Australians who are struggling to survive below the poverty line. The government seems content with this dog-eat-dog approach to the most vulnerable members of our community—those who are continuing to fall through the cracks—because $4 a week will not stop that fall. It does not take them out of poverty; it does not help put food on the table. Since the government announced this, they have had another indexation of Newstart that is not indexed in the same way as aged pensions and other pensions and does not keep up with the true cost of living. In fact, six months after I lived on Newstart for a week I compared the basket of goods and they had gone up by $7. Indexation did not go up by that much for those people living on Newstart. The $4 they are getting a week now does not keep up with that increase in the cost of living. 


This is not the action of a government that cares for its community or cares for the most vulnerable in that community. This is an extra $210 a year that will be paid in twice-yearly instalments. Those living on youth allowance and trying to study are trying to live at $170 below the poverty line, because they receive $42 less than those trying to survive on Newstart. This shows how out of touch they are if they think this is going to go anywhere near addressing the huge financial difficulties of those living on Newstart. Only the Greens are actually prepared to help look after the most vulnerable members of our community. We know that Newstart needs to be increased and that is why I have introduced a bill to increase Newstart by $50 a week. Although that does not fully address the gap between Newstart and the poverty line, it does at least give a meaningful additional payment to those struggling to survive. I will be introducing another bill to address the government's cuts to single parents that will provide a supplement to all of those single parents trying to survive on Newstart, because, of course, the Howard government's welfare-to-work changes, brought in in 2006, moved single parents—other than those who were grandfathered—onto Newstart, and it is those parents who are doing it even harder than those trying to survive on parenting payment single.


The bill I will be introducing will provide a supplement of $40 to all single parents, which will help those who are already struggling to survive on Newstart as well as that new grandfathered group that has been moved onto Newstart. It will also address the issues around the taper rate for single parents. The government says, 'We dumped over 100,000 single parents onto Newstart to help them, to encourage them, to find work.' We know that is a fallacy. We know from the mothers who have told us how they are struggling. We know it is even harder for them on Newstart as they struggle to keep ahead. Those who are already working are losing even more money than those who have not yet managed to find part-time work. We also know that cohort of people are the people who are on income support who are working the most—up to 50 per cent of those single parents who are on parenting payment single are already working—and yet NATSEM was reported in the media on Saturday as finding that single parents keep less per hour because the taper rates on Newstart if they are moving from part-time to full-time work. In other words, they are worse off if they are on Newstart and they are trying to work full time. 


We know that up to 30 per cent of those who are using Foodbank services and other emergency relief services are people on income support and are single parents. You can bet your bottom dollar that those are the single parents who have already been moved onto Newstart and just cannot make ends meet when they are trying to raise a family and find work on the measly amount that Newstart pays. Since single parents have been moved onto Newstart, I have heard account after account of the ways people are struggling to survive on Newstart. Let me read some examples from mothers who are struggling to survive and raise their family on Newstart. This is one mother's story:


My heart is for my children. Do they not have a right to be parented by me? Do they stop needing me when they turn eight? There is no-one else to care for them when they're sad, sick or frightened. How can I be in two places at once? If I am at work I am worrying about my children, not focussed on work. At home I worry about finding the money needed to provide for my family. I am in a no-win situation.


Here is another one: 


Dear federal government, 


I am a single parent. My son has turned 12 last September. I fulfilled the commitment of studying, working since 2008 and I have continued to be eligible for parenting payment single. Since the change of legislation on 1 January 2013 I have been plunged into despair because of the demands on me—homemaker, financier, cook, cleaner, home maintenance repairs and car costs. The pressures of looking for full-time work are impossible for me. It is negatively affecting my ability to parent my son. Trying to manage everything with less money is a Mount Everest of burden on my shoulders and my son's wellbeing is bad. He is feeling my pressure. You must change the legislation back and give more, proper support to single parents and mothers and fathers with children of all ages.


Another mother says: 


I am unable to plan! I will no longer be able to register my car!! Buy new tyres!! Replace light bulbs!! Buy new shoes!! Purchase head lice treatment! House and contents insurance, pay debts, let my daughter go to birthday parties as I can no longer buy presents. Unable to sleep!! I DO WORK in part-time employment. I DO study a full-time course. I volunteer at my neighbourhood house community school.


I have received hundreds and hundreds of emails and letters from parents expressing similar concerns. 


I have an example of a parent who was sick and could not make her interview at Centrelink. Her payments were cut because she could not make the interview. Her Centrepay payments were not met, therefore her rent was not paid. She has been made homeless. That is how Australia cares for its most vulnerable members of our community—by plunging them into poverty, making them unable to support their children and unable to pay their rent and making them homeless. That is not the sign of a caring community. 


We know that those on income support are living below the poverty line. We know they make up a large number of the people that have to access emergency relief services. We know that their children are living in poverty. We know the lifelong effects that poverty has on those children's chances. We know from Anglicare’s When there's not enough to eat report that children are going to school hungry or being withdrawn or not sent to school because parents cannot provide lunch. When children do go to school hungry, it is not a good situation to be learning in. We know that, if you cannot learn and you do not learn and do not get a good education, that lowers your job prospects into the future. 


It is not as if we do not know what impact poverty has on children’s lives and their lifelong chances. Yet this government thinks that $4 a week will fix that. This is a joke. It is a cruel joke on the most vulnerable members of our community. This is not sharing the benefits of the boom. If we were sharing the benefits of the boom, we would be making sure that we were supporting the most vulnerable Australians and caring for the most vulnerable Australians, because that investment not only helps now; it helps those families' long-term prospects and futures. An investment now is an investment for the future. An investment through a proper mining tax would properly share the benefits of the boom. If we were not more interested in keeping the big miners happy and keeping money in their pockets than we are in the most vulnerable members of our communities and the children that this government says it cares about, we would be investing a lot more than $4 a week in these families. These families are struggling to survive on Newstart, which is more than $130 below the poverty line. 


Single parents who have been just managing to survive have been plunged into circumstances where they cannot make ends meet. They cannot make ends meet on Newstart. And $4 a week is nothing but show from this government: 'Look—we're sharing the benefits of the boom. We are putting money into parents' pockets.' Well, they are not. They put $4 in and took between $60 and $120 a week out. How is that the sign of a caring government? How is that sharing the benefits of the boom? It is not. Making children homeless does not share the benefits of the boom. 


Anglicare’s report found that 45,000 households using their services were unable to feed their families properly. Three-quarters of the adults participating in the study said that they had run out of food in the last three months and could not afford to buy more. In other words, they were going hungry. Seven out of 10 said they had cut the size of meals and six in 10 are regularly skipping meals altogether. These adults and their children are going hungry. Children who are hungry are often reported to be grumpy, upset, embarrassed or withdrawn. Often they have behavioural problems, struggle to pay attention at school and are isolated from their friends. Parents in the Anglicare survey described keeping their kids home because there was nothing to put in their lunch boxes or not letting them have friends come over after school because there was nothing to eat and share. 


The Senate inquiry into the adequacy of Newstart agreed:


On the weight of evidence, the committee questions whether Newstart Allowance provides recipients a standard of living that is acceptable in the Australian context for anything but the shortest period of time. 


We know that 62 per cent of those on Newstart have been on it for longer than 12 months. That is not a short period of time. How is $4 a week going to help these people? How is $4 a week going to help them pay the bills and manage to make ends meet? How is it going to help them pay the ever-increasing cost of rent? It is not. 


Many, many people have been calling for an increase in Newstart—the Henry tax review, welfare groups like ACOSS, UnitingCare, the Salvation Army, economists and the Business Council of Australia. They are calling for at least a $50 a week increase in Newstart because Newstart is too low to live on. ACOSS reports that 25 per cent of single parents and their families live below the poverty line, and of course that data was from before single parents were transferred onto Newstart. There are almost 600,000 children living below the poverty line. 


If you are struggling to survive on over $130 below the poverty line, what do you think $4 is going to do for you? It is not going to be able to raise you out of poverty. It is not going to pay for school books, for the spiralling cost of food, for car maintenance and for the spiralling cost of utility bills. It is not going to help you study. If you are a single parent who has not started studying you might as well forget studying, because you are not going to get the education supplement either. You do not make the benefits out of transferring from part-time work to full-time work because of the government's transferring you to Newstart and the effect of the tapering rate on the payments that you can take home. You are in trouble every way you look.


And what is the government's response? Four dollars a week, because they would rather care for keeping big miners happy than those more than 100,000 single parents that have had money taken out of their pockets and those on Newstart, youth allowance and Austudy who are all struggling below the poverty line. On top of not being able to survive, they are also struggling with inadequate job services. Job service employment agencies are not meeting the needs of the long-term unemployed. They are not able to help people find work. Not one person on Newstart that I have spoken to does not want to find work. They face multiple barriers to employment, not the least of which is struggling to survive below the poverty line.


It is time that we paid attention to supporting the most vulnerable in our community. We will be supporting this bill, because of course every cent helps; but they need $50 a week at least, not a measly $4 a week. Ultimately this is about the sort of society that we want to live in. We want to live in a caring society, a society that cares for people, not in a dog-eat-dog community, which is what the government and the coalition obviously want to see. The coalition are not even supporting a measly $4-a-week increase. This is about people who have fallen on hard times. How we treat people is a sign of how caring our society is—how we treat single parents who are struggling to balance work and looking after their kids, the kids that are our future. Do we want to become a more caring society where we use some of the wealth of this country to look after those that are doing it tough, or are we going to attack them and keep them living below the poverty line, unable to support their children, unable to make ends meet and continuing that cycle of poverty? If we significantly support the most disadvantaged, it helps them and our community.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:32):  I rise today to make comment on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. As my colleague Senator Siewert has just said, it provides for a totally inadequate supplementary payment for recipients of Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment, Austudy and Abstudy. A supplement of $210 a year, paid in two instalments of $105 in March and September, is completely and utterly inadequate and unacceptable. As my colleague has just said, $4 a week is a complete affront to the idea of equality of opportunity in Australia. Oscar Wilde once said:


… to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting.  It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.


That is precisely what the coalition are doing by saying they will not support it at all and what the government is doing by saying that $4 a week is enough.


I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for the huge amount of work that she has done in recent years to try and bring the absolute inequality that is going on in Australia to the public eye. She took on the Newstart allowance and, through trying to live on that allowance herself, was able to highlight all of the issues associated with trying to provide for transport, trying to clothe and feed a household and trying to pay the disproportionate amount of money that goes to paying rents in a society where the cost of renting is now so high and so extreme—particularly in communities affected, as we have seen in Senator Siewert's state of Western Australia but also elsewhere in the country, by the huge boom in the mining industry—that it is out of the reach of many people. That is why the poorest are becoming homeless.


We really need to ask this question: what sort of society do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a society which has a growing gap between the rich and the poor—which of itself then ends up with a society with lowered life expectancy, poorer health outcomes and less educational opportunity for some because a few want to maintain the wealth that they have to the exclusion of others? I found it particularly obscene when I heard last week that Marius Kloppers had left BHP, taking $75 million on top of his wage with him as he left the company—$75 million. This is a company, BHP, which only paid $77 million in the mining tax to the Australian people for the Australian people's ore that BHP was making its huge profits with. The fact that BHP could write off its poor judgement in terms of its African operations in Mozambique, for example, and use that not to pay an appropriate tax in Australia just shows you that we have both a government and a coalition who are bending over backwards to facilitate the mining industry to the detriment of those in Australia who are struggling—and there are many of them. I draw attention to the single parents. Taking away that support from single parents because there was a hole in the budget because the mining tax was not paying and there was a refusal to fix it, letting Marius Kloppers walk away with $75 million whilst taking the money out of the pockets of single parents, is surely an affront to what a decent country would look like and to making sure you address this issue of equality of opportunity.


Over the weekend there had been much discussion about the implementation of the Gonski review and trying to get a fair amount of funding into the schools which are the most disadvantaged. Once again, the Greens have said: 'Yes, we will pass Gonski. We want this new funding formula which is fairer to go through, but we would like to see priority given to the funds going first to the most disadvantaged public schools.' If we were a society that was actually genuine about providing equality of opportunity to all children, regardless of the socioeconomic background from which they come and regardless of where they live, then we would be supporting such an amendment. But, instead of that, we have got the Treasurer, Mr Swan, who has said that making the country a fairer place is a priority for him but we have to create the wealth to sustain these programs—and of course he was referring to all the support payments. Well, he is making the country a less fair place by not creating the wealth that there is the opportunity to create at the moment through the mining tax, by not choosing to go after that, and instead trying to take money away from single parents and coming in here with a bill which gives a mere $4 extra a week—in a restaurant, a cup of coffee—for people who are struggling to pay the rent, struggling to put a meal on the table and struggling to get their children back to school.


All this is in the context of people talking about trying to get people who are currently unemployed and on Newstart allowance, or single parents, back into the workforce. This is condemning them to not being able to get back into the workforce, to having to make the choice between maintaining a computer, paying for internet access and so on and actually providing what their children need to go to school. What sort of choice is that for a single parent? Why are we putting people in that position? All of the recent evidence out of the OECD, out of the Gonski review, shows that it is the educational background of parents that is a significant factor in their aspirations and their ability to achieve. That comes down to income inequality. Income inequality has been rising in Australia since the mid-1990s, effectively, and the social inclusion report that came out last year gave evidence to that effect.


The government stand up and talk about Labor values, but the action that they take is the antithesis of those Labor values. They are refusing to raise the money from the mining industry at a time when it is making megaprofits and instead are cutting payments to single parents and then coming in here with a bill which says, 'We will give a $4 a week rise in payments.' This is nowhere near enough. It holds up a mirror to statements about values. If you are serious about social justice and go out into your electorate and talk to people—to single parents, to young people who are on the youth allowance, to people on Austudy and to people on ABSTUDY—you will soon find that what we are saying is true: they are struggling to pay the rent and to put food on the table. They are asking the question: 'Why is it that we are being so repressed and put down in a society which is becoming wealthier by the minute, where the number of wealthy people is growing and the gap between the rich and the poor is expanding?' 


The fact is that the middle is being hollowed out. People are either being pushed down or getting into the higher income brackets. The middle is being hollowed out, just as has occurred elsewhere in the world. President Obama stood up and said that this gap between the rich and the poor in America was a critical issue for the wellbeing of that society, and he campaigned on it in the election. I am not suggesting that Australia is anywhere near as unequal as the United States. It is not, and I am very pleased that it is not. That is because we have a long tradition of trying to maintain an equal opportunity for all, regardless of where they have come from or the personal circumstances in which they currently live. That is an aspiration which I think most people, if you stopped them in the street, would say that they want to see delivered and that they think they could be proud of. But the reality is that it is not the case. Senator Siewert has demonstrated that it is not, by trying to live on Newstart. As she indicated in her speech, the price of the goods that she bought during her time on Newstart has increased by $7 a week. This bill provides a mere $4 increase, so people are still falling well and truly behind. This is nowhere near what it needs to be.


It is not just the Greens who are saying this. It is not just the social justice groups and the people out there in volunteer organisations who are providing support to people in the community who are saying this. It is not just those people in the non-government sector who are saying this. It is also the business community who are saying it, who are out there agreeing that Newstart should be increased by $50 a week and that putting people below the poverty line is unacceptable in Australia.


So where is the resistance? Who are the people out in the community backing the idea that you should not get people living on Newstart out of poverty? Who are the people advocating that we do not get people living on youth allowance out of poverty? People living on youth allowance now suffer on $170 below the poverty line. Who are the people saying that they ought not to be brought up to at least getting above the poverty line? I have not found anyone out there arguing that. But effectively that is what this parliament is doing. That is what the government is doing and that is what the coalition is doing. The coalition is doing it by saying: 'No increase. They should stay below the poverty line. The miners should not pay any mining tax at all. It is fine for Marius Kloppers to walk away with $75 million and it is fine for youth allowance students to live $170 below the poverty line.' Well, I do not think it is fine. I think it is despicable and I do not think it augurs well for the long-term health and wellbeing of our society. 


But, equally, the government are pretending that $4 a week is some kind of genuine attempt to address inequality of opportunity, to address the fact that people are living in poverty and children are living in poverty. It is not enough. How many backbenchers, how many members of this Senate and how many people in the parliament are already paying for breakfast programs in our schools? I can tell you that a lot of them are, Mr Deputy President, and you probably are as well. I can tell you that around Tasmania a number of members of parliament are paying for breakfast programs in schools because they know that students are turning up hungry.


That is something that people need to take on board. Children cannot learn and cannot achieve to their full potential if they come to school hungry. That is why schools are out developing breakfast programs of nutritious food and asking people to support them. I am very happy to support them, but the point is: how we have got to this? In a society of families and single parent families why are we getting to the point where people have to live with sending their children to school without breakfast? Is $4 per week going to fix that? I do not think so.


It is also about providing nutritious food to students. As we know, children need nutritious food to grow so that they achieve their full physical and mental potential. This is not happening; more and more children across Australia are living in poverty and have poorer health outcomes and poorer educational outcomes, and therefore less ability to get work and less ability to achieve their full potential.


It is not fair; it is not a fair and just society. Nor is this a parliament that cares. If there is one thing you can say about this bill—this social security bill that is giving a mere $210 a year to people on these allowances—it is that this parliament does not care about people living in poverty in Australia. It does not care about the fact that children are going to school hungry and it does not care about unequal health outcomes.


The Greens do care. We do care, and that is why Senator Siewert has developed her own bill to increase Newstart by $50 per week. That will cost about $2 billion a year. We also have the intention to go ahead with this additional Newstart allowance. We know it costs money, but we know that the money is there to be had as well. If the government would get behind us and if the coalition would abandon their cruel and unjust policy of refusing to tax the miners and we actually got the money from the mining tax, we could do the right thing. We could care for people living on Newstart, on youth allowance, on parenting payments, on ABSTUDY and on Austudy. We could care for those people. Surely that is what we want. Long term it is not only good for the people who are given the opportunity to participate in Australian society to their fullest—which is what we would ask—but it is better for our social and community wellbeing as well. When you have less disadvantage you have less anger, disappointment and frustration in the community. You have a more cohesive, happy and optimistic community. And with that you get a happier country.


Everywhere you look around the world you find that the countries that have the narrowest space—the narrowest gap—between rich and poor have the best outcomes as a nation on all kinds of social inclusion—health, education and prosperity outcomes. The more the gap between the rich and the poor widens, the more you get all those social indicators which undermine the health of your society in the long term. This is why the Greens are standing here to say we are prepared to stand up to the miners and to have the mining tax amended so that we can raise the money and block the loopholes. We are able to achieve that.


How much money are we talking about? We had this costed; the proposed changes we were making to increase the mining tax to a 40 per cent rate to fix the loopholes and to tighten up the generous depreciation provisions. That would bring in $26 billion over the forward estimates—$26 billion over four years! On that basis—if you are going to get $26 billion over the forward estimates—why would you not spend $2 billion of that a year to help children and their families to get out of poverty, or to help students struggling on youth allowance to achieve to their best ability in the educational scenarios that they are working in?


These are Australia's children and young people, disproportionately in this category, who are being done down by an unequal system and by a government and a coalition who are not prepared to take on the big miners but who are prepared to keep people in poverty. It is a sad indictment of the way that the society is going that this can be happening and people just sit back and accept it. The Greens do not accept it. We joined single parents out the front of this parliament the last time we were here during the estimates week. Those people had heart-wrenching stories to tell of the choices that they had to make. Far from getting people into work, it has meant that in many cases it has prevented them from being able to take up opportunities for work. It is driving people deeper and deeper into poverty.


I conclude by saying again: advising a man who is starving to eat less is both grotesque and insulting. And that is what both the government and the coalition are doing. In the case of the coalition, it is refusing to give any increase at all in support, and the government is suggesting that $4 per week is somehow fair—is somehow fair!—when the mining industry is walking away with megaprofits and can say goodbye to a chief executive with $75 million in his pocket in addition to everything he has earned over the years in that position. What does that say about the gap between the rich and the poor? The Greens do care, and will continue to argue and prosecute the case for a society which cares about people as well as the environment.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I rise today to speak to the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012 along with my colleagues Senator Siewert and Senator Milne. You have to ask yourself what has happened to the Labor Party and what has happened to the party who, under the Whitlam government, introduced the single parent pension because they knew that doing things on your own was a tough job. You have to ask yourself what has happened to the Labor Party when their values to do with looking after the most vulnerable in our community are now being traded off for what is in the best interests of people like Gina Rinehart and of the big mining magnates.


This morning the Prime Minister has announced the appointment of a new children's commissioner. It is fantastic to see this country finally catching up with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we signed over 20 years ago. But it took us 20 years to even take the crucial first step that that convention required of us, to appoint somebody at a national level to advocate for the rights, needs and interests of young people and children in this country. It took us 20 years to do that and now we have a children's commissioner, appointed today, and I congratulate the government for doing that. But this legislation is precisely the type of issue that 12 months ago a children's commissioner, if we had had a commissioner in place then, would have been screaming blue murder about given the fact that single parents and their children have had to suffer as a result of the callous cuts to the budget that the government have introduced. The fact that we are debating today a bill that gives parents an increase of only $4 a week despite their copping a reduction of up to $100 a week beggars belief. The Labor Party have truly lost their way when they are slugging single parents more when they are not prepared to stand up to the mining industry. The government wants to save $700 million by making single mothers in particular—we know that the majority of single parents in this country are mothers—pay for the government's budget savings, rather than introduce a proper mining tax that actually would have covered the necessary costs. Rather than making Gina Rinehart pay more tax, this government is telling single mothers around the country that they have to skimp and save.


My office has been inundated, as many of ours would have been, by stories of hardship from single mothers and single fathers across the country about how tough the changes introduced by the government last year are and about the effects that they are already having on their family. Parents are telling us that they cannot afford rent and that they have had to tell their kids, when they went back to school at the beginning of this year, that there would be no school camps. Their kids will not be going to school camps this year because the government has cut their payments, some by more than $100 a week.


Of course, we hear from the government that this is all about making single mothers work harder. Well, I can tell them that single mothers are probably the hardest-working people in this country. Not only do they have to hold down jobs and put food on the table for their kids; as everyone knows, they have to do the hardest job of all of being a parent—and when you are doing it on your own it is a tough gig. These parents have been kicked in the guts again by the Labor government. Rather than standing up to the miners and telling Gina Rinehart she should pay more tax, it has said, 'Single parents, you cop it.' Where are the values that were introduced by the Whitlam government when Mr Whitlam said that single parents deserved a bit more support and that looking after the most vulnerable in our community was something that all of us as elected representatives had a duty to do?


This bill gives recipients an extra $4 a week despite the reduction in payments across the board. Senator Siewert, as we all know, has a bill before the parliament to increase Newstart by $50 a week. That is a minimum as to what should be done. It is just giving people a fair go. What happened to the idea of looking after the most vulnerable and helping those who need a little bit of a hand up every now and again? It seems to have been forgotten. Meanwhile, as Senator Milne points out, Mr Marius Kloppers walks away with $75 million cash in hand. That is not a fair go for the rest of the country. It is obscene. That is what that is.


In South Australia, my home state, there are 25,000 single parents and about 40 per cent of them are going to be impacted by the changes that this government rushed through the parliament, with support from the coalition, only a few months ago. Some of those impacts are already starting to be felt. Welfare agencies are telling stories of how the number of single parent families applying for charity assistance has grown and schools are reporting that children are not being enrolled in their school camp programs. In Adelaide over the last few weeks, many of the public schools have been having swimming week, and about $25 is required for your kid to be allowed to be involved in it. When you have just had a cut to your fortnightly payment of anywhere between $100 and $200, $25 to send your kid to swimming classes, along with all the other kids in their class, is a pretty tough ask and there are parents who have had to make the decision that their children would not go to swimming week classes because they simply could not afford them. This is the reality of what this government's callous policies do to the most vulnerable in our community.


Rather than standing up to the big miners, rather than saying, 'We could get our savings and fund an increase in Newstart of $50 a week, make sure that single parents are not slugged and make sure that we actually get something back for the community from this massive mining boom that we are having,' the government has gone to water, buckled at the knees and handed over to Gina Rinehart and her mates everything that they wanted. It is time this government stood up for the interests and the needs, and understood the vulnerabilities, of those in our community who need proper support instead of kowtowing to the needs and desires of the big miners.


As I said at the beginning, today the government has announced the appointment of the National Children's Commissioner, Megan Mitchell. Her role will be to make sure that people understand the full impact on the country's children and young people of pieces of legislation and policy decisions enacted by this parliament. I would be interested to hear what the new children's commissioner thinks of pushing single parent families into poverty, because that is exactly what this government is doing. Rather than taking the opportunity to lift people up, give them a helping hand and get them into work in an effective way, and a way that empowers and inspires them, we have seen this government just kick and kick and kick. It beggars belief that it is the Labor Party that has followed the coalition down this path of get tough, get mean, cruel policies affecting vulnerable people rather than standing by the principles of former prime ministers like Whitlam, Hawke and Keating, who knew that government had to stand up and help single parents and their families and ensure that children were not sacrificed just because the government of the day wanted to make some budget savings.


We should be seeing an increase to Newstart of $50 a week. The government does not have the guts to do that. From the bill on the table it looks as though it does not have the guts at all. There is $4 extra a week, when all of the social welfare organisations, industry groups and everybody who is in the know understand that a $50 increase is an absolute minimum to help people get back into the workforce and provide for their families. The big myth about cutting the single parent pension is that it will force people back into work. This is despite the fact that over 40 per cent of single parents are already working. They are juggling working the hours they can get, squeezing them in during school hours, being able to do the school drop-offs and pick-ups and being able to make ends meet and put food on the table, providing a safe, loving and caring home for their children.


Cutting people's payments by $100 does not really help them—particularly those who are already working—find more work. How do they pay for the before- and after-school care now? How do they make sure that their kids have everything they need? How do they keep themselves fit and able to go back to work? This is a backwards policy, a cruel policy, and it is absolutely a rejection of the very values that people like Gough Whitlam brought into the parliament when they advocated the single parent pension in the first place. It is a short-sighted policy, it does more harm than good and all the while the big miners, Gina Rinehart and her friends, are being let off the hook.


This government has to recognise that, if it wants to fund the services that our community needs, it has to get the revenue from somewhere. Fixing the mining tax, plugging the loopholes that the miners had cleverly had put in, would be a step towards making sure we had the money in the coffers to fund an increase for Newstart, to implement the Gonski reforms in a meaningful, effective way and to fund an NDIS program. And what about affordable child care? We have just slugged single parents with a reduction in their pension, and yet childcare costs continue to rise. What is the government going to do about that? This bill is an insult to the hard work of single parent families, to anybody who is struggling to survive on the paltry Newstart allowance, and of course to all those young people who suffer on $175 a fortnight under Youth Allowance—way below the poverty line. The Greens will continue to advocate that Newstart be raised by $50 a week and that we allow single parents to earn what they can in the jobs they have without suffering the callous cuts proposed by the Labor government.


The Greens remain in this place the only ones prepared to stand up for single parents and their children, and we are proud of that. While the Labor Party has forgotten who it is meant to look after and the coalition and the miners are laughing all the way to the bank, the Greens are the only ones with the guts to stand up to the big miners and say single parents do not deserve the kicking they are getting from the Labor Party. The government should seriously consider passing Senator Siewert's bill and fixing the loopholes in the mining tax so that we can get on and start supporting people rather than pushing them into further poverty and pushing them down to a point where they become voiceless as the government forgets totally the values it was meant to uphold.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:07):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012. This particular bill was announced as part of the government's 2012-2013 budget. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill will provide many disadvantaged Australians with extra funds to count on in tough times. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security Administration Act 1999, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and creates a new indexed, tax-free income support bonus to be paid to recipients of ABSTUDY, living allowance, Austudy, Newstart allowance, parenting payment, sickness allowance, special benefit, youth allowance, transitional farm family relief payment and the exceptional circumstances payment.


The government understands that it is very tough living on unemployment benefits. Making ends meet when you cannot get a job is incredibly difficult. Many Australians are feeling the pressure on their household budgets, and families receiving government allowances are some of our most vulnerable citizens. Some recipients of allowances can find it hard to manage unexpected costs. The income support bonus will provide $210 extra per year for eligible singles and $350 to most couples, where both partners are eligible. The bonus will be paid in two instalments each year, in March and September, with the first payments on or soon after 20 March 2013, subject to the passing of this legislation. For single recipients the initial income support bonus payments will be $105. The payment to most people who are a member of a couple will be $87.50. As is the case with other supplements, each entitled member of a couple separated by illness, or a couple where a partner is in respite care or a couple where a partner is in jail will be paid the single rate of $105. Recipients will not have to apply to receive the income support bonus. Payments will be made automatically by the Department of Human Services to those who are eligible.


As I said, it is very tough living on a Newstart allowance but long-term unemployed, intergenerational joblessness and welfare dependency is beyond tough; it is a tragedy. It is vital that the Newstart allowance continues to provide a strong safety net for people who have lost their job. We know Newstart allowance now supports a more diverse population than it used to, so it is even important that we keep the focus on work because having a job is the best safeguard against poverty. It is the only permanent solution to unemployment. That is why we have invested $5.9 billion and reformed Job Services Australia to target assistance to those who need it most. The government is focused on creating jobs. Helping people back into the work is partly about targeted assistance, but more about strong economic management to create the conditions that support jobs.


The government recognises that the issue of adequacy is about lives, and it will not turn its back on the issue or the people who are doing it the toughest—some of the most vulnerable in our community. It is also why with this measure the government is providing more than $1.1 billion over the next four years to help people who receive these income support allowance payments to manage unexpected cost-of-living expenses. People on Newstart allowance will continue to have access to a range of additional payments and supports, depending on the person's circumstances, including rent assistance, the family tax benefits, childcare support, payments to help with specific costs like medicine or telephone bills and, of course, concession cards.


The budget bottom line always has to be a central consideration, which this government does not walk away from for a moment. The modest extra assistance provided through the income support bonus strengthens the existing support whilst being framed against a background of fiscal prudence, given the tough budgetary considerations of the government and the ongoing priority on jobs. This new payment, along with related measures such as the doubling of the liquid assets waiting period and the increase in the tax-free threshold, will assist some of the most disadvantaged in our community to manage their budgets as they deal with rising living costs.


The government has welcomed the report of the Senate Education Employment and Workplace Relations Reference Committee on the adequacy of the allowance payment system. The government is careful and is seriously considering the recommendations of the committee. Any increase in the rates of Newstart and other payments would come, obviously, at a significant cost. We cannot simply ignore the cost pressures in the current budget environment, and we will need to make some difficult policy choices. This measure will help both new and long-term income support recipients, including those in receipt of the Newstart allowance, to manage and be more resilient to unanticipated expenses. I thank those senators who have spoken on this bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-02-25,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:26):  by leave—I move: 


That the Senate declares that it has no confidence in the Government's handling of the mining tax.


Never before in the history of the Commonwealth have the Australian people endured such a dysfunctional and incompetent government. Those of us who recall the debacle known as the Whitlam government are beginning to look on that short-term yet devastating era with a degree of fondness, as an example of sound administration and robust policy development in comparison to the past five years. In fairness, though, we do not know what depths the Whitlam government might have sunk to if given five years.


The Rudd-Gillard governments have presided over the worst governance Australia has had to endure in its 112-year history. They came to office on the back of a promise, backed up by paid commercials, that Mr Rudd was an economic conservative, yet, on gaining government, he immediately took to scribbling that essay in the Monthly condemning sound economic policy, parading his economic illiteracy in grand style.


Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard will be remembered for stunning evidence based public policy initiatives! Who can forget Fuelwatch? Who can forget GROCERYchoice? Or what about the cash splash which paid the dead and those overseas in a vain attempt to stimulate the domestic economy? We then had the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which Ms Gillard herself wanted Mr Rudd to dump. We then had the temporary deficit, which is now in its fifth year and no end in sight. We then had the border protection disgrace, and so the list goes on—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! On both sides, Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence. 




Senator ABETZ:
  And so the list goes on—



The PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute, Senator Abetz. I will give you the call when I am ready. Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  And so the list goes on, including the so-called Building the Education Revolution. Remember the laptops, the GP superclinics and the mining tax, the topic of today's motion. It will be recalled that Ms Gillard needed to wrest the prime ministership off Mr Rudd because the government 'had lost its way'. She, of course, was the vice-captain of that government. But itemised examples were given by Ms Gillard of the loss of direction. They were volunteered by her at her first press conference as Prime Minister. What items did she nominate? What items did she volunteer? Border protection—well, that has gone well, hasn't it? The carbon tax—a $4 billion black hole and heading south. And, of course, the mining tax. 


I agree with Ms Gillard on this: Mr Rudd's handling of these issues was diabolically inept.


He did deserve to be rolled. He did deserve to be ousted. But, if Mr Rudd deserved to be ousted for his gross incompetence, what do we say of Ms Gillard's handling of those issues? Ms Gillard's ineptness, unbelievably—because one would not believe that it is possible—is 10 times, if not more, worse than Mr Rudd's; border protection—worse, the carbon tax—a $4 billion black hole—and now this mining tax. Who else! Who else could dream up a scheme which shatters Australia's enviable, second-to-none, world reputation on sovereign risk? Who else could have the arrogance to negotiate personally the details of the mining tax without officials present? Who else would do it without the states present? Who else would do it without the territories present? And who else would do it in secret? Who else would do it with only three of the mining companies out of the 3,000 mining companies that exist in Australia? Who else could agree to a scheme which collects virtually no money? Who else could design a mining tax that costs a miner like Atlas Iron $2 million to comply with, only to find out—after submitting their returns—that they will not have to pay the tax? Who else could design such a maze of red tape? Who else could design a mining tax that even the Chief Government Whip acknowledges needs to be changed and that the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia opposes because he knows the damage it will do to his state's economy? The answer to all these questions is Ms Gillard and the Green-Labor-country Independent alliance's excuse for a government. They are the people who have put such a scheme together.


The next question is: which parties combined to ruthlessly and arrogantly guillotine the mining tax—with all its fatal flaws—through the Senate? Which senators thought they knew it all?




Senator Kim Carr:
  Mr President, a point of order!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Just wait a minute.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! You will be given the call when there is silence on both sides.



Senator Joyce interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Wait a minute Senator Joyce. You will be given the call. Order!




Senator Joyce:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I could not properly hear Senator Abetz because Senator Conroy was negotiating with their former partner about what they were going to do next.



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  That was very telling, Senator Joyce, to see these people who have allegedly ripped up the marriage certificate there in deep discussion. We will see what comes from it.


Which senators thought they knew it all? Which senators believed that guillotining 150-plus bills through the Senate was part of the new paradigm? You know, democracy at work? That the Senate would be given a proper role? Remember, what an affront it was to democracy—and I address these comments to our friends in the media gallery—and remember how the keyboards tapped away when the coalition guillotined 30 bills through the Senate in a full term? Five times that number have been guillotined in half the time, courtesy of the Green-Labor alliance in this place. I trust the keyboards will be suitably fired up.


To the Greens and the ALP senators' enduring shame, it was them who foolishly—soaked in their own self-importance and convinced of their own superior intellect—guillotined this flawed legislation through the Senate. But worse than all of this, this is the government that has also forced through this place billions of dollars' worth of expenditure predicated on the income of the mining tax, which disappeared like this morning's mist in Canberra.


Labor has again broken its own limbo record on public policy with the mining tax. No-one gets lower than Labor when it comes to public policy debacles, and the mining tax is an excellent exemplar. Yesterday's much-heralded reform is now another Labor policy dud.


I say to the Australian Greens: we can have all the faux outrage, we can have all the foot stomping and we can have all the ripping up of agreements at the National Press Club, but today the Greens have an opportunity to tell the Australian people whether they have confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax. The difficulty of course for the Australian Greens is that they helped ram it through. They helped guillotine it through the Senate, ensuring that there was no proper debate and ensuring that all the issues that we as a coalition wanted to ventilate would not be ventilated—despite their promise of a new paradigm. But today the Australian Greens can tell the Australian people whether or not they have confidence in the way that the mining tax was handled.


Let us be very clear, especially in relation to the answer given by the Leader of the Government earlier on in question time. Senator Conroy sought to put all the blame in relation to the debacle that is the mining tax at the feet of variable pricing of commodities.


Well, I am sure Senator Conroy was actually present at Senate estimates when the Secretary to the Treasury told the truth about these things and, of course, Senator Wong would have been there as well, one would hope. The Prime Minister has not only reneged on the promise of the carbon tax—not having one—she has also reneged on giving a commitment to providing monthly updates on the mining tax revenue—a rolled gold, solid commitment and, once again, broken. At Senate estimates, just a fortnight ago, the Treasury secretary, Dr Parkinson, admitted that the design of the mining tax is responsible for its failure to generate revenue, not the falling commodity prices and not the higher currency and state royalties blamed by the government. It is for exactly that reason that the Chief Government Whip, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, has indicated to the public that he believes that there is a design flaw in the system. I can understand Senator Wong's embarrassment at this because, as the minister for finance, she should have had control of this issue. She never has had and she never will because she is like all her colleagues around here: economic illiteracy is their strong suit.


But what did Dr Parkinson say? He said Treasury had compiled its budget forecasts in ignorance of the real cost of concessions agreed to by Mr Swan. Now why were they in ignorance of that? Because the deal was done in secret without Treasury officials present. They are the architects of their own debacle. They thought they knew it all. Take the master negotiator, Ms Gillard, who negotiated a deal with Mr Wilkie only to welsh on it, and who did that wonderful negotiation with Mr Slipper, the member for Fisher. What a great thing that was to have him elevated to the Speakership! And now, to complete the trifecta, we have the master negotiator exposed in relation to the mining tax. We have design flaws courtesy of Ms Gillard and Mr Swan thinking they knew it all, thinking that they could outsmart the three CEOs of the big mining companies. Guess who won? If you could have a sweep on it I reckon Sportsbet would have laid the odds pretty heavily in favour of the three CEOs.


Of course, unfortunately, we are now paying the price. Part of the price that we are paying is that the Labor government sought to sell this so-called reform to the Australian people on the basis of a whole range of goodies and bribes to the electorate. This is what Labor are all about: they want to buy their way back into government and on the way attack Mr Abbott. But what I say to the Australian people, through this forum, is this: the mining tax has failed. Take all the predicated expenditure which was also rammed through this place courtesy of the Greens-Labor alliance and is now clearly unaffordable on all the evidence. Who is going to pay for it? Future generations, because the government have now abandoned their promise of a surplus. If ever there were a case for young Australians to vote for the future of their country, it is this, to vote for the party that actually believes in intergenerational economic responsibility. To keep on maintaining the debt levels that we have today and try to keep our lifestyle as it is, lumbering the cost with interest onto the next generation, is an example of the gross incompetence of the Labor Party. Dr Parkinson's testimony to the economics committee disclosed quite clearly that Mr Swan was either grossly negligent or grossly reckless. We do need and deserve an explanation from the government as to how this debacle was able to be achieved. It was all their own work—we know that—because they specifically dismissed the Treasury officials. They were so smart they only had to work this out all by themselves with three CEOs! Yet we have the audacity of the Leader of the Government in the Senate trying to claim that somehow 'we do deals with rich miners'. Excuse me, but who did this deal and got done over by the three richest mining companies in Australia? Minister Conroy, you and your government did—your Prime Minister and your Treasurer—and that is the legacy that will be left, and will be remembered by the people, because of this government.


So what we have here is a gross example of ministerial incompetence mixed up with ministerial arrogance as they are thinking they know it all and then when the problem blows up, who do they blame? 'It's the states' fault but we didn't consult them' or 'It's the territories' fault but we didn't consult them' or 'It might be the miners' fault and the Treasury's fault.' When you do not include the people in the equation you can hardly blame them afterwards for the debacle. There are two people who are at the head of this government—the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer—who personally negotiated this fatally flawed deal, a deal which has punched a billion-dollar-plus hole in the government's forward estimates of billions and billions of dollars—and those are thousands of millions of dollars. Keep in mind, if you want to get an idea of how big that is, that they trumpeted that a $1 billion surplus was going to be a huge economic outcome. Multiply that but in the other direction—negatively—and that is the hole that is now left in the budget courtesy of Ms Gillard and Mr Swan—all their own work because they knew better than Treasury officials. So it was not surprising that, by implication, the head of Treasury dumped on the government by saying it was not the fault of commodity prices—that it was not as the leader of the government in this place sought to say—but was the fault of the scheme and its design. As I have said before and as I will say again: when even your own members, like Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, understand that and your own Leader of the Opposition, desperate to win some votes in the west, is willing to say it is fatally flawed and hugely damaging to the sovereign risk reputation of Australia and to forward mining initiatives—when Labor doyens like that can acknowledge it—one wonders why is it that Ms Gillard and Mr Swan cannot.


One reason is their own pride—it was all their own work, so they cannot admit that they made such a fatal mistake in the design. This is a fatally flawed scheme. At at least make sure if you are going to devastate our sovereign risk reputation, that there is a dividend on the other side of the ledger. Our sovereign risk reputation has been trashed without any real money being collected on the other side. This is the classic loss-loss that only those with the ingenious nature of Ms Gillard and Mr Swan could think up and produce.


This is serious. The mining sector in Australia has been its mainstay for a considerable period. This Labor government has sought to kill the goose laying the golden egg for the Australian economy. Fortunately, in this absolute debacle they have simply wounded the goose and it has flapped away. We hope that the likes of Joel Fitzgibbon and the Australian Greens will not get their hands on the mining tax and complete the job.




Honourable 
senators
 interjecting—





Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Cameron continues to talk across the chamber about Gina Rinehart. What his fascination with her is we do not know, but we do know that Ms Gillard had a fascination with the three top mining companies in Australia and they did over her and Mr Swan. They were done like a dinner. Labor is now confronted with the embarrassment of it all, and the Australian Greens are scrambling around for advice because they guillotined this tax through the Senate, they forced it through the Senate, and then, in a bit of a temper tantrum at the Press Club recently, they ripped up the agreement, with Adam Bandt saying that this was the straw that broke the camel's back.


The mining tax is a destructive tax cobbled together by a dysfunctional government. That is why the Senate should declare that it has no confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax</title>,MOTIONS,2,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:47):  As we were submitted to that 20 minutes of diatribe, we all got an image of Eric in his bathroom practising in front of the mirror—adjusting his tie, puffing his chest out and showing how outraged he was. What a pathetic performance. Is that the best he can do when he has actually prepared for this stunt? Let us be clear that this is nothing more than a stunt. Those opposite cannot wreck question time in the House of Representatives today, so they want to wreck it in the Senate—but they cannot even do that properly.


The only reason they have moved this motion of no confidence on the minerals resource rent tax is that the good ladies and gentlemen of the press are sitting up in the gallery. Everybody knows that is the only reason this motion has been moved by the opposition. It is not orthodox practice in the Senate and until now, in general, we have avoided the sorts of tactics that we have seen in the House of Representatives, where there is no interest in question time, no interest in discussing public policy and no interest in talking about anything important to the future of the country—only an interest in stunts. Everybody watching knows that this motion is nothing more than a grandstanding stunt, a tactic by those opposite because there is no question time in the Reps. The press gallery is here and it is the turn of the Senate coalition to look like they can blow the place up as well. That is the sum total of this opposition's contribution to public policy debate in this country.


I am happy to talk about the economy and jobs. I know that those opposite are not interested in talking about jobs—it is obvious in here that they do not want to talk about Australian jobs. We saw that when Senator Lundy was on her feet talking about Australian jobs. We saw it with the usual smart alec contribution of Senator Brandis—




Senator Fifield:
  That's not fair, Penny.




Senator WONG:
  I am sorry, Senator Fifield—your smart alec contributions as well. Those opposite were completely uninterested in talking about Australian jobs. Let us hear a few statistics that those opposite do not want to talk about. How about an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent? How about 800,000 jobs being created since we came to government? It has gone very quiet over there. They do not want to talk about that. Let us talk about the size of the economy. Our economy is 13 per cent larger than it was when we came to government, prior to the global financial crisis—something those opposite lied about to pretend it did not occur. Those opposite like to scrub the GFC from the economic history of the nation and the globe, saying that somehow it did not really happen. The reality is that it did.


What have we achieved in this country—government, business and employees working together? An economy 13 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. There are comparable economies that still have not got back to the same level of output, that are still not the same size they were over five years ago. Have a look at some economies overseas. Senator Brandis and Mr Abbott love to look to the United Kingdom and talk about all the wonderful things that we should import from the UK—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I have been listening to the minister, between interruptions from Senator Conroy coming down here and Senator Collins coming down here to talk to their former partners, the Greens. I have been trying to find a point of relevance. This debate is about the minerals and resource rent tax. The only thing that will be relevant here is whether the Greens support the Labor Party—



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Joyce.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! When there is silence on both sides we will proceed.




Senator WONG:
  There was a great contribution from the bloke who wanted to be the deputy prime minister and still has Mr Abbott's ear when it comes to the economy! A really intelligent contribution from the Leader of the Nationals! I again remind people: 13 per cent larger. The United Kingdom is still smaller than it was at the same time, and, of course, Germany, which I think Mr Robb and others have touted as being this incredibly strong economy that we should aspire to, I think has grown 2½ per cent. So let us get the facts on the table when it comes to economic performance. Cash rate—what is the cash rate? Three per cent as at December 2012.




Senator Brandis:
  That is because the economy can barely raise a pulse!




Senator WONG:
  I will take that. The brilliant Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that the economy barely has a pulse! What a brilliant contribution that is! We had 3.1 per cent growth through the year. That is something most advanced economies would give their right arm for, and yet another example of the way those opposite believe it is entirely appropriate to talk down the Australian economy. Australian workers do not thank you for that, Australian families do not thank you for that and Australian businesses do not thank you for that because we know that talking down the economy is not good for the economy. It is quite clear that those opposite are quite happy to put political advantage above the national interest every single time. Every single time, they will put political advantage above the national interest. I was talking about the cash rate, and I know those opposite promised that interest rates would always be lower under them. Can everyone remember that? Interest rates would always be lower under a coalition government. Well, they are lower under us. Despite the fact those opposite want to forget this, they are lower under a Labor government, and, of course, we see inflation being contained.


Those opposite want to have a debate about the economy, and we are very happy to have a debate about the economy. We are very happy also to have a debate about our fiscal position, because, yet again, we hear those opposite saying things which are completely untrue. I make this point to the chamber: we have a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from all three international ratings agencies. So the question I would ask is this: do you believe Senator Abetz or do you believe the ratings agencies? Do you believe the markets, which show confidence in the Australian economy, or do you believe Senator Abetz? Do you believe market commentators and people investing in Australia? We have investment that is approaching the highest percentage of GDP in the nation's history. Do you believe people who are investing in our economy or do you believe those opposite, who are scaremongering for nothing more than political purposes? The reality is that those opposite have no idea when it comes to the economy and no idea when it comes to public finances.


I will make another couple of points about spending and about the budget. Of the 12 coalition budgets that were handed down, nine of them showed higher spending as a percentage of GDP—nine out of 12—so higher spending as a proportion of GDP than now. I would also make this point: when you look at our last five budgets plus the last mid-year review, we have delivered $154 billion worth of saves. That is eight times the number of savings delivered by the Liberals in their last five budgets when, of course, we remember that there was revenue coming in hand over fist to government that they frittered away and failed to invest in skills or in infrastructure or in anything of long-term benefit to the nation.


Today, the coalition want to talk about the government. Let us talk about the things that they do not want to talk about. I would like to remind them that they say we should not be funding anything and that all of this expenditure associated with the mining tax should be avoided. It is really interesting that they are also agreeing to match the government when it comes to the superannuation guarantee. I am interested to see—it has gone very quiet, and I know that Mr Robb was rolled by Mr Abbott in this—if they ever fess up to the Australian people, given that they want to abolish the carbon price and abolish the mining tax, how they propose to fund the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy. It is yet another example of those opposite refusing to give any costings to the Australian people.


Let us remind Australians and the chamber of the things that the coalition do not want to talk about. They do not want to talk about the cuts that they want to implement should they win government. Let us remind ourselves about some of what we already know. We know that they want to give a tax hike to all low-income workers. Everybody earning under $80,000 a year that gets a tax cut under us will get a tax hike under the coalition by removing the tax-free threshold changes that Labor put in place. This shows their values; this shows their priorities: 'Let's hack into workers earning under $80,000 a year'.


What else will they do? They will roll back the low-income superannuation contribution. They want to impose a tax hike on 3.6 million Australians—the lowest-paid Australian workers. So, tax hikes on people earning up to $80,000 and an additional tax hike on people on the lowest incomes—the lowest-income workers in Australia, of whom the majority are women. 2.1 million of the 3.6 million people in this country who benefit from that super tax rate that a Labor government is implementing will get hit, should the coalition win power.


What does this speak to us about? It shows what their values are. It shows that the first people in line when a Liberal Party and a National Party are looking for cuts are low-paid Australians. That is what it shows. Low-paid Australians are the first ones in line for cuts and tax increases should a coalition government be elected. It says something very clear about the difference in values between this side of the chamber and those opposite. Those opposite want to go hard on low-income Australians; we want to support low-income Australians. That is the difference between the two sides of parliament.


I also want to make this point: we also know the game plan for those opposite. The game plan can be very clearly seen in what we see, particularly in Queensland, where before an election they do not actually want to tell people very much about what they want to do because it is so bad. We know what Liberals do: they cut health, they cut education and they cut services. That is what they do. We know that is what Liberals do.


What we are hearing is those opposite yet again saying, 'We actually do not want to tell people about that. We know we have to say a few things—that we are going to increase taxes on everyone earning up to $80,000. We know we have to say something about the low-income super contribution—we are going to tell people that. But we are not going to talk about anything else.' We saw that game-playing in Queensland. We saw what Premier Newman did in Queensland. He told people that he would not be too radical, and what did we see: cuts to health and cuts to education. That is what we are seeing and that is what Liberals do.


We know that because over and over again the opposition are avoiding any scrutiny when it comes to their budget position or when it comes to details of their policies. They come in here and they want to talk to us about the mining tax. What I would say to you is this: when will you tell us anything about how you will pay for anything you are promising—anything about what you will do? We know that in this economic team—among those opposite there is no Peter Costello, let me tell you—since Mr Hockey has been in his position, there has never once been delivered a policy costing which added up. He has never once delivered a policy costing that added up. Instead of making sure that it adds up, what is he doing? 'We just will not put them out. That is what we will do—we will not actually put them out.'


How do we know? Before the last election, they used a Western Australian accounting firm that was subsequently found to have acted unprofessionally. This was your budget position: an $11 billion black hole was discovered by Treasury and by Finance after the election. And what have we seen since then? We have seen another botched attempt at costings where you have used a catering company to put forward your costings.


This coalition has had such an embarrassing history when it comes to anything fiscal, when it comes to any policy costings, when it comes to any transparency and when it comes to fessing up to the Australian people about anything they will do. They have the hide to come in here and say they want a debate on taxation and the economy. What a joke! I think that everybody here knows precisely what a joke it is.


You had the opportunity in this question time if you really cared about some of the things you say you care about. We hear Senator Abetz whining about how little time they had on the MRRT package—in excess of nearly 15 hours of debate—and they say that they did not have enough time, that they never get the opportunity to talk about policy. Well, you had the opportunity today to ask ministers questions. You could have asked about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but you do not want to do that. You could have asked about education, but you do not want to do that. You could have asked about jobs, but you do not want to do that. You could have asked about the economy, but you do not want to do that. All you want to do is continue the relentless negativity, and complete absence of any positive plans for the future of the nation, that you have become known for. That is the sum total of the contribution of this opposition to today's political debate.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:03):  This move by Senator Abetz is so transparent and expected. It is why I indicated at the Press Club last week that we would not be doing anything to move or support a no-confidence motion in the government.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  We have no intention of allowing Senator Macdonald to send the CSIRO to Karratha or wherever else he wants to send it. We have no intention of letting Tony Abbott put 100 dams across Northern Australia. We have zero intention of allowing Zed Seselja—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Order on my left! Senator Milne, you have the call. Please refer to members in the other place by their correct title.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. We have no intention of allowing Mr Zed Seselja to sack 20,000 public servants in the ACT and send half of the rest north of the Tropic of Capricorn.




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. We have just heard the minister give a speech that was in absolutely in no way relevant to the issue of the mining resource rent tax. Now we have Senator Milne giving a speech that—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Is this on relevance, Senator?




Senator JOYCE:
  It is one on relevance. If she is embarrassed by the fact that she is about to support the government on the tax that she said she would not support them on, let her just say so.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Joyce! There is no point of order.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. There is only one serious embarrassment in here and he has just sat down. I get to the point here. This is a classic case where we have sat here and listened to 40 minutes of ranting on both sides of this chamber and nobody has talked about where the revenue is going to come from to do the things that the Australian community want done, particularly in the lead-up to the election. It is a classic case of a pox on both your houses as far as the community is concerned. That is why I am moving to amend the motion as follows:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""the Senate condemns the Government's failure to put in place a mining tax which raises sufficient revenue from the big miners to fund Australia's long-term needs"".



Senator Joyce interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  I understand that Senator Joyce does not want to raise the money to fund the Gonski reforms, for example. He does not want to raise the money to put in place national disability insurance; nor is he prepared to tell people in his electorate in Queensland that he is going to change the tax-free threshold from $18,000 back to $6,000. So let us hear from Senator Joyce, when he speaks a little later, how he is going to do anything other than open his big mouth and make an even bigger fool of himself.


I want to come to the point about revenue raising. There is all this talk about what promises are going to be made or not made in the election campaign. The people want to know where the money is going to come from in order to implement the Gonski review. Let me start with that as an example. We need a new funding model for education in Australia. Where are we going to get that money if we do not raise it from those who have the capacity to pay?


Let me just take BHP Billiton for a moment. BHP Billiton have just made a $9 billion profit and Marius Kloppers has just walked out the door with a $75 million handout, yet BHP can only spend $77 million on the mining tax. It is time that we actually raised the money so that we can put it into Australian schools. We still do not have in this house a piece of legislation for a funding model to pass between now and the election, and we need it, but we also need to know how to fund it.


I happen to agree that it is very clear that the mining industry ran rings around the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson. They did—it is now quite clear that that happened. But I want to come to this idea that the Greens should have known that somehow and I want to go through the dates to explain this. It was on 2 July 2010 that the Prime Minister and Treasurer Swan announced to the Australian people they had reached a deal with the big miners. The federal election was called on 17 July for a 21 August election. No further information was made available in the public arena in relation to the exact details of that tax, nor were they revealed throughout. Indeed, the details were not revealed until a long time afterwards, after the agreement that the Greens reached with the government.


So let us get back to the facts of the matter. Between 2 July and the time the election was called, no details were in the public arena. And, for example, it did not come out in the public arena until Senate estimates the other night that Treasury officials were not even in the room. You do have to ask yourself: what were the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson doing? In fact, where was Minister Ferguson? He seems to have slipped out the side door and managed to avoid the criticism that he ought rightly to have been there. Of course, he would be the best friend of Senator Macdonald—they are both on the same side on many issues. When we get to the point here, the fact of the matter is nobody knew and we have only just discovered from Treasury that Treasury were not in the room to negotiate this outcome.


The other reason we need to fix this mining tax is one where we get total hypocrisy from Senator Abetz and the coalition. They do not want to raise a cent. In fact, they want to let Gina Rinehart, Twiggy Forrest, Clive Palmer et al off paying any tax—any at all. Not once has Senator Abetz or anyone on that side been able to say where they are going to get the money from to be able to do what they say they are going to do. If you say you are going to get rid of the mining tax, if you say you are going to get rid of the carbon price, how are you going to fund the change to the tax-free threshold and the compensation payments more generally? How are you going to fund the superannuation contributions? How are you going to fund any of those things? You have not presented a single idea about where the money is going to come from except that, as you have already said, you do not support giving even a $4 a week increase to people who are on the lowest level of support in Australia. What a disgusting exhibition of meanness and of increasing the gap between the rich and the poor in Australia. You do not want the miners to pay anything, but you are not even prepared to give people on Newstart or youth allowance $4 a week.


As far as the government is concerned, you do not want to give them more than $4 a week; in fact, you have taken away the support for single parents and you are not prepared to see people on Newstart get $50 a week more, even though all the community NGOs who are supporting people in the community are saying it is essential and so too are the churches and the business groups. Everybody recognises that people are living below the poverty line and we have to do something about it.


How fair is it, when people are living below the poverty line, that we have a coalition saying it is fine for BHP to make their $9 billion and for Marius Kloppers to walk away with $75 million in his pocket? It is fine as far as the government is concerned not to fix the mining tax but, instead, to leave the Gonski report not fully implemented until 2019. That is on the never-never. That will never happen. That is the fact of the matter: unless you bring these things forward and fund them, they are not going to happen. It is the same with the promises about national disability. How are we going to get this actually implemented? To make them at-risk propositions, to go out there and say, 'Unless you vote for us you are not going to get these things,' is to condemn another generation of schoolkids around Australia to a completely unfair, unjust funding model.


We cannot afford to have these things made at-risk propositions. I will never facilitate the coalition determining that you will not get a fairer school funding model. The minister has said that the funding model is coming. Well, let us see it in here. The opposition spokesperson, Christopher Pyne, has said he wants to delay it for another two years. Let us go back. In 2007, when the Labor Party came to power, Prime Minister Gillard was the minister for education and she deferred that funding model for two years. It has been deferred and deferred and deferred until the last gasp of this government. Now it is right up against the election and we have a coalition saying they want to maintain disadvantage in schools around Australia. They want to maintain the poorest and most disadvantaged schools being disadvantaged and to maintain that unfair, unjust funding model. I am not going to facilitate that because I want to see this money raised.


I am not going to facilitate a coalition which wants no mining tax and is hypocritically standing up here criticising the mining tax. If you want to actually see justice in Australia—which you talk about—do something about it and let's raise the money. If you are not prepared to raise it from the miners, tell me where you are going to raise it and identify the people around Australia whose pockets you are going to rob. Which people are you going to take money from? That is the obligation of the coalition. You cannot just come in here and get stuck in about a mining tax which I agree has been poorly designed and which needs to be fixed. We need the money. I am just tired of a debate where everybody says what they will spend the money on and nobody says how they are going to raise it. 


The Greens are prepared to fix this. We have said that, if you lift the rate to 40 per cent, if you block the state royalty loopholes and if you deal with the accelerated depreciation, you could get $26 billion over the forward estimates. How is the coalition going to pay, how is Labor going to meet the Gonski implementation and when are we going to see that funding model? When are we going to see some fairness and justice for people who are on Newstart, for people who are on youth allowance and for single parents? When are we going to see those sorts of things, because, as we speak, there are children in Australia who go to school hungry and are at school hungry today? The coalition would rather have the mining industry pay no taxes, the Labor Party is not prepared to fix the holes in it, and neither side is prepared to say where the money is coming from. Until we get an idea of where the money is coming from, everything that the coalition are saying about this is simply hot air because we do not have any notion from them about who is going to pay for this direct action. Where is all this money coming from? It is simply not there as far as the coalition are concerned.


Worse than that, we have even had the coalition trying to get people to breach their statutory obligations and break the law. We have had Andrew Robb—




Senator Abetz:
  That is Mr Robb to you.




Senator MILNE:
  Yes. We have had Mr Robb and Mr Hunt write to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ask them to break the law. What sort of behaviour is that from the coalition? It is all because they do not want $10 billion to go into renewable energy. I want to see $10 billion into renewable energy. I want to see large-scale solar rolled out across Australia and I want to see the Clean Energy Finance Corporation get that leveraging of private sector finance to drive the clean energy revolution. It is shocking when you think about what the coalition have done. They have written to people asking them to breach their statutory obligations and break the law. That is how far they are prepared to go and yet they are not prepared to drive the clean energy revolution at all. They have made no undertakings in terms of the renewable energy target and actual energy at use here. We have really got big issues with the coalition running away and hiding from actually answering some questions. That is the fact of the matter.


I invite any one of you in the coalition to get up in a minute and tell us where the money is coming from. Where are you going to get the money if you are not going to support the mining tax, if you are not going to support carbon pricing? If you are not going to do that, where are you going to get the money to maintain the tax-free threshold at $18,000? Let me just hear that for a start. Where is the money coming from? Where is the money coming from to pay the polluters? No doubt it is coming out of the pockets of those who can least afford to pay because that is the coalition's track record.


As far as the government is concerned, there is no doubt that we need to raise this money and we need to raise it now. We want the funding model for Gonski in this parliament legislated and locked in so that, whatever the election outcome, the Greens will hold the balance of power and can stop it being repealed. I can tell you that, when we get this election, there will be students around Australia and their families devastated if the new funding model has not been legislated and the funding brought forward so that it is left until 2019-20 to have it implemented. It is already shocking that a child who started school in 2007 has left primary school and they still do not have the inequitable funding model dealt with.


It is interesting that Senator Nash supports coal seam gas and loss of farmlands and contamination of groundwater across northern New South Wales, a process going on as we speak. I am interested that we are not hearing anything from Senator Joyce about the massive support the Nationals have got for coal seam gas and expansion of coal mining around the country. So much for the National having a base which is supposed to be looking after agricultural land and farmers. Far from it, their former leader is head of a coal company destroying agricultural land and forests and woodlands in the Maules Creek area for a start.


The opportunity is there to raise money and that is where the Greens stand on this. Both the coalition and the Labor Party need to start getting real on where the revenue is coming from or else all of these promises and announcements about national disability, Gonski and superannuation will count for nothing if there is no money. R&D funding is exactly the same. We are hearing about $1 billion getting taken out of research and development but only $400 million going into the jobs packet—$600 million is going to the budget to prop up whatever the election announcements are going to be from the government. The fact of the matter is, if you want to be a clever, innovative country, you need to be supporting higher education, you need to be supporting universities and TAFE. You need to be supporting students—




Senator Joyce:
  I raise a point of order on relevance, Mr Deputy President. I want to make sure that Senator Milne has said that she wants to hear what we have to say. That would mean that she is not going to guillotine the debate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Joyce. Senator Milne, you have the call.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you. The point I am making, for Senator Joyce's interest, is that you need more money put into research and development, not less. We should be increasing the money. We are low in the OECD rankings of the spend. If you spend money on research and development, it flows through into jobs. There is no question about that. It also flows through into the CRCs and into small companies that are engaged in research. You get research clusters, and that is where we need to go if we are going to be a clever country that uses fewer resources and gets more from what we do. That is what you do with R&D.


I can tell you now that the agricultural sector is desperate for more R&D funding and we need more. The question now is: where is the coalition going to get the money for R&D for agriculture? Where is the coalition going to get the money to support its so-called direct action? Where is the money from Senator Joyce to pay the polluters, because that is what he wants to do? That is what he wants to do—pay the polluters. He can go back to his constituency and explain to them how he wants to take money out of the pockets of single parents, money out of the pockets of people on Newstart, so that he can pay the polluters. He can let his friend Clive Palmer and others off taxes. That is exactly where the coalition want to go, but the Greens do not.


The Greens want a more caring society. We want one where we care for the environment and care for people, and we want to make sure that we raise the money from those who can afford to pay, which is just and fair. What we need to hear from both sides is: where is the money coming from?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-02-25,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:24):  We heard before a very remarkable speech from Senator Penny Wong. It was remarkable for two reasons. First of all, it was remarkable that, on the most solemn parliamentary occasion there can be, a motion from the opposition of confidence in the government's handling of a key issue of public policy—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Collins, it may have escaped you, but the House of Representatives is not in session today.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis, please resume your seat. On my right, Senator Collins and others. Senator Brandis, you have the call.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I was simply, through you, pointing out to Senator Collins that the Senate is a coequal chamber with the House of Representatives and happens to be the only chamber in the Australian parliament in session today. It was a remarkable speech by Senator Penny Wong because, on this very important parliamentary occasion, it was the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, not the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who responded on behalf of and in defence of the government to a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in this place, Senator Abetz. One might imagine that after his blundering, inarticulate, uneducated, incompetent effort in answering questions directed to him, in particular by my colleague Senator Sinodinos, that Senator Stephen Conroy was feeling a little sheepish. Nevertheless, on a motion of this kind it ought to be the Leader of the Government who defends the government, not the deputy.


Be that as it may, the other remarkable thing about Senator Penny Wong's speech today is that the subject of Senator Abetz's motion—that is, the mining tax—was barely mentioned by her. In 20 belligerent minutes, in 20 minutes of relentless negativity, there was barely a mention of the MRRT, the subject of the motion, because Senator Penny Wong, I suspect, is smart enough to know that she cannot defend the indefensible. She might be smart enough to be unable to defend the indefensible but Senator Penny Wong has not been smart enough as finance minister to be able to deliver a budget surplus.


We sat through question time after question time over the last year with Senator Penny Wong as finance minister. Not a day went by in question time throughout 2012 when Senator Penny Wong did not refer to 'the budget surplus' as if a surplus budget were locked in stone. In fact, humiliatingly, just before Christmas the Treasurer had to admit, as the opposition had said all along last year, that there would be no budget surplus in 2012-13 and there would be just another historically large deficit. In fact, if the electoral fates cast their judgement on this government on 14 September, or perhaps sooner, and the government were to go out of office later this year, it will be the first Australian government in living memory never, never to have produced a budget surplus. That, Senator Wong and Senator Conroy, will be your legacy.


We know that the previous government, the government of Mr John Howard and Mr Peter Costello, made budget surpluses the norm. It was the totem of their fiscal discipline. In the 12 budgets that Mr Peter Costello brought down, 10 of the 12 were surplus budgets. We know that in the previous period—



Senator Thorp interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Thorp, I know you do not sit right at the top of the Labor Party tree, but the attitude you display by your interjection sums up the mindset of this government perfectly. As I said, the last government of Australia, the government of Mr John Howard and Mr Peter Costello, delivered 12 budgets and 10 of those 12 budgets were surplus budgets. I see my friend Senator Fifield nodding with satisfaction as I say that, because Senator Fifield, of course, was one of Mr Costello's senior advisers who can take some share of the credit for producing that magnificent outcome which put Australia in the best financial position in the world at the time of the change of government in 2007. 


I do not want to be unfair to my Labor Party colleagues, because there have been previous Labor governments that have produced budget surpluses, too. In the previous period of Labor government, during the Hawke and Keating governments, there were several years in which the budget was in surplus. It was a Labor government and so in most years the budget was in deficit, of course, but in several of those 13 years the budget was in surplus. In the previous period, the government of Mr Malcolm Fraser, the budget returned to surplus. It might surprise you, Mr Deputy President, to learn that during the period of the government of Mr Gough Whitlam, who produced three budgets, in two of those years the budget was in surplus—the national debt went through the roof, of course, because of borrowing, Senator Ronaldson, but nevertheless in two of the three years of the Whitlam Labor government the budget was in surplus. 


Of course, in the 23 glorious golden years of coalition government, which preceded the government of Gough Whitlam, the budget was in surplus. It might surprise you, Mr Deputy President, to learn that in the last year of the wartime Labor government, the government of Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley, the budget returned to surplus in 1949. In the prewar government of the United Australia Party, under Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies, the budget was routinely in surplus, but then one gets to the government of Joseph Scullin and that was the last time—mercifully it was only in office for three years; the government was elected in 1929—that an Australian government went out of office having never produced a budget surplus.


Mr Deputy President, you would have to have been born in 1908 to have voted for the last Australian government never to produce a budget surplus. But that, Senator Penny Wong, is your legacy. Not only is it a hopeless legacy in historical terms but it is a hopeless legacy by your own definition of your own competence, because it was your leader, Senator Penny Wong, who said that 'the test of a government's capacity to manage the budget is the test of its competence'. That is what Julia Gillard said.




Senator Wong:
  She is the Prime Minister.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry, Ms Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister—Ms Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, said 'the test of a government's capacity to manage the budget is the test of its competence'. And Mr Wayne Swan, who sits at the heart of the government's economics brains trust and whom I have known since we were university students in the 1970s—he had no brains then and his intellect has not grown in the years since—said: 'Come hell or high water, we will be returning to surplus.' These are the fiscal geniuses who went naked to negotiate the mining tax that produced no revenue. It produced many other things by the way, Mr Deputy President. It produced a prime ministerial scalp, because you will recall that it was on the basis of the mining tax that Ms Julia Gillard—in conspiracy with Mr Wayne Swan and in violation of her repeated and solemn and emphatic assurances of support and loyalty to Mr Kevin Rudd—tapped him on the shoulder in the dead of night on 23 June 2010, a day of infamy in Australian politics, and removed the elected, sitting prime minister. The mining tax did produce that historic result, but revenue, it produced nary a dollar. 


After resisting for weeks any attempt at accountability to parliament for the revenue collected by the mining tax, eventually the Treasurer relented, and the pathetic, limpid figure of $126 million turned out to be the entirety of the revenue collected by this mining tax in this financial year. Just think about it, Mr Deputy President, originally the budget projection for the revenue from the mining tax was $3.7 billion. The revenue projection was revised downward by almost half so that it became a revenue projection of $2 billion—from $3.7 billion to $2 billion to $126 million. And Senator Conroy says, 'Well, the iron ore price has been very volatile. It's gone up and down.' Yes, it has, Senator Conroy. It has gone up. The price of iron ore has gone up by $30 a tonne. The Secretary of Treasury, Dr Martin Parkinson, himself admitted to Senate estimates under questioning from Senator Sinodinos that the fault was not in the international price of minerals; the fault was a design flaw in the heart of the tax.


Let me say that again, because we heard no answer from Senator Wong put up because Senator Conroy could no longer cope. Senator Conroy, in his answer to Senator Sinodinos's question today, said, 'Well, the reason the mining tax has collected a negligible amount of revenue is because of the volatility of international mineral prices.' But Dr Martin Parkinson, the head of Treasury, told Senator Sinodinos in estimates that that was not the reason. Dr Martin Parkinson said the mining tax did not collect the projected revenue because of design flaws in the tax. 


That brings us to the obvious question: who designed the tax? Who were the fiscal geniuses who were responsible for designing this tax, the fiscal architects of this tax that was such a terrific tax that it provided a political excuse to assassinate an elected Prime Minister but barely collected a dollar for consolidated revenue? We know who they were: Ms Julia Gillard and Mr Wayne Swan. They went to the negotiating table with Mr Marius Kloppers, Mr Tom Albanese from Rio Tinto and the CEO of Xstrata, and between the five of them they designed a tax. 


Mr Deputy President, who do you think were the smartest people in the room that day when it came to designing the mining tax? Do you think that perhaps Mr Marius Kloppers, who until recently ran the biggest mining company in the world, was the smartest person in the room? Do you think that Mr Tom Albanese, who until recently ran Rio Tinto—Australia’s biggest single taxpayer, by the way—was the dummy in the room? 




Senator Fifield:
  No!




Senator BRANDIS:
  No, Senator Fifield, perhaps not. Or do you think the CEO of Xstrata was the dummy in the room—who had no idea what they were talking about when it came to minerals taxation? I suspect not. I do not want to be cynical; I do not want to be sarcastic or scathing, but I suspect not. I suspect the two people in that room who least knew what they were doing were Ms Julia Gillard, whose entire life experience before coming into this place had been as a dodgy trade union lawyer, and Mr Wayne Swan, who, as I said, I have known for 35 years. He was a dope then and he is a dope still. They came out of that room and Julia Gillard was smiling—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis, please refer to the Prime Minister using her honorific. I also suggest that it would be better if the other comments you made a moment ago were withdrawn. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  If you so rule, Mr Deputy President. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That would assist the chamber. Thank you, Senator Brandis. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Who do you think came out of that room with a Cheshire cat smile?




Senator Thorp:
  Oh, do tell us!




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am going to tell you, Senator Thorp. Senator Thorp over there from the Labor Party brains trust thinks that whether the budget is in surplus or in deficit is a matter of complete irrelevance. I am going to tell you, Senator Thorp. Ms Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, came out with a Cheshire cat smile because she knew that, whatever the hit to the revenue, she had got past a political difficulty for herself. She had got past a short-term political difficulty for the government. Mr Wayne Swan is a person of such intellectual depth that I suspect he had no idea what was going on. But the three people who I feel very certain had the biggest Cheshire cat smiles on their faces that night were the CEO of BHP Billiton, the CEO of Rio Tinto and the CEO of Xstrata, because they knew they had found negotiating partners who were, shall we say, a walk in the park. 


So who is going to suffer from this? Who is going to sufferer from the hubris, the incompetence, the ignorance of the senior ministers who negotiated this mining tax? The bottom line of the budget is going to suffer. Senator Conroy said before in his answer, 'Well, if you want to see the effect of the mining tax collections, it is in the budget bottom line.' Senator Conroy, you are right. That is the one thing you got right: it sure is in the budget bottom line, because the budget has gone from a projected surplus to a projected deficit approaching $20 billion and heading south. So, for five years out of five, we will have, on your government’s watch, a deficit budget. 


I do not want to be mean-spirited, but I have to say that I have never seen—and the Australian people have never seen—a more fiscally, economically incompetent bunch of ministers than the ministers in the Rudd government and, most particularly, in the Gillard government. And there has been nobody more incompetent, nobody less equal to the task, than the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan—the genius who negotiated this brilliant mining tax! 


If this government does go to electoral oblivion later this year—and that is by no means for sure; we go into this election as the underdog—it will be remembered as the only Australian government, in the memory of the oldest person living in Australia today, never, ever to have produced a budget surplus. That will be your legacy. That will be the badge you will wear from hereon, down the pages of Australian history for all the years and decades into the future. It was on your watch; you were the ministers who never, ever  in the life of the oldest living Australian, managed to produce a budget surplus. Yet it was your Prime Minister who said, 'The capacity to manage the budget is the ultimate test of a government’s competence.'



Opposition members: Hear, hear!




An incident having occurred in the gallery—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order in the gallery! It is inappropriate to applaud.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax</title>,MOTIONS,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (15:44):  Senator Brandis asked us who was the smartest person in the room. Well, we know the answer. Who is the smartest person in the room every day of the week? It is none other than Lord Brandis himself! What we have seen is an arrogant, contemptuous, pompous display of the attitude that this opposition brings—




Senator Nash:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President, I would ask that you ask the minister to refer to Senator Brandis by his correct name.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Nash—quite appropriate. Senator Carr, please refer to Senator Brandis as 'Senator Brandis'.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I will indeed. I was simply complimenting Lord Brandis on his approach—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, Senator Carr. You have to refer to Senator Brandis as 'Senator Brandis', thank you.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Senator Brandis has tried to present to us that he is the cleverest man and is God's gift to the legal fraternity. He is obviously the most intelligent legal mind that has ever been produced in this chamber! He is a man that is knee-deep in horsehair and can advise the rest of us about what is right and what is wrong when it comes to the question of revenue in this country, because not one word has he said about the question of the revenue that was raised by this particular tax. He argues that he is very concerned about the welfare of the mining industry when it comes to the question of the revenue stream here. He argues that it has not raised enough money; that is the claim that they are making publicly. We know what crocodile tears those remarks are, because from day one of this whole exercise those opposite have opposed the resources rent tax. They have seen it as an opportunity to go down on bended knee to the wealthy and the vested interests in this country and to argue their case that they should pay no tax. That has been their proposition: they should pay no tax. That is the principle upon which they have based their entire approach. When it comes to actually helping out Australians in these times of need, what have we seen the opposition actually do? They have voted against tax breaks for 2.7 million small businesses, they have voted against supporting the retirement savings of 8.4 million working Australians, they have fought to deprive the country of the most needed infrastructure and they have done so in order to do the bidding of the most powerful and most deeply enriched vested interests in this country.


When we look at this whole issue, we do not hear one word of criticism of any state government that is imposing revenues in terms of its capacity through the royalties system. Not one word has been uttered about this. If it is such a shocking thing to tax the mining industry, why have we not heard a word about what is occurring with the states across this country? We know that the state royalties are an inefficient tax which actually discourage investment, but there is not one word from those opposite. We know that royalties do not ensure an adequate return to the community, and it is the community that owns these resources—it is not the states and governments but the people of this country that own these resources. Of course, there is not one word about the failure of the royalties system to ensure a proper return when commodity prices are high.


The Australian government has sought to engage the states on this matter, but what we know is that the states have taken full advantage of these circumstances. The New South Wales Treasurer, Mike Baird, has announced an increase in the state's mining royalties of approximately $1.5 billion over four years.




Senator Conroy:
  How much?




Senator KIM CARR:
  One point five billion dollars over four years. He says, 'Oh, this is to offset the carbon price.' What a pathetic excuse! What a miserable attempt to hide what is clearly a tax hike based on the coal industry! What we know is that the New South Wales government's increase in mining royalties increases the risk of investment cuts and increases the level of uncertainty for businesses.


We know that in Queensland a similar pattern has emerged. The Queensland government has announced an increase in the royalty payable for the coal price at more than $100 a tonne from 1 October last year. The increase will see a jump of some 10 per cent—a 10 per cent hike to 12.5 per cent—for every tonne of coal sold between $100 and $150. Coal sold for more than $150 a tonne will attract a 15 per cent royalty. This is an increase included in the Queensland 2012-13 state budget and it is expected to raise $1.64 billion over the next four years. So what we saw in the case of Queensland is that the government's decision to raise the royalty on coal will create additional pressures operating in that state, which is already being affected by the falling commodity prices, by higher costs and by the strong Australian dollar. There is not one word over there about the impact of those charges on the coal industry.


I am particularly interested that Queensland coal operators, under the resources rent tax, do not bear a liability and cannot offset it until such time as their profits exceed $75 million. If their profits are below $75 million, that means they cannot actually claim the state royalties back. So the consequences of the changes in Queensland are that small and medium-sized miners are in fact hit with that tax. There is not one word over there about the consequences of that operation and not one word in defence of the mining industry on those matters. We know now that Queensland is the fifth state—after Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales—to increase the iron ore and/or coal royalties since the Commonwealth resources tax reforms were first introduced in May 2010. If the opposition were serious about these matters, they would have drawn attention to what has been a very substantial increase in revenues that have come from the states.


Upon coming to office, this government was faced with quite extraordinary economic difficulties flowing from the effect of the two-speed economy. We were determined to ensure that the government was able to assist people in rebuilding this country. That is why there have been record investments in health and education, record investments to build infrastructure and record investments to produce more jobs, more opportunities and more prosperity in this country. Despite the extraordinary headwinds of the international economic downturn, the economy has created 380,000 jobs, including some 67,000 jobs in the mining industry. There has been $152 billion of capital expenditure in mining, an increase of 160 per cent. There has not been one word from over there about the importance of those economic effects. Total business investment across the economy has increased by 45 per cent. There has not been one word from those opposite about the strength of the Australian economy. This government is in the business of ensuring that we, as one of the more prosperous countries in the world, are able to achieve this prosperity through having a balanced economy, not relying on resources alone but appreciating the skills and opportunities for the whole population.


That is the legacy this government has been building upon. That is why we negotiated and delivered the minerals resource rent tax. The coalition should stand condemned for their opposition to this proposition from day one. The opposition have no credibility whatsoever when it comes to these questions. The opposition have not been able to release any of the costings for their promises. They are not subject to any scrutiny, any accountability. When people had a chance to look at their costings at the last election, they left a funding gap of some $11 billion. Their approach to these issues is about covering up the fact that, in aggregate, they now have commitments of $70 billion over budget expenditure. They need to find mechanisms to cover up the inevitably savage cuts that they will be making to hospitals, schools and universities. These savage cuts will have to be endured by working people across this country.


That is what this debate really is all about. It is not about the concern of the opposition for the revenue streams that are coming from the mining industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have an opportunity here to build a better country if this parliament is prepared to seize it. But those opposite have taken every opportunity to turn their backs on fairness and turn their backs on ensuring that we are able to build a stronger economy and a more equal society. After 21 years of consecutive economic growth, Australia is now the 12th largest economy in the world. This is despite the economic crisis. 


You would have thought we would be able to seize that opportunity, build a much stronger and fairer economy and ensure that the people of this country are able to enjoy the security that comes from that sort of prosperity. But those opposite have been pursuing a policy which is really about defending vested interests. That is the long and the short of it. It is about defending those that are already extremely well-off. It is not about ensuring we have fairness built into the system. You have opposed every single measure to ensure we have a more productive economy and a fairer society. You are not in the business of ensuring the long-term reform that is needed to build the economic underpinnnings to secure the prosperity of Australia.


While commodity prices are down, the revenues from this arrangement will be down. As commodity prices improve, the revenues will improve. We should not, however, fall for a moment for the claims that have been made, the crocodile tears that have been shed, about concerns about the mining industry. I am particularly concerned about the position that is taken in the education area and the failure of the conservative governments around this country to meet their responsibilities. The royalties they have taken from coal and iron ore have been used for other purposes at the same time as we have seen massive reductions in the hospital and education systems across the country where conservative governments have been in office. To me, this is a harbinger of things to come. What we are likely to see, if the coalition are ever elected, is a government that is determined to ensure that the pandering to vested interests is accelerated but the opportunities to support the people of this country with proper education and health take a back seat. We are entitled to ask, with a motion of this type: what does the coalition actually stand for? What does it actually seek to do?




Senator Abetz:
  The abolition of the mining tax.




Senator KIM CARR:
  You say you are about the abolition of the mining tax, but are you also saying that you are opposed to all the things that flow from it? 




Senator Abetz:
  It's not funding it, you goose!




Senator KIM CARR:
  So you are going to remove the $18,000 floor from the taxation system?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Kim Carr, first of all, direct your comments to the chair and please do not interject across the table. That goes for all senators.




Senator KIM CARR:
  We have today the clear statement from those opposite that those earning less than $18,000 a year will now be paying tax under a conservative government, and the measures taken on superannuation will not proceed—




Senator Abetz:
  No. We didn't say that at all.




Senator KIM CARR:
  That is exactly what you said: 'We don't have the money to pay for it, so we're not going to do it.'




Senator Abetz:
  No. That is untrue.




Senator KIM CARR:
  That is clearly what you were saying, Senator. You were saying that those who currently do not pay tax because they earn less than $18,000 a year will lose that benefit.


That has to be understood by the clear intention that you are pursuing here today. But, if it is not your policy, I have no doubt your next speaker will make it perfectly clear that it is not your policy.


What we have to do is see what other measures are also being funded by these measures which are already built into the budget.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  Are you going to continue with them or not? Are you continuing with it or not, Senator?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order senators! We are not debating each other across the table. Address your remarks to the Chair, Senator Carr, please. You have the call.




Senator KIM CARR:
  It strikes me that what we are getting here is a little bit more than the opposition bargained for because they are now being forced to reveal what their policies actually are, and that is taking benefits off people—some of the poorest people in this country and some of the most vulnerable people in this country. There is an attempt being made by those opposite to actually defend what is indefensible. You want to support the vested interests of the multimillionaires, but you want to impose higher taxes and charges on the poorest people in this country. Is that how you are going to balance the budget? Is that your intention, to actually make people who earn less than $18 thousand a year pay tax? Because that is the clear implication of the proposition that you are advancing here today.


We know that since the resources rent tax was announced, those opposite immediately did the bidding of their billionaire mates. From day one, they have said that they will not support what they call an 'investment-destroying and job-destroying' tax. Of course we know the reality, and the reality is very, very different. This is a tax that is justified, is fair and is reasonable, and the Australian public know that. They know that they have to share the benefits of the resources boom. They do know that we have to have a system that ensures that we are able to build a future with confidence, and that we have to have measures in place so that the ordinary people of this country do get the benefits of the enormous wealth that this country produces.


The alternative is very straightforward, of course. The alternative is that, essentially, you want to increase the taxes and the charges for those who are least able to afford it. What you are prepared to do is to say that you will cut back on school kids' bonuses and you will cut back on superannuation reforms that benefit working people across this country. You will go down in history as amongst the greatest wreckers.


And you are not interested in building. This is a country that aspires to something much, much better. This is a country that aspires to genuine progress. This is a country that has a right to aspire to those things, and this is a country that will not get any answers from those opposite on these matters. We know that those opposite are really in the business of ensuring that those least able to afford it will pay the highest. And those with vested interests, who are already very wealthy, will get the benefits of your support. That is the real nature of this debate. You are in the business of defending the millionaires and taking from the poorest in this country—of cutting social security benefits, of making people on low incomes pay more tax and reducing the benefits that come to their social wage through the education system and the health system. You are in the business of undermining the infrastructure of this country and destroying the prosperity of this nation; that is quite clear as a result of your approach to these issues.


How else? How else will you be able to fund the $70 billion-black hole that is now being created in terms of your own arrangements? We know that those who are on low incomes, those who are, of course, entitled to the support of the taxation system, will be right in the firing line—right in the firing line under a conservative government. What we do know is that Tony Abbott has not changed his spots one bit because the previous arrangements—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Mr Tony Abbott, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Thank you Mr Deputy President. What we do know is that when it comes to the question of policy differences in this country, nothing could be starker. Nothing could be starker! You are on the side of the wealthy and the powerful. You want to use the state to undermine the opportunities that will ensure that the benefits are spread for the poorest and the weakest in this country. You want to reimpose that $18,000-arrangement whereby people who earn less than that will now be paying tax under a coalition government.


We know that hard-working Australians are in the firing line under Mr Tony Abbott's government, and this is a position that we will strongly argue against to ensure it does not happen.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax</title>,MOTIONS,2,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-25,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:05):  I always wonder why people get up to speak for the last 50 seconds when they have said nothing else in the previous 19 minutes and 10 seconds before it.


But anyhow, the MRRT has always been a mystery. Was that, 'Marius' and Rio's rort tax'? Or was it the, 'must-remove-Rudd tax'? What exactly was it? How did we come to this position? This was what brought about the removal of Mr Rudd with the replacement by Ms Gillard. It was all there. 


I remember the time and I remember the person, but, I can never quite remember him being elected to parliament—Paul Howes. He is not a member of parliament so what do I call him? I suppose 'Howesy'—I do not know what you call him. Mate? My mate? When 'the mate' turned up; he has never actually gone to that table and sworn an oath. He has never actually held the Bible or the Constitution in his hand. He is not actually accountable to the parliament. The Australian people have never voted for him, but somehow at the time of this mining resource rent tax—I am trying to get it right—he was instrumental in changing the makeup of our nation.


It has always perplexed me how people manage to do that when they are never actually elected to parliament. But he is back again, by the way; he is back again! The other day we heard that he has 'got her back'. I do not know if he has 'got her back' like she was lost and she has come back—he lost her down the park somewhere and he has got her back. Anyway, he has 'got her back', which means once more he is instructing the way the parliament works.


So that is Mr Paul Howes—never elected to this parliament. I must admit a man who likes to run with the fox and hunt with the hounds is Mr Paul Howes.


This is really a test on so many levels. This motion today is also going to test the Australian Greens, who in the previous week said, 'This is it. It's over. The marriage is over. We're out of the house.' Well, now it is: 'Hang on, we're back today.' They are actually supporting them. Senator Collins came down here to talk to them and Senator Conroy came down here to talk to them. And today they are going to support the Labor Party in keeping the whole thing that they said they were upset about. They will not support this motion.


I always find it fascinating when I go back and grab some of the things that Senator Milne has said. She said this at the press conference:


Labor refuses point blank to fix the loopholes in their dud of a mining tax that has only raised $126 million of a supposed $2 billion …


How true—a Daniel come to judgement! How true that is. She said it is forgoing the revenue needed for key reforms, including implementing Gonski—and you believe in Gonski, don't you?; the National Disability Insurance Scheme—now that is something that is worthwhile; Denticare; and building high-speed rail—though and I do not know about that. All those promises, by the way, add up to $365 billion over the next 10 years. They are a very rational party, the Greens! The way they were going to pay for that $365 billion was apparently out of the mining tax, but the mining tax is a dud—and today we have a motion saying that the mining tax is a dud. If this motion is passed, the government will not fail, the government will not fall over and the government will go on. So it is really just a question about the Greens: are they fair dinkum or are they hypocrites?



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  If something goes wrong, Senator Collins, you know that you should wander down here and reorganise the marriage. You have been doing that today, and others have been reorganising the marriage today. It is going to be fascinating to see if they renew their vows today for a whole new sunny outland of matrimonial bliss for the Greens and Labor—who have only been separated for a week but are back into it. So congratulations and I would like to thank you on behalf of all of us for getting the marriage back together again!




Senator Brandis:
  It's like a game show.




Senator JOYCE:
  Every time you think they are out of the house they are back in it again—'It's great; we've just been voted back into the house.' We go through this complete and utter anarchy which is this tax. Initially they had the RSPT, Kevin Rudd's mining tax, and they thought that that tax was so good and such a ripper that it was actually going to earn more than Mr Rudd's tax in the first year. Probably one of the things they said in that meeting with Mr Paul Howes—the person who is the unelected Prime Minister of Australia—when they were trying to work out why they should remove Mr Rudd was that they had come up with a better tax that was going to earn more money. The problem is that it did not—thus we are here today.


When we go through this economic work of art which is the minerals resource rent tax we see they had their base value back on 1 May 2010, if my memory serves me correctly, and then we had the market value and they would depreciate the asset from that point in time. But, pray tell, wasn't that at the end of the so-called global financial crisis that they tell us about all the time? Could it be that this asset at the end of the global financial crisis was valued so high that the depreciation of it has meant they have never earned any money from the tax? What happened to that global financial crisis? Where did it go? So quickly did it disappear. But they had as their base value the value at the end of the crisis that they kept on telling us about. Because the crisis never existed, the market value was so high that, on the depreciation of this market base value, they have never actually really been paid any money.


So all this confusion goes on. But now we have the crux of it. In this boiling cauldron of confusion, we now have the person who was deposed because of the mining tax, Mr Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, out there as 'Pop-Up Kevin' and every time something is on up pops the member for Griffith. I think the reason he is popping up everywhere is that he wants his job back.



Opposition senators:  No!




Senator JOYCE:
  I think he wants his job back. I do. I was even more confirmed as to that idea today when I saw a brilliant interview by a senator from New South Wales.




Senator Cash:
  Name him!




Senator JOYCE:
  Senator Douglas Cameron. Douglas Cameron gave a rip snorter of an interview. They asked Douglas Cameron—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Joyce, refer to Senator Cameron as 'Senator Cameron'.




Senator JOYCE:
  Sorry; Senator Douglas Cameron—as his mother used to call him for dinner every night. They asked Senator Douglas Cameron, 'Do you think the momentum is coming back for Kevin?' and Senator Douglas Cameron's reply was, 'I don't know.' But, Senator Douglas Cameron, I think you do know. I think you are counting them—'One, two, three, four, five; we're getting close.' I think you do know. I think they are counting. Then it will be Senator the Hon. Douglas Cameron, because what will happen is that he will come to the front while Senator Stephen Conroy goes right to the back. He will almost go out of the building, because he said some very nasty things about Mr Rudd. So Senator Stephen Conroy will go back and Senator Douglas Cameron will come forward. I do not know where you will go, Senator Jacinta Collins. Just keep your head down and be nice and quiet and hope it all passes over.


This is how the country is being run at the moment. There is complete and utter mass confusion. If we look at Senator Stephen Conroy, who is at the table, we are about to see a big smile. He is covering up with his hand because he does not want us to see that he knows this is true. Yes, here it comes. He can see it coming. Senator Stephen Conroy is ringing up his good wife saying, 'How much do we owe on the house and how far ahead are we on the mortgage because I think I'm about to suffer a serious pay cut?'




Senator Abetz:
  'And I hope we have enough saved up for broadband.'




Senator JOYCE:
  How sweet! So what of the people who signed off on this brilliant piece of work? There were three very clever people in the room and three other people. I will give you a hint. The three very clever people was a bloke called Marius Kloppers—he was the head of BHP Billiton—a bloke called David Peever, who is head of Rio Tinto, and a bloke called Peter Freyberg, from Xstrata Coal. They were the clever people. Then there were three other people in the room. We will not give it away totally; we will just say that their first names were Julia, Wayne and Martin. And what happened?


These three people came in and said, 'Oh, you are trying to design a tax—just hand it to us, we will design it for you.' They gave Julia, Wayne and Martin some crayons and told them to go outside and draw some pictures of flowers, or whatever, and when they came back they were told, 'Here is your tax; that will work—for us!' And we got the tax.


The one thing the Greens have got right is that they said it was a dud of a tax—and it is. But it is not a dud for Marius—it is a brilliant tax for Marius—and it is not a dud for David Peever from Rio Tinto; he thought it was a great tax. He thought it was one of the best pieces of work he had ever done. Marius had never had a better day in the office than the day he had in Julia Gillard's office. It was the best day in an office Marius had had in his life. How do you get your company out of billions of dollars of tax? You go for a cup of tea with the Prime Minister of Australia, Ms Gillard, and you will never have to pay a cent. They said that, no matter what, they would have a tax—and they got the 'no matter what' tax. It would all be hilarious except that they are running the country.


Right back to 2010 the Labor Party has been spending the money. They spent $480 million on one road around Perth—the Perth ring road. It was going to be financed by the tax. It was a regional road, by the way. Whenever they are in a corner and they are trying to get something, they put 'regional' in front of it—like the regional parliament house, the regional opera house or the regional Sydney Harbour Bridge. This was the regional ring road around Perth airport. So $480 million was to come from the mining tax for that. But the mining tax has only brought in $126 million, so there is a problem. Where do they get the money from? They borrow it. Now they are up to $262 billion in gross debt. They have crashed through the $75 billion limit, they have crashed through the $200 billion limit and they have gone through the quarter of a trillion dollar limit and now we are on our way to the $300 billion limit—all because the mining tax is a dud. But don't worry, because today the Greens will vote for the tax—they will vote for it again. Yesterday they said they did not like it but today  they will vote for it. It all makes complete sense—and they are running the country; we should all remember that.


What else have we spent this mining tax on? Apparently we are going to do the Gateway upgrade with the mining tax, and the Blacksoil Interchange. There are so many things we are going to do with the mining tax. It will be interesting to see how we do them. I remember Minister Crean telling us in an interview on ABC Darwin with Julia Christensen, though he could have said it to someone else:


But for regional Australia as a whole Julia there is significant new resources available. Obviously there's the money from the mining tax …


So it is obvious—we can do these things with the money from the mining tax. The problem is, there is no money from the mining tax. There is just a massive hole and a big growing debt and a really stupid look on the face of the Treasurer and a very awkward Prime Minister and a Leader of the Government in the Senate with a funny little smile on his face—and a very nervous man he is too—and a very happy looking Senator Douglas Cameron. And there is massive confusion.


I know I am only a little old bush accountant, but I kind of like the details. On 1 May 2010, when the mining tax came in, the price of coal was about $100 a tonne; it is now $93. The price of iron ore was around $161 a tonne; it is now about $150. The global financial crisis was almost up there with them trying to cool the planet, and they were curing us of it with ceiling insulation and $900 cheques and school halls. That was how they were going to reboot the global economy. But isn't it funny that the prices of these commodities were higher then than they are now? Surely in the middle of a crisis the prices would be low, but the prices were high. How could that be? Where did that crisis go? Where is that crisis when you need it? What happened to that crisis? We seem to be in more of a crisis now than we were back at the time of the crisis. It is rather unusual. The crisis now is worse than it was then—but, apparently, we are not in a crisis now; now we are just in a state of complete and utter anarchy.


The people who knew this included Marius Kloppers, for a start. There is that famous quote by Kerry Packer about Alan Bond. He said, 'Alan Bond turns up once in your life, and when he turns up you just have to make the most of him.' I think that was ringing loud in Marius's ears when he went in to see the Prime Minister. He said to himself, 'This lady turns up once in your life, and when she turns up you just have to make the most of it.' And they did. I would love to have been a fly on the wall as they left. They would have said, 'Let's go down the boozer and have a couple of pots and talk about what just happened then; let's talk about how much we ripped off the Australian Treasury; let's talk about how we just left them in the aisles.' They must have walked out the door and said, 'You must have gone to mass last week—how did we manage to get out of that? It was so simple.' But now we are stuck with it.


My old audit boss, Philip Charles Travers Maltby, would look at these ridiculous scenarios that people would get themselves into and would sit there quietly in the smoko room and talk about how someone got themselves into this invidious financial position, and he would say that if you did not laugh you would cry. They are the only options you have. It is like that now with this client, called the Australian Labor Party. If you do not laugh, you cry—it is just so pathetic. It is a tragedy, it is a travesty, it is a joke, it is ridiculous and it cannot go on like this.



Senator Thorp interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  Honestly, Senator Thorp, when you are ahead you should just be quiet. Now you have said something and I am going to quote you. In the midst of all this, when I talk about a surplus, Senator Thorp says it does not matter. That is the attitude that obviously permeates the Labor caucus—it does not matter if you cannot pay back your debts; it does not matter if you are hocked up to the eyeballs; it does not matter if you max out your credit card; it does not matter if you are going out the back door. It just does not matter. You just borrow more money. You go out and find people who will lend you more money and you borrow more money off them.


This cannot go on. This country cannot go on like this. This has to come to a conclusion. It is absolutely outrageous. Our nation cannot go on like this. It is hopeless; it is ridiculous. I say to Mr Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, 'If you are fair dinkum, stand up and do something for goodness sake; do not let it go on like this.' Or I say to Martin Ferguson, 'If you think you have got it, do something.' Somebody do something, because we cannot go on like this.


In the midst of this, in a few moments you are going to see one of the greatest corralling of hypocrites in the world as they stand up and vote for the tax that they, a week ago, said they were splitting the sheets over. It is just so absurd. It is just so patently absurd. It makes a farce of everything and it treats the whole of the Australian people like fools—as though they do not know what is going on. They do know what is going on. They have read this book; it is a horror story. Unfortunately, it is a horror story which we are all in.


In conclusion, the mining tax is just a manifestation of this government. It was a farce; it was premised, basically, on a lie. It was bred from the destruction of a prime minister who was voted in by the Australian people. It was manipulated by people who were, obviously, completely and utterly shrewder than those leading our government. It was done in dark corners; they did not even allow the proper Treasury representatives in to try and make sure the thing worked. Now it is going to have the imprimatur re-endorsed by the Australian Greens in a moment from now when they once more vote for the thing that they said was the biggest problem they had.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax</title>,MOTIONS,2,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2013-02-25,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:24):  Sometimes, I think about what people think of this place and what people in the gallery and those of us who occasionally listen to this place on broadcast make of all of it. After that last contribution, a contribution that treated the chamber with complete contempt and disrespect—



Opposition senators:  Where is your tie?




Senator DI NATALE:
  Completely contemptible. And now I am getting fashion tips from Giorgio Armani over there. The fact is we have a very serious motion before this chamber and it warrants being treated with some respect.


A few weeks ago, I was at a public meeting in a place called Colac. For those of you who do not know, Colac is a place in south-west Victoria. It is a place that is largely a rural community with a manufacturing industry and dairy farmers—people who are struggling to get on in life. I attended the meeting because the meeting dealt with the overnight closure of the emergency department. Colac Hospital services that regional community; it provides important services to those people. It has an emergency department staffed by number of dedicated GPs.


The reason a thousand people met on one night in Colac was because they were distraught about the thought of the closure of the emergency department in Colac. The reason the emergency department was closed overnight was that midway through the financial year, this federal government ripped $100 million out of the health system in Victoria. It was part of a broader cut—$1.5 billion over four years. The cut comes on the back of chronic underinvestment by the conservative state government in Victoria, but there is no way of sugar coating the cut by the Commonwealth government. It was a huge kick in the guts to the people of Colac. The reason that people met was because kids with asthma in their communities need somewhere to go overnight, farm workers who might suffer an injury need to be able to access that emergency department and an older person who might be suffering from chronic disease, like high blood pressure and ischaemic heart disease, needs to know that they have somewhere they can go.


Why is the closure of that emergency department relevant to this debate? It is relevant because several years ago a tax was proposed by the then head of Treasury, Ken Henry: a good tax, a tax that was essentially a tax on super profits from mining companies. It was a tax that would only be paid when super profits were made. It was a tax on mineral resources that were exploited by the mining industry, for good reason, but belonged to all of us; resources that are non-renewable—they will not be there forever. A tax that, on every level, economically, in terms of equity and in terms of meeting our sustainability challenge, made sense.


Had we had that tax, this government would not be facing the financial pressures it currently faces and would not have had to have taken that money out of Victoria's public health system or, in fact, out of hospitals right around the country. The tax that was proposed by Treasury and then put forward by the former prime minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, was a good tax, but we do not have in place because, ultimately, what we saw was a government cave into an aggressive, shameless, blatant campaign by the mining interests, who essentially got together with government representatives to stitch up a deal so that they did not face a campaign from that industry. It was one of the great missed opportunities of this parliament and the previous parliament.


What is the cost of not doing it? We heard about Newstart. We have now got more money raised by taking funds from single mothers than we have raised through the mining tax. We cannot commit to raising Newstart so that people currently living in poverty are not faced with the decision of whether they can afford to buy a loaf of bread or a carton of milk or whether they have to get their public transport ticket so that they can try to attend a job interview.


We have got the great education challenge confronting the nation. We have got the Gonski reforms—reforms that are absolutely critical—and we have no means of funding them. And of course we have got the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a scheme that is long overdue and welcomed by all parties, and yet not one of them, the government or the opposition, has any explicit ideas on how disability insurance will be funded.


We have got the issue of Denticare. We have a situation in this country where people do not go to the dentist because they cannot afford it. I am proud that through the term of this parliament the Greens did get progress on Denticare. For the first time we have a situation where young kids will be able to go to the dentist in the same way they go to the doctor, handing over their Medicare card and getting treated. That is a good thing. We have got a big investment in public dental care and for rural and regional dentistry, but we need more. We need to make sure that we address the wrong that was done when Medicare was first introduced, so that we give everybody access to dental care and ensure that it is universal and that the size of your wallet does not impact on your ability to go to the dentist.


On that point I heard Minister Albanese talking about the Greens as 'parasites' for claiming achievements that were rightfully Labor achievements. He needs a history lesson here. The government tried twice to close the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme without putting anything in its place, and it was the Greens that dragged the Labor Party to the table to ensure that we had a replacement that was going to meet the needs of low-income people and young children. So we do claim that as a Greens achievement, and rightfully so. Without the Greens, the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme would have been closed and we would have nothing in its place.


Mr Albanese also needs a history lesson when it comes to the introduction of action on climate change. This government took to the election a plan for a climate assembly, a citizens assembly. There was no action, and it was the Greens that made sure that we put this country on a footing to address what is one of the great economic, environmental and social challenges of this century. We achieved that through negotiations with the government and the Independents, and what we now have for the first time is a price on pollution. We have got a massive investment in biodiversity funds and we have also got a raised tax-free threshold so that we can encourage people into work. They are good things. They are Greens achievements in this parliament.


But we need more. We need to make sure that everybody in this country can go to the dentist in the same way that they go to the doctor. We need universal dental care. We need to address the issue of rising out-of-pocket costs for medicines. We need to do more in the area of preventative health. We have to make sure that our public hospital systems are once again the first choice for people, not the last choice. Private health insurance in this country must be a choice and not a necessity. It is now the Greens that are the party of universal health care and universal education.


I heard the Prime Minister recently talking about her party not being a social democratic party. Well, the Greens are proud to take on that mantle. We do believe in the provision of education, health care, disability insurance and ensuring that people's needs are met if they are unemployed. They are core Greens policies.


But this motion is a motion of no confidence in the government. The Greens, like the Australian community, face a diabolical choice. We have got a government that has lost its way and we have an abysmal opposition, an opposition whose policy on the important action we took on climate change is to create uncertainty in the investment community and through some magical soil sequestration program to achieve the same target they criticise the government for. They signed onto the target and yet they want to pay polluters and tax the community—an economically irrational, environmentally scandalous set of policy responses. I would respect the opposition more if they listened to those elements within their own party and were honest about it and did not try to continue with this charade of pretending to have a policy that represents action on climate change when it does nothing of the sort.


It is just like their position on coal seam gas. Senator Joyce could not face a vote on that issue because he knows that his constituents are concerned about the impact of coal seam gas in his community on underground aquifers, the environment, and the fact that somebody can come and knock on your door and say, 'We are going to put in a coal seam gas well and you can do nothing about it.'


I am worried about the opposition's policies on health. They are going to abolish the National Preventative Health Agency and Medicare Locals, important reforms that do something towards addressing the issue of prevention and primary health care. On education they are going to continue with the inequitable funding model introduced by the Howard government and, with the election of an opposition government, I fear that the Gonski reforms will be dead before they have even begun.


On Newstart, they will not commit to ensuring that people facing those terrible choices will be given some comfort through a small increase that gets them somewhere near the poverty line rather than a long way beneath it. They have made some extravagant promises—on paid parental leave, for example. Of course, the question is: how are they going to pay for it? 


This is an opposition that expect to sail into government with no scrutiny, with no-one pushing them on the revenue that it is necessary to raise in order to pay for some of these promises. The bottom line is that the Greens will do nothing to help this opposition coast into government. We will do nothing that will ensure that a backwards-looking, nasty, regressive opposition, with a 1950s view of what Australia should look like, becomes the next government of Australia. That is why we will not be supporting a motion of no confidence in the government.


In the end, government is about priorities. We need to decide what sort of society we want. Do we want to be a decent, caring, more compassionate society? Do we want a society where everybody, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born, gets a decent education, not just those who can afford it? Do we want a society where people can access life-saving medicines, have elective surgery done and not languish for hours in emergency departments, regardless of their ability to pay? Do we want a situation where people can marry regardless of their sexual orientation? Do we want a society where people who are seeking protection in this country because they face the very real threat of prosecution are granted that protection when they are deserving of it? And do we want a society that is prepared to meet the great challenge of sustainability, of ensuring our economy is on a sustainable footing going into this century?


That is the great challenge for our economy. And the mining tax was an opportunity to do just that, to ensure that we do not squander the benefits of the mining boom as we squandered the last decades under the coalition government, with very little to show for it apart from handouts and pork-barrelling, rather than ensuring that we meet the challenge of this century, which is to transform our economy so it is on a more sustainable footing and to provide the services—education, health care and a national disability insurance scheme—for those who need them That is why the mining tax represents one of the great missed opportunities of this parliament. It was a tax that, when it comes to equity, was to ensure that we get a fair share from the resources that belong to all of us. It was a tax that, when it comes to transforming our revenue base, would tax resources that will not be there forever, that will be gone, so as to ensure that not just this generation of Australians but also future generations will benefit, because it is their wealth that we are squandering along with ours. 


We are faced with some huge challenges in this country: an ageing population and the impact of the health burden on our community, the shift in chronic diseases, the fact that our PBS system needs to provide decent medicines at low cost. How on earth are you going to meet those challenges if you are not prepared to raise the revenue? How are you going to meet the challenge of making sure that every child in this country gets access to a decent education and that we do not slip further down the rankings through our performance as a nation on a range of benchmarks?


We are not meeting the challenges because we have neither a government nor an opposition that is prepared to stand up to vested interests, to take them on and to say, 'This is the sort of society we want: a society that is decent, that is caring, that is compassionate, that recognises that the role of government is to provide those things for people.' Instead, we have a government that caved in to those interests, just like it did when it came to poker machine reform and just like it has done in a number of other areas. And we have an opposition who will not even take up the challenges because they are too close to the big end of town. What we need to do is to recognise what a modern, decent, forward-looking Australia looks like. We have got to make sure we do not miss this opportunity. We do need to amend the mining tax. We have to make sure that we use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-02-25,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:43):  Listeners could be forgiven for thinking that the motion before the Senate deals with every single area of public policy other than the handling of the mining tax. Let us go straight to the point with the deception of the Australian Greens contribution. The motion before the Senate is not a motion of no confidence in the government. It is a no-confidence motion in the handling of the mining tax—a specific issue that Senator Milne herself announced at the National Press Club as the reason for ripping up the agreement with the ALP. We have given the Australian Greens the opportunity to show their colours, to show whether they actually meant it.


We now know what the Greens will do. They misrepresent the motion and by misrepresenting the motion they give themselves an excuse not to vote for it. The Australian people will see through that. They will see through the faux foot-stomping of Senator Milne at the National Press Club by the vote of the Australian Greens today. The motion before us is not about curing asthma or anything else. It is about the mishandling of the mining tax—an issue that Senator Milne addressed at length at the National Press Club.


Today she and her fellow Greens will have the opportunity to vote on whether or not she has and the Greens have confidence in the way the government handled the mining tax. By their vote they will show that Senator Milne on the national stage at the National Press Club will say one thing and do the exact opposite in this chamber. That should not surprise, because when they signed the deal with the Australian government, with the Australian Labor Party, they promised a new era of consultation, a new era when the parliament would be respected. What have they done: 150 times they have joined with the ALP to guillotine legislation through this chamber. When the coalition did it when it had a majority in the Senate, like the Greens and Labor do now, we did it on 30 occasions. It was an affront to democracy, it was an outrage, and that is why the Greens had to be given the balance of power in the Senate. Well, they were given it, and what have they done with it: guillotine five times as many bills through this place than the Howard government did. The Australian people now know that the safest place to put the Australian Senate is in the hands of the coalition, because the Greens cannot be trusted. They, along with the ALP, are the big guillotiners in this place.


Let us be quite clear as to the ALP's approach and go through them speaker by speaker. When you have no capacity to defend, what does Senator Wong do: she descends to abuse, personal abuse, vilifying individuals. It is the old hoary ALP tactic, isn't it? If you do not have anything to run with, just attack. That is what they are doing to Mr Abbott relentlessly, attacking and attacking him. Why? Because they have got no policies to sell, no record to sell to the Australian people. Let us be absolutely clear on this. The ALP's crisis management 101 agenda is attack—attack personally, attack often and avoid the topic. That is what Senator Wong did for virtually all her 20 minutes. And Senator Kim Carr, well, why would you even bother? 


But then we have Senator Milne and Senator Di Natale from the Australian Greens misrepresenting the motion. In fairness, I think they are intelligent people. I am sure they are not in need of the Prime Minister's reading lessons but they might like to avail themselves of that facility. If they were actually to read the motion that is before the Senate, they would know that it is not a vote of no confidence in the government full stop; it is a vote of no confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax. So you cannot pretend that you hate the way this was done, that it was a secret deal with big miners, but then not vote for it.


I am not sure if the Greens actually moved their amendment to the motion. I understand they have. This is it: to get rid of the no-confidence motion and put in its place:


The Senate condemns the Government's failure to put in place a mining tax which raises sufficient revenue from—


this is a clearly defined economic term that everybody will know—


the big miners—


Who are they? Enumerate them. How big do you have to be to be a big miner? As big as Clive Palmer? Sorry, that was a personal comment. Do you have to be personally big, does your company have to be big or does your mine have to be big? What is the definition of a big miner? It continues, and this is a doozy:


to fund Australia's long-term needs.


There is one thing about the mining tax that we always said, that mining goes in booms and regrettably also in busts. Therefore you cannot rely on an ongoing basis on the funding from such a tax. Indeed, in its previous manifestation it was called a super profits tax. Do those opposite honestly believe that the mining industry will continually be in a position of super profit making? Of course not. It has never happened in history; it is very unlikely to happen in the future, especially not under this government. So how can you predicate all this expenditure on it? Senator Di Natale gave us a great speech about how it could help asthmatics, people with heart issues, help education, help all sorts of areas. These are all worthy causes, but what happens when the mining boom, as it inevitably will do, turns into decline and bust? Where is the money going to come from? The Greens have no answer, the ALP have no answer, and that is why we at all times were indicating the terrible flaw in the system of the mining tax. 


It was the Greens that rushed with the ALP to guillotine this legislation through the place. They knew so well. They were not offended by Ms Gillard and Mr Swan doing a secret deal with the three CEOs of Australia's larger mining companies. But it is interesting, isn't it? Just think if we as a coalition would have sat down in secret doing a deal with mining companies on the taxation regime. It would be the end of democracy as we know it, with the need for the Greens to move a motion of no confidence in the government full stop, not only on the handling of the mining tax. It would be indicative of everything that pervades the coalition. But when their mates the Labor Party do it, not a squeak out of the Australian Greens. Today, despite their attempt to grossly misrepresent the motion that is before us, the Australian people will be a wake-up that Senator Milne just engaged in a little bit of faux foot-stomping at the National Press Club and did not mean what she said.


She did not say what she meant, because at all times she will keep this government on life support, irrespective of how bad its policymaking is, irrespective of how bad its policies actually are.


Today, having spent so much time at the National Press Club, Senator Milne has the opportunity of voting for a very simple motion which says that this Senate has no confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax. We on this side have no doubt that the Australian people have no confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax. It is obvious that Joel Fitzgibbon, the Chief Government Whip, has no confidence in the government's handling of the mining tax. There is no doubt that the leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia has no confidence in the Labor government's handling of the mining tax. We, as a coalition, agree with them, and we would invite the Greens to join with us on that basis. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Milne to the motion moved by Senator Abetz be agreed to. 


Question negatived. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that the motion moved by Senator Abetz be agreed to.




Senator Siewert:

 (Victoria) (17:02):  I move:



That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senators Brandis and Sinodinos today relating to the Minerals Resource Rent Tax.



It seems some time ago that those questions were asked. I want to make a couple of comments about what we heard today. We had Senator Conroy, who squibbed it; Senator Wong, who was squawking; we had the Greens, who again have taken it upon—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to draw the senator's attention to the question before the chair which is taking note of answers given during question time, not other matters. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  There is no point of order.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The Labor Party are obviously very touchy at the moment because the Labor Party know full well where they are positioned. At the moment, the Australian people are sick and tired of the self-indulgent behaviour coming from the Australian Labor Party. Talk about revolving doors and prime ministers. The only job those opposite and those in the other place are concerned about is their own job. They have completely lost the focus of government. Their behaviour is irresponsible. The challenges are enormous, but what do we hear day in and day out? We get leaked views from cabinet ministers and we get people in the Australian Labor Party briefing against each other. And it is all about one job—that is, who the Australian Labor Party want as Prime Minister. 


The mining tax is a classic example of why this government has completely and utterly lost the plot, but it is not just the mining tax. A litany of bad decisions by bad government ultimately is going to require at least two generations of future Australians to pay off this massive debt. We heard the extraordinary intervention from Senator Thorp today when Senator Brandis was talking about the fact that Labor governments cannot deliver a surplus. The direct quote from Senator Thorp is, 'So what?' That was Senator Thorp's response to the wanton destruction of this economy by both the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. It is quite remarkable that the budget papers still talk about $2 billion to be raised by the mining tax. We now know that only $120-odd million has been raised. The only outcome of that is that the commitments made by the Labor government can only be met by borrowing. That is the only outcome of its appalling mismanagement of this economy.


Everywhere I go, at every function, at every community event, the one question I am continually asked is, 'When will these people be thrown out?' I do not know the answer to that question. I do not know whether they will be thrown out. What I do know is that the Australian people are heartily sick and tired of what they are seeing at the moment. As I said before, a political party that starts talking about itself to the extent that the Australian Labor Party are talking about themselves at the moment has abrogated their responsibilities as a government. They have denied themselves the right to govern. They have denied the Australian people being led by a government which, at the end of the day, are concerned about their welfare, about whether they have a roof over the head, about whether they have a job, about ensuring that people will at least have some confidence that their job is secure. None of that is occurring at the moment.


How can it be that when an enormous number of Australians are concerned about their jobs and the cost of living, and are concerned about illegal arrivals— (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:07):  It seems to be very coincidental, but I often get to speak straight after Senator Ronaldson. 




Senator Ronaldson:
  You do it on purpose.




Senator MARSHALL:
  It is not on purpose actually, but it is always fun, because Senator Ronaldson likes to be very dramatic in his presentation, and he is saying that he has other commitments outside the chamber, and that is fair enough. Here we are after five o'clock taking note of answers to questions on notice, but he should have paid some attention to his leader's contribution in the last debate that we had, and I note that you have ruled, Acting Deputy President McKenzie, that we are able to talk about that last debate in this session.


Senator Abetz chastised the government for making personal attacks. I think he was getting confused between Senator Wong and Senator Brandis, because it was actually Senator Brandis who indulged himself in some of the most personal attacks that I have heard here, and Senator Ronaldson continued to carry on like that. That just demonstrates to everybody who might have been listening to the last couple of hours the double standards that are constantly applied by the opposition in all matters of debate. They criticise the government for doing one thing and then do it themselves. They have no standard nor benchmark on which to measure themselves. 


The debate we have just had was another classic example of this. We are debating a tax which the opposition do not want. They do not want it to raise a single cent because they did not want the tax at all in the first place. But they come in here and complain that it has not raised enough. They cannot have it both ways. It is just another of the many examples of the double standards applied by the opposition not only to this issue but also to every other issue across the board. They simply want to be negative about it but have that double standard. So which is it? Does the opposition say it raises too much tax or not enough tax? They do not seem to know. They seem to be quite divided on this point. They make impassioned arguments and complain about the tax not raising enough money, then very clearly say, 'We don't want it to raise any money.'


In fact, if we go back some time there were some of the most outrageous statements made by people—in fact, by the Leader of the Opposition. Do coalition members recall Mr Abbott blaming BHP's decision to put their Olympic Dam project on hold on the mining tax? That is what he said, 'Based on the mining tax,' because of the amount of money they thought was going to be raised by the mining tax. The head of BHP said at the time that that was not true and clearly it is not true now. But do you hear them complaining about that? No, because they are still conflicted about whether they want it to raise more or to raise less. 


Clearly, the minerals resource rent tax has been raising revenue, although it has been impacted by a big drop in revenues, particularly in the third quarter of this year. As commodity prices have started to pick up, we have seen an increase in the amount of revenue being raised by this tax. This brings the coalition to the problem they have most, because they do not believe that these resources belong to the Australian people for the ultimate benefit of the Australian people. What they believe is that these resources belong to their friends: the mining magnates and the people they support and kowtow to. They believe it belongs to them and that the Australian public ought not to get the benefit of the resources that can only be dug up once and can only be sold once. They believe that they should take all the profit and that the Australian community should not get their fair share. We on this side of the chamber believe not only that the Australian community should get their fair share but also that they deserve their fair share. When we have gone through a boom—as it has been and as will come again; it will go in cycles and the booms will come and go—and when the high profits are there, a share of those profits should be distributed amongst the Australian people. They are their resources and they should be spent on building infrastructure, reforms and for the benefit of the Australian people. That is what we want to do. We on this side of the chamber believe in a fair go for the Australian people and a fair sharing of the resources that we own as a community on behalf of all Australians.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  It gives me great privilege to take note of answers given by Senator Conroy today in regard to the debate we have had about the minerals resource rent tax. I think it is fair to say that this is a government that is losing the will to live but has not yet lost the will to tax, even if that tax achieves little in revenue. The coalition opposes Labor's mining tax because it is bad for jobs and bad for Australia. If the Labor Party were the party of equity and fairness, then it would ask its faceless men to roll Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan in the same way that they rolled Kevin Rudd. But Labor is not a party of equity—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order to remind the senator to use the proper titles when he is referring to members in the other House.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  Senator Smith, it is Prime Minister Gillard.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you Acting Deputy President and thank you Senator Brown for your timely intervention. What is important here is that the coalition position is not changing. We are unequivocally opposed to the mining tax and we will abolish it in government. It is good for Western Australia to abandon the mining tax, and what we know, in the current state of our economy, is that what is good for Western Australia is good for Australia.


In the debate today at question time we heard the government leader say that the tax was important for long-term reform. The government kept telling Australians that they would share the benefits of the boom through their historic reform of the mining tax. This historic reform has so far raised only a fraction of the money promised in the budget.


Labor is right on only one point—that the coalition will most definitely repeal the tax. Even the Reserve Bank has recognised that sharing the benefits of the boom occurs through jobs, through company tax and through royalties. The RBA, as we have heard today, found that soaring resource exports over the past seven years have created about 500,000 jobs across every major industry.


Not only is Labor dysfunctional and incompetent; it is divided and confused over its own position. Earlier this month, on 15 February, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, said:


In the meantime we're seeking to address the design flaw in—well, we're seeking to actually now change the design—


of the mining tax. Only days earlier, Prime Minister Gillard had told the parliament:


… the government has no plans to change the design of the MRRT.


Labor cannot be trusted on this tax nor on any other plans to tax the Australian community. In giving evidence at Senate estimates on 14 February, the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Parkinson, confirmed that the flaws in Labor's MRRT were the result of the negotiations orchestrated by the Prime Minister and Treasurer after the ousting of Kevin Rudd.



Senator McLucas interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I think this is a critical point—that the flaws were the result of negotiations orchestrated by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer after the ousting of Kevin Rudd. The Australian newspaper—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  Senator Smith, I remind you to use the proper title of members in the other place.




Senator Birmingham:
  That's 'Prime Minister in exile' for Mr Rudd.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you very much, Senator Birmingham. Later in that same week, the Australian newspaper reported:


Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson has admitted the design of the mining tax is responsible for its failure to generate revenue, not the falling commodity prices, higher currency and state royalties blamed by the government. 


In explosive testimony to the Senate economics committee yesterday, Dr Parkinson said Treasury had compiled its budget forecasts in ignorance of the real cost of concessions agreed to by Wayne Swan and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson when they renegotiated the tax in private with the chief executives of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata in mid-2010.


I think this is an important point. How critical have changing commodity prices been? Do they give the government a defence for this significant policy failure? While the government now point to changes in commodity prices, the risk of commodity price falls did not stop them from boasting at the time this tax was brought in that it would be a multibillion dollar revenue windfall. It did not stop them from putting forward a variety of programs to be funded through this tax initiative. 


On 1 November 2012, the West Australian put to rest the suggestion that commodity prices are the only cause for concern in this revenue mix-up:


He—


the Treasurer—


is now trying to create the impression that lower commodity prices are the only reason the MRRT has not delivered any revenue so far. That is part of the story, but there is much, much more.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:18):  What the opposition say is that they oppose the minerals resource rent tax, but this is merely code for supporting tax cuts for their billionaire mates—some of the richest people, if not the richest people, in the country. In government, they say, they intend to repeal the MRRT. We know what will result from that—attacking low-paid workers to provide tax cuts to billionaires. How on earth is that good for all Australians?


Senator Smith talks about how the MRRT is bad for jobs and bad for Australians. How can this minerals resource rent tax be bad for Australians when the reason we are taxing mineral resources is that they belong to the Australian people? The mineral resources of Australia belong to all of us and we should all therefore have some say in how they are used and we should all get some dividend, some benefit, from their exploitation. It should not all go to the billionaires—the ones the coalition want to give a tax cut to—but should be shared in by the Australian people. As my parliamentary colleague Senator Marshall remarked: 'Once they are dug up, that is it; they are gone. We do not have them anymore. Once minerals are dug up, they are gone.' The minerals resource rent tax is about delivering something to the Australian people. This country and its minerals belong to all of us and we should all have some say in how those minerals are exploited and we should all share in the benefits when they are dug up and sold.


In looking at the design of this tax, let us go back to minerals 101. The tax is linked to commodity prices. Because it is linked to commodity prices, if commodity prices fall, as they have over the last year, the tax revenue collected is not going to be as high. It is pretty basic. The coalition argue that the minerals resource rent tax has not delivered enough tax—but, in the same breath, they say that they would repeal the tax, that they would not have the tax. They cannot have it both ways. They do not want the tax to exist, but now, while it does exist, they are saying there is not enough of it. So what is their position? Which way do they see this? I think they are just playing politics—nothing else. It is not about the fact that we have minerals in the ground, the benefits of which need to be distributed fairly, and it is not about giving a return to the Australian people—it is simply politics. It is simply going around in a circle and talking about nothing. 


On this side of the chamber, we pursue policies which are good for Australia and good for the Australian people.


That is why we have introduced the minerals resource rent tax. That is why it is designed the way it is. When commodities are down, yes, there will not be as much revenue coming in, but when they are up, there will be and that will be returned to the Australian people.



Senator Brandis referred before to the fact that we have some failed public policy. Let us talk about the coalition's public policy—at least the things they have so far on the record. We could look at the failed public policies of the past, of Work Choices—the policy that got them out of government when the Australian people voted them out—or we could look at the current public policies, at the issue of GST. I understand Mr Joe Hockey is in my home state of Tasmania today. I have not heard one senator from Tasmania ask Mr Hockey, or anyone in this chamber, whether or not they support the coalition's policy of reforming the GST, of ripping $700 million from the Tasmanian budget. Here is Mr Hockey today, pretending he is a friend of the people in Tasmania. No-one should be fooled by that because that is exactly what they intend to do. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-02-25,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (17:23):  It is with pleasure that I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Conroy to questions asked in question time today about the minerals resource rent tax. I come from South Australia so I can tell you firsthand what this tax means to people in my state. It has reduced mining activity, which equates to fewer jobs and reduced opportunities for everybody. Do not let Senator Marshall or anybody else convince you otherwise—the minerals resource rent tax did have a major impact on the decision by BHP Billiton not to proceed at Olympic Dam on the Roxby Downs expansion. I know there has been a lot of comment that this mine's expansion would not have been directly impacted on by the tax, but the cost of doing business in Australia is what has been affected. It is about the risk of doing business in Australia and that is the fundamental problem here.


When faced with a decision on whether to invest in Australia, or to spend their investment dollars somewhere else, mining companies are going to choose to invest in a country that does not keep backflipping on its decisions and a country that does not keep introducing new taxes just because it wants to balance the books. The bottom line is that Australia is no longer seen with any confidence as a safe place to do business. In short, the sovereign risk is just too great.


That is not the worst of this tax. Even at the most fundamental level, we all know that you should not spend money that you do not have and you do not know where it will come from. You can imagine walking into a bank and saying to the manager, 'I want to borrow $200,000 to buy a house. I'm not quite sure where I will get the money from but I might get a new job in a few weeks time that pays me more.' The guy would laugh you out the door. No individual, no family, no business can simply access money when they do not have any prospect or evidence of repaying it. The government have had every chance to know that this was likely to happen with that tax. All the experts have told them that the revenue from the MRRT was highly unlikely to ever be realised. But that is the track record of the government.


This is a government that was happy to give money to parents for a kids bonus with nothing to tie it to actually spending for the benefit of the education of children. Where is the investment in infrastructure promised by this government? Where are the real tax breaks that were promised for small businesses? What has happened to the promised superannuation reform? All we have seen is a massive increase in debt—$126 million raised by the MRRT, $2 billion spent so far, $14 billion in commitments, and this is all from the world's greatest Treasurer. I think not.


It is interesting that the author of this tax, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, lost his job over this tax but not so the Treasurer. Together with the new Prime Minister, he has negotiated a tax that the mining industry basically does not have to pay. The big miners must be struggling to keep a straight face at the moment. I draw to your attention a comment made yesterday morning by Alan Kohler on the ABC: 'You've got to wonder which goose or geese paid the $126 million that the ATO collected from the minerals resource rent tax in the first six months.' If you look at some of our big miners, Rio Tinto did not pay any tax but it booked a non-cash revenue item of $1.1 billion against the MRRT. Xstrata—no revenue that we are aware of. Fortescue Metals says it is not paying anything. BHP Billiton paid $77 million—maybe they thought paying the retiring managing director more than the tax was probably a bad look.


All in all, the MRRT is a disaster, not a political inconvenience as the Treasurer has described it. Maybe the Treasurer could come to speak to the contractors who have geared up to provide goods and services in support of the mining expansion in South Australia. Maybe he can explain to these rural communities why they have not had the opportunities that were promised. This lack of regard for rural communities is nothing new from this government. I will not digress like everybody else has and talk about all the different things that have been impacted upon by this government. I will stick to the MRRT. But, by the Labor Party's own admission, straight from the Labor Party's website, the minerals resource rent tax is a true Labor reform. It is a tax that collects no money; a tax that has generated huge future liabilities for all Australians; and a tax on the back of which a huge debt for Australia has been generated. If this is true Labor reform then I reckon every Australian has every right to say that they have had quite enough of Labor Party reform.

 (17:28):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 15 February 2013, of William (Bill) Lawrence Morrison, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the division of St George, New South Wales, from 1969 to 1975, and from 1980 to 1984.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:29):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to move a motion relating to the death of former member and minister of the House of Representatives, the Honourable William (Bill) Lawrence Morrison, AO.


Leave granted.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 15 February 2013, of the Honourable William (Bill) Lawrence Morrison, AO, former minister and member for St George, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Bill Morrison came into the parliament in 1969. He had been a diplomat in the Department of Foreign Affairs for 19 years and was elected for the seat of St George. He was part of a transformation in the profile of Labor politicians that occurred in that election. Many of those new faces had a professional background and tertiary education. In many ways, they were Gough Whitlam's men, handpicked and in his likeness. He welcomed them with pride, proclaiming to the parliament in April 1970:


Forty-four per cent of honourable members on this side of the chamber were not in the last Parliament. Due to changes on this side, this is the best qualified Parliament to sit in this place in terms of academic qualifications, lay experience and public service. I have noticed that nothing stirs the personal resentment of honourable members opposite as much as the possession of qualifications by honourable members on this side. I have already noticed, for example, that the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) seems to have attracted that same sense of outrage that used to be reserved for the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson).


If Bill Morrison's diplomatic skills were welcomed in the Labor Party, his skills as a butcher, a trade he learned from his father, were once welcomed in the embassy in Moscow when he butchered a whole bullock brought in by the Argentinian ambassador for a barbecue.


He has the distinction of twice being expelled from the embassy in Moscow, in 1954 and in 1963, both times in retaliation for government actions in Canberra. Alan Ramsey last week told the story that on hearing of Petrov's defection Morrison, a young diplomat in the embassy in Moscow, bet Richard Woolcott that they would not be expelled and that he would drop his pants in Red Square if they were. They were and he did.


Bill Morrison's career in parliament was not long but it was full and impressive in its achievements. On entering parliament, he served immediately as deputy chair of the foreign affairs and defence committee, on which he brought to bear all his background in foreign policy. He also led Labor members out of the committee because of the refusal of the government to allow the committee to hold hearings and report in public, a move that was both radical and successful. Foreign policy loomed large in the years Bill Morrison was in parliament. He spoke and wrote extensively on our relations with South-East Asia and the United States, our recognition of China, our Middle East policy, our aid program—which he believed was poorly organised and poorly focused—and our defence arrangements. Having been an official Australian representative in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, he brought to the parliament an informed and critical voice about how we related to our region.


To look back at Bill Morrison's political career is to recall an era of issues fought with great intensity, with commitment and with clarity of purpose. He spoke often on foreign policy but particularly on Vietnam. It was an issue he returned to again and again and one that defined the Labor Party and separated it from the coalition. His speeches on foreign policy were always substantial, arguing legal issues and treaty obligations. But they also expressed the anger felt by many Australians about the war. How did Australia get into the war and how was it to get out of it? He supported the Vietnam moratorium. He believed the decision to go into Vietnam risked the lives of Australian soldiers and conscripts without proper cause and that Australia went into Vietnam on a lie and was extricating itself on a lie. On 14 April 1970, he argued:


It is a matter of some significance that in the several volumes of the documents on Vietnam published by the Department of External Affairs—and I have read each and every one of them—the much referred to official request from the Government of South Vietnam has never appeared.


It [Australia's contribution] was a public relations exercise, and Australian sons, brothers, fathers and husbands have died for a Madison Avenue victory.


In 1975, his anger over Vietnam was unabated. He said this:


The guilty men have raised themselves from the bloody mire of Australian involvement in Vietnam to point their fingers. But have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fraser) and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia (Mr Anthony) forgotten the appalling My Lais of the Vietnam War, the searing deadliness of the napalm bombs, the deathdealing bombs that were dropped, not only on Hanoi but also on the rest of Vietnam by the United States of America? Their memories are conveniently short. Not once did they protest, and now they talk of humanitarian principles. These men who plunged Australia into war, these men who applauded killing, these men who applauded violence, these men who supported the United States' invasion of Cambodia and of Vietnam, not once protested about United States transgressions when evidence showed that both the Americans and the North Vietnamese had transgressed the 1954 Geneva agreements. Yet they talk about even-handedness. Not once was a protest made by them. They talk also of deception and of lies. These people belong to the very Parties that lied and lied and lied to the Australian people about Australia's involvement in Vietnam.


Bill Morrison, along with former Prime Minister Whitlam and the former foreign minister Don Willesee, was a driving force for the articulation of Labor foreign policy during his years in parliament. But he was also an effective local member who fought hard for the interests of his constituents. Perhaps the issue that stands out most is his work and advocacy about Sydney airport, as a member of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. He tried, unsuccessfully, to get the terms of reference expanded to include the need for a second airport for Sydney. But he did succeed in placing limits on noise which continue to benefit those under the flight path. The restrictions and noise abatement policies still operate at Mascot. His arguments about the need for a second airport, however, say something about the political gridlock on the issue.


With the election of the Whitlam government in December 1972, Bill Morrison was made a minister—firstly, for Science, a new portfolio and the first time Science was given its own department. He worked to bring to fruition the new Institute of Marine Science in Townsville. He personally went diving on the Great Barrier Reef to examine the damage caused by the crown-of-thorns starfish and subsequently gave large grants to scientific research on the problem. In 1974, he adamantly opposed suggestions of nuclear powers dumping nuclear waste in the Antarctic. He said:


We don't know enough about the physics and ecology of the Antarctic ice shelf. There is also the problem that for 250,000 years radioactive waste remains highly dangerous to the environment.


He was also made Minister for External Territories and later, after PNG's self-government, Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to the Islands of the Pacific. This was a particularly active part of Bill Morrison's ministerial career and one of his most important legacies. The previous government had agreed to a date, 1 December 1973, for self-government for Papua New Guinea and the Labor Party concurred with that policy. It was consistent with their strong support for decolonisation and with very strong moves globally towards independence for British and European colonies in the 1960s and seventies. The United Nations, too, had asked Australia for a timetable for PNG's self-government and independence.


Under Bill Morrison's stewardship, the move to independence in PNG was orderly, considered and consultative, if perhaps somewhat rushed. He worked well with the leader of the assembly in PNG, Mr Michael Somare. Although the policy was largely bipartisan, it was not without controversy and, as independence approached on 16 December 1975, there was debate about the state of readiness of PNG. There was, at times, obdurate resistance in PNG itself, an expression of fear and conservatism on the part of expatriate planters and district offices. In answer to the criticism of haste, Bill Morrison was clear and determined. He said: 


It was generally accepted that colonies should have a right of self determination … Those of us who had observed the struggles for independence in other parts of the world didn't want the unfortunate lessons of history repeated in Papua New Guinea. Nor did we want the unity to be achieved in Papua New Guinea to be a unity based on Australia as a common enemy.


In the last five months of the Whitlam government, Bill Morrison served as Minister for Defence. It was a short-lived appointment. He began managing the transition of Defence from five separate departments to a single entity and the winding down of our forces after the withdrawal from Vietnam. But there was little time to achieve anything before the dismissal of the government by John Kerr on 11 November. 


Having won the seat of St George in 1969 by 69 votes, Bill Morrison lost it in 1975 by 56 votes; I think a more than creditable result in Labor's landslide defeat. He was out of parliament for five years. In 1980, he ran for and won the seat of St George, again supported by Gough Whitlam, who spoke in support of him at a pre-election rally. Let me quote Gough's words: 


The next Government will be the Hayden Government, which will be the greatest government since Federation—with the possible exception of one. And the next Foreign Minister will be Bill Morrison who will be the greatest Foreign Minister—with the possible exception of one.


Well, sadly this was not to be. But Bill Morrison was neither bitter nor disillusioned. Echoing a sentiment he had expressed on arriving in parliament, he said: 


I came into this Parliament with perhaps the idealistic notion that a parliamentarian had one of the higher vocations of life. I thought that we came here to represent our fellow men. I think there is no higher calling.


Bill Morrison was defence minister when five journalists were shot during the invasion of East Timor by Indonesian forces. The repercussions from this were still being felt in 2007, when he and former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam were called to the last of many inquiries into the deaths of the journalists. He testified that he had known of the shooting within hours, from cables sent to Canberra, but that he had not told the Prime Minister, who was caught up with pressing political crises—the blocking of supply and the loans affair.


Bill Morrison was a conservative on the issue of Indonesia and East Timor. He led a parliamentary delegation there in 1983 and was severely criticised for the subsequent report, stating that Indonesian control of the territory was 'final and irrevocable'. These findings were by no means unanimous. Bill Morrison supported the policy of the Hawke government for Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, despite strong opposition within the Labor Party.


In 1985 Bill Morrison was made Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, following some years after his old friend and colleague Richard Woolcott. He supported the Indonesia-Australia agreement on the Timor Gap. He served as ambassador for four years before retiring in 1989.


There is an interesting postscript to Bill Morrison's public life. He and his wife, Marty, have worked in recent years for refugees through Rural Australians for Refugees. In the course of this work they took up the cause of Mamdouh Habib and David Hicks. For them, this support was a matter of principle. Bill Morrison told a Sydney newspaper that:


… while he was still a card-carrying member of the Labor Party, his party was, like the Howard government, ""devoid of principle"" and had failed to take a stand against the jailing of Habib and the other Australia citizen still detained at Guantanamo Bay, David Hicks.


He said:


I am appalled by the performance of both Australian political parties, both parties unfortunately. I think the Labor Party, the leadership of the Labor Party, has just let this thing go on without any protest, without any active intervention.


As with Vietnam, the war in Iraq and its consequences brought out his strongest feelings. In 1973, he had quoted Richard Nixon to argue for a more independent foreign policy for Australia:


… if domination by the aggressor can destroy the freedom of a nation, too much dependence on a protector can eventually erode its dignity.


Bill Morrison was, as always, blunt and direct and passionate in support of his beliefs. His was a life well lived.


Bill Morrison died on 15 February. My sincerest condolences are offered to his wife, Marty, and his children, extended family and friends.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-02-25,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:47):  The coalition joins the government in supporting the motion of condolence saluting the service of Bill Morrison to our nation. His personal antecedents have been well covered and canvassed by Senator Faulkner. Suffice it to note that his was a story of opportunity and advancement courtesy of sound policy settings of the time.


As the son of a country butcher, he went on to matriculate at North Sydney tech and won a scholarship to study economics at the University of Sydney. After attaining his degree with honours as a Commonwealth scholarship student, Bill Morrison joined the Commonwealth Public Service as a cadet with the then Department of External Affairs.


His diplomatic service made me realise that he was someone that the coalition could warm to. You see, he was expelled from Russia not once but twice. The first time it was in relation to the defection of Vladimir Petrov. The second time it was in retaliation for Australia's expulsion of Soviet agent Ivan Skripov, who had been cultivating an Australian woman for the purposes of espionage. On this occasion, the KGB tried to recruit Morrison as a spy by ham-fistedly attempting to frame him. It is understood that Morrison had been visiting a Russian friend's house in Moscow when KGB officials barged in and told him that, unless he cooperated, the Soviet media would announce the next day his expulsion for the heinous crime of selling used clothing to his maid, something that was supposed to be illegal at the time—a heinous crime, no doubt, under the regime that some of those opposite were known to actually support. But Morrison famously told the KGB—one assumes he may have made this up himself, but if he did I salute him—to 'jump in the lake'.


History tells us that in 1969 Morrison was approached in Singapore by the then opposition leader Gough Whitlam, asking him to stand for federal parliament. As captains' picks go, it was one of the more inspired ones—I will not talk about later captains' picks—but his electoral success was mixed by virtue of the seat in which he ran. He voluntarily retired prior to the 1984 election.


Before that, the Parliamentary Library records some amazing things about Mr Morrison. He warned against the buying of coloured TVs because certain plastic elements might explode. He gave cyclones masculine names, overcoming that long-term gender discrimination against men—so he was a trailblazer in that regard. He did a number of other good things as well, but I thought that, on a lighter note, those two were worth noting.


I refer to his appointment after his retirement from parliament as Ambassador to Indonesia, where he served for 3½ years. There is one anecdote about how Mr Morrison used all his diplomatic skills to cover off the diplomatic fallout following the Sydney Morning Herald's publication of a story on the Suharto family's wealth. Mr Morrison had the bright idea of inviting Rebecca Gilling, the star of the truly improbable but highly popular Australian soap opera television export Return to Eden, to his next Australia Day garden party. Never was this event attended by so many Indonesian generals. The next day the Indonesian newspaper Kompas ran a cartoon saying that diplomacy between the two countries had 'returned to Eden'.


Mr Morrison's life was a life of service to the Australian people, and the coalition will always recognise that, even if that person happens to come from the other side of politics. The coalition extends its condolences to his widow, Marty; his daughters, Tanya and Melanie; his son, Kim; and his seven grandchildren.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator BILYK:
  I have been asked to table this petition on behalf of the Uniting Church in Australia Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, regarding internet filtering.


In 2010, prior to the last election, the government announced that the Australian Law Reform Commission would review the refuse classification category for films, computer games and publications after community concern that it did not reflect community standards. Following public consultations, the ALRC recommended in February 2012 that refused classification should be narrowed into a prohibited content category which includes illegal content like child abuse material. In line with this recommendation Australia's largest ISPs have been issued with notices requiring them to block these illegal sites in accordance with their obligations under the Telecommunications Act 1997.


Australia's major internet service providers are now required to block child abuse websites on the Interpol 'worst-of-child-abuse list'. Blocking the Interpol 'worst of' list meets community expectations and fulfils the government's commitment to prevent Australian internet users from accessing child abuse material online.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:58):  I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.


The speech read as follows—


The Small Business Commissioner Bill 2013 ensures that the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Small Business Commissioner are set out in legislation. It also provides teeth to the Commissioner to ensure he or she can effectively carry out their role as an advocate and representative of small business. 


The Small Business Commissioner must be more than a symbolic position, the Commissioner and their office must be empowered to be effective advocates for small business. This bill provides the necessary capacity to move beyond the symbolism. 


Small Business is a crucial part of the Australian economy. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics small businesses employ more than two million people; therefore they are a fundamental pillar of the Australian economy. The personal risks that people take when starting a small businesses and the challenges they face are immense. They deserve a champion at the Federal level to deal primarily with Commonwealth related issues and to complement the work of the small business commissioners in the States that have them. 


This is why the Australian Greens welcomed the decision of the Government in 2012 to appoint a small business commissioner. However this does not go far enough - currently the Commissioner has no legislated role. It has no power to ensure it can be an effective broker between small and big business. At the moment the Commissioner and their office don't have defined roles and responsibilities, the Commissioner can channel their office's resources and energy in whatever direction they choose.


Therefore legislation for the office of the small business commissioner is crucial to ensuring roles are defined and the Commissioner has the power to be effective. 


A legislated position will also make it more difficult for an incoming Government to abolish the position as happened recently in Queensland when the Newman Government abolished their Small Business Commissioner. 


The roles and responsibilities of the Small Business Commissioner as described in the bill cover a range of areas including assisting in dispute resolution and investigating complaints from small businesses about their commercial arrangements with Departments, Statutory Agencies or Executive Agencies of the Commonwealth. A recurring theme from small businesses that conduct business with Commonwealth Departments is the unnecessary complexity involved in winning and adhering to Government contracts. Some small businesses also claim that Commonwealth Government bodies can be particularly slow in paying their bills.


As cash flow is integral to a small business, delayed payments of bills can be quite destructive. In many ways just as crucial to small business owners is the time they use in following up late payments. This is time they can't use to grow and develop their business. 


Government agencies and departments should adhere to best practice in dealing with small businesses and many do. However for those who don't, small businesses will be able to contact the Office of the Small Business Commissioner for assistance and representation in their business dealings with Commonwealth Departments and Agencies. 


The Office of the Small Business Commissioner has the power to bring representatives of Commonwealth Departments and Agencies to the table to facilitate conflict resolution with a small business. Subject to constitutional constraints it also allows the Commissioner to facilitate resolution between larger businesses and small businesses. If Departments or businesses fail to attend in front of the Commissioner or provide documents as requested this Bills allows for the application of financial penalties. Based on my understanding of the operation of the small business commissioner in South Australia I anticipate that businesses will willingly attend resolution and mediation sessions with the Small business commissioner. Therefore the power is there to be used if necessary, but I hope it will be used minimally, if at all.


The Small Business Commissioner Bill also requires the Commissioner to monitor, investigate and report to the Minister on market practices that may adversely impact small businesses. This will provide a dedicated office of people who can undertake research and monitoring of issues and market practices that are key to the operation of small business and provide reports to the Minister for Small Business. The office of the Commissioner will also be able to prepare information for small business about entering into commercial arrangements with Commonwealth Departments.


This bill vests a research function within the Office of the Small Business Commissioner. This will ensure research on small business trends and growth is available to policy makers through an annual report. I also hope that research into the size and structure of the small business sector and emerging trends is carried out to help policy makers to better understand the sector. 


The Bill provides for cooperation between small business commissioners in the states and territories and other relevant Government agencies and the Commonwealth Small Business Commissioner on a voluntary basis in respect of any dispute that has national ramifications. I would think that the expertise and advice of a Federal Small Business commissioner would be valued across the country. I would also like to take this opportunity to call on the states and territories without small business commissioners – including my home state of Tasmania – to strongly consider their introduction.


The architecture is already in place. As previously outlined the Minister has appointed a Small Business Commissioner who started work in January. This Bill is not intended to undermine this position; its intention is to strengthen it. This Bill provides for a seamless transition, it explicitly states that the person known as the Federal Small Business Commissioner should be appointed as the first Small Business Commissioner once the legislation receives Royal Assent. 


Small businesses are a major contributor to the Australian economy and therefore employment. They deserve their own advocate and the legislation to back them up. This will help ensure small businesses are at the forefront of economic policy discussion and development in Australia. 


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:04):  I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the ministerial statement regarding Afghanistan.


Leave granted. 




Senator MILNE:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I note with interest that the minister says:



Australia must continue to be clear-sighted about our objective in Afghanistan.



But that is the problem: Australia has not been clear-sighted about our objective in Afghanistan for quite some time. 


There is no more grave responsibility or decision by any country's leader than to choose to send young men and women to war to risk their lives for our country. As Major-General Cantwell said in his book, which was published last year:


We need to have a crystal clear understanding of why we're getting into the fight, how long for, what we hope to achieve, how we will leave, and what conditions might prompt us to change strategy—this has let us down in Afghanistan. Human beings die as a result of warfare.


I want to come to the Australian government's decision to now be engaged in the transition out of Afghanistan. In particular, the minister said in his statement:


Our objective is to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for terrorists.


He then went on to talk about the transition and said:


Australia will continue to remain firm in our support to Afghan security forces and firm in our commitment to the transition strategy that Australia and the international community, acting under a United Nations mandate, have agreed to implement.


The point that I wanted to discuss tonight in particular is the situation of women in Afghanistan. As one such woman said recently:




You can't have a secure Afghanistan unless Afghan women are safe. The knowledge that there is a comprehensive plan to secure women's safety is what will enable Afghani women to actively participate in public life and shape their country's future.



Unfortunately, the Australian government has no such comprehensive plan. In Minister Smith's latest statement to the parliament, women are mentioned three times and only in relation to Australia's service men and women.


Not once are the women of Afghanistan mentioned in the government's statement of transition out of Afghanistan. Of course I support the references to supporting Australia's service men and women with as much capacity as we have, particularly servicing their physical and mental health needs on their return. But the women of Afghanistan deserve our consideration. 


Not once in the seven statements made to parliament or two speeches to NATO and ISAF has the minister ever talked about the vital importance of securing women's rights during the transition for the future prosperity of Afghanistan. And this is despite the fact that his department has signed up to the Australian National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2012-2018 to support, and I quote, 'capacity building for women in fragile conflict or post-conflict settings', and for 'putting in place specific strategies to promote the participation and protection of women and girls'. There is no sign of any concrete implementation.


The minister's latest statement is focused on improvements in Afghanistan. For an honest assessment, it is just as important as discussing the data that shows deterioration. Violence against women is one of these crucial indices of progress, but it is not mentioned. The Afghanistan Independent Humans Rights Commission recorded 4,010 cases of violence against women in 2012, up from 2,299 in 2011. Perversely, this may be a sign of empowerment because more women are finding their voice to publicly register their humiliation. But what its absence from the minister's statement highlights is that women's rights are not seen as a guiding priority of Australia's involvement. The Greens find that shameful. We must make women's rights in Afghanistan a key component of Australia's contribution during this transition. 


The Afghan Australian Development Organisation, a fantastic NGO established through the hard work and dedication of Nouria Salehi, empowers women in Afghanistan through funds raised in Australia. They provide vocational training and literacy programs for women and young people in Kabul and nearby villages, as well as accredited formal training programs for science teachers. Back in Australia they assist Afghanis to settle into Australia and overcome the trauma experienced both in their home country and in our detention centres. They are a member of ACFID and have a local office in Afghanistan to support local community development. 


Last month, a delegation of 50 eminent Afghan MPs and Afghani Australian civil society leaders came together to develop recommendations for the Australian government. They then briefed both the government and the opposition spokeswoman, in that case Julie Bishop, on the overarching recommendations. The first one was that Australia use its place on the UN Security Council to ensure that women, peace and security provisions are entrenched in all resolutions dealing with Afghanistan. Most importantly for the purposes of the minister's statements is the upcoming mandate for NATO ISAFin October 2013. I would like to put the government on notice. It is essential that Australia use its place on the Security Council to highlight the role of women and to make sure that they are there in the peace and security provisions.


Secondly, make Afghanistan a priority country for national action plans for women, peace and security, with each government department implementing and monitoring a plan accompanied by a budget measure starting this May. You cannot say that you are serious as a government on national action plans for women, peace and security if you are not prepared to put a figure against it in the case of women in Afghanistan. Thirdly, the recommendation was that AusAID make gender equality the priority for their new country strategy, particularly focusing on the development within Afghan institutions and women's organisations. 


Certainly, the Greens support those recommendations. Why would we not provide support to Afghanistan to achieve 25 per cent representation of women at elected bodies as per the Afghanistan Constitution, as well as achieve 30 per cent representation of women in leadership in all government bodies as per Afghanistan's commitment to the Millennium Development Goals by 2020? Why would we not provide direct technical and capacity building support to women to facilitate their involvement at the table in the peace and reconciliation process? Women's presence is not enough to meaningfully participate; women need an enabling environment and capacity building support both at the national and at the provincial levels.


When we ensure the exit of combat troops, we need to make sure that that is matched by increased support to gender sensitivity training and mentoring of the Afghan National Army, in particular the Afghan National Police. The Australian security sector training and mentoring should specifically focus on Afghan laws that protect women, human rights law and gender sensitive reforms. We must provide funding to the forces in Afghanistan after the main withdrawal of international troops to make sure that we build the Afghanistan National Security Forces' capacity to implement laws that protect women. We need to make sure that we support increased participation of women in the Afghan National Security Forces in high-level and local level decision making and especially the National Security Council.


I cannot see why we would not, in Australia, also make sure that we continue to support and resource the increased participation and access of women and girls to education through literacy and accelerated learning programs. Of course, we should focus on eliminating violence against women in Afghanistan by supporting Afghan civil society in the elimination of violence against women in law in Afghanistan.


I put on the record my disappointment that the minister has not, again, mentioned the plight of women in Afghanistan in this transition. If we are serious about having a plan which secures Afghanistan in the long term then we must protect the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan to participation and education, and we must use some of our aid budget and our transition money to that end. I think we could expect from the government some outspoken support in the UN Security Council. Australia has now got a unique position in the UN Security Council to raise and support this issue of empowerment of women in Afghanistan.

The response read as follows—



GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE PARLIAMENTARY .JOINT COMMITTEE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INQUIRY INTO COMMONWEALTH UNEXPLAINED WEALTH LEGISLATION AND ARRANGEMENTS


In February 2010, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act2010 (Cth) introduced provisions for the making of unexplained wealth orders into the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the POCA).


These laws are designed to target senior organised crime figures who often derive large profits from illegal activity but distance themselves from the commission of actual offences.


On 19 March 2012, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (PJC-LE) handed down the final report on its Inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements.


The Government would like to thank the PJC-LE for its comprehensive examination of the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws.


The Government has accepted 15 of the Committee's 18 Recommendations (either wholly or in part).


Organised crime is motivated by the huge profits that can be made through illegal activity. The Government is committed to ensuring that it has strong laws to target the criminal economy; not only removing the proceeds of crime, but also preventing its reinvestment into further criminal activity.



Recommendation 1:



That the objects of the POCA be amended so as to include a statement about undermining the profitability of criminal enterprise, including but not limited to serious and organised crime. Such a statement should be drafted in such a way to avoid causing unnecessary complication of unexplained wealth proceedings.




Noted



While the Government agrees that one of the key purposes of unexplained wealth laws is to undermine the business model of serious and organised Crime by eliminating criminal profits, the Government considers that this is sufficiently captured by the objects currently listed in section 5 of the POCA.


In particular, paragraphs 5(a), (ba) and (d) provide that the purposes of the POCA include:


depriving persons of the proceeds of offence and other benefits, the instruments of offences and benefits derived from offences


depriving persons of unexplained wealth amounts that the person cannot satisfy a court were not derived from certain offences, and


preventing the reinvestment of proceeds, instruments, benefits, literary proceeds and unexplained wealth amounts in further criminal activities.


The Government considers that it is important that the objectives of the POCA are framed broadly in a way that does not restrict the circumstances in which the laws may need to be used in the future.



Recommendation 2:



That the Commonwealth Government explore the possibility of amending legislation to allow the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) Board to issue a determination on unexplained wealth, so as to enable the ACC to use its coercive powers to provide evidence in support of unexplained wealth proceedings.




Agree



The Government will consider the feasibility of allowing the ACC to use its coercive powers in support of unexplained wealth proceedings, as well as whether there would be a need for the ACC Board to issue a new determination for this purpose.



Recommendation 3:



That the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (ACC Act) and the POCA be amended as necessary to make clear that the ACC's examination material can be used as evidence in proceedings under the POCA.




Agree 
in principle



The ACC Act already enables the use of ACC examination material in proceedings under the POCA. Section 12 of the ACC Act allows for evidence that would be admissible in confiscation proceedings to be shared with a relevant law enforcement agency.


Subsection 30(5) of the ACC Act also provides that an answer, document or thing given in an ACC examination can be used in confiscation proceedings.


As such, the Government does not consider that it is necessary to amend the ACC Act or the POCA.



Recommendation 4:



That the POCA be amended so as to enable an ACC examiner to conduct examinations in support of unexplained wealth proceedings after a restraining order has been made by a court.



Noted



While it might be possible to legislate to allow a court to enable an ACC examiner to conduct examinations in support of unexplained wealth proceedings, where the ACC examiner had discretion as to whether to conduct an examination, such a change would raise complex issues, including judicial power issues.


The Government notes that the POCA already contains extensive examination provisions which allow for the examination of any person about the affairs of


(a) a suspect


(b) a person who has an interest (or claims an interest) in property, and 


(c) the spouse or de-facto partner of either of the above.


A significant number of examinations have previously been conducted under the POCA. There is no evidence to suggest that the POCA examination provisions are deficient or ineffective.


In light of the above, the Government does not intend to amend the POCA at this time.


That said, the Government agrees with the PJC-LE's observations that there are advantages in the expertise and knowledge of the ACC being able to be actively utilised during proceeds of crime investigations relating to serious and organised crime. The Attorney-General's Department will work with the ACC to further explore the option of ACC examiners becoming approved examiners under the POCA.



Recommendation 5:



That search warrant provisions of the POCA be amended so as to allow for the collection of evidence that is relevant to unexplained wealth provisions. The committee's preferred means of amending the provisions would be to amend:


 Subsection 228(1) to enable material that is relevant to an unexplained wealth proceeding to be seized during execution of a search warrant; and


 Subparagraph 228(1)(d)(iii) to remove the requirement that the evidential material relate to an indictable offence.




Agree



The Government has introduced the Crimes. Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 containing amendments to ensure that material relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings can be seized when searching premises under a warrant.



Recommendation 6:



That the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce be prescribed as a taskforce under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and associated regulations.




Agree



In December 2011, the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce was prescribed as a Taskforce under the Taxation Administration Regulations 1976 to allow the disclosure of taxation information to the Taskforce for law enforcement purposes.



Recommendation 7:



Amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 so as to allow the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to use information gained through telecommunications interception, in the course of joint investigations by taskforces prescribed under the Taxation Administration Act 1953, for the purpose of the protection of public finances.




Noted



The ability to use intercepted information for an agency's own purposes is currently limited to interception agencies (law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies) that are investigating prescribed offences (generally a serious offence or an offence punishable by imprisonment for a period of at least 3 years). Section 67 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (TIA Act) only allows the ATO to deal with existing intercepted information in order to assist with investigations being conducted by these agencies. Currently, the ATO cannot subsequently use this intercepted information for its own investigations or tax assessments, and cannot request interception information for the ATO's own purposes.


While the Government agrees in principle that amending the information sharing provisions in the TIA Act will allow agencies to more fully cooperate, appropriate limitations on the use of existing intercept information will also need to be assessed. To enable appropriate consideration of this recommendation, the Attorney-General's Department has sought advice from the ATO on how the ATO proposes to use existing intercepted information in its taxation assessment taskforces, including the offences the ATO wishes toinvestigate using intercepted information. The Department will continue to liaise with the ATO on this issue. This issue has also been raised by the ATO in its submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's inquiry into potential reforms of national security legislation, which is considering reforms to the Commonwealth's telecommunications interception regime, among other issues.



Recommendation 8:



That the POCA be amended so as to eliminate the requirement for authorised officers to meet an evidence threshold test for a preliminary unexplained wealth order where the evidence threshold test for a restraining order has already been met. Any amendment should recognise the need to be able to update an affidavit to reflect new evidence as appropriate.




Agree 
in principle



The Government will consider options for improving the process for seeking preliminary unexplained wealth orders to reduce duplication where relevant requirements have already been met at the restraining order stage.


Any amendments will ensure that any additional information that is uncovered after the affidavit for the restraining order has been sworn is still taken into account when the preliminary unexplained wealth order is sought.



Recommendation 9:



That provision be made for extending the time limit for serving notice of a preliminary unexplained wealth order to accommodate extraordinary circumstances.




Agree



The Government has introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 containing amendments to the POCA to enable a court to extend the time limit for serving notice of a preliminary unexplained wealth order where the court considers it appropriate to do so.


Extending the time limit for giving notice of an application for a preliminary unexplained wealth order will make the provisions more flexible in circumstances where it is not possible for notice to be given within seven days of an application being made. For example, this may cover situations where a suspect is attempting to avoid service of the notice or is temporarily absent from the jurisdiction. A court will have the discretion to extend the time limit for serving notice, which will ensure that extensions are only granted in appropriate circumstances.



Recommendation 10:



That legal expense and legal aid provisions for unexplained wealth cases be harmonised with those for other POCA proceedings so as to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses.




Agree



The Government has introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill containing amendments to the POCA to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses.


The ability of a person to dispose of restrained property to meet their legal costs weakens the effectiveness of the unexplained wealth provisions by allowing the wealth suspected to have been unlawfully acquired to be used to contest proceedings. This may lead to fewer assets being available for confiscation if an unexplained wealth order is successful.


A person who is subject to a restraining order will continue to be entitled to representation by a legal aid commission.



Recommendation 11:



That the enforcement provisions for unexplained wealth orders include an ability to create and register a charge over property that has been restrained by the court to secure the payment of an unexplained wealth order.




Agree



The Government has introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 containing amendments to the POCA to enable a charge to be registered over restrained property to secure the payment of an unexplained wealth order. This amendment will improve the enforcement of unexplained wealth orders by ensuring that restrained property can be used to satisfy an unexplained wealth order if a person does not pay an unexplained wealth amount.  ·



Recommendation 12:



That the court's discretion to make a restraining or preliminary unexplained wealth order under subsections 20A(1) and 179B(I) of the POCA be removed in cases where the amount of unexplained wealth is more than $100 000, so that the court must make the order in cases over $100 000.




Agree



The Government has introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 containing amendments to the POCA to remove a court's discretion to make a restraining or preliminary unexplained wealth order where the amount of unexplained wealth is suspected to be more than $100 ODO. This will provide greater certainty to parties litigating unexplained wealth matters and is consistent with the approach to other types of POCA orders.



Recommendation 13:



That the court's discretion to make an unexplained wealth order under subsection 179E(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 be removed where the amount of unexplained wealth is above $100 000, so that the court must make the order in cases over $100 000, and that the following additional statutory oversight arrangements be made:


law enforcement agencies must notify the Integrity Commissioner of unexplained wealth investigations;


the Ombudsman must review and report to Parliament the use of unexplained wealth laws in the same way that Ombudsman does for controlled operations; and


the oversight by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement be enhanced so that in addition to appearing when required, that the ACC, AFP, DPP and any other federal agency or authority must brief the committee on their use of unexplained wealth provisions as part of the committee's annual examination of annual reports of the ACC and AFP.




Agree in part



The Government will introduce amendments to the POCA to remove the court's discretion to make an unexplained wealth order where the amount of unexplained wealth is above $100 000. This will provide greater certainty to parties litigating unexplained wealth matters and is consistent with the approach to other types of POCA orders.


The Government agrees that oversight of unexplained wealth powers is important.


The Government will put measures in place to ensure that unexplained wealth investigations and litigation is appropriately reported by enhancing the PJC-LE's oversight of agencies' use of the unexplained wealth provisions, including by requiring the ACC, AFP and any other relevant federal agencies to report annually to the Committee on the number of unexplained wealth investigations and any proceedings that they have conducted. The PJC-LE will have the power to examine relevant agencies on these reports.


The Government does not propose requiring law enforcement agencies to report unexplained wealth investigations to the Integrity Commissioner or requiring the Ombudsman to review and report to Parliament on the use of unexplained wealth laws.


The Integrity Commissioner is already empowered to review any allegations of corrupt conduct by law enforcement agencies, including in relation to unexplained wealth. However, the Integrity Commissioner does not have a monitoring role in relation to law enforcement tools more generally. As such, requiring agencies to notify the Integrity Commissioner of unexplained wealth investigations would be a significant departure from the Integrity Commissioner's current role and of limited utility unless this information was specifically linked to corruption issues.


The Commonwealth Ombudsman can also already receive complaints about, or conduct investigations by his or her own motion into, the actions of AFP members or the policies, practices and procedures of the AFP in relation to unexplained wealth provisions. Consequently, it is not considered necessary for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to be required to report to Parliament on the use of unexplained wealth laws.


Unlike controlled operations and other types of covert investigation powers, unexplained wealth proceedings are heard and determined by a court. As such, unexplained wealth proceedings are able to be contested by an affected person. This ensures that there is independent judicial oversight of how unexplained wealth proceedings are conducted.



Recommendation 14:



That the Commonwealth Government take the lead in developing a nationally consistent unexplained wealth regime.




Agree



The Government supports the development of a nationally consistent unexplained wealth regime. While there are a number of ways that nationally consistent unexplained wealth laws· could be achieved, the Government considers that the most effective way is through a referral of powers.


The Attorney-General raised a possible referral of powers with her State and Territory counterparts at meetings of the Standing Council on Law and Justice on 13 April 2012 and 5 October 2012.  ·



Recommendation 15:



That the Australian Government seek a referral of powers from the states and territories for the purpose of legislating for a national unexplained wealth scheme, where unexplained wealth provisions are not limited by having to prove a predicate offence.




Agree



The Attorney-General raised a possible referral of powers from the States with her State and Territory counterparts at meetings of the Standing Council on Law and Justice on 13 April 2012 and 5 October 2012.


The Government notes that the precise scope of any national unexplained wealth scheme would need to be considered carefully having regard to constitutional limitations.



Recommendation 16:



That the Commonwealth Government actively participate in efforts to establish international agreements relating to unexplained wealth.




Agree



The Government will explore the potential to establish international agreements on unexplained wealth with suitable partner countries, as part of its broader agenda to improve international cooperation in relation to criminal asset confiscation matters.



Recommendation 17:



That the Commonwealth Government create and commit to a plan for the development of national unexplained wealth scheme including the following elements:


identification and implementation of short-term measures including cooperation with states with existing unexplained wealth legislation;


negotiation with States and Territories to create or improve supporting mechanisms such an equitable sharing programs and mutual assistance agreements;


development of agreed guiding principles around unexplained wealth; and


a final objective of achieving a referral of powers from States and Territories to enable the Commonwealth to legislate for an effective and nationally consistent unexplained wealth scheme.




Agree



The Government supports the development of nationally consistent laws for dealing with criminal organisations and the confiscation of criminal assets, to ensure that no jurisdiction becomes a safe haven for serious and organised crime.


As noted above, the Attorney-General raised a possible referral of powers from the States with her State and Territory counterparts at meetings of the Standing Council on Law and Justice on l3 April 2012 and 5 October 2012.


The Government will work with the States and Territories on measures to improve cooperation on the confiscation of criminal assets, including the implementation of equitable sharing programs and mutual assistance provisions in all jurisdictions, as well as the development of guiding principles around unexplained wealth.


This will build on measures agreed to by the then Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in December 2010 to enhance cooperation in targeting the proceeds of organised criminal groups.



Recommendation 18:



That the Commonwealth Attorney-General immediately place the issue of harmonisation of unexplained wealth laws on the agenda of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice.




Agree



As noted above, the Attorney-General placed unexplained wealth on the agenda for the Standing Council on Law and Justice's meetings on 13 April 2012 and 5 October 2012.

The response read as follows—



GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE PARLIAMENTARY .JOINT COMMITTEE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INQUIRY INTO COMMONWEALTH UNEXPLAINED WEALTH LEGISLATION AND ARRANGEMENTS


In February 2010, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act2010 (Cth) introduced provisions for the making of unexplained wealth orders into the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the POCA).


These laws are designed to target senior organised crime figures who often derive large profits from illegal activity but distance themselves from the commission of actual offences.


On 19 March 2012, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (PJC-LE) handed down the final report on its Inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (20:22):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the responses by Minister Bob Carr to resolutions of the Senate in relation to malaria, and global hydro fluorocarbons phase-out; and access to sanitation.


Leave granted.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The responses from the Foreign Minister, Mr Bob Carr on these two resolutions of the Senate were quite informative. The response about water and sanitation contained useful information—the amount of money that Australia is spending; there will be an estimated $1 billion spent on water, sanitation and hygiene activities from 2012 to 2016—and the needs of women in particular are clearly noted.


It is worth noting that is estimated that less than 50 per cent of the people across Africa have access to improved sanitation. That certainly is, in part, a good news story. But there is something that needs to be noted here, because it is a disturbing trend that could continue—that is, the aid budget to Africa has now decreased.


The situation that we now find ourselves in is that the Australian government has chosen to divert $375.1 million of ODA money. And, yes, I know it can still be classified as ODA, but it is not going to the many programs that communities in many low-income countries were expecting. That money is going to detention centres in Australia. In Africa, where there is a clear need for much more money to be spent on water and sanitation programs, we see that there has been a decrease in money in sub-Saharan Africa of $34.9 million. When you look at all of Africa, it is even more than that. I think that is a very disturbing trend.


With regard to the minister's response about malaria and some of the global funding issues, again there is some good news there. What we read is that there is more money now being allocated for malaria programs. There was a very good initiative that AusAID undertook at the end of 2012, with a very large conference; the government committed more money. That is particularly welcome news because of the growing challenge of how to contain drug-resistant malaria. Again, there is a lot of good news in this.


However, when you look at the funding for Pacific countries, you see the drop in the amount of money that has just been announced, again because of this shift of $375.1 million into programs in detention centres in Australia. For the Pacific we are seeing a drop in ODA of $51.4 million.


That becomes very serious for a country like Papua New Guinea which has a very high rate of malaria. It is estimated that 90 per cent of the PNG population is at risk of malaria and about 1.9 million cases are reported every year. There is a similar trend across the Pacific and there is increasing concern that with climate change we will see more cases of people diagnosed with malaria. Malaria has always been endemic in parts of Papua New Guinea and the Pacific. With the changing impact on ecosystems because of climate change impacting on humidity, higher temperatures and rainfall levels we could see malaria zones in the Pacific increase. 


I think that puts an added burden on Australia not to divert our aid money in this way but rather to ensure that we allocate more money for the people of this region. Yes, it was good news that the conference was held and the allocation was made. But it was bad news that overall the ODA—the Overseas Development Assistance—budget has been cut by such a sizeable amount to countries in the Pacific.

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



I am pleased to be introducing this Bill today as a clear step forward towards holding a successful referendum to change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


This Bill will establish an Act of Recognition, acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples of our nation. 


The Gillard Government is committed to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. 


We want meaningful reform that reflects the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and unites our nation. We believe the Australian Constitution should:


recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their unique history, culture and connection to this land;


reflect our country's fundamental belief in the importance of equality by removing all references to race; and


acknowledge additional effort is needed to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in this country.


And we are committed to achieving this. 


We appointed an Expert Panel to develop options for constitutional change and work out how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the Constitution.


The Expert Panel consisted of a range of respected and accomplished individuals, including Indigenous and community leaders, constitutional law experts and parliamentary members. 


In bringing forward this Bill, the Government again thanks the Expert Panel, including co-chairs Mr Mark Leibler and Professor Patrick Dodson, for their dedication and tireless work. They have helped build a strong foundation for change.


We also thank the Australian Human Rights Commission, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples and Reconciliation Australia – and the many organisations and individuals who lodged submissions, participated in consultations or helped the Expert Panel with their research.


Throughout 2011, the Expert Panel led a wide ranging national public consultation and engagement program.


They talked to more than 4,600 people, in more than 250 meetings in 84 locations across the country, and received more than 3,500 submissions. 


The panel also sought extensive advice from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and constitutional experts, and gathered data through research and surveys.


The Government was pleased to receive the Expert Panel's findings in January this year.


For the first time, we now have specific proposals on how to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution. 


The Government agrees with the Expert Panel on the importance of holding a referendum at a time when it has the most chance of success.


We do not underestimate the challenge of achieving nation-wide consensus. Change will not happen without support from across the political spectrum and the support of the majority of Australians. 


And we are working with local organisations to build a movement for change.


The Government is investing $10 million to help build public awareness and community support for change. This important work is being led by Reconciliation Australia, supported by a reference group of business and community leaders. 


This funding is supporting community groups and activities across the country, giving Australians the opportunity to learn more about constitutional recognition. 


We do recognise that there is not yet enough community awareness or support for change to hold a successful referendum at or before the next federal election.


The Act of Recognition that will be established by this Bill will continue to help build the momentum we need for successful constitutional change.


The Act of Recognition will largely reflect the introduction to recommendation 3 of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians.


The Act makes a clear statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first inhabitants of Australia, and acknowledges their unique history, culture and connection to their traditional lands and waters.


To allow all of us here in this Parliament to show our support for these truths. 


And through our support, to build awareness and support in the wider community.


To maintain momentum towards a referendum, a sunset provision in the Bill limits the effect of the Act to two years. The sunset date ensures that legislative recognition does not become entrenched at the expense of continued progress towards constitutional change. 


The sunset provision will provide an impetus for a future Parliament to reassess how the campaign for change is travelling, and the appropriate timing for a successful referendum.


The Bill also provides for a review to consider and advise a future Parliament on proposals to submit to a referendum, based on the work already done by the Expert Panel. The review will identify which of those proposals are likely to receive the support of the Australian people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


A report from the review will be given to the Minister by six months before the sunset date of the Bill and be tabled in Parliament.


The report will also set out a process for Parliament to consider the next steps towards the ultimate goal of constitutional recognition.


It is important to recognise that this Bill is not a substitute for constitutional recognition. Legislation is not the appropriate forum to address all of the recommendations of the Expert Panel for constitutional change.


We are pleased that there is a strong commitment across the Parliament to supporting this Bill. 


We know how crucial cross-party support is to the success of a referendum. We all share the determination to make sure that we continue to build momentum towards a successful referendum that unites and strengthens our community. 


It is in this spirit that the Government has agreed to establish a Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. 


The Committee has been asked to consider this Bill as its first order of business. 


The Committee will then work to build a secure, strong multi partisan parliamentary consensus around the timing and specific content of referendum proposals for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Committee will also engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the broader community to secure their support for specific referendum proposals for constitutional recognition. 


The Government believes a successful referendum will help create strong, respectful relations between Indigenous and non Indigenous Australians. 


The National Apology to Indigenous Australians, the Stolen Generations in particular, helped build a bridge of respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. It generated trust, so we could work together to tackle Indigenous disadvantage. 


The recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution is another step in that journey, and one that is critical to our efforts to close the gap.


The Australian Constitution is the foundation document for our laws and our government, but it is silent on the special place of our first Australians.


The Government is pleased that today this Parliament is taking an important step towards changing that situation.


Towards a successful referendum that unites and strengthens our nation.


I am pleased to introduce legislation to implement important reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal.


The Bill is also an important component of the Gillard Government's wider federal courts reform package, which includes the recent announcement of injecting an additional $38 million in funding across the forward estimates for the federal courts to maintain their services, particularly for regional residents and disadvantaged parties.


This legislation will:


facilitate the transfer of the National Native Title Tribunal's administrative functions, staff and appropriation to the Federal Court, and


provide for the merger of the administration of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.


The Bill implements recommendations of the Review of Small and Medium Agencies in the Attorney-General's Portfolio, completed by Mr Stephen Skehill and released in June 2012, which recommended changes to the operation, structure and administration of agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio. 


While the amendments in this Bill are largely of a technical and administrative nature, they will allow the Courts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their administrative structures, and allow Court resources to be directed where they matter most: providing services to court users, particularly regional and disadvantaged parties.


This Bill implements several Skehill Review's recommendations relating to the National Native Title Tribunal.


The Review recommended both transferring native title mediation functions from the Tribunal to the Federal Court and creating corporate efficiencies by removing the Tribunal's classification as an Financial Management and Accountability Act1997 agency and providing for its financing and staffing through the Federal Court.


The reforms will not only generate savings, but also result in a closer relationship between the agencies and promote more cohesive and timely operation of the native title system.


A preliminary transfer of functions has already allowed the Tribunal to focus on its core area of strength – its crucial future acts functions – while the Federal Court, with strong results in the area, has been given control of native title mediation. 


This better alignment and allocation of functions builds on the Government's 2009 reforms, which first gave the Federal Court greater involvement in mediation. Those reforms have generated a four-fold increase in the rate of consent determinations – this means less waiting for claimants and faster certainty for all affected parties.


This Bill completes implementation of these reforms by clarifying the agencies' administrative framework and ensuring that they can work together efficiently.


For example, the Bill consolidates the Tribunal and Federal Court as a single Statutory Agency under the Public Service Act 1999. This aligns the staffing and financial responsibilities of the Registrar of the Federal Court, who will now be the Head of the consolidated agency for the purposes of both the FMA Act and Public Service Act. The Registrar's powers are also better defined. These measures provide clarity for agencies and stakeholders.


These reforms also allow the Tribunal and Federal Court to work more efficiently. The agencies will now share corporate services related to human resources, finances and information technology. Where possible, staff will work from the same buildings and share the same facilities. The compliance burdens under legislation such as the FMA Act will now also be shared.


The resulting efficiencies of these reforms are expected to generate $19 million in savings over the next four years.


In enabling the Tribunal and the Court to both operate more efficiently and to achieve better results, these reforms will support the Government's ongoing success in tackling the backlog of outstanding native title claims for the benefit of all stakeholders. 


This is why the changes a widely supported by stakeholders, and why we have organised a staged and ordered transition to make sure no matters currently underway will experience any delays.


As noted by Mr Skehill, the effective merging of the administration of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court from November 2008 has been a significant achievement in cooperation between the two Courts. 


Since 2009, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court have operated with a single Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court has also been the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court already share many resources, including staff and facilities.


The amendments for the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court in this Bill will clarify and formalise existing administrative structures, rather than fundamentally changing the way the Courts operate. This is appropriate, as the two Courts have cooperated effectively for several years.


I emphasise that the Courts will retain their separate and distinct identities, with the Federal Magistrates Court in the process of changing its name to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to reflect the growth in its scope, workload and regional work over the past decade. 


However, formalising the shared administrative arrangements for the Courts will allow them to achieve savings and operate more efficiently. 


For example, establishing the Courts as a single agency for the purposes of the FMA Act with a single budget appropriationwill mean that funds can be shared between the Courts as necessary.


This measure will also allow the Courts to produce a single set of financial statements for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the FMA Act, which will eliminate significant duplication of the Courts' work.


A range of provisions in the Courts' current legislation are not compatible with the Courts having a single Chief Executive Officer and operating as a single agency for the purposes of the FMA Act 


This Bill amends these provisions and ensures that the Courts will be able to work effectively and efficiently under shared administration, unhindered by unnecessary procedural formalities. As such, it's appropriate to conduct this change as efficiently as possible, without creating new and separate legislation to add to the statute book. 


We are also in ongoing discussions with both Courts to ensure their internal structures meet the needs of both the judiciary and court users.



This Bill forms one part of this Government's wider federal courts reform package. 



As noted earlier, the Gillard Government is also putting the courts back on a firmer financial footing, by directing an additional $38 million over four years to the courts.This injection of new funds, derived from a change to fee structures, will ensure our courts can continue to deliver key services, including regional circuit work, which are vital for disadvantaged litigants and small businesses. 


Other important aspects of this package of reforms include: 


establishing a transparent complaints process against judicial officers – the legislative framework for which was passed by the House earlier this sitting period; 


As noted earlier, renaming the Federal Magistrates Court as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, and federal magistrates as 'judges';


expanding the diversity judicial appointments, to better reflect the Australian community; and


establishing the Military Court of Australia, so that independent justice is available to Australian Defence Force members.


It is important that our federal courts and tribunals operate efficiently, are accessible to all parties, and provide effective forums for the resolution of disputes. 


The Bill enables the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia to work more closely to achieve better native title outcomes.


And it will formalise the administrative structure that has proved successful for the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court since 2009, and will drive further efficiencies for these Courts.


The Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Bill makes consequential amendments to the Commonwealth statute book to reflect changes to the name of the Federal Magistrates Court and the title of Federal Magistrate to 'Judge'.


It operates together with the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, to more accurately reflect the Court's modern role and highlight the valuable service it provides to regional Australians through its program of regular court circuits. 


The Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Bill, which has passed the Parliament, amends the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and other legislation to rename the Court and change the title of Federal Magistrate to 'Judge', while ensuring that existing arrangements and entitlements continue.


This Bill makes the necessary amendments to update references to the Federal Magistrates Court and Federal Magistrates across other Commonwealth legislation. The number and breadth of these necessary amendments clearly demonstrates the Court's broad jurisdiction and the functions of its judicial officers across areas as diverse as water efficiency, national measurements and telecommunications interception and access. 


Some of the legislation undergoing slight amendment enables Federal Magistrates to undertake functions in their personal capacity, such as issuing search and seizure warrants. The sensitive nature of many of these functions requires that there be no doubt about continuity of arrangements. The Bill includes specific provisions to preserve existing arrangements after the name changes commence, and clarifies the operation of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. 


The Bill also includes contingent amendments to update Bills currently before the Parliament that refer to the Federal Magistrates Court or Federal Magistrates. 


This Bill, while containing only consequential amendments, nevertheless forms an important part of this Government's wider court reforms, which will ensure that the federal judicial system provides accessible, equitable and understandable justice for the community. 


This Government has put the federal courts on a much firmer budget footing by recently allocating an additional $38 million to maintain and improve court services.


We have developed and passed a judicial complaints framework, to provide a more transparent and understandable way to raise complaints about judicial conduct, while fully respecting the constitutional boundaries between the arms of government.


And new court fee levels will better reflect the capacity of different litigants to pay – such as higher fees for large corporations and Government departments, balanced by the reintroduction of fee waivers and exemptions for disadvantaged litigants.


The Government has demonstrated good faith with the Court and Federal Magistrates by progressing this name and title change with all possible speed, while ensuring proper consultation with Heads of Jurisdiction.


These changes to commence the Federal Circuit Court and title of 'Judge' will be smoothly implemented across the Commonwealth statute book without any disruption to existing arrangements.


It is envisaged that this Bill will commence at the same time as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. 


I commend the Federal Magistrates Court and its judicial officers for their hard work over the past 12 years providing affordable, accessible and streamlined justice for people all over Australia. This new name will open a new chapter for the Court and help its Judges continue to serve the Australian community.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-02-25,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:39):  Prior to question time—or what was meant to be question time—there was a spirited debate and contribution by Senator Ryan which I appreciated in relation to this amendment. He raised issues about the problems with the democratic audit of Australia saying they were not completely impartial because they recommended rules for campaign financing that would favour unions and penalise corporations. I unambiguously state that the rules should be the same. You should not favour unions or big corporations. You should apply issues and the rules equally; that includes donations where they are made by individuals via a union, or individuals via a corporation. I think that is important and I want to make that clear. I still believe that the democratic audit, on balance, contributes usefully to the debate on issues of democracy in this country and I think it makes a valid point in its submission to this bill that it believes that the postal vote system favours incumbents and political parties. I think that is an issue that is legitimate and ought to be addressed. 


This particular amendment says that the current disclosure rules with respect to political donations are woefully inadequate. When a donation is made it ought to be disclosed within 30 days, so long as you are above the prescribed limit, which is about $11,900 at the moment. Senator Feeney, on behalf of the government, indicated that the next tranche of amendments of reforms to the electoral laws in this country would include more timely disclosure of every six months compared with every 18 or 19 months that potentially occurs now. Given the lag between a donation made on 1 July 2011, you would not know about until 1 February 2013, because that is the potential lag. We need to have more timely disclosures.


Hopefully, Senator Ryan will acknowledge that someone who was not for more government intervention in the United States was no less that George W. Bush. I remember a statement he made a number years ago—either when he was running for President or when he was President—talking about the need for having much more timely disclosures and that the internet could be used; online disclosure could be done virtually instantaneously. This is not about extra regulation or red tape, it is about trying to find a mechanism, provided the threshold is a reasonable threshold. My issue at the moment is not with the current threshold; my issue is with letting people know when those donations were made in a timely manner. What is being proposed by the government does not address those issues.


Before we go to a vote on this, I note the words of Doris Haddock, who was an American citizen who in 1999 at the age of 87, a great grandmother, walked across the US from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts in protest of the influence of big money in politics. She told the 1999 Reform Party Convention that a person:


… ought to be able to run for a public office without having to sell his or her soul to the corporations or the unions. Fundraising muscle should not be the measure of a candidate. Ideas, character, track record, leadership skills: those ought to be the measures of our leaders.


Those words are relevant in the context of this debate. Those words are relevant in the context of requiring greater degrees of transparency and disclosure in our political donations.


I indicate that I will be seeking to divide on this amendment. I note the support of my colleagues from the Australian Greens and Senator John Madigan from the DLP, and I am very grateful for that support. We need to get on with this sooner rather than later. I look forward to the next tranche of amendments that the government will be putting up. Every opportunity that can be taken to reform our electoral laws to make them more transparent, to make disclosure much more timely, ought to be seized. This is one of those opportunities.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (20:43):  Earlier this afternoon when Senator Ryan rose to speak about Senator Xenophon's amendment he spoke about unions and their funds, and the member's funds that are paid to unions by way of their membership fees. I think we need to clarify this: all people have a right to collective bargaining, Senator Ryan. What is the difference between members of the VFF or the NFF? That is collective bargaining. As are members of VECCI or the Australian Industry Group or the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, or whatever it may be.


As much as those people are entitled to collective representation, so are unionists, working people, allowed to have collective representation also. Picking up on your point that members' contributions to a union's funds are tax deductible, I think you will find that if you are a member of the AiG, VECCI, the VFF or the NFF, those contributions would also be tax deductible. So I think we have to be very careful as we erode the rights of one that we do not erode the rights of all, because these things set a precedent and precedents can come back to haunt people.


As far as Senator Xenophon's amendment goes, I support anything that offers transparency and accountability. I think any party, no matter who it is, no matter how large or small, should be prepared to disclose what donations they get, however large or small they are. On that basis I support Senator Xenophon's amendment.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (20:45):  The Greens also support this amendment, moved by Senator Xenophon. It provides an important step in cleaning up the complex way disclosure is presently managed. I did note Senator Feeney's comments. He said that the government will not vote for this amendment because the government has its own bill. On first hearing that sounds good, particularly when he says that its bill is to improve disclosure, make it more transparent and more timely. But then he tells us that he is referring to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2010, which is a bill that has been sitting there for three years. That is why we need to support the amendment that Senator Xenophon has brought before us. We have waited three years and Senator Feeney thinks it is a good argument to say, 'Well, we have this bill sitting here.' It is also worth remembering that, while it does cover these important issues of lowering the level of disclosure from presently pushing up towards $12,000 down to $1,000 and of more timely disclosure, Labor should have made some progress when it first was elected. It is worth remembering that this problem that we have came in when the coalition had control of both houses of parliament and the laws were wound back in a very unsatisfactory way. Labor did vote with the Greens and other minor parties, I understand, against that change. But here we have the situation where Labor for the last six years could have changed the law. It has had a bill for three years, we have talked about it for six years, and it has not changed. That is why we need the action and I am very pleased that we are able to explore the issue this evening. 


The law was changed in December 2005 when we went overnight from knowing that the public could find out who was donating if they gave a donation above $1,500 to all of a sudden having it changed to $10,000 and linked to the CPI. As we know, it is now up to about $11,900. That means that we have had a great deal of donations that have been hidden from public scrutiny. It is worth reminding ourselves how extensive this is, which underlines why we need the amendment that we are considering tonight. If you go back to 2005 when this change was made, which is basically what Senator Xenophon's amendment deals with, at that time Senator Eric Abetz and the Liberal Party federal director, Brian Loughnane, stated that the new $10,000 disclosure threshold would make little difference to public scrutiny. A lot of people doubted that; it is a big change. Once again their words were shown to be quite misleading. 


The Greens Democracy4sale research project examined the 2004-05 data, the disclosure data that the Australian Electoral Commission puts out on 1 February each year. That was the last time we saw donations having to be disclosed that were $1,500 or higher. Data for the New South Wales Liberals showed that only 58 per cent of donations, about $3.2 million, would have been identified if the new disclosure threshold had been applied. So clearly it was a large amount that would be hidden. Figures for the National Party are also interesting. In 2004-05 the Nationals reported 148 contributions of $1,500 or more. We would have had no details about most of those contributions if the law had already been in place. That gives us some idea of the money that is coming in about which we have no idea who it is coming from. Of the more than $1.3 million the Nationals received in 2004-05, 63 per cent would be identified, with 37 per cent hidden from public view. So what Senator Ryan is really saying when he says they do not want the bar changed and he talks about too much regulation is that they want to avoid public scrutiny. This is a very important point because at the time Senator Abetz and the director of the Liberal Party argued that 90 per cent of the dollar amount donated would still be available for public scrutiny. I understand that the exact amount that Senator Abetz argued at the time was 88 per cent of the dollar amount still being available for public scrutiny.


That has certainly not been the case when you look at the figures and compare those from 2000-05 to later years. 


This is a worrying trend and underlines why we need to have amendments like those before us. In fact, we need to look even more deeply into the whole issue of disclosure. As we have been waiting for this legislation from the government to come on for so long, I think it is worth us taking the opportunity that these amendments afford us to just consider the changes we do need with regard to disclosure because, yes, we need to get the bar down—$1,000 seems very reasonable—and it needs to be done in a timely manner. In these days of electronic spreadsheets and websites whereby it so easy to coordinate, it would be very easy to have the donations put up probably within a matter of hours. 


We also need to clear up what is declared and the penalties for non-compliance. This really does go to the issue of resources for the Australian Electoral Commission. Often you find out that the rules have been broken but nothing happens, and it just goes on because there are not the resources for the Australian Electoral Commission to look into it in detail. When it comes to disclosure, it is very unclear what you are actually looking at. It needs to be differentiated at least between fundraisers and money donated. A very important issue that comes up time and time again when you talk about disclosure is that the money that a donor puts in should be aggregated. It should not be possible for a donor to give small amounts of money, thereby staying under the threshold and out of public scrutiny in that way. 


For the record, in the 2011 state election the Greens in New South Wales enacted their commitment to continuous disclosure by publishing details of donations that were received. The amendments before us address just a part of this, but it is an important step towards bringing forward a healthier disclosure system. Labor may have promised action on this front but we still have not got it. We know that the legislation has been sitting there for three years, and that is why we cannot keep waiting. We have some amendments before us now. The Greens support these amendments, and I urge all senators to support them.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (20:54):  I just want to briefly respond to Senator Madigan's comments about my comments before question time. I actually agree with him. I hope I did not misconvey the point that I was trying to make. He makes the point about legitimate collective bargaining, which is guaranteed in the Fair Work Act and in competition and consumer law. I am not challenging that at all. The point that I was making earlier, which Senator Madigan has responded to, was about where the money ends up and the means by which money that political parties get hold of is treated differently. 


Senator Madigan rightly referred to tax deductibility not only of union dues but also of membership of professional associations or industry groups like the AiG or the Real Estate Institute or, for that matter, groups like the AMA. The difference is that those groups do not hand money to political parties as membership fees. The point I was making, Senator Madigan, was in regard to the fact that someone who chooses to contribute money to the Labor Party through their union membership fees and then also through a donation or through their membership of the Labor Party more directly is availing themselves of two different tax-free thresholds, in terms of the tax deductibility of that money. The union money is deductible in one way, whereas the money for membership is deductible in another way. It means that in that all-important sense the money that unions hand over to the ALP is tax free, whereas the money that individuals or that corporates may hand over to another political party or, indeed, to the ALP itself is dealt with primarily, if it is above the deductibility threshold, as post-tax income, which actually leads to a very different real cost of that donation. 


The point I was making about the comments from that particular member of the Democratic Audit was that a structure which favours corporate membership such as the unions have—which is a corporate membership sense of the Labor Party, where the body is the member as opposed to an individual-based membership, which I understand the Democratic Labor Party and the Liberal Party have—leads to unequal tax treatment of the money that goes to political parties. It has nothing do with collective bargaining, and I do not wish to do anything about the collective bargaining space; it is purely about how the tax system treats the money that political parties get hold of. 


I note that in Canada the tax system actually counts tax deductibility as part of the public funding amount, and all moneys that go to political parties that are tax deductible are treated equally. There are no different routes, whether it be by union membership fees or by donations. I think that is an important point. We do not want to have an unlevel playing field with money in politics in terms of its legal treatment. I was not trying to make a point about collective bargaining in that sense at all. I think this could be resolved without having any impact on collective bargaining, because the examples you mentioned, such as dairy farmers and their collective bargaining with a milk processor—all those things—would be untouched. The issue here is about money that flows to political parties from what is rightly pointed out to be the historic arrangement they have with unions, but that should not give them a financial advantage over other participants in the political process purely via the tax system. 


With respect to the contribution from Senator Rhiannon, I will not stand here and be lectured on transparency by a political party that does not allow the media into its national conference. 




Senator Rhiannon:
  That's not true.




Senator RYAN:
  That is transparency—how you form your policies. It is about how the Greens come up with the policies which they then put as a gun to the Labor Party's head and force them to implement. It is about how the Greens come up with the policies that they use in their balance of power and negotiating position in this Senate to force onto the Australian people. Real transparency, Senator Rhiannon, is not about someone who donates $1,000.50; it is actually about political party processes. All the other political parties represented here are not afraid of transparency. They do not lock the media out of their national conference for fear that the truth about the extremist base of the party might actually be on the national news. Transparency is as much about information about our operations and how we come to decisions, and that is something in which the Greens are profoundly lacking. I will not be lectured about transparency by them.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-02-25,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:39):  Prior to question time—or what was meant to be question time—there was a spirited debate and contribution by Senator Ryan which I appreciated in relation to this amendment. He raised issues about the problems with the democratic audit of Australia saying they were not completely impartial because they recommended rules for campaign financing that would favour unions and penalise corporations. I unambiguously state that the rules should be the same. You should not favour unions or big corporations. You should apply issues and the rules equally; that includes donations where they are made by individuals via a union, or individuals via a corporation. I think that is important and I want to make that clear. I still believe that the democratic audit, on balance, contributes usefully to the debate on issues of democracy in this country and I think it makes a valid point in its submission to this bill that it believes that the postal vote system favours incumbents and political parties. I think that is an issue that is legitimate and ought to be addressed. 


This particular amendment says that the current disclosure rules with respect to political donations are woefully inadequate. When a donation is made it ought to be disclosed within 30 days, so long as you are above the prescribed limit, which is about $11,900 at the moment. Senator Feeney, on behalf of the government, indicated that the next tranche of amendments of reforms to the electoral laws in this country would include more timely disclosure of every six months compared with every 18 or 19 months that potentially occurs now. Given the lag between a donation made on 1 July 2011, you would not know about until 1 February 2013, because that is the potential lag. We need to have more timely disclosures.


Hopefully, Senator Ryan will acknowledge that someone who was not for more government intervention in the United States was no less that George W. Bush. I remember a statement he made a number years ago—either when he was running for President or when he was President—talking about the need for having much more timely disclosures and that the internet could be used; online disclosure could be done virtually instantaneously. This is not about extra regulation or red tape, it is about trying to find a mechanism, provided the threshold is a reasonable threshold. My issue at the moment is not with the current threshold; my issue is with letting people know when those donations were made in a timely manner. What is being proposed by the government does not address those issues.


Before we go to a vote on this, I note the words of Doris Haddock, who was an American citizen who in 1999 at the age of 87, a great grandmother, walked across the US from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts in protest of the influence of big money in politics. She told the 1999 Reform Party Convention that a person:


… ought to be able to run for a public office without having to sell his or her soul to the corporations or the unions. Fundraising muscle should not be the measure of a candidate. Ideas, character, track record, leadership skills: those ought to be the measures of our leaders.


Those words are relevant in the context of this debate. Those words are relevant in the context of requiring greater degrees of transparency and disclosure in our political donations.


I indicate that I will be seeking to divide on this amendment. I note the support of my colleagues from the Australian Greens and Senator John Madigan from the DLP, and I am very grateful for that support. We need to get on with this sooner rather than later. I look forward to the next tranche of amendments that the government will be putting up. Every opportunity that can be taken to reform our electoral laws to make them more transparent, to make disclosure much more timely, ought to be seized. This is one of those opportunities.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (20:43):  Earlier this afternoon when Senator Ryan rose to speak about Senator Xenophon's amendment he spoke about unions and their funds, and the member's funds that are paid to unions by way of their membership fees. I think we need to clarify this: all people have a right to collective bargaining, Senator Ryan. What is the difference between members of the VFF or the NFF? That is collective bargaining. As are members of VECCI or the Australian Industry Group or the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, or whatever it may be.


As much as those people are entitled to collective representation, so are unionists, working people, allowed to have collective representation also. Picking up on your point that members' contributions to a union's funds are tax deductible, I think you will find that if you are a member of the AiG, VECCI, the VFF or the NFF, those contributions would also be tax deductible. So I think we have to be very careful as we erode the rights of one that we do not erode the rights of all, because these things set a precedent and precedents can come back to haunt people.


As far as Senator Xenophon's amendment goes, I support anything that offers transparency and accountability. I think any party, no matter who it is, no matter how large or small, should be prepared to disclose what donations they get, however large or small they are. On that basis I support Senator Xenophon's amendment.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (20:45):  The Greens also support this amendment, moved by Senator Xenophon. It provides an important step in cleaning up the complex way disclosure is presently managed. I did note Senator Feeney's comments. He said that the government will not vote for this amendment because the government has its own bill. On first hearing that sounds good, particularly when he says that its bill is to improve disclosure, make it more transparent and more timely. But then he tells us that he is referring to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2010, which is a bill that has been sitting there for three years. That is why we need to support the amendment that Senator Xenophon has brought before us. We have waited three years and Senator Feeney thinks it is a good argument to say, 'Well, we have this bill sitting here.' It is also worth remembering that, while it does cover these important issues of lowering the level of disclosure from presently pushing up towards $12,000 down to $1,000 and of more timely disclosure, Labor should have made some progress when it first was elected. It is worth remembering that this problem that we have came in when the coalition had control of both houses of parliament and the laws were wound back in a very unsatisfactory way. Labor did vote with the Greens and other minor parties, I understand, against that change. But here we have the situation where Labor for the last six years could have changed the law. It has had a bill for three years, we have talked about it for six years, and it has not changed. That is why we need the action and I am very pleased that we are able to explore the issue this evening. 


The law was changed in December 2005 when we went overnight from knowing that the public could find out who was donating if they gave a donation above $1,500 to all of a sudden having it changed to $10,000 and linked to the CPI. As we know, it is now up to about $11,900. That means that we have had a great deal of donations that have been hidden from public scrutiny. It is worth reminding ourselves how extensive this is, which underlines why we need the amendment that we are considering tonight. If you go back to 2005 when this change was made, which is basically what Senator Xenophon's amendment deals with, at that time Senator Eric Abetz and the Liberal Party federal director, Brian Loughnane, stated that the new $10,000 disclosure threshold would make little difference to public scrutiny. A lot of people doubted that; it is a big change. Once again their words were shown to be quite misleading. 


The Greens Democracy4sale research project examined the 2004-05 data, the disclosure data that the Australian Electoral Commission puts out on 1 February each year. That was the last time we saw donations having to be disclosed that were $1,500 or higher. Data for the New South Wales Liberals showed that only 58 per cent of donations, about $3.2 million, would have been identified if the new disclosure threshold had been applied.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-02-25,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (21:50):  Access to employment with fair and equitable remuneration has always been a cornerstone of social cohesion in Australia and the quality of life that Australians enjoy, but too many women have found difficulty in finding gainful employment and, even then, too many have been unable to access fair and equitable remuneration. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth, working with state governments, unions and the business community, to increase women's participation in the workforce and close the pay gap between men and women.


Last year, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency published gender pay gap statistics. They show that the pay gap sits at an alarming 18 per cent—that is, $250 a week. Those statistics show that the average weekly ordinary earnings of a woman working full time are $1,186.90, or $250.50 per week less than men, who on average earn $1,437.40 per week. Unsurprisingly, the public sector fares better than the private sector, with a 12.9 per cent gap compared to a 20.8 per cent gap.


This contributes to the ACT's pay gap remaining the smallest nationally at just 12 per cent, with Western Australia a long way back at 25.8 per cent. 


Industry statistics show it is the healthcare sector which has the most alarming gap, at 32.6 per cent. Public administration and accommodation and food services are both on eight per cent. Women aged 45 to 49 are the hardest hit, with a pay gap of almost 27 per cent.


Not only are women underpaid, when compared to their male counterparts, but women also remain significantly underrepresented in the workforce. Despite representing slightly over 50 per cent of the population and over 50 per cent of university enrolments, women represent just 45 per cent of the workforce. The recent statistics from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency show that only 65.3 per cent of women work, whereas 79.7 per cent of men are employed. Over the past decade, the male participation rate has remained steady at around 78 per cent to 79 per cent, while female participation rates have grown from 60.3 per cent in 2001 to 65.3 per cent today. This means that just about all the recent growth in labour force participation has been female.


There are many reasons why there are fewer women in the workforce, but discrimination on the basis of gender related to family caring responsibilities remains a key barrier to equal workplace participation. Many women, as we know, take time away from work to raise a family. The flow-on effect of this is that many women lose valuable time and experience from the workforce, leading to difficulties for many who wish to re-enter the workforce.


Helen Conway has pointed to the research by Catalyst that suggests that even when women do 'all the right things', they are unlikely to earn as much or advance as far as their male colleagues. Catalyst puts this down to 'entrenched sexism'. Sheryl Sandberd, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, recently pointed to studies which show that there are psychological reasons which contribute to the lower rates of female workforce participation. These are twofold: first, women consistently underestimate their abilities, while men generally overestimate their own abilities; and, second, women attribute success to external factors, while men attribute success to their own abilities. But these psychological hurdles are not genetic or physiological; they are entrenched when society is male dominated. Other factors which a recent regulatory impact statement found contribute to the lower rate of female participation include the impact of sexual harassment, bias in recruitment and insufficient data.


The government's recent Workplace Gender Equality Act has meant some important new initiatives will increase participation rates and reduce the pay gap between men and women. Its centrepiece is a new and improved reporting system. Workplaces with more than 100 employees will make reports based on uniform indicators. Streamlining the indicators will make it easier for businesses to make comparisons with competitors and allies and easier to compare their results with past years and track their gender workplace statistics. These uniform indicators will also allow governments to have more accurate and usable statistics for future public  policy decisions.


The reports will now need to be signed off by a CEO. This will bring gender workplace pay and participation issues to the top and encourage serious responses from CEOs. The uniform indicators are gender composition of the workforce; gender composition of governing bodies; equal remuneration; availability and utility of flexible working arrangements to support family or caring opportunities; consultation with employees on gender issues; and other matters as defined in subsequent legislation.


The process for lodging statistics has also changed: employees and employee organisations must be invited to contribute to the reports; the final reports must be made available to shareholders and employees; and misleading or late reporting or failure to comply with the act can lead to the naming and shaming of that employer by the minister, or even a declaration on ineligibility to compete for Commonwealth grants or tenders.


Creating fair and equitable access to employment with fair and equitable remuneration is a core responsibility of government. I applaud the government's recent initiatives to improve female participation in the workforce and reduce the gender pay gap, and I look forward to seeing the results of this important legislation, the Workplace Gender Equality Act, which has recently passed the parliament.
