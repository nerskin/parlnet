"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—On the one hand, it is a pleasure to speak in this debate; on the other hand, I have to express my concern at the nature of it. In the short time available, I particularly want to draw attention  to some of the impli 
 cations of a GST on remote and rural Australia—in particular, the distinct and very definite inequalities that prevail within the tax proposals of the government as they affect people who live in these regional and remote communities. The implications go to the distributional impacts of this quite iniquitous tax, both vertically and horizontally. Frankly, I am a little surprised that our colleagues on the other side of the House have not picked up on these issues. I know there is some trepidation within the National Party about the impact of a GST and that in their heart of hearts they do know what I am talking about.
 The first thing that must be recognised about a GST is that, compared with other indirect tax systems, a GST or VAT inherently discriminates against country areas and, the more remote the area, the greater the discrimination. This is because the GST effectively applies the tax to the retail value of goods and services, including the costs of transport and distribution. The wholesale sales tax, on the other hand, does not tax the final stages of transport and distribution.
An arithmetic example illustrates the point. Take a good with a wholesale value of $100 and subject to sales tax of, say, 22.5 per cent. Say that the final retail transport and distribution cost, including the retailer's margin, is $80 in a city, $120 in a country town, and $160 in a remote community. These proportions would not be atypical. At present, therefore, the item sells for $202.50 in the city, $242.50 in the country town, and $282.50 in the remote area. With a GST replacing sales tax, the final prices come to $198 in the city, $242 in the country town and $286 in the remote area. So an apparent reduction in the tax rate from 22.5 per cent to 10 per cent has had the effect of reducing the price by all of 2.3 per cent in the city and 0.2 per cent in the country town, but has increased the price by 1.2 per cent in the remote community.
The government's estimates of the price effect of the GST package relate to the consumer price index. The CPI, however, is based, as we know, purely on city prices—it takes no account of the higher prices paid in non-metropolitan areas. So even if the government's estimates of the CPI effect are 
 accurate, they still understate the cost of living impact in rural and remote areas. And if I have time, I will come back and illustrate that point in more detail.
In the arithmetic example I have provided, to effect a 2.3 per cent price reduction in remote areas, the retail transport and distribution cost and margin would need to fall by $6.50, or four per cent. It needs to be remembered that fuel costs are only one part of the additional cost of supplying goods and services in rural and remote areas. There are also labour and other costs in the transport and retail task, profit margins for the firms involved, and higher unit costs resulting from lower throughputs than in the cities.
In all, it is unlikely that the fuel price reductions contained in the government's package would offset the discriminatory impact of the GST compared with the government's taxation system. And there is absolutely no evidence at all—in fact, some would say there is quite contrary evidence—of the argument that savings would be achieved as a result of costs going down in the transport sector and that this will mean lower freight costs. In fact, in the Northern Territory during the election campaign, the major freight distributors in the transport industry indicated that it was unlikely they would pass on any savings because of the low margins they already have.
A second discriminatory element of the government's tax reform package derives from the fact that incomes are, on average, lower in rural and remote Australia than in the major cities. Low income people spend a higher proportion of their income on food and clothing, which are currently tax exempt but are to be included in the GST. I will come back to an example if I have time.
The proposed income tax cuts provide the greatest benefits to taxpayers on about $75,000 a year. With lower average incomes, non-metropolitan Australia will therefore receive a disproportionately low share of these income tax reductions. I might point out that the median wage for Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory is a handsome $180 per week. Compare that to $72,000.
One aspect of a GST that does provide a net benefit to non-metropolitan Australia is, of course, the removal of taxes from exports—other than tourism. However, the extent of this impact should not be exaggerated. There is very clear evidence that at least in some industries its impact will be minimal. 	It is inconceivable that all of the proposed reductions in taxes will be passed on to purchasers—at least some will find their way into firms' profits, or at least will be	used to offset the administrative burden of the GST itself, particularly on small business. This is what makes the government's estimates of a two per cent CPI effect so suspect. What is more, the CPI estimate is dampened by an expected currency appreciation arising from the estimated impact on exporters' costs. That raises the question of whether the modelling has appropriately captured the nature of exchange rate determination, something that is notoriously difficult to do. More immediately, it means that if the assumption of a full pass-on of all reductions in other indirect taxes is not correct, then the CPI estimate is doubly deflated.
It is not surprising that other analysts and commentators have suggested a CPI effect of more like over four per cent than the 1.9 per cent assumed by the government. Indeed, a rough calculation based on the government's revenue estimates supports such a calculation of a price impact in excess of four per cent.
The government's estimates are that a GST of 10 per cent applying to more than 90 per cent of consumer expenditure will raise some $32 billion in the year 2001-02. Of this, $26 billion net is to be returned in the form of lower indirect taxes, $4.5 billion of which goes to exporters—according to the government. Simple arithmetic suggests that, even on the assumption of a full pass-on of all the price reducing elements of the package, the increase in consumer costs will be a price impact of three per cent—compared with the government's estimates of a price impact of under two per cent.
But if businesses pass on only, say, half the benefit they receive from reduced financial institutions duties and stamp duties—and as I have pointed out, it is likely that in the 
 transport sector in the Northern Territory they will not even pass those on—then the price impact will be 4.3 per cent, more than twice that estimated by the government. This is a much more realistic scenario than that painted by the government and still might be considered optimistic in that it assumes that all of the reduced wholesale sales tax is passed on.
That calculation has a number of very severe implications. It suggests that the government's compensation package is inadequate for most families, particularly low income families and social security recipients. It suggests that the supposed national economic benefits, such as from reduced costs on exporters, have been greatly overestimated. It further suggests that the Reserve Bank will have to take strong monetary policy action through higher interest rates to prevent this extra price impact being built into ongoing inflation.
We need to be very conscious of the distributional effects of this inequitable tax. When we talk about the cost of doing business in the bush, I have a very good example in the cost of housing. I will give it very briefly. I am talking about the construction of a two- to three-bedroom dwelling. Bulla is a small Aboriginal community in the Victoria River district. The cost of that house in that community is $143,000. The cost of building a similar house in Hobart is $89,000. To build a similar house in Adelaide it is $92,000 and in Sydney $132,000. In Darwin the average cost is $130,000. A similar house built at Demed, which is an outstation of Gunbalunya in the Northern Territory, would be $180,000. You can see that the prices paid by Territorians living in remote communities are far higher than those paid by people living in the major metropolitan areas.
An eight per cent increase, which is what has been estimated by the Housing Industry Association to be the increase in the cost of housing, would mean that in the case of Hobart you would pay an extra $11,000 for a house but in the case of Demed, this outstation near Oenpelli in the Northern Territory, you would pay an extra $22,500. I ask the government whether it is their proposal that they will increase program funding 
 levels to all of these Aboriginal organisations and communities that provide housing, to compensate for the additional costs they will wear as a result of this tax. I know what the answer is—the answer is no. This is an unfair tax. It is a tax which will hurt ordinary Australians. Most of all, it will crucify those people who live in regional and remote Australia.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, Jnr, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—One of the most important problems that Australia has to come to grips with is that we are in fact a vanishing race. The population of Australia projected for 2098, a hundred years time, is, according to the latest National Geographic , some 14 million people. According to Professor Richard Blandy, it is some 12 million people. That is assuming fairly high immigration rates, and our immigration rates are negligible. On negligible immigration rates, we are talking about a population of six million people. The male youth suicide rates are now second only to those in Russia; they are the second worst in the world. Gaolings of youths throughout Australia have increased some 300 per cent since 1966 and youth suicides have increased some 200 per cent.
If a mother chooses to stay at home and look after kids, in our society today she is penalised. If a single-income family has a husband and wife and two children and they are on average weekly earnings, the average income for those four little Australians, if you like, is $6,000. If they are what we call a Dink family, a double income and no children family, their income is $26,000 each. What would you prefer to be on: $26,000 disposable income or $6,000 disposable income? Not unnaturally, all of the mothers in Australia, whether they like it or not, are forced out into the work force. This move towards income splitting provides a choice, and we should unashamedly say that this is something that needs to be done.
The second thing I want to talk about is the $7,000 for the first home ownership scheme. I thought one of the most marvellous things I ever saw government do in my 24 years in parliament was the introduction of the first home ownership scheme, which I think was by Mr John Howard when he was Treasurer. 
 It has been reintroduced now. For the poor people in a place like Charters Towers, when we had enlightened government in the BjelkePetersen years we could provide free land for them. That, along with the first home ownership scheme, if they did not have a job, provided them with a job. They could then build their own homes, as 11 people did in Pentland outside of Charters Towers. So it is a marvellous scheme, and a marvellous attribute has been provided by this package.
I have not got time today to say where I think we should be philosophically with respect to where we raise taxation from. One of the great difficulties I have always had with this is that it is a marvellous mechanism for raising extra money in the hands of an ALP government. The Bjelke-Petersen government's trenchant opposition to the introduction of this sort of tax was coloured by the fact that when the ALP government came to office it had $41,000 million of revenue coming in, but when it left office it had $115,000 million of revenue coming in. Yet average weekly earnings in that same period only rose from $372 to $634. What the then government said is, `We deserve a 300 per cent increase, but the average Australian deserves less than 100 per cent increase.' That is what was said by the ALP government, and that is one of the great fears that I always hold with respect to this sort of mechanism being introduced.
However, there are so many good things in this tax reform package, and some of them I need to note here. We compete in export industries against massive subsidies from other parts of the world. I instance two of our three biggest agricultural exporting industries, sugar and beef. We are allowed only 7,000 tonnes of beef into the United States. When we had Saint Francis station, one of the neighbours produced 7,000 tonnes of beef a year, and he was not all that big. So one single Australian farmer can produce 7,000 tonnes of beef but that is all we are allowed into the biggest market in the world. There are 500 million people in the European Union. As far as sugar goes, the biggest exporters are from Europe, and they enjoy a subsidy of 193 per cent. Recently there was 
 a series of articles in Time magazine which I think every Australian should read. It gives you some idea of what other countries are doing to subsidise their exports: $125,000 million a year was the figure put out by Time magazine.
At least this tax package removes the burden of government charges from our exports, and that gives us an advantage which is vitally important to every single person in this country. The greatest problem, outside of our population, outside of being a vanishing race, is the current account deficit, which this year will probably go close to $30,000 million. Everything humanly possible must be done to make those industries competitive. I have a very excellent paper which I would like to table from Alan Medley of Medley Supermarkets. In all my years of politics, it is very seldom that I have got such professionally presented documentation of a point of view. He supplies all of the retailers in north-west Queensland. He is a wholesaler who provides a complete grocery range of items, with the exception of meat.
The figures here indicate that the overall tax now being levied is 8.465 per cent. I would like to table this document. That means that the regime that we are moving into will make a difference of 1.5 per cent. That, plus the comments of NARGA, Alan McKenzie and the shopkeepers that we really cannot differentiate, has coloured my judgment somewhat. The figures are there, and I cannot question them.
I agree with the previous speaker—one of the very few times in this House that I ever have or probably ever will—that in country areas we have a problem. It might be as a result of this, but we will deal with that at a later stage. The problem exists right at this very moment. A person on average weekly earnings in Australia, $37,644, pays tax of $8,820. In the mid-west area of North Queensland, which was my old state seat, we had a cost of living difference with Brisbane of 23 per cent, which represented $8,648. So, if you took the tax off and you took off the loss of purchasing power because the person lives in Julia Creek, Hughenden or Cloncurry, he ends up with an income of $20,000.
That is bad enough, but if he lives in Normanton or Karumba he has a 40 per cent cost of living difference—that is, $15,058—and that leaves him with the princely disposable income of $13,786. If he was a wife and two children, he is below the pension. So, even though he starts off on average weekly earnings, a very handsome $37,664—and I suspect there are very few people in Normanton and Karumba earning that amount of money—he ends up with a disposable income which is less than the pension if he has a wife and two children.
This problem must be addressed, and it can only be addressed by a revision and a revisiting of the zone rebate system that exists at the moment. The issue has not been visited in 17 years. When it was visited 17 years ago, the tribunal comprised a Sydney accountant—a person I found to be most insensitive and with very little understanding of what he was dealing with—a trade union official, who put the point of view of the employee quite strongly, I must say, and a departmental official from Canberra. We did not get a good deal. We got a deal, but it was not a very good deal, and it has been 17 years since it was done.
When I started work, my first job was shovelling lead dust at Mount Isa Mines. I got a very big wage—it was probably almost twice average weekly earnings in those days—of $66 a week and I paid tax of $5 a week. If I had been married with a couple of kids, I would have paid $2.50 tax. The zone allowances then were such that they would attract young men to go out there, because you could earn a lot of money and you could save a lot of money. That was the profound importance of the zone allowances in attracting population to these areas.
The sad fact of the matter is that fewer people are living in these areas now than in 1966. So, if there were a compelling case for generous zone allowances in that period of time, it would be a far more compelling case today. The country is rapidly emptying—90 per cent of the surface area of Australia is currently unpopulated—and the tiny population that is left is rapidly dwindling. Mount Isa's population has fallen from 30,000 to 
 close to 20,000 in the last 10 years. The mid-west, over the last 2½ decades, has gone down 40 per cent. That will give you, Mr Deputy Speaker, some idea of what is happening in these areas.
In addition to that, if you live in a town like my home town of Cloncurry, there are very few people on average weekly earnings. There are no cappuccino machines or art galleries. There are no universities. There are not even high schools in most of these towns. There is no Australian Rugby League matches to go and watch. In fact, until recently there have been no rugby league matches to watch in the mid-west. I was one of the people that started off the mid-west rugby league. There was no football at all last year in that area. There is no shooting since that has been virtually banned by actions in this place and in other places.
There are very few dentists throughout that area. There are no accountants. There are no lawyers. There are no specialist doctors. There is no surgery. As for the subsidised commuter transportation system enjoyed by the big cities, which is worth $4,000 million a year in subsidies to the cities, when we go to work we have to pay a petrol tax of 120 per cent and we have to pay a sales tax on our motor cars, a tariff level together of about 50 per cent. I would plead with the Treasurer to please address the matter of the zone allowances because, independent of anything that is happening here in this parliament, we desperately need action along these lines. We need it urgently.
If we do not act upon the zone allowances and zone rebates, the population will continue to dwindle. Having given the matter a lot of thought, I cannot think of any approach that we can use that will do the sorts of things that need to be done, other than the Cloncurry clause, which is being introduced in this bill. It will do away with the fringe benefits tax on those companies that are decent enough to allow families to live together in their mining situations and restore the level of population in the mining towns. For that I must sincerely thank the government.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—If former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's famous observation that a week equals a long time in politics is true, does logic dictate that the words `never, ever' can also be construed as a different period of time when politics is concerned? That is the leap of faith the Prime Minister would like us to take anyway. It seems `never, ever', according to our Prime Minister, means `not in the next term of government'. That is an incredible suspension of logic, but that is what he and the government want Australians to believe he meant when he made his famous anti-GST pledge in 1995. But, of course, he meant nothing of the sort.
During the course of the 1996 election campaign, and in the phoney 12-month campaign that preceded it, the member for Bennelong, now the Prime Minister of Australia, appeared on any radio or television show that would have him in order to try to gain the trust of the Australian voting public by proclaiming his key message: `The promises I make, I keep.' At a time when Australians view their politicians with an almost intractable level of suspicion and cynicism, Prime Minister John Howard placed great emphasis on trying to convince Australians that, unlike other politicians, he could deliver on his promises. The Prime Minister said:
During this campaign, I will not be embarking on . . . campaign promises which aren't worth a candle flicker.
He also said:
I would rather promise half of what I'm asked and deliver on 100 per cent than promise everything I'm asked only to find I cannot keep some of those commitments.
While delivering these fine words, he also made it clear that a coalition government would never, ever introduce a GST. In one breath the Prime Minister said, `I will keep my promises,' and in the next breath he said, `There will never, ever be a GST.' So why are we here 2½ years later debating the merits 
 of the coalition government's tax package which has, as its central plank, a 10 per cent goods and services tax on almost everything Australians do or buy?
How silly of me—`never, ever' actually only means `in the lifetime of the next parliament'. `Never, ever' means nothing of the sort! `Never, ever' means `when hell freezes over'; it means `not if you were the last man on earth'; it means `when pigs fly'. And yet here we are with a GST staring us right in the face. Chalk it up as another win for hypocrisy and half-truth over good government and honest politics.
The GST legislation introduced by the Treasurer in this House last week represents an attack of a kind never seen before on the lifestyles and communities of low and middle income Australians. I would like to comment on many aspects of the coalition's tax package, but unfortunately time does not permit it. We have been given only 10 minutes each to debate this important legislation. I will try to satisfy myself by focusing on two aspects of the package which are of particular concern to me: the compensation measures contained in these bills, and the government's erroneous connection between job creation and the GST.
For a succinct appraisal of the compensation measures contained in the GST legislation, one need look no further than this comment by the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Ross Gittins. He said:
The fact is, its tax package is seriously flawed. It contains a . . . GST accompanied by utterly inadequate compensation for people on welfare and people with children, as well as tax cuts biased heavily in favour of higher income earners.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The Government sought to conceal the flaws in its package by issuing dishonest tax tables and by suppressing the Treasury study of the distributional impact of the indirect tax changes. For good measure, it left the package on the table for a mere seven weeks before it rushed the electorate to judgment.
Mr Gittins is not the only economics writer, analyst or spokesperson who has difficulties with the compensation measures contained in the coalition's tax package. For the record, let me list some of the others who have gone on 
 record registering their concerns: Colin Hargreaves of the Economic Modelling Bureau of Australia; Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales; Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling; and, finally, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.
The root problem with this government's underestimation of the impact the GST will have on the CPI index can be found in the economic modelling carried out by Treasury when it was in the process of constructing this package. Treasury provided this government with a number of different GST tax models and compensation packages for it to consider. The figures the coalition settled on—and this is why its compensation offer is so hopelessly flawed—did not contain crucial modelling based on the household expenditure survey.
For all the Treasurer's hyperventilation and hyperbole in regard to the household expenditure survey and his comments regarding former Treasurer Dawkins's supposed lack of regard for the HES, I would like to put one thing straight. Both the 1985 compensation tax proposals considered by the then Labor government and the 1991 Fightback proposal put forward by the coalition were based on economic modelling that took the household expenditure survey into account. If the government's current tax package had included modelling based on this HES data, it would have found—as a similar study by the Melbourne Institute did find—that low income earners require two to five times the amount of compensation that the legislation provides in this current GST proposal.
The government says that the cost of living for a pensioner will only rise by $6 per week with a GST and that it proposes to put nearly $11 extra into their pockets to compensate. But economic modelling, taking the household expenditure survey into account, suggests that the cost of the GST to pensioners will be more like $14 to $18 a week extra. The government has based its tax package on the erroneous assumption that all households—rich, poor, pensioners and wage and salary earners alike—save the same and spend the same. How crazy is that?
My constituents, the majority of whom are low and middle income earners, would like the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to understand that they do not have the same saving and spending patterns as families living in Kirribilli or South Yarra. Well-off Australians may spend more money on food and the essentials of life, but poor and middle income families spend a greater percentage or proportion of their income on such necessities. Even Dr Michael Carnahan, one of the Treasury mandarins who had such a close hand in preparing the coalition's tax package, has admitted that `different people do indeed buy different things'. He also conceded that there `are arguments' in favour of considering the impact of the GST on different households.
The poorest 20 per cent of households spend almost 40 per cent of their income to buy the food they need to survive. The richest 20 per cent devote less than 11 per cent of their income to the same necessities. As Ross Gittins again so eloquently put it:
. . . food is the dominant item in the budgets of the retired. Why? Not because they eat more than the rest of us, but because they have low incomes and they have cut back their spending on so many items.
And yet the government wants Australians to believe that we all save and spend in the same pattern. What a load of rot! As with all things put together with scant regard for detail, the sloppy preparation of the tax package has led to a sloppy outcome. But in this case, a sloppy outcome will lead to financial and lifestyle pain for many thousands of Australian families and, in the process, drain the budget of over $12 billion between the years 2000 and 2003.
The second aspect of this tax package that I would like to take issue with is the government's assertion that the GST will lead to jobs and a reduction in unemployment. If anything, the GST will be a job destroyer. It will place a dead hand on the services sector, the major growth area for jobs in Australia over this last decade. Indeed, the Economic Modelling Bureau of Australia has said that the GST `could destroy 150,000 full-time jobs and 50,000 part-time jobs in its first year of operation.' For tax reform to lead to job 
 growth, the leading economists are not talking GST. They are not talking consumption tax. They are talking tax credits. They are talking roughly the same policy on tax reform that Labor took to the last election.
The proposal that has received the most coverage of late has been that prepared by Professors Peter Dawkins, John Freebairn and Ross Garnaut, Dr Michael Keating and Chris Richardson and submitted to the Prime Minister for his consideration. Their tax reform-jobs blueprint is heavily dependent on three of the pillars central to Labor's tax reform package. It endorses the setting of an explicit unemployment target, it recommends the introduction of a tax credit system in order to provide an incentive for people to leave welfare for work and it endorses the development of many of the same labour market programs the coalition government did away with when it came to power in 1996.
As for the other part of their proposal concerning the freezing of minimum wage rates, when tax credits were introduced into the US and the UK, neither reforms were accompanied by such a movement with regard to the minimum wage. Tax credits, unlike the GST, are about employment. The GST will not only retard job growth but, in the process of reforming our tax system, it will throw thousands more Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap.
Tax credits let families keep more of what they earn. A tax credit system will make sure that people on low incomes are better off working than staying on the dole because it will give them more the more they work. While a GST saps effort and initiative, tax credits offer rewards for both.
The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and everyone in the government paint the GST as a magic elixir for all of Australia's ills. On the contrary, if these bills are passed then the GST will become Australia's chief cause for complaint. This is a government, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, that has confused stubbornness with courage. The courageous thing to do would be to take a step back, recognise the inadequacies of this package and fix them. Without taking such action, the passage of these bills will intro 
 duce a tax that will become a yoke around our country's neck and around the neck of our people from which we will never be able to gain relief.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—If we were simply to listen to all those members of the opposition who have taken part in this debate on A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  and related bills, we could be forgiven for thinking that this debate was simply about the introduction of a GST. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak in this debate because this is a debate about introducing a new tax system. It is about introducing a new tax system to get rid of an outdated, outmoded tax system designed in the 1930s. We are now about to move into the next century and yet the opposition would have every Australian individual, business and exporter working with a tax system that is completely and utterly outmoded. It is for those reasons that I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak in this debate, which is about the introduction at long last of a new tax system.
I would like to talk about the need to introduce this new tax system. The most unfair tax in our tax system today surely has to be the wholesale sales tax. This is a tax that builds into every layer of production, process, transport and marketing of our goods produced in this country. It is a hidden and very unfair tax. The average consumer has only to walk down the street of their local shopping centre and walk into their supermarket, newsagent, electrical goods store or any of the variety of stores there to find that hundreds and hundreds of normal everyday items have concealed within their prices the wholesale sales tax. It is an arbitrary tax. There are seven different rates of this tax. It applies arbitrarily to a range of goods. As I said, it compounds into the cost of the good.
The losers from this wholesale sales tax are, firstly, the Australian consumers. They are the ones who are duped by this most iniquitous tax. But our small businesses are also disadvantaged by this tax and a whole range of other taxes which we are going to get rid of in this new tax system. Because of these unfair taxes those businesses are made un 
 competitive. As several members from the government have pointed out, the exporters in our country are also disadvantaged. It is very hard to compete in the global international markets. I can name many exporters from within my own electorate who have fought tooth and nail to gain entry into some of these important niche exporter markets—especially some of our producers in aquaculture, a new industry for many of our primary producers. Many exporters have really had to fight hard to get a foot into some of these niche markets, and they are being disadvantaged.
I have heard speeches in this place by every member on both sides of this chamber exhorting our exporters to get out there and do better. But, by opposing the introduction of this tax, every member of the opposition is saying to our exporters, `We are going to tie one hand behind your back. We are going to make you uncompetitive. We are going to disadvantage you against all of the other countries that are your competitors in that international marketplace.' That is what every member of the opposition is doing—disadvantaging our exporters and making them uncompetitive.
As well as that, every member of the opposition who has stood up in this place and has opposed this legislation is disadvantaging all of our hardworking people out there who are trying to earn a living. As an illustration of this, recently I was in a small town called Kinglake in my electorate where I was approached by a man who wanted to complain bitterly about the tax system. He was an average worker trying to support a wife and three children. They were a single income family and he told me that his income could not support that family. They could not even afford to send the children off on school camps. He nominated the reason why he was falling behind in society as being that he was losing so much of his salary in tax. He, like so many others, made a point of coming up to me and saying, `It is not worth our while to work any overtime because we simply lose it in tax.'
In the brief time that I have available today I have given just some of the reasons why this new tax system is so needed. It is needed 
 for our individual workers, it is needed for our small business people and it is needed for our exporters. This government is prepared to introduce this new tax system.
The last speaker, the member for Prospect, was talking about the compensation that is contained within this new tax system. Let us have a look at some of this compensation. The first method of compensation to all Australians under the new tax system will be to ensure that 81 per cent of all of our taxpayers will never pay more than 30 cents in the dollar in tax. That has to be one of the best incentives of all time. As well as that, we are increasing and making far more simple the family assistance within this legislation. For example, we are doubling the extra $1,000 tax-free threshold for each dependent child under the family tax initiative to $2,000, which is the equivalent of $140 per year per child. These are real benefits to families. We are doubling the extra $2,500 tax-free threshold for single income families with a dependent child under the age of five. That $5,000 tax-free threshold means $350 per year per family. These are real initiatives.
There are others, including an increase in the maximum assistance for child care for low income families by $7.50 a week, an increase in social security benefits and an up-front increase in allowances by four per cent. This means that those receiving any form of income support are going to have that increase long before the GST is introduced. The assets test for pensioners is being increased by 2.5 per cent. We are making sure, importantly, that all of our citizens who are receiving income support pensions are always going to be ahead by 1.5 per cent.
In stark contrast to what the opposition ever did in government, we are making sure that those on income support are always 1.5 per cent ahead. They are not going to be in catch-up mode. By the stance the opposition are taking with regard to this legislation, they are denying ordinary Australians the advantage of those tax cuts. They are denying them assistance to families. They are denying small businesses the chance to be competitive and to get ahead. They are denying our exporters the chance to be competitive.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I have a number of amendments. We are required to move them sequentially as a result of the government bungling the way they have brought forward this package. To give some indication as to the duplicity of this government, the night before yesterday we had an agreement 
 about times for this debate that would have enabled more time for us to speak. That was broken within 24 hours unilaterally by them insisting upon a new order of business being introduced at 9.30 a.m. today.
We have the position where there are nine of these bills before the House, three of them we support or, depending on what happens with one of our second reading amendments, four we could support. Because the government is requiring us to vote for them in a block in one motion, we are forced to oppose them. I made approaches through the office of the Leader of the House to try and get procedurally a separation out of those four bills. I think it is important to demonstrate that there can be agreement on both sides of the House about sensible tax reform, and we do support three of these bills and maybe a fourth bill subject to the debate.
However, they are not letting us vote with them. They are not letting us demonstrate support for their position. Why won't they do it? Why are they so hung up on the stupidity of this procedure that they will not allow us to do it? This highlights the frustration the opposition has with the way this government manages the affairs of the House, particularly on such an important package of measures as this.
There is a package of nine bills here. I will do what I can in the time that I have left—only 10 minutes—to go through the six amendments, because I understand that the Speaker requires them to be read in. I am not sure whether time permits me to do that, but I will do my best. The first of these bills is the  A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Excise) Bill 1998 . This bill imposes a new 10 per cent tax on almost everything. On behalf of the opposition, I move the amendment to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Excise) Bill 1998 :
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government specifically for its proposed excise imposition and for seeking to impose a GST on Australian families which will inevitably rise over time 
 as it has risen in almost every country in which a GST has been introduced; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for attempting to deceive the Australian people that there is a constitutionally valid mechanism which will ensure that the GST rate will not rise over time"".
The next bill is A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Customs) Bill 1998 . This bill makes it a custom to pay 10 per cent on almost everything every time you fork out money from the cradle to the grave, turning a new 10 per cent tax into a new custom in this country, but not telling people the amount.
—I am loath to interrupt the honourable member for Hotham, but the chair would have no objection if you wished to move your amendments in the terms circulated if that would suit your convenience.
—That is very kind of you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will go through them, because I think the amendments are important in themselves, but if I run out of time in the minuscule time that is available to us, I will adopt your course of action. In relation to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Customs) Bill 1998 , which makes it a custom to pay 10 per cent, I move the following amendment:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government specifically for its proposed customs  imposition and for seeking to impose a GST on Australian families which will inevitably rise over time as it has risen in almost every country in which a GST has been introduced; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for attempting to deceive the Australian people that there is a constitutionally valid mechanism which will ensure that the GST rate will not rise over time"".
The third bill is the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—General) Bill 1998 . This bill puts a huge new imposition on the Australian public and on Australian families. It imposes a 10 per cent tax on almost everything they buy. Every time they buy a good or a service, the government 
 will have its hand in their pockets taking out one-eleventh. That is what this bill imposes on the Australian public. I move the amendment to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—General) Bill 1998 :
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government specifically for its proposed tax imposition proposal and for seeking to impose a GST on Australian families which will inevitably rise over time as it has risen in almost every country in which a GST has been introduced; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for attempting to deceive the Australian people that there is a constitutionally valid mechanism which will ensure that the GST rate will not rise over time"".
The next bill is A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Administration) Bill 1998 . This bill imposes a huge administrative burden on at least 1.4 million small businesses and family businesses, turning them into government tax collectors and burdening them with an administrative nightmare. That is what this bill does. I move the amendment to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Administration) Bill 1998 :
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government for seeking to impose a huge new unnecessary taxation compliance burden on Australian small business which will involve, inter alia, large start-up costs, significant ongoing costs, an erosion of the competitive position of small business relative to big business which are not nearly compensated for by the claimed cashflow effects of the GST; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for introducing legislation which is very complex which adds to the complexity of the tax system, rather than simplifying the system"".
The next bill that I propose to move an amendment on is the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Bill 1998 . This bill involves Australia making a huge transition from being the strongest economy in the world; an economy which is served by a taxation system which was developed, changed and reviewed by successive 
 Labor governments over 13 years, producing an economy in which we fundamentally changed the structures, the approach and the strength of the nation with low inflation. We did it with a tax system that, from time to time, needed review and repair, but we made those reviews and repairs without a GST.
We are now being asked to make a transition from being the strongest economy in the world—no system is `broke' here. The IMF says that this economy has performed well over the past seven years, and Labor was in power for two-thirds of those years. This government inherited a system that even it could not muck up in a hurry. This bill will commence the process of mucking it up. This bill is unfair; this tax is unfair. It is bad for the economy; it is bad for jobs. I move the amendment to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Bill 1998 :
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House condemns the Government for imposing complex, anomaly-ridden transitional arrangements concerning the GST on Australian business which will inevitably involve competitive distortions and costly compliance burdens"".
I have only one amendment in relation to the next group of four bills—A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998 , A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998 , A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Bill 1998 , and A New Tax System (Australian Business Number Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 —and that is an amendment to A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Bill 1998 . I move the amendment to A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Bill 1998 :
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government for not going far enough in its tax package in cracking down on tax avoidance;
(2)	 calls on the Government to tighten the legislation and administration of the Prescribed Payments System (PPS) system to ensure that only genuine self-employed people are within the PPS system; and 

(3)	 condemns the Government's failure to introduce legislation abolishing provisional tax"".
Our complaint here is simply that this bill does not go far enough. We agree with it as far as it goes, but we believe it should go further. As I said at the opening of the debate on this particular group of bills, there is a lot in common between both sides of this House on what is needed for taxation reform. We should have been entering into sensible debate and dialogue to get agreement on how we can repair the current system. We think that it can be repaired; we think it can be reviewed. We think it can be done sensibly and all of it without introducing a GST. This government has given no opportunity for such a debate in this chamber. (Time expired)

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I second all the amendments moved by the member for Hotham. I will also make a comment, given that the government has moved so quickly in this place once again to deny the rights of members of parliament to debate what it maintains is the most far-reaching and important piece of legislation dealing with taxation reform introduced into this place. If, in fact, it was so important to it, one would have thought more hours would have been made available to us all to debate this matter.
I will make specific reference to a couple of bills that are a part of this package. The simple fact is that there are elements of this package which the opposition agrees with, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said. In respect of the effect the GST will have on small business, let me say this: in the course of the last parliament I went around Australia, as the shadow minister with this portfolio responsibility, talking to small businesses. They said that the last thing they needed, particularly in micro-business, was an impost on them in terms of the amount of bookkeeping that would be required and the additional hours they would have to put in after a long day at the office, at their work or at whatever they were doing, just to maintain the records so that the tax police from the Australian 
 Taxation Office would not be on their case all the time. The simple fact is that small business do not want this sort of taxation regime. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Labor has never shied away from taxation reform if it was necessary.
—Order! The time allotted for the second reading of orders of the day Nos 2 to 10 has expired. The original question was that the bills be now read a second time. To this the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved amendments in respect of certain of the bills that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—I appreciate being able to speak briefly on this legislation. As agreed, because of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in six minutes time I have to make a presentation elsewhere in this building.
This is the second leg of the tax reform package which delivers the transport fuel tax cut worth $3½ billion to Australians—wherever they live in Australia—to the Australian economy, to exporters and to consumers in rural and regional Australia. It is the breakthrough which I have worked for over many years and which I thought we could get close to in the lead-up to the 1993 elections.
It is a privilege to stand here as a member of the coalition federal government with a mandate to deliver a new tax system: a goods and services tax; the abolition of wholesale sales tax; and the abolition of a huge amount of diesel fuel excise tax right across this country.
I point out to the House that the diesel fuel excise—the transport fuel tax—reductions 
 provided for in this legislation will apply not only in respect of road, important as that is, but also in respect of rail operations. The diesel fuel is consumed by the Australian railway systems, which are variously government and private enterprise railways, across the big system of Queensland, a narrow-gauge system, and the systems of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, as well as a private enterprise rail, including iron ore and coal haulage, where it has not been electrified.
This measure will be a huge boost for rail transport as we enter the beyond 2000 period and it is one which has been long overdue. Governments on both sides of this parliament have hit hard against rail over the years. They have applied to rail a diesel fuel excise tax regime which was very unfair. I am proud of the fact that, as part of the tax reform package, there is now to be a huge reduction in fuel excise applying to rail. Equally, there is going to be a big reduction in fuel excise applying to road. That will give consumers across country Australia and exporters right across Australia a chance to have a far more effective approach and a lower cost transport system to apply upon the implementation of this tax reform package on 1 July.
The first leg of the fuel equation was delivered under subdivision 123-A and division 123, which deals with diesel fuel credits, in a new tax system bill. The second leg comes with A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Excise) Bill. I note that the opposition has previously moved some amendments in relation to the excise bill. I reiterate that the government stands absolutely behind this part of the package which gives the country areas of Australia a fair go, at long last, in relation to transport fuel taxes.
I note that the Democrats have already signalled out for particular opposition the tax system changes in respect of diesel fuel. They have not done their homework on this. The more efficient you can make rail in this country, the more contribution you can make to the greenhouse equation. The more efficient you can make road in this country, again the better it is for the greenhouse equation.
I recognise that over the years the Democrats and others have pursued a particular agenda with regard to pollution, environmental considerations and the like. The bonus of our tax reform package, and one of the absolutely core parts of that package, is the transport fuel tax reform, because that will help us along the pathway of a more efficient transport system and give people living beyond Mildura and Mount Isa, at long last, a fair go with both the cost of supermarket goods on the shelves and the costs of exports from those regions to the ports, the airports and to the world.
I strongly commend the new tax system package of legislation going through the House of Representatives this day and I particularly commend the transport fuel tax reform. I am proud of it, the Treasurer is proud of it and the government is proud of it. It is long overdue.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I move:
(1)	  Clause 4, page 2 (line 12), omit ""10%"", substitute ""0%"".
I move this amendment for two reasons: one to demonstrate how simple it is for this government to change the tax rate by a simple decision of the parliament to change the rate which they said was locked in by the so-called `fantastic mechanism', to quote the Treasurer; and, second, to reinforce the point that, if we have already started to see the government, under pressure, agree to extending the exemptions to the GST, why not take it to the fullest extent and exempt everything? What they could have on the books is the technicality of a GST and no rate.
I want to go to this issue of the lock-in of the mechanism because this was heralded with great triumph by the Treasurer when his package was announced. He referred to it, and I mentioned the words before, as a `fantastic mechanism' for making sure that the rate once struck is locked in. But where is this fantastic mechanism in the legislation? The only reference one can find in the 1,000 pages of bill and explanatory memorandum is contained in clause 1-3(b) which says:
The Parliament acknowledges that the Commonwealth:  

. . .              . . .             . . .
(b) will maintain the rate and base of the GST in accordance with the Agreement on Principles for the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations endorsed at the Special Premiers' Conference in Canberra on 13 November 1998.
So here we have this fantastic mechanism being based on an agreement on principles—the principles of which still have to be thrashed out and which, when I asked the Treasurer in this parliament where his mechanism would be, he said we would have to wait on.
What is he hiding? If in fact he has got this fantastic watertight mechanism developed, why isn't it in his legislation? Why isn't it the subject of scrutiny in the Senate where the inquiries are taking place? We know this government will not answer the question. But the issue is: where have they guaranteed the lock-in?
To demonstrate how simple it is to change the rate, all that is required is a bill to be introduced into this parliament. In the schedule to that bill—called a taxation reform act 1999—is a two-line entry. The first is to repeal the part that levies the rate at 10 per cent and, secondly, to omit `10 per cent' and substitute `15 per cent'.
Let us not have any of this nonsense about the veto powers. A simple act of parliament will increase this GST. Why is it so simple to do it? Because we are demonstrating it here today. We are demonstrating by an amendment that you can turn the rate from 10 to zero. It is validly before the parliament, and the parliament will decide whether it gets up. Remember that Labor will be voting against the GST and the coalition will be voting for it. There will be 10 per cent on almost everything you buy. From the cradle to the grave, there will be a new 10 per cent tax on everything.
That is what they want to impose, and they will have you believe that the rate will not increase. Do not believe them. Do not believe them because the rate can be changed by a simple act of this parliament. If anyone doubts that this can happen, of the 25 countries that have introduced a GST, 22 have put it up. And another one—Switzerland—is 
 about to put its up. Do not believe them when they say that the rate will not rise.
We are still looking for the `fantastic mechanism' of lock-in, and so is Jeff Kennett. Jeff Kennett has written to the Prime Minister saying, `You have dudded me, Prime Minister. You told me that there was a lock-in mechanism.' (Extension of time granted) But this is not the first time that Jeff Kennett has attacked this legislation. He did it again today by saying he wants the 10 per cent disclosed on all receipts. That is something that this government have just voted down. Not only are they imposing a 10 per cent tax; there is also no mechanism to ensure it cannot rise and there is no mechanism to identify the precise amount. This amendment should be supported.

(1)	  Clause 4, page 2 (line 12), omit ""10%"", substitute ""0%"".
The GST is the most unfair tax that has ever been thought of, conceived or applied in this country. The opposition completely opposes the GST because it will be unfair to low and middle income earners and unfair to Australia's pensioners who have worked all their lives and made a great contribution to this country.
Older Australians deserve dignity, respect and peace of mind. What will they get in response? If this legislation goes through, they will get a 10 per cent tax on just about everything they buy and use. It is a disgrace that this parliament should even be considering imposing a regressive, harsh, unfair tax on ordinary Australians and on decent Australian pensioners. Our older citizens, who have done so much for this country, now have to face the prospect in their later years—after having worked all their lives and paid taxes all their lives—of being hit with a new tax which will affect not only their future incomes but also the value of their savings.

That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House:
(1)	 condemns the Government for proposing to replace the Wholesale Sales Tax with a regressive GST;
(2)	 notes the advantages of the WST which include no tax on services, the exclusion of necessities such as basic food, clothing, footwear, health, and building materials, flexibility, a multiple rate structure to enable differential tax rates to be applied to different goods where appropriate, low administrative costs for government, very low compliance costs for most businesses as only 75,000 taxing points are needed compared to 1.4 million taxing points for the GST;

(4)	 notes that a GST, if introduced, cannot be maintained on top of the WST, as this will result in an unreasonable increase in the indirect tax burden on ordinary Australians"".
The Treasurer says this country needs tax reform. I agree with that—the system does need constant reform. But the simple fact is that the need for tax reform does not mean that the only option is a GST, nor does it mean that the existing tax system is broken.
Is the tax system broken? This is what is often asserted. Not according to the Treasurer, who just the other day admitted that it is not broken. Not according to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who has just released a document showing revenue $5 billion higher in the first four months of this year than in the same period of the previous year. Not according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which, just yesterday, released data showing that growth in total tax across the country in 1997-98 was 5.2 per cent, or $8¼ billion.
Being in surplus is a rare occurrence in most OECD countries, but not in Australia. Including this year, the Commonwealth has been in surplus for six of the last 12 years. Labor delivered four successive surpluses in the late eighties and early nineties. Now the 
 budget is back in surplus again and is forecast to be in surplus into the foreseeable future—all this without a GST.
The supposed notion that the sales tax base is crumbling is unsustainable. The facts demonstrate a very different story. Rather than declining, sales tax has maintained a very constant proportion of total revenue and GDP over the last decade. Australia's fiscal position is sound due to Labor's sound economic management and tax reform. Australia's tax mix—that is, the relative share of direct and indirect taxes—has indirect taxes at around 30 per cent of total tax revenue, comparable to the OECD average.
But the most damning indictment of the claim that the system is broken comes from new modelling released just today. According to that modelling of the government tax package, an analysis based on the Monash model:
The Treasury has asserted that a major change in the tax mix is necessary because the present array of indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements. However the Treasury provides no explicit revenue forecasts.
I underline that point again. The Treasury, according to the Monash people, provides no explicit revenue forecasts. I continue with the quote:
At this stage of our research we have found no evidence to support the Treasury's proposition. In our basecase forecasts, indirect taxes grow at about the same rate as GDP, even in the absence of increases in rates of indirect tax.
The Treasury and the government will not produce their modelling. Try as we have to get that modelling produced, they will not. They are hiding it like they are hiding so much else in relation to this package, but we will insist upon this material being made available in the Senate inquiry. But here is independent modelling debunking the assertion of the Treasurer.
In short, the system is not broke, and it is not going to break. There is no need for the large increase in indirect taxes being proposed by Mr Costello. Australia simply chooses to raise its indirect taxes in a different way from other countries. This system works well in Australia, is fairer to ordinary people and to 
 families and should not be abandoned for a GST. The truth is that, while the coalition desperately want a GST, Australia does not need one. The Treasurer says he wants to replace a 1930s tax system with a GST—a value added tax. But the idea of a value added tax was first advocated in the United States by T.S. Adams in 1911. He wants to replace a 60-year-old tax with an 80-year-old one. He claims that we should have a new tax for the new century, but what he is proposing is a 1911 tax. Some reform!
He forgets to point out that, in Australia's case, the transition will be harder than in other countries because we have no turnover tax and therefore no large administrative infrastructure to collect the tax from a large number of production units. But, as much as the Treasurer would like to characterise it, Labor is not about defending a 1930s tax system. Labor has already modernised Australia's tax system.
We make no apology for concentrating on equity when we reform the system, and we continue to insist that taxation reform be fair. His case is that the sales tax was introduced in 1930 and therefore it should be repealed and replaced with a GST which was developed in the 1950s in Europe. On that basis, all excise, customs duties and income taxes, both personal and corporate, would also be repealed because they all predate the sales tax. But the truth is that we do not have a 1930s tax system. Our tax system is almost unrecognisable from that of the 1930s. Successive Labor governments have constantly updated it and Labor fully modernised it through our period of office.
The 1985 tax summit agreed to significant sales tax reform, and in 1992 the sales tax legislation was substantially streamlined. Labor in government also repaired the direct tax base which was crumbling, a tax base we inherited from the man who is now Prime Minister—bottom of the harbour, John Winston Howard. Remember him when he was Treasurer—and all those rorts, all those bottom of the harbour schemes? That is the tax system that we inherited.
Labor's major reforms include the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the petro 
 leum resource rent tax, the taxation of foreign source income and cracking down on tax havens. Collectively, these fair, progressive measures contributed around $7 billion this year to better public services without impacting unfairly on ordinary Australians and ordinary PAYE taxpayers. Other reforms, such as the superannuation taxation regime, have further increased this contribution to around $10 billion.
The coalition oppose the vast majority of these fair, modernising taxation reforms. We all remember the now Treasurer, the member for Higgins, and his desperate attempts to block Labor's measures to crack down on tax avoidance through employee share ownership schemes. I quote him:
We've knocked off the last two and we plan to knock this one off as well. We will be opposing root and branch Labor's latest proposal.
So today we have in charge of our tax system the tax rorter's friend, now Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello, and old Barnacle Bill from the bottom of the harbour as Prime Minister. That is who is proposing this taxation reform—and what form have they got? Appalling form.
The real issue in taxation is keeping the direct tax base in good repair. That is where the focus should be with the government, not increasing the cost of living for ordinary families. Labor has demonstrated that, if the government is vigilant in keeping tax avoidance in check, we do not need an unfair tax on necessities. That remains the case today.
The wholesale sales tax is a better tax than the GST. Its structure is very flexible and can react quickly to urgent situations. Two recent examples come to mind. When the High Court held that the business franchise fees of the states were unconstitutional, what did this Treasurer do? He used the sales tax to impose a 15 per cent surcharge on wine and other alcoholic products to recover the threatened revenue. This increased the number of rates from six to seven. Let me repeat that. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, increased the number of sales tax rates from six to seven. But it was very effective also in dealing with the unprecedented fiscal crisis confronting the states. 
Were any of the states criticising the sales tax then? No. Because it helped to save their budgets in a relatively simple and effective manner. Furthermore, when some of the states threatened to renege on the uniform gun laws, what did the Prime Minister do? He threatened that a punitive level of sales tax would be imposed on certain firearms if the states broke the agreement. So, for the Prime Minister's greatest achievement in his first term, he enlisted the flexible multirate sales tax. These options are simply not available under the flat rate GST.
So sales tax has a great flexibility as a policy tool, and it has been used by both the current Prime Minister and the current Treasurer in precisely this mode. The wholesale sales tax is an input tax, just as his tax on financial services and home rentals is an input tax. A multiple rate structure in an indirect tax is not a fault; rather, it is an advantage. His input taxes, just as wholesale sales tax—the very thing he berates—he now adopts in his tax package: input taxing.
Mr Costello has also criticised the seven-rate structure of the wholesale sales tax. But we should remember that the GST will have up to five rates—nil; 10 per cent; probably around four to five per cent, depending on the flow-on impact for input taxed industries; and others for luxury cars and for wine. Sales tax has seven rates, of which Peter Costello produced two, and the tax he berates he now adopts. In fact, the Treasurer is a serial taxer and a serial hypocrite to boot!
Labor believes that necessities should not be taxed—food, clothing, footwear, electricity, gas, telephone and health care. We also believe that luxuries should be taxed at a higher rate than ordinary items. All of this can be achieved by sales tax. What should also be understood is that the flat rate GST structure proposed here is not the norm. Most countries that have a GST have a multirate structure. They believe that differing goods and services should be taxed at differing rates. Just some examples of countries with differential rates in the OECD include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swit 
 zerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. We should also consider the range over which these exemptions fall.

—Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. The ministers will stop interjecting. The honourable member for Hotham will address the chair and address the question before the chair which is that this bill be now read a second time.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Examples of consumption for which GST exemptions have been given include telecoms, legal services, ferry, road and bridge tolls, standard municipal services, passengers, transport, sport, burials, sale of new buildings, artists and travel agents. None of those attracts or—
—On a point of order: we had an agreement in place that there would be 10 minutes allowed for the Treasurer to complete on this bill, and the shadow Treasurer and member for Hotham is breaking that deal. I ask him to keep to that deal.
—Order! The minister will resume his seat. There is no point of order.
—None of those I have listed attracts sales tax. So, rather than being out of step with the rest of the world, Australia's exemptions in its indirect tax system are consistent with general overseas practice. 
 Food is not generally taxed at the standard rate either.
The efficiency of sales tax is also impressive. For the 1996-97 year, almost 95 per cent of the revenue is provided by a little over 8,000 taxpayers. These firms will provide around $14 billion in sales tax this year. Contrast this with the GST that will increase the number of taxpayers from 75,000 to 1.4 million. The initial cost of the GST approach is estimated as $7,000 by the National Tax Accountants Association. This represents about $10 billion in costs in the first year, with huge ongoing costs as well.
The government claims that sales tax is a tax on manufacturing and the GST spreads the burden to the services sector. But you cannot look at these issues in isolation. The services sector will have this GST imposed on everything that they do. This is the country's fastest growing sector in terms of employment. Of the two million new jobs created in Labor's 13 years, practically every one was generated in the service sector. The GST is a tax on service industries and a tax on jobs.
Government ministers say a payroll tax is bad because it is a tax on jobs but, in the same breath, they propose a new $30 billion tax on those jobs. This is going to have interesting implications for the Ralph review of business taxation. For, while sales tax is weighted more heavily on manufacturers, miners and farmers, so are the various tax concessions and outlays measures. Last year, manufacturers, farmers and miners received $2.6 billion in budgetary assistance—75 per cent of total industry assistance. In proportion to its size, the services sector received just a fraction. So manufacturers are compensated for a sales tax with significant concessions—tax expenditures. Service industries do not receive the tax concessions, but they also do not pay the tax. So the GST is going to change all of that. Service industries which will be paying 10 per cent on everything will demand significant compensation. They will be the ones pushing for the 30 per cent company tax rate goal. Note the word is `goal'. `Goal' is an even more discredited commitment than a non-core promise. These people will demand, through the Ralph re 
 view, reductions in the company tax rate. They will argue that with the GST manufacturers will no longer need special assistance measures. It will be an interesting debate and we will be following it intensely.
This week we have witnessed the disappearance of the Treasurer's great anomaly-free tax system. We can score as many points on the GST anomalies as he can on the wholesale sales tax. But the truth is that all indirect taxes are going to have anomalies, particularly where there are exemptions. They arise when the boundaries for those exemptions are drawn. The point about sales tax is that the task of administering these issues and sorting out the anomalies does not fall to the ordinary small businessman and woman.
The wholesale sales tax does an effective job and it should not be repealed. It is a better, fairer, more efficient tax than the GST. Unfortunately, the GST has now been passed by the House despite Labor's best efforts. Labor will redouble those efforts to have the GST rejected by the Senate, but we are now presented with a series of bills which, however inadequately, are designed to compensate for the GST—
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: there was very clearly an agreement between the opposition and the government in relation to the conduct of this debate. This is a flagrant breach of it.
—There is no point of order.
—They are designed to compensate for the GST by removing sales tax, introducing personal income tax, and various other compensation measures. It would be a double blow to the Australian community to be hit with a GST but retain the wholesale sales tax and receive no compensation. Labor will therefore not oppose these measures in the House—
—On a point of order, there was a clear agreement between the opposition and the government in relation to the conduct of this debate, and this is a flagrant breach of it. 
—Your point of order is not a point of order. It is not relevant to the debate.
—We call on the government to address any perceived anomalies in the wholesale sales tax rather than impose a new 10 per cent tax on almost everything. I point out, however, that if we succeed in defeating the GST in the Senate, the compensation measures will become unnecessary—
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member for Hotham made an agreement with us about speaking time for the Treasurer.
—There is no point of order. The minister will resume his seat.
—I will address the point of order, because this government has broken agreement after agreement on the time that we were going to have for debate.
—The point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, which I am raising with you, at 12 minutes before 2 o'clock, is that there was a clear agreement between the opposition and the government.
—Order! Resume your seat. I regret to inform the Chief Government Whip that agreements made between parties are not part of the standing orders and you cannot raise a point of order on it.
—And the abolition of sales tax will be opposed.
—I rise on a point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, is this another point of order on the same point? If so, you should adopt the Speaker's ruling and—
—Why don't you keep to the agreement?
—Why don't you keep to your agreement?
—Order! Both members at the table will resume their seats. Before I call the minister, I have already ruled that there is no point of order regarding agreements made informally between the 
 parties. So if you wish to raise a point of order, it had better not be on that one.
—My point of order is on relevance. The member for Hotham is not speaking to the appropriate bill; he is right off track. He is talking about the overall package and, therefore, I ask you to bring him back to the substance of the debate, which is an end to sales tax, which the member for Hotham is opposed to.
—I thank the minister.
—On a point of order in respect of the arrangements for today, Mr Deputy Speaker—
—Order! It being 1.50 p.m., the time allotted for the remaining stages of the bill has expired. The question is that the bill be now read a second time. All those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I think the ayes have it.
—The noes have it.
—Is a division required?
—Yes.
—I have only had one call. Do you want a division or not?
—Yes, on the amendment.
—You have not moved the amendment.
—I did.
—No. You have not moved the amendment. It was not seconded. If you did move it, it has not been seconded. Order! It has not been seconded and therefore lapses.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an absolute joke. I moved this amendment.
—No. Resume your seat.
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it is this: did you call for the seconder before you ruled my motion out of order?
—No, I have no obligation to.
—You are required to do that.
—The rules and regulations for the House required me, at 1.50 p.m., to put the question despite the fact that you still had not finished and you still had not had somebody second your amendment. The question is: do you want a division?
—Yes, I want a division on the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—No. There is no amendment. I will put the question again so everybody is quite clear. The question is that this bill be now read a second time.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (END OF SALES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I also have an amendment to move in relation to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Bill 1998, and I would hope, unlike the ruling in relation to the previous one, that this can be before the House.
We oppose the government's intention to compensate people through the measures that are contained in its taxation reform legislation—its income tax bills—because they are about compensating an unfair tax. But as I indicated in relation to the last bill, we cannot allow people not to have compensation if the GST is passed. We recognise that it is being passed in this chamber. We will be doing everything that is necessary to oppose it in the other place, in which case this compensation measure is not necessary.
But let me just say how this government has mucked up their strategy. They wanted a 
 position today where they had Labor voting for the retention of a wholesale sales tax, and they also wanted a position whereby we would vote down their tax cuts. They will not get that. Why? Because they did not move the bills in the right order. Had they moved the wholesale sales tax and the tax cut bills before they introduced the GST, then of course we would have been required to do that. Blind Freddy could have seen it but not these moles sitting on that side of the chamber. These people are hopeless tacticians led by Peter Reith on instructions from Peter Costello, who cannot even get the order right.
But what have we achieved today? We have achieved the position whereby all members on that side of the House are on the record voting for the imposition of a 10 per cent GST on almost everything. Every time people go into a shop Peter Costello, with his hand in your pocket, will be taking 10 per cent.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are discussing a new tax system for personal income tax cuts, and the member for Hotham is talking about the bills that have already been passed. I ask him to get back to the substance of the bill which is under debate.
—Resume your seat. There is no point of order. We are talking in cognate.
—I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. So the government members have voted for the imposition of a 10 per cent tax on almost everything—Peter Costello, with his hand in your pocket every time you go into a shop and purchase something—and these bills are about trying to compensate people for that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Hotham clearly should not address the Treasurer by his name but rather by his seat.
—I thank the honourable member for Moreton. I have drawn the honourable member for Hotham's attention to it, and I am sure he will refer to all ministers and members correctly.
—I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. Not only do they have a 10 per cent tax on 
 everything but they do not want to tell people what that amounts to—dividing everything by 11. Even the Treasurer could not do it yesterday, but he expects the punters to be out there doing it every time they purchase something. The minister for consumer affairs not wanting to tell consumers how much tax they are paying? It is dereliction of duty, Treasurer. We are having to do your job for you. We are having to introduce legislation so that people know exactly what they are paying.
—I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that you bring the member for Hotham back to the substance of the debate.
—Resume your seat. There is no point of order. The practice of this House is that when bills are under the guillotine it is regarded as a cognate debate and it is wide-ranging.
—They should know it, because it is a mechanism they introduced and mucked up.
—Point of order!
—I do hope that the honourable member for Moreton is not going to canvass the points of order that I have already given a ruling on.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, no. Out of great respect to you and the position you hold, I wish to raise a further point of order. It seems to me that, I would hope unintentionally, the member for Hotham is accusing you, by way of his delivery, of certain things. He is talking across the table; he is not speaking through the chair.
—There is no point of order. I must say to you and to all other members that if there is any need for me to protect myself I am quite capable of doing it.
—We oppose this proposition because of the fiscal profligacy of the government's planned personal tax cuts, as evidenced by the dramatic impact of the tax package on the forecast Commonwealth budget, reducing the underlying balance in the year 2000-2001 by $4.76 billion. We oppose it because of its unfairness in that 50 per cent of the tax cuts go to the richest 20 per cent of 
 taxpayers, with the other 50 per cent going to the other 80 per cent of taxpayers. The other deficiency in this package is the failure to adequately address the disincentives to move from welfare to work and to consider Labor's alternative approach through earned income tax credits. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House requests that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to produce a fairer tax system with no GST, and in particular to overcome the following deficiencies:
the fiscal profligacy of the Government's planned personal tax cuts, as evidenced by the dramatic impact of the tax package on the forecast Commonwealth budget, reducing the underlying balance in the year 2000-01 by $4.76 billion;
the unfairness of the tax cuts in that 50% of the tax cuts go to the richest 20% of taxpayers, with the other 50% going to the other 80% of taxpayers; and
the failure to adequately address the disincentives to move from welfare to work and to consider Labor's alternative approach through earned income tax credits"".
What you have to understand is this: this is a government that is having to introduce these tax cuts because it has also introduced a new unfair anti-job tax. The Treasurer likes to rail forth about no-one paying more than 30 cents in the tax dollar on marginal tax rates. They will. They will be paying 10 cents on every dollar. On every dollar they spend they will be paying 10 per cent more. That is what they will be paying.
So add to the 30 per cent the other 10 per cent and then people will start to wake up to what they have here. It is an unfair tax, and these tax cuts are about buying that very unfairness. But they do not do it properly. They do not compensate properly because the assumptions on which the compensation is based are flawed. They assume a full flowthrough of the taxes that will be abolished. We will demonstrate in the Senate that that will not occur. The 1.9 per cent inflation rate is a bodgie one, and if the inflation rate is bad the compensation package is more skewed. I will return to this subject after question time.
—Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with 
 standing order 101A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (PERSONAL INCOME TAX CUTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen modelling released today by the Centre for Policy Studies, Monash University, on the government's tax package? Has he seen their finding that:
The Treasury has asserted that a major change in the tax mix is necessary because the present array of indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements . . .
At this stage of our research we have found no evidence to support the Treasury's proposition.
In our basecase forecasts, indirect taxes grow at about the same rate as GDP, even in the absence of increases in rates of indirect tax.
Treasurer, if the Monash economists do not believe that the tax system is broken, how do you expect to con the rest of the community?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation Reform: Indirect Taxes</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—I welcome the question. I would have welcomed the opportunity to stand in the debate if the member for Hotham had not broken the agreement that prevented me from doing so. So I am glad that he has given me this opportunity to participate. I thank him for that opportunity. I presume the premise of his question is that the tax system is not broken. As I recall, he said rather rhetorically, `If Monash doesn't think it is broken, why are you changing it?' If the Labor Party does not think the tax system is broken, you can stand and defend it to the last man and woman, but you will not have us supporting you.
—On a point of order, Mr Speaker: did not the Treasurer admit last week on radio that the tax system is not broken?
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that that is not a point of order and he cannot expect me to entertain that sort of point of order.
—Okay, you are reinforcing your point that you do not think the tax system is broken. You will have trouble convincing Australians of that because Australians who are living under huge marginal income tax rates of 43 cents in the dollar, facing the prospect of paying 47 cents in the dollar, do think the tax system is broken. We know Labor is a party of reaction. Labor can only oppose; it cannot build. So Labor has to maintain this pretence that the tax system works because it will not engage in reforming it.
It was not always the case that Labor opposed tax reform. When it had decent leadership—when it had any leadership—back in the mid-1980s, it used to support tax reform. Who supported tax reform? The current Leader of the Opposition and the member for Holt, when they were in the Keating Labor Party, supported a 12½ per cent broad based consumption tax—as I have already told the House—in a booklet put out back in 1985. I had to go to great lengths to find that booklet because I thought all of the copies had been destroyed. I am not sure that troglodytes like the member for Hotham endorsed a broad based consumption tax, but it was certainly endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Holt back in 1985.
Back in the 1980s when Labor was supporting a broad based consumption tax, indirect tax represented 7.2 per cent of GDP and now it only represents 5.8 per cent. So Labor was arguing to broaden the indirect tax base right back in the 1980s when it was substantially higher than it is now. Back in the 1980s, direct taxation on individuals and companies was only 16.4 per cent and now it is 17.2 per cent. Therefore, back in the 1980s Labor was supporting reducing the burden of personal income tax even though it was less than it is today. 
If you wanted to make sure you have a sustainable position in relation to the tax base, you would be broadening the indirect tax base. This point was made by somebody in debate in the Main Committee last night when he said:
The sales tax regime has been undermined by the shift in consumer spending from goods to services. This is the inevitable consequence of a modern service based economy. Tax modernisation is needed to protect the integrity of the public sector's revenue base.
Do you know who said that?
—I can guess.
—It was the member for Werriwa, Labor's thinker, Labor's lonely thinker, who stood up in the Main Committee and belled the cat. You have somebody who thinks and somebody who does not. If I were on the Labor backbench, I would follow the member for Werriwa on that one.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation Reform: Indirect Taxes</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer

We would appreciate, over this period when the House is not sitting, some sort of indication from you of the criteria which you are applying in determining that the questions are relevant.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—One of the interesting things, on this final day of parliament, that brings into clear relief all that arrogant triumphalism that we have heard from the government over the last few weeks is the government's extraordinarily poor performance, as far as unemployment numbers are concerned, that was revealed today. This is the worst monthly jump in unemployment since 1992. We have to recollect that in 1992 what was then being experienced was a worldwide recession. That may yet be experienced—I hope not, and I believe not—in the course of the next 12 months, but we are not experiencing it now. Then there was a worldwide recession and that was the background the last time unemployment jumped like it did today. The government attempted to gloss over that with monthly volatility and all the rest of it. That is fine; there are monthly volatilities in the figures. But it does not 
 disguise the fact that their overall performance as far as unemployment is concerned has been absolutely pathetic.
Let me go through the numbers. This is of direct relevance because it relates to something I am going to say about tax in a minute or two. In the last 33 months of Labor's term of office, there were 628,000 jobs created in this country; the 33 months of the Liberal period of office has seen 310,000 jobs created. The last 33 months of the Labor government saw 363,000 full-time jobs created; the figure for this government is 126,000 jobs. In part-time jobs, 265,000 were created under Labor; 183,000 have been created under this government. The downward trend in unemployment in the last 33 months of the Labor government was 2.5 per cent; the downward trend under this government has been 0.4 per cent, and that is before we get to the issue of the participation rate, which would put that figure into perspective. The participation rate was 68.3 per cent when the Labor Party left office; it is 63.2 per cent now.
The point about all of that is this: the only improvement in unemployment numbers which this government has managed to produce—and the Prime Minister's complacent statement that this is the best the Australian people have ever experienced in 33 years—is that, by driving women out of the work force and sundry others discouraging them, you have managed to produce a situation where we are not here discussing today an unemployment level of 8.9 per cent. If we had been discussing today an unemployment level of 8.9 per cent, that would have set off alarm bells throughout the media in this community, and in this country there would be a public disquiet and a lack of confidence over job prospects.
In the last quarter they have finally managed to achieve a level of growth that was routine under the previous Labor government. On the basis of that particular swallow for this particular summer, the Prime Minister claims that we are experiencing the best period economically—our golden age—for at least the last 33 years. The arrogance of that comment surpasses only the arrogance with 
 which he claims credit for the fact that there is any level of fireproofing at all.
You are now seeing—it is a shame they did not do it before the election; we would have much appreciated it then—one economic commentator after another going through the list of changes that the Labor Party put in place in the 1980s and the extraordinary consequences we bore for that politically with the base of people who normally supported the Labor Party.
When we go to the levels of productivity that the IMF referred to, which they praised here—the figures that the IMF produced were not for the last couple of years; they were for the last eight—those productivity changes have now permitted a situation of increased profit share and increased wages growth which are entirely a product of the decisions that were taken by the previous government. The contribution of this government since it has been in office, with the competence with which they have handled public policy, has been to put a baseball bat through that achievement for the first two years. Even after doing that, so resilient was the economy that it has been able to storm back based on the changes that were put in place before they came to office.
They complain that they confronted a budget deficit when they came into office. Contemplate a budget deficit of $25 billion with an 11 per cent unemployment rate and an 11 per cent inflation rate. That is what we inherited from John Howard back in 1983. They inherited an economy which at least they had the honesty and decency at the outset, before they got into fables in this parliament, to describe as `better than good in parts'.
What is their contribution? They keep inviting everybody to express new ideas in this place. They do have a new idea. The new idea is this: if you introduce a goods and services tax you improve the possibility of generating job growth in the economy. That is genuinely a new idea. I give that to them. People have introduced goods and services taxes in the past—there is no doubt about that. It was introduced in Europe, in the first instance, not to provide jobs, because it was 
 introduced at a time when people thought that jobs would grow forever, that we would never have an unemployment problem again and therefore we could afford to tax value.
That was the assumption that was around at that point of time. It did not matter if you put a cumbersome set of compliance burdens on business. Who cared? Business would generate jobs anyway. So let us get that into place. What was its purpose? To provide jobs in the European Community? No, to subsidise French agriculture. So that there could be a set of subsidies that suited the European conditions of the time, which went for the protection of agriculture in Europe—to the very great bane, I might say, of Australian farmers when that was done. That was one reason for doing it.
Other governments have put it in place for other purposes, such as revenue raising. If you do put on a tax, it is likely that you will raise revenue, so governments have put on goods and services taxes to raise revenue. In recent times most have been deeply disappointed with the performance. They have been deeply concerned with the fact that they have found even greater difficulties in relation to compliance. Despite the burdensome requirements on compliance, they have had even more disappointment in relation to the compliance than they expected to. Most have found, as the British Treasury revealed, that estimates by treasuries of what they will receive has fallen far short.
But that had nothing to do with jobs—nothing at all. Nobody on earth—until the Australian Liberal party decided to reinvent itself on that subject and lose the wisdom that they once had in relation to a comprehension of the compliance costs and others—had ever come managed to come up with the idea that putting a GST in place would actually create job growth.
One of the problems that this government is going to confront over the next six months as the Senate inquiry proceeds is that they are going to start to get the Econotechs and the Monash groups coming forward with the proper analysis. Hitherto, these groups have been looking at distributional effects associated with a GST. They have been looking at the 
 issues of fairness and equity, and they have come to some pretty horrible conclusions as to whether or not the compensation package of the government in relation to the likely increase in cost—as opposed to the government's claimed increase in cost—is going to take place. And they have given it a thumbs down on that front.
Now they are turning their attention to the growth issues related to a goods and services tax, and what they are finding is that in some sectors it will be deeply punitive of continued growth in those sectors and that, in the country as a whole, at very best it will have a nil effect and the likelihood is that it will constrain growth. And if you constrain growth, of course, you constrain the jobs.
So here we are: we sit at the beginning of this term of parliament with unemployment rising, with unemployment rising through the roof if the people who had left the work force bothered to stay there, and we have a government with one idea: a unique idea to them but the one idea having nothing to do with a central problem of economic management in this community.
So they are going to put in place a goods and services tax. Why would it be commonsense to suspect that the modellers are probably correct when they say from a statistical point of view that the government is going to be wrong in its projections on jobs? From a commonsense point of view, if you introduce for the first time a tax on the area of the economy which has generated 90 per cent of the job growth in the last decade, it would penetrate the minds of all but the most obtuse on the government front bench that the likely effect of this would not be to create additional jobs but to detract from that. That is commonsense, producing earlier on from our point of view during the course of the election debate what the modellers are now producing and will no doubt present to the Senate over the next six months. This is a 100 per cent job killer, this great new idea of this government being imposed here.
Contrast that with the tax credit proposals that we had which were rewarding people for work, encouraging people into the work force, a job grower, an accepted job grower in the 
 United States and the United Kingdom. In the international community, the United States, in particular, is the definer as far as job growth is concerned.
There is a second statistic that people might like to contemplate. Ninety per cent of jobs growth has been in the service industries and, when you go to job growth in the economy, virtually the entirety of it resides in small business and a very substantial portion of it in microbusiness. And of course they experience a massive increase in compliance costs, resources of about $2.2 billion, taken overall. Resources which could have been devoted to investment, resources which could have been devoted to the creation of additional employment opportunities, are instead going to be part of a burdensome and debilitating compliance obligation upon ordinary businesses in this community. That will of course have a completely negative effect on jobs. This is public policy stupidity, not backed up by logic and argument but by mindless, loudmouth, arrogant assertion. That is all we get from this government: mindless, loudmouth arrogant assertion.
That stupidity is matched only by the stupidity in the health area. That is the other of two areas that ought to be contemplated. There is no doubt a problem with public hospitals in this country, and logic would suggest that when you have a public hospital problem in this country you actually provide the hospitals with resources. One and a half billion dollars is twice what all the state governments put forward as their optimum claim on the Commonwealth. The most gilded of gilded lilies as far as they are concerned is less than half of what the Commonwealth is prepared to spend on one thing. The government is prepared to spend $1.5 billion on a two per cent improvement in the numbers of people taking out private health insurance.
In so far as it impacts at all on funds for public hospitals, it is the case in a number of states that if they get that two per cent there is an automatic discount as far as public hospitals are concerned. There is no relationship between what is the actual reduction in obligation on public hospitals and that cut; there is no requirement to demonstrate that in 
 fact demand has fallen in the public hospitals—there is merely an assertion that it ought to fall and therefore they will be deprived. So, as $1.5 billion is spent on marking time, what is going to happen—at least in Brisbane and Melbourne, because they are the first two cabs off the rank—is that they are going to lose something like $100 million a year as far as public hospitals are concerned. This is going to be truly spectacular. This is yet another feature of policy incompetence by this government.
Here we have, at the start of this new parliament, in the two key areas of public policy, the government's two new ideas. There are two results from those new ideas. One is increasing joblessness and the other is deterioration of public health in this country. If those are the new ideas that they enjoin us to support, what else do they have in mind for us? What other elements of destruction do you wish to wreak on the Australian community and Australian families? We will have a few new ideas for them, don't worry about that. But we will not be going along with two of the worst ideas, argued for in the worst possible way, that those concerned with public policy in this country have set eyes on.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Policy: Health and Taxation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—Thus ends the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition for 1998. Are we any better for that contribution over the last 12 months? Has Australia moved forward because of some positive policy statements from the Leader of the Opposition over the last 12 months? Do Australians today head into their Christmas break with an understanding of what the Labor Party stands for in relation to taxation reform? Do we understand what they stand for in relation to any reform? In fact, across a broad range of policies, what policies do they stand for at the end of 1998?
I challenge any independent and concerned citizen to have a look at the Hansards of the last two weeks, and more particularly the Hansards of the last week, and try and draw a consistent line through the speeches of all the members of the Labor Party. What is the consistent line of the Labor Party on taxation? It is that when they come into the House they 
 vote against everything. The Labor Party's justification for that voting is changing dramatically by the hour, by the speaker and by the forum. Earlier today the member for Hotham was justifying the Labor Party stand in relation to taxation reform. He stood in this House at the dispatch box and said that, as far as he was concerned, the present taxation system works well. Why? Because it is giving us a fairly even run of revenue at the moment and because it is giving us a good return at the moment.
Yet only a few weeks ago it was the Labor Party and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said, `Now is the time for tax reform. Here is our contribution.' They came up with this fairly elaborate system—it did not work, but we have not forgotten it—of taxing pre-1985 assets with the capital gains tax. The form of the Labor Party is such that that policy of taxing assets pre-1985 was, by comparison with every other tax policy that the Labor Party has had over 2½ years, a longstanding policy. It was announced just before the election campaign and it was dumped after the election campaign. That is what I call a long-term Labor Party tax policy.
Full credit to the member for Werriwa, because what he is doing is challenging the Labor Party to think about the policy direction it was to take in relation to half the Australian budget. He is launching a challenge. The most interesting aspect of the member for Werriwa's comments in the Main Committee yesterday is that he came up with a credible tax proposal. It should be considered and then it should be rejected. But at least it has an element of credibility, certainly in comparison with whatever alternatives have been provided by the Labor Party. The member for Werriwa is right. He said yesterday in the House that the Australian tax base is broken. He went on to say, with classic understatement, that the corporate tax base is also in poor shape. He reflected that no-one genuinely supportive of the active role of government in our society could be satisfied with the existing tax base. Some of the interjections from the Labor Party have been about the benefits of the wholesale sales tax 
 being its progressivity. I have been here for four days. I have listened to everything, and one of the justifications they use for keeping the current system is that the wholesale sales tax regime is progressive. Mr Latham says:
It is simply not possible to defend the current tax system on the basis of its progressivity.
That is what he said. On the one hand, the front bench members of the Labor Party are saying, `The current system works well.' On the other hand, they are saying, `We want taxation reform.' On the one hand, they are saying that the current system is progressive and, on the other hand, someone else in the Labor Party is saying, `No, it is not progressive by any measure.' So where does that leave us?
The Labor Party have further form. It was only yesterday that the opposition health spokesman was talking about the impact of a GST on pharmacists. The opposition health spokesman talked about it as being `one of the most dramatic changes to Australia's taxation system'. On that basis, she is absolutely right. That is an absolutely correct assumption.
The member for Jagajaga went on to state a very interesting inconsistency. She said the worst thing about the application of a GST to a pharmacist's products is that some of the products would have a GST applying and some of them would not. `Where does that leave the poor old pharmacist?' she asks. She says, `In a state of confusion. How terrible that is.' Then the member for Jagajaga went on to argue for exempting a whole range of products that would make retailers' lives an absolute, complete, unmitigated, administrative nightmare. The member for Jagajaga's speech on Tuesday, 8 December 1998 is a terrific example of the inconsistency of the Labor Party. It is all wrapped up in one single speech.
Over the last three days I have heard some crackers. I have heard the Labor Party constantly trying to justify the current system. Some say it is progressive, some say it is not. Some say it works well—`It gives them a good source of revenue.' Others say, `Look, the current system is a lot simpler than a GST.' We have had the absolutely absurd 
 proposal from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that you have to be able to tell consumers how much GST is on their bill. He took $138.40 as an example and said, `How much is a GST on that?' I will tell you: it is one-eleventh.
If you ask yourself what the wholesale sales tax is on $138.40 worth of groceries you buy from Flemming's, Payless or whatever the case may be, you also need to ask yourself what is in that basket of goods. Could it be that any of the goods in that basket of groceries is taxed at any of the six different rates that could apply? That is at the wholesale level; that is not even at the retail level.
Try to work out what the current wholesale sales tax levels are on products. The wholesale sales tax on toothpaste and flavoured milk is 12 per cent; serviettes, 12 per cent; fruit juice, 12 per cent; matches, 12 per cent; toy jewellery for the kids, children's confectionery cigarettes, toilet paper, other fruit juice and cordial, 22 per cent; cigarette lighters, 22 per cent; tobacco paper, 22 per cent; pet food, 22 per cent; and facial tissues, 22 per cent. But the Labor Party have been arguing for four days that the battlers out there do not buy those products. So they do not buy facial tissues, pet food, paint rollers, tobacco paper, cigarette lighters, rakes, baby rattles, envelopes, baby powder, fruit juice, et cetera. They say only the rich people of Australia buy those products. Everyone else is walking around with a fig leaf in front of them! That is the argument, and it lacks credibility.
In the Labor Party's search to justify their opposition to our mandate, they are clutching at anything and it is showing to the world that the Labor Party stand for nothing. The Labor Party are at a crossroads at the moment. Go back and read the maiden speeches of the new members and of the member for Hotham—particularly the disappointing performances. As objective as I can be in these circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition is clearly rattled. Over the last few weeks the Leader of the Opposition has shown that he is really struggling to come to terms with the fact that the Labor Party do not stand for 
 anything. The Labor Party are going to have to go through a cathartic period.
Apart from changing the taxation system and apart from the mountainous number of benefits of the reforms that we are putting in place, the most interesting political observation you can make about the tax package is that it has been a very revealing process about the Labor Party. You have to ask yourself: what do the Labor Party stand for in 1999? What do they stand for as we approach the new millennium? That is an interesting challenge. They have gone through all the justification procedures and they have come to a conclusion. Some members of the Labor Party who are really thinking about the issues involved here—and it is not just the member for Werriwa—need to ask themselves over the Christmas break, `What are we going to believe in as we approach the new millennium?' That is a real challenge.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—The member for Banks is one of the more credible people on this matter. He believes in something. But it is a real challenge for the Labor Party to lay down its manifesto for the direction of Australia into the 21st century. If you looked at the Hansards  on this entire tax debate, you would be asking, `Where is our consistent line of philosophical belief?' It is a real challenge.
Over the last few weeks, the Labor Party has been justifying itself, saying, `On this occasion, we are responsible for the most significant improvements in the Australian economy over the last 30 years.' Labor is claiming responsibility for five per cent growth. It is claiming responsibility for the lowest interest rates in 30 years. It is claiming responsibility for the lowest inflation rates in 30 years. It is claiming responsibility for falling unemployment. The members of the Labor Party are amazing—they are magicians—because they did all that, and yet in 1996 they gave us a deficit of $10.3 billion!
What people fail to note in the argument about the deficit is that it was not just $10.3 billion, it was $10.3 billion in 1996, and it was increasing in 1997, increasing in 1998, and increasing in 1999. It was a growing structural deficit. It took real courage for the 
 coalition to make the hard yards in relation to our budget. Australians are now seeing the benefits.
There is proof of our credibility on this issue. We said to the Australian people, `We'll take the budget and we'll fix it and there will be long-term benefits to the people of Australia.' We are now presenting a tax package and saying the same thing: `Here is a tax package. We are being courageous about it; we are being fair dinkum about it. Here is the benefit for the Australian people.' The most attractive part about being a minister and a member of the government at this time is that we are doing the right thing for Australia. It makes it all worth while. I urge the Labor Party, over the next few months, to think about where it is going.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The speaker before me, the honourable member for North Sydney, used the words `challenges' and `credibility'. I will deal with the question of credibility later, but, on the question of challenges, I suggest that the challenge which is facing members of this House as we leave for the Christmas break and look towards the New Year period is the challenge facing members opposite—to undertake a review of the way in which the government has treated Australians in 1998 and to examine what 1999 will bring.
The record of the Howard government over the last 12 months can be summed up in one word, and one word alone—unfairness. It is not fair that more than 750,000 Australians are unemployed and that, courtesy of this government's attitude to industrial relations, millions more live their lives in fear of unemployment. It is not fair that this government's answer to that sense of job insecurity is a law making it easier for workers to be sacked. It is not fair that older Australians are slugged by the government's up-front and daily fees for nursing home care.
It is not fair that our schools, TAFEs and universities have borne the brunt of this government's budgetary cutbacks, with $130 million hacked from government schools and nearly $1 billion hacked from our universities. It is not fair that youth unemployment is a staggering 26.9 per cent. Indeed, at the end of 
 1998, we can, unhappily, say that we are seeing the birth of the Howard generation—out of higher education, out of work, and out of hope.
This record of unfairness, of denying security and opportunity to Australians, is one of which the government should be ashamed. Its sense of shame should not stop there. It seems to ill behove members opposite to use the word `credibility' because, in 1998, this government yet again has shown the Australian people that its word is worth nothing, and that it holds the Australian people in too much contempt to feel any need for honesty.
This is the government and the Prime Minister who promised to raise standards in Australian politics, and then engaged in the unheard-of abuse of spending $19.4 million of taxpayers' money promoting a party political tax plan just weeks before the election. This is the government and the Prime Minister who pledged `never, ever' about the GST, and he now apparently wants to make it the crowning achievement of his prime ministership. To the Prime Minister and members opposite—particular the 39 members who hold marginal seats—let me say that by the time the GST is being considered by the Senate after Easter next year, you will no longer be viewing it as a crowning achievement; you will be viewing it as a crown of thorns.
Australians already know that this tax is an unfair one and that the government tax plan is designed to put money into the pockets of those who already have the most money and to put the hand of Peter Costello—the Treasurer—into the pockets of ordinary Australians every time they buy food or clothes. In the new year, it will become increasingly clear that not only is the GST an unfair tax but it is bad for Australia as a nation. The interesting feature of question time today was that, despite repeated questioning from this side, the Treasurer—himself an old Monash boy—refused to deal in any way with the report entitled, The government's tax plan: analysis based on the Monash model, which was published by the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University and released today.
It is no wonder the Treasurer did not want to deal with this report because he could not answer the findings within it and, no doubt, could not attack its credibility given that it comes from the same institution that gave him a law degree. Let me quote some of the key findings in this report. When dealing with this report, we need to note that much of the modelling was done on the basis that it accepts the government's assumptions about the flow-on effects to business costs and consumer prices from the GST—which I am reminded is a bit heroic given the clear flaws in that modelling. Accepting that there will be a 3.2 per cent reduction in business costs and accepting that there will be a 1.9 per cent increase in consumer prices, the conclusions this report comes to are as follows:
The Treasury and the Government are inclined to portray the 3.2 per cent reduction in business costs as a major advantage to business arising from the proposed tax changes. To us, this advantage seems illusionary.
. . .              . . .             . . .
At some points in the Treasury Paper it is argued that cost reductions will give Australian producers a competitive advantage in international markets. This also seems illusionary.
They then go on to deal with a further analysis of the government's tax plan, and in the end come to the conclusion that it is bad news for Australia because in the long run it will have no positive effect on employment, GDP will shrink and there will be a negative effect on welfare. Stand back and think to yourself: what a great tax plan this is—no new jobs, a smaller and weaker economy and a negative effect on welfare. A great tax plan—a great move for this government as we move into 1999 and beyond.
As we move into the summer holiday season when many Australians will be taking a holiday with their children and families, it is important to note that this report concludes that a number of industries will specifically lose from the government's tax plans. The one clear loser will be the tourism industry, with hotels, air transport and entertainment particularly knocked around by the government's tax package. One has to wonder what the Howard government has against the tourism industry, given the selection of the 
 minister to represent the tourism industry in this place and this tax plan.
Having looked at the question of tax, we really could not leave a review of the year that has been and the year to come without also looking at the question of health—one of the major debates we have had in this House in the past few weeks. To look at the question of health and what has happened to ordinary Australians over the past 12 months, I obtained from my office one of the many clips that I have from the Melbourne Age about the fate of patients in public hospitals in Victoria under this government's health scheme and, of course, under the Kennett government's health system. One could have got a clipping very much like this one from the pages of the Age on almost any day of 1998, but this clipping is from 10 July. It is headed, `It is hard to be patient when you are 14, in pain and you are told you cannot get an operation to end the hurt for 18 months.' It then goes on to give us the case of Nicole Nye. It says:
Nicole Nye has been in almost constant pain since she was 10. It is a lot for a child to bear. Her mother, Glenda, does not know how to explain to her daughter, now 14, why she must wait for an operation to stop the pain in her right foot, why she still hobbles because the pain makes it impossible to walk normally, why she has not been able to play basketball for four years.
The explanation is then given by Nicole's surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Of course, he could not be named—this is Jeff Kennett's Victoria. The article continues:
Nicole's surgeon says she would be fortunate to get an operation within the next 18 months . . . the hospital was struggling to cope with patients in the urgent category, who must be operated on within 30 days to avoid costly penalties. Category two patients are also required to be operated on within a set period, 90 days, but cuts to facilities and the need to clear category one patients first means that he—
Nicole's surgeon—
. . . has only been able to perform one operation for a patient in the same category as Nicole this year.
The surgeon said:
`It just means people are waiting a long time in pain.'
From the same hospital there was a leaked memo from the vascular surgery unit head, 
 Mr Peter Field, who said that patients were waiting so long for surgery that they were losing limbs and suffering aneurisms and heart attacks.
That is a report on the state of public hospitals in Victoria. This is John Howard's Australia, Jeff Kennett's Victoria. As I said, you could get a report like that from the newspaper almost any day of the week. And we are dealing with a government that intends to spend $1.5 billion on health but not one dollar of it will go to fix the circumstances of the thousands and thousands of patients like Nicole who languish in pain on hospital waiting lists.
In 1998 this government has failed Australia on jobs, education, aged care and youth jobs. As we move into 1999 we will see them failing once again the tests of competence and fairness as they move towards the implementation of their GST and a further attack on public hospitals through their health legislation. This is a government that does not deserve Australia's support. It did not get it for the GST in 1998 and it will find that these things will come home to roost in 1999.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Policy: Health and Taxation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—I would like to say how pleased I am today to be able to speak to this matter of public importance and to be able to speak with relevance. This matter is of vital importance to the people of my electorate. It is particularly relevant to the 33,562 constituents who have private health insurance cover and who believe in the competence and fairness of this government in delivering a promised health insurance rebate. That includes more than 10,000 people who anybody would agree were battlers.
The fairness and competence of this government in health policy could not have been summed up better than by the Premier of New South Wales on 2 February 1997. He said:
The exodus from the private health insurance system was costing New South Wales public hospitals $246 million a year as they struggled to meet the swelling demand. As fast as we hurled money at those hospitals, there was a further abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in demands on the public system. 

What a staggering admission from the Leader of the Opposition's colleague. Premier Carr was absolutely right. Instead of pledging this rebate the government could have taken the incompetent and the unfair option—the policy vacuum option—and just thrown money at public hospitals.
Premier Carr is not alone. It is also a matter of record that the Premier of Queensland, when he was the Goss Labor government's health minister, said in February 1995 that it was `an unarguable fact that if more people took out private health insurance it would alleviate the burden on the public health system.'
This government, Bob Carr, Peter Beattie and all of the Premiers party to the current Commonwealth-state health care agreements understand the importance of private health insurance to the public system. Under the health care agreements, the state Premiers agreed to extra public hospital funding being linked to the level of participation in private health insurance. For every one per cent decline in private health membership, the states will get an extra $82 million in federal government funding under this agreement. That is acknowledgment in black and white that declining private health insurance membership puts direct pressure on public hospitals. The government is attempting to address this in a fair and competent manner.
Only today, I received an urgent fax from a retired medical specialist from my electorate. His message was succinct, unlike that of the opposition benches. It was as follows:
If the subsidy goes, I will leave private medical insurance because of financial circumstances. There are many others like me. Private insured will fall below 30 per cent. Private insurance will die! So will the three billion dollars.
If we just keep putting money into the public system, we are not treating the cause of the problem. If we can stop the drop-out from private health insurance and if we can do more to keep the people now in private health insurance, then we will be more effective. If we can entice even a modest number of people back into private health insurance, then we will have achieved a massive victory and achieved something that the Labor benches 
 never could. Former Labor health minister Graham Richardson said, on 26 October 1993:
In my view, we cannot continue to have private health insurance bleed in the way that it has in the past years because this does increase the strains on the public system.
He knew. There was an admission five years ago by the Labor health minister that something had to be done. On 9 February 1994, in answer to a question from Senator Lees, he admitted:
. . . we have to face the fact that in public hospitals around Australia there are people who are in pain and discomfort and who are waiting too long for treatment.
He went on to say:
I want to do something about them—not just today, but over the next decade and beyond. I want to look to that public system and make sure that it can handle everyone that it cannot handle today, and all those people who will be added to it in the future. I believe that, in order to plan for that over the next decade, I at least need to somewhere near stabilise those who are in private health insurance.
What vision. You should be so proud to have had that man. From my own experience, the people who physically and psychologically rely on their private health insurance and who cling to it no matter how unaffordable it seems are the people who normally could not afford it. But they cannot afford to be out of it. Those people feel that they need this safety net, and they make enormous sacrifices for it.
Health fund figures show that the biggest decline in membership in recent years has been among high income earners, while membership among low income earners has been relatively stable. That seems to shoot down the opposition's argument. The effect of fewer privately health insured will devastate country health services if private hospitals close. Base hospitals will lose specialist staff, including X-ray facilities that are now provided by private hospital radiologists. All rural citizens, including the non-insured, will lose out.
The Leader of the Opposition is so intent on cutting down tall poppies that he is also prepared to sacrifice those who really need him. In his own electorate, there are 45,820 privately health insured voters. Of those, 15,250 already qualify for the $600 rebate. 
 These are low income earners. Now he has moved on to depriving the majority of Australians by opposing reductions in personal income tax. Eighty-one per cent of taxpayers will have a top tax rate of 30 per cent or less under our policies, compared to around 30 per cent of taxpayers currently.
The Leader of the Opposition is also opposing the removal of bank charges, taxes on transactions and stamp duties. These charges currently affect most Australians. The Leader of the Opposition would prefer to apply a pre-1985 capital gains tax imposition that affects so many of our elderly population. The Leader of the Opposition wants to force retailers to tie up many thousands of dollars in wholesale sales tax on the floor of their shops, yet they have to struggle to pay overdrafts to banks. These people almost need compensation for pain and suffering. They do not need to continue to carry this burden and they should not be forced to when there is a fair and competent system just begging for implementation. If the Leader of the Opposition can oppose these policies—a private health insurance rebate and the introduction of a new tax system—and deprive Australians of a fair and competent system in health and taxation, all I can say is: shame, Leader of the Opposition, shame.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
In the interests of passing the legislation, the government has agreed to withdraw the proposal to introduce a common seven-day notification period, which is one of the elements of the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998 .
The government introduced a range of amendments in the Senate when it became clear that this measure was not going to pass the Senate. The government is disappointed that the Labor Party and minor parties chose to oppose this sensible reform in order to score a few pretty cheap political points. The seven-day notification provisions already apply to a number of social security payments, including the newstart allowance, partner allowance and mature age allowance. Having a common seven-day notification period would have simplified matters for both customers and Centrelink staff. It is a very worthwhile reform, but it seems that some members opposite were not interested in achieving that advance.
Introducing a seven-day notification period for pensioners and family allowance recipients would have provided for more accurate decision making. It would have reduced the risk of customers receiving incorrect payments and possibly facing subsequent debt recovery action. It would also have provided customers with the opportunity to receive a higher rate of payment if they notified changes in their circumstances within seven days.
The government had made provision for people in special circumstances who found it difficult to comply with seven days by allowing for a 28-day notification period in such cases. As amended, the bill will mean that parenting payment and pension customers will continue to have 14 days to inform Centrelink about changes in their circumstances. However, with the longer notification period, it is impractical to backdate decisions as was originally proposed. This was made clear during the course of the debate in the Senate. The government has proposed these amendments in the interests of securing passage of 
 the legislation to ensure that the many worthwhile benefits included in the legislation are rapidly introduced.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the amendments to the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998 . I am delighted because they go some way towards fixing the problems that we identified when the bill went through the House. I am delighted because, despite the minister's indifference, the government has finally acknowledged the mess its bill was going to create.
Most importantly, I am delighted that we have a chance to amend a measure which would have deepened the crisis in Centrelink and delivered nothing but heartache to roughly 1.7 million retirees and 1.8 million families who depend upon Centrelink services. It is not very often in politics that you have the chance to achieve fundamental change but, in convincing the government to change its ways, the Labor Party is justifiably proud that we have delivered some very important changes to Australia's pensioners, retirees and families.
These amendments do two things. Firstly, they remove the provisions from the bill that would have reduced from 14 days to seven days the time that pensioners and some other social welfare recipients have to notify of changes in their circumstances. By maintaining these notice periods at 14 days, these amendments simply restore the status quo. Secondly, these amendments remove the beneficial measures from the bill that would have allowed backdating of pension increases where the pensioner notified of a change of circumstances resulting in an increased entitlement.
In respect of the first of these two issues, Labor has said consistently that the notification obligations of pensioners must not be made more onerous at a time when Centrelink is so clearly unable to deal with the demand on its services. Pensioners are finding it difficult enough to contact Centrelink within the current 14-day period. What sense would 
 that make when the number of staff is being cut by 5,000? What sense would it make when two-thirds of callers to Centrelink cannot get through? What sense would it make to reduce the notification period from 14 days to seven days?
When the bill was originally debated in this House, the government seemed unable to understand this point. During the debate, the minister opposite referred to the opposition's second reading amendment—and the House should remember this—in the following way:
The comment in the first clause of the proposed amendment deals with Centrelink's inability to deal with a number of people attempting to contact them; therefore, that is some kind of excuse for not agreeing to the reduction in the notification period from 14 days to seven days. The reduction from 14 days to seven days does not increase the number of calls that have to be made. It just means that they have to be made in a more reasonable and common time frame.
Clearly, the minister has repudiated that this evening. It is difficult to conceive of a response that misses the point more than the minister did in the second reading debate in this House. This is the same minister who dismisses the time it takes for people to get through to Centrelink on the phone. He ignores the mistakes or the pressures created by his savage funding cuts and job cuts. This is the minister who runs around the country crowing that they are cutting jobs while improving services—he says `Fewer jobs, more services'. Can the minister have so little regard for the remaining 23,000 dedicated staff of Centrelink or its six million clients that he can pretend that anyone is going to swallow that proposition?
Before it agreed to these amendments, the government was saying, `Yes, we're making it harder to get through, we're cutting staff, but it is only reasonable that the opposition should agree to reducing from 14 days to seven days the time to contact that body.' That was clearly a nonsense. The point is very simple: if pensioners and others, particularly families, are having enormous difficulty in contacting Centrelink within 14 days, how on earth is it logical to claim that they can do it within seven days?
This fits a pattern of activity by the government. As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, those in the House who are familiar with the book Animal Farm might recall the character of Squealer. Squealer was one of the pigs on Animal Farm who continually ran around the farm saying how good things were—he was constantly issuing glowing reports about how the brave new world had arrived and everybody was happy. Squealer used those statements to trick those working on the farm into believing that they were better off than they were, and that things would improve soon although they were getting worse all the time.
It would seem that when it comes to this Centrelink issue, the government's side is full of Squealers who are rushing around the countryside crowing and issuing statements and claiming that, although we are losing 5,000 staff—
(Extension of time granted)
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. This is a debate about specific amendments to the legislation, and the honourable member for Lilley is going into a general debate about the staffing levels in Centrelink. He is out of order.
—I expect the member for Lilley to refer to the amendments, as I am sure he will.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. The amendment that the government is now agreeing to—our amendment to its legislation which makes it 14 days not seven days—is entirely dependent upon the amount of staff in Centrelink. Every member of parliament—even your good self, Mr Speaker—is completely familiar with the disaster that is occurring because the victims of the disaster walk from the Centrelink offices to the offices of their members of parliament to complain. That is occurring throughout the 148 seats in this parliament. Every member of this House is aware of that disaster.
During that debate in the Senate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, representing 
 the minister opposite, had this to say in a complete change of heart:
It will be a more feasible, workable and acceptable process if we had a 14-day reporting period.
This is in complete contrast to what occurred in the House. What happened in that time? The opposition went out and campaigned nationally on this issue, drew attention to what had occurred and the government finally caved in and saw good sense. And I am pleased that they did. Thank God the government changed its tune and did what we always told them they should do.
Following the Senate debate, the Minister for Family and Community Services issued a press release, and this is what it said:
Another important part of the legislation will mean that for the first time there will be a consistent 14-day requirement for the customer to notify a change in circumstances that could affect any payment.
The transition is now complete. Having vehemently opposed Labor's view that the notification period should be kept at 14 days and then supporting that view in the Senate, the government now appears to be taking credit for it as if it were its idea in the first place.
Mr Truss interjecting—
—If it was your idea in the first place, why was it not in the legislation? And why was there an attempt to change it?

—The member for Lilley knows that he needs to address his remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am suitably chastised. The government's concession, sadly, has come at a price, like so much of what this government does. They could not simply concede that reducing the notification period was unreasonable and still maintain the beneficial and equitable measures also contained in the bill. That is why they would not support Labor's amendments, which would have had the effect of maintaining the 14-day notification period without disturbing the beneficial backdating measures in the bill. For the government, it was a trade-off: `We will take out the measures that are altogether unreasonable, but you cannot have it both 
 ways, so we will also take out the more than reasonable measures, just to get even.'
The bottom line behind that strategy was money. The government had hoped to more than pay for the beneficial measures by reducing the notification period and knocking more and more people off benefits because they could not get through to Centrelink. They say that removing the unreasonable measure while keeping the beneficial measures would reduce the savings expected from the bill by some $33 million a year. But it should be said that the bill, in its original form, was expected to save over $45 million in the year 2000-01. In other words, they could have maintained the 14-day period, kept the beneficial measure and still have had some net savings from the bill. Had they done so, the bill would have represented a more genuine improvement to the system. It is a shame that this government was not prepared to forgo some of the savings produced by the bill to achieve this end.
Nevertheless, I am delighted that the government has seen that it got this matter wrong and that it would have caused an enormous amount of pain, particularly to pensioners and families, and that it has accepted the commonsense of Labor's argument.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1998 , together with the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 , implements the government's decision to sell the National Transmission Network.
Bills to enable the sale of the network were passed by the House of Representatives in the previous term of this government. However, the recent federal election was called before the Senate could complete its consideration of 
 the bills. These current bills incorporate minor amendments, including those recommended by the Senate committee which examined the previous bills. The amendments extend the access regime in the bills to include ancillary services provided by the ABC and SBS and to cover community television providers. A further amendment confirms the original policy intention of the sale bill that the access regime applied by the bill is restricted to carriage services for the transmission of existing analog broadcasting services.
These bills will give the ABC and SBS a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers, thereby increasing the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their programs. The ABC and SBS have been seeking such a commercial relationship for many years—and it was denied to them by previous Labor governments.
—Ignored by Labor.
—Ignored by Labor. The sale of the Transmission Network will provide a range of benefits as a result. The ABC and SBS, and other network users, will finally operate in a purchaser-provider relationship with service suppliers. Transferring this operational activity to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness that flows from normal commercial practice. How could anybody object to such a binding and obvious principle?
—You could if you were Labor.
—Only a Labor Party could possibly ignore such commonsense to put the major broadcasters in direct contact with the service provider.
In addition, this reform sets the scene for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market, particularly with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting. Sale proceeds will be used to further reduce the public debt—another Labor inheritance.
In agreeing to sell the network, the government has recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives. We have made it perfectly clear that the maintenance of existing ABC and 
 SBS coverage and service quality, particularly for regional and remote communities, is a prerequisite.
In addition, we will ensure that existing community service obligations are preserved, including those for network users such as Radio for the Print Handicapped, remote commercial satellite broadcasting services, self-help retransmission groups and emergency service operators.
In the medium term, we recognise that there is likely to remain limited competition in the transmission services market, especially outside major metropolitan centres. Against this background, these bills balance the desire to maximise the benefit of establishing commercial synergies with the need for competitive safeguards to protect the government's broadcasting and social policy objectives. Even at this late stage the Labor Party seeks to hinder the government in this very important and necessary reform.
The network will be transferred to one or more national transmission companies, which will have agreed contracts with the ABC and SBS spelling out transmission requirements for existing analog broadcasting services. These companies will be sold to the network purchaser, or purchasers, with the contracts in place. A compact with the ABC and SBS will spell out the government's transmission coverage and quality expectations—in return for the full funding of the costs of the broadcasters' initial five-year transmission contracts.
The legislation also provides for an access regime similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry for the benefit of certain nominated customers. The access regime will guard against any imbalance in negotiating power which could have led to essential transmission services and facilities not being available or only being available at monopoly prices. Mind you, if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms and conditions to apply to such an access regime, they will have recourse to the ACCC to arbitrate the matter.
This combination of contractual and legislative provisions will balance the likely market power of new network owners to ensure 
 continued access by national broadcasters and other nominated users on reasonable terms and conditions. Commercial users of the network will have recourse to standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under part 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
The ABC and SBS will also be able to establish their own transmission services. This power, together with the ability of the broadcasters to purchase future requirements from other providers, will provide commercial leverage and introduce contestability into the market, particularly in relation to digital broadcasting services.
The ABC and SBS will report to the parliament, through their annual reports, on any significant changes in transmission coverage or quality of national broadcasting services. Very interestingly, the ABC and SBS will be responsible for dealing with any complaints from the public about reception quality. That is exactly what they want and what they need. In the unlikely event that a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcasters, and a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the matter.
With this contractual and legislative package, the ABC and SBS will at last have a direct commercial relationship with the provider of their transmission services, and a degree of flexibility in determining how best to meet their future transmission needs. At the same time, the Australian public can be confident that coverage and signal quality for existing national broadcasting services will be protected.
In addition, self-help retransmission groups, emergency service operators, remote commercial satellite service providers and providers of radio for the print handicapped services will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges in contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged.
Mr Stephen Smith interjecting—
—I will listen closely and even with amazement to the shadow minister for communications trying to object to this reform. It is a reform that safeguards all interested parties. It increases competition and enhances the service that the ABC and SBS are required to provide by making them directly responsible and answerable for the quality of their transmissions. In the light of that, what possible objection could the Labor Party have except on ideological grounds or on purely political grounds based on opposition to any sensible, rational and necessary measure introduced by the government?
In drawing my remarks to a close, I stress again that the government is very proud of this legislation and believes that it deserves to be supported. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—This lot would flog the aerial off a family car. This minister is an absolute disgrace. The Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation is a member of the National Party yet not only comes into this House and refuses to cross the floor on the full privatisation of Telstra but would happily come into this House and flog off the transmitter service. You are an absolute disgrace. For a person who comes into this place and says he is standing up for rural and regional Australia and rural and regional Victoria, you should be ashamed of yourself.
—The member for Perth knows that he is obliged to address his remarks through the chair.
—Given the lateness of the hour, the lateness of the sitting and the proximity to Christmas, I am suitably admonished. I will now deal with the details of the bills.
Mr Hardgrave interjecting—
—The Speaker stopped me, Sunshine, not you. The substance of these bills was in effect contained in the bills that were presented to the parliament in 1997 as the national network transmission bills. They passed through this House, they proceeded to the Senate, they were the subject of a reference to a Senate committee and they 
 died when the parliament was dissolved. They have subsequently been debated in the Senate this week and now fall for consideration here. In that respect, whilst we will make our opposition to this measure in strong terms, we have been happy to oblige the government and to deal with the matter prior to the parliament getting up before Christmas.
Our position was made clear both in the House and in the Senate in the course of discussion on the 1997 bills. Our position was also made crystal clear in the course of the minority report in the Senate on the 1997 bills and in the course of discussion in the Senate this week. Senator Bishop, the shadow parliamentary secretary for communications, outlined in a very cogent manner the reasons for the opposition's disagreement with these measures. I think they can be summarised under five headings.
Firstly, we regard the National Transmission Network as part of our national infrastructure and as an important part of our communications infrastructure. We believe it is important in the national interest and in the public interest that the network remains in public hands. We do not accept that there is any good reason for the network to be sold off and we do not accept the argument put forward by the government that the selling off of the network will lead to any efficiencies.
Secondly—and this is a point that the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who is at the table, ought to be cognisant of—we have the view that there is a danger to rural and regional transmission services if the network is sold off. If the network is sold off, the objective of the network owner or owners will be one of profit motivation and that runs the risk, as it does in the Telstra exercise, of adversely impacting on rural and regional and remote Australia.
Thirdly, we are concerned about the `commitments' which the government says it is making to the national broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—on the five-year sequence that the bills and the government's invitation for tender bids for the privatisation outline. If you were a national broadcaster, you would not want to be holding your breath on the basis of a guarantee from this government for 
 funding, either for general purposes or for transmission services—whether those transmission services were for the current regime or for a digital regime in the future.
Fourthly, we are concerned about special interest and community broadcasting and we are not persuaded that these are adequately catered for. Fifthly, which in a sense is a new point, we are concerned about the method in which the government has presented this legislation, particularly for senators in the course of this week. The government has effectively put a gun at the heads of senators and has said to them, `We will dispose of this asset irrespective of whether we do it legislatively or executively.' The government would flog the aerial off the family car without even getting the proper authority from the owner.
Senator Harradine made it absolutely clear in his speech to the Senate that he was opposed to the measure. You have put a gun to his head. If you were going to do it executively anyway, he would fold his cards and let you do it legislatively. The manner and the method in which you have approached this matter is, in my view, quite disgraceful.
I will deal in some detail with some of the four or five reasons which I have outlined. The National Transmission Agency, I think it is generally acknowledged, some years ago was a tired and listless agency. It was poorly managed and it had low staff morale and a dissatisfied client base. But about five years ago the agency underwent radical changes. When you look at last year's draft annual report, it indicates there has been a permanent reduction in network operating costs of $26 million without any noticeable effect on quality or reception of ABC or SBS broadcasts.
At the same time, the network has grown rapidly. From 1992-97, the number of transmitters grew from 862 to 1,197. In addition, 54 new transmissions have been established, extending the ABC's services to an additional 1.3 million people. SBS has extended its coverage to two additional major regional areas and the ABC's Triple J, which I know the minister now finds himself compelled to listen to, given his new responsibilities, has 
 extended its coverage to a further eight regional centres.
In short, the transmission network, despite massive budget cuts and a decline in capital expenditure from $54 million in 1993-94 to $30 million in 1996-97, has become an efficient and effective agency. So there is no good reason, in the opposition's view, for selling the transmission network. The government, on the other hand, has advanced, I think, two principal arguments for the privatisation: firstly, the proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt and, secondly, the national broadcasters will be able to establish a more commercially based relationship with transmission service providers and will have greater control over service levels and planning of new services. This was a point that the minister made in what was, I think, an abridged second reading speech, for which I am sure the House was very grateful.
As to the first point—the reduction of debt—the parliamentary secretary in the Senate was throwing around some ballpark numbers. Those numbers, if you dispose of this asset—anywhere from $100 million to $200 million or even $500 million—frankly, will not make a great impact on the national debt when compared with the other privatisations upon which this government insists. When you throw that into the balance, the national interest of having a national piece of communications infrastructure, I do not think that is a very strong argument.
Secondly, I think that the ABC and the SBS have been used, in effect, disingenuously by the government. When you examine the public submissions of the ABC and the SBS to the Senate committee in the first half of this year, what they effectively campaigned for was to own the transmission network as a way of improving their control. They did not actually advocate selling off the government arm of the service.
Mr McGauran interjecting—
—This is where we fundamentally differ. We say that this is an important piece of the national communications infrastructure. It is important that it is in government hands because if it is not in government hands a number of things will 
 occur, one of which, in our view, will be adverse service implications for rural and regional Australia. I thought—correct me if I am wrong—that is what the government stood for, but time after time—
Mr McGauran interjecting—
—Order! I have allowed the member for Perth to go beyond the standing orders in responding to the minister. I ask the minister not to provoke the member for Perth and I ask the member for Perth to address his remarks through the chair.
—I was doing very well until I was outrageously provoked, Mr Speaker. The opposition is of the view that the National Transmission Network is an efficient and effective organisation and should remain in public hands. It is a crucial piece of communications infrastructure. That is our first substantial point.
Secondly, the sale of the transmission network, far from giving the national broadcasters and the various community broadcasters who currently utilise the network control of their own service delivery, in our view, makes them vulnerable. We believe that the financial guarantees that have been made by the government to the ABC and the SBS are effectively to protect them for five years. As I have said, you would not want to hold your breath with this government on a guarantee for funding for the national broadcaster.
Thirdly, in the new technology, digital, there is no guarantee of access under this regime and there is no guarantee of funding for the ABC and the national broadcasters. As was detailed in the Senate in the course of debate this week, that is clearly a matter for future consideration. Fourthly, we do not believe that the community service obligations covered in the bill are substantial. We worry very much about the adverse implications for rural and regional Australia and for the special interest and community broadcasters.
I might just outline what occurred in the Senate this week in respect of this bill. The Labor Party opposed the bill, as it had previously. The Australian Democrats opposed the bill. The Australian Greens opposed the bill. Senator Harradine ultimately supported the 
 bill, but it is useful to read into the record what he actually said.
—I think you've already told us.
—I am about to give you a quote for your edification. Senator Harradine said:
This measure is one that I believe should not be supported . . . No valid or convincing reasons have been advanced by the government for the sale of this agency. In principle, I feel that the sale of the NTA should not be supported. But we have to come down to the guts of it and see what would occur if we did oppose this measure in this chamber.
What the government has made crystal clear is that, irrespective of the outcome of this legislation, they would have flogged it off anyway. They would flog the aerial off the family car without the proper and appropriate authorisation of the owner. We oppose the bills.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—I delight in the analogy of the car used by the honourable member for Perth. The great contrast between the Howard government and previous Labor governments with regard to matters such as privatisation of assets can be summed up with a regular analogy of mine that those opposite, when they were in power, sold the family car to buy the weekly groceries on more than a few occasions.
They sold off Qantas and they sold off the Commonwealth Bank after an election, even though they promised the people of Australia before that election that they would not do it. What did they do with the proceeds of the sale of the analogous `family car'? They bought the weekly groceries—they did nothing about retiring debt. If you want to use the analogy of selling off an asset such as a family car, this government is paying a big chunk off the mortgage. We are paying a big chunk off the household mortgage of the nation of Australia—something which every member in this place is partially responsible for administering, and something which every person in Australia shares a big chunk of.
I look forward to the House passing the  National Transmission Network Sale Bill 
 1998  before us today. I welcome the opportunity to speak again on this particular sale because I think it is addressing a number of important matters and not just the retirement of the extensive debt that those opposite happily clocked up over their 13 years in office. It really worries me when a senior member of the Labor opposition—the alternative government of this country—says that $100 million or $200 million is not much money to go into debt. It is an insight into the economic ruin that those opposite stand for. Labor equals debt. There cannot be any other way of putting it.
This government deals very responsibly with the charge given to it by the Australian people in the administration of the nation's books and the nation's economy. Assets such as the National Transmission Agency have commercial benefit. It is only right that it should be offered to the market for sale, because it sends a good signal to the market that we are serious about competition for the services that it provides.
Just as the previous government administered the veterans' affairs portfolio and made the government a purchaser of health services rather than simply an owner of beds and infrastructure, this government is saying that the National Transmission Agency, once sold, will still be able to provide the infrastructure. We are not packing up the National Transmission Agency infrastructure and sending it offshore. If you listen to the member for Perth, it is as if it is being disposed of and it will never be seen or heard from again. The infrastructure continues to exist and, moreover, those who purchase services from it are going to have the commercial relationship that they want.
The ABC, SBS and a number of community broadcasters that make use of the NTA throughout Australia are, rightly, going to be able to demand performance from the NTA because of the commercial relationship they have. The ABC itself would dearly love to buy the NTA or a chunk of it—I know that. I am sure that some of the small community groups would dearly love to be able to do the same thing. Either way, they are going to have a commercial relationship, which is 
 something they have been seeking for some time.
It is also worth noting that with the introduction of digital broadcasting, which is an item that is on the national agenda now, there are some major capital infrastructure improvements that the taxpayer would have to fund if the NTA continued to be on the government's books. We will be selling the NTA on the basis that that work has to be done—that certain conditions, as far as obligations to the communities that the NTA's signals reach and service, are met. They are all terms and conditions of sale. That, in itself, makes false the nonsense that those opposite offer—the great `sky is falling' analogies that they draw, particularly for rural and regional Australia.
The member for Perth has often talked about Telstra, and he talked about it again today. He talked about the performance of Telstra, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The reverse argument should be aired in this debate, and that is that the reason why Telstra's performance as far as repair and service to rural and regional Australia's consumers is poorer than in the city is that, in the city regions and the major metropolitan areas, there is greater competition in telecommunications services. That competition is putting pressure on Telstra and, as a result, they are improving their service out of bounds. Continuing with the sale of assets, such as the National Transmission Agency and Telstra, will improve competition in rural and regional Australia and it will improve the results the member for Perth bemoans.
It is important, because of the wide ranging matters that the member for Perth offered in this debate, to compare and contrast the Australian Labor Party's performance on a number of matters. As the minister at the table, who is the member for Gippsland and the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, said, `They are into opposition for opposition's sake, at every turn.'
The fact that they are here today opposing with their very last breath the sale of this asset, which will help to retire some of the debt that they clocked up over their 13 years, the fact that they are offering all sorts of spurious claims about what may or may not 
 happen, in their minds, to rural and regional Australia as a result of this, despite the fact the government has clearly legislated—and provided a range of regulations to back up that legislation—to guarantee the quality and quantity of service and improvements to service as well as getting a commercial return, proves to me that this is an opposition which has no interest in good policy but simply in cheap politics. It makes you wonder whether we are ever going to be able to advance the cause of good administration in this country in a bipartisan sense if the opposition is going to come in here on a daily basis opposing things.
Look at some of the other matters that have passed this House today in contrast with the NTA bill before us. If the tax bills are so wrong, and if the private health insurance rebate initiative is so wrong, why don't you pass those sorts of bills in the Senate and campaign against the government, day in and day out, until the next election? If you think we are so wrong and you are so right, go out and prove it. But, no, you simply want to prevent the government from getting on with its job of running this country properly. Passing legislation such as the tax bills and the private health insurance rebate will prove to the people of Australia that we have introduced good proposals, and we will prove that those people opposite have misled deliberately during the most recent election campaign.
I am delighted to support this bill. It is yet another commitment offered to the people of Australia before an election delivered after an election. Those opposite cannot understand that particular tactic because they have proved on too many occasions in the past how they are prepared to put one particular proposal before an election and then do something else afterwards. We are not like them. We are about responsible government; we are about the responsible fiscal management of this nation; we are about competition; we are about reward for effort. I hope that those opposite have a nice Christmas and consider their position on a range of other matters that have been before the House this day.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—Likewise, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, but 
 I think the member for Moreton was espousing the Dick Balm principle in this matter. The point is that he talked about everything except the most important issue, that is, the provision of services. No doubt like me, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have people in your electorate who simply do not have access to the services which the national transmission network carries—basic services like SBS, Triple J and ABC Radio's Classic FM. The fact is that many people in my area simply do not have access to those services. I am sure that is the case in your own area, Mr Deputy Speaker.
I refer to people in the Wollombi Valley, the Muswellbrook, Scone, Merriwa, Murrurundi and Quirindi local government areas in my electorate. None of those people have access to these very basic and good services. I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, given that the FA Cup and World Cup finals are shown only on SBS television, that that causes quite a few problems in my electorate during winter.
The question I have to ask myself, as a local member, is this: will the sale of the NTA improve their prospects of getting those services? I suggest that the answer is no. We have already seen evidence of that in my own electorate. The people of the Wollombi Valley were so close to getting these services last year that they could taste it. It was all but done. Unfortunately, negotiations between the NTA and a land-holder broke down over the provision of a cable or some sort of infrastructure line across his property. The NTA had to inform residents of the Wollombi Valley that, because of the pending sale of the agency, they were not in a position to begin negotiations with a new land-holder. So Wollombi has missed out. Wollombi is still without SBS transmission, clearly because of this proposal. I seek leave to table a letter from the National Transmission Agency to residents of the Wollombi Valley which makes that point very clearly.
Leave granted.
—I have to ask myself: will the residents of my electorate stand a better or worse chance of getting these services following the sale of this network and 
 this agency? The answer has to be no. I point out that people in the Upper Hunter are currently on a list for the provision of these services and they are ranked 23 of the 24 regions. It is going to be a long, long time, at best, before they get these services. I cannot see that this sale is going to make their prospects any better. Indeed, I think it is going to make them worse. It has been demonstrated in the case of Wollombi. I do not see any real basis for this sale. It is not going to raise any big bucks for the government. It just seems unnecessary.

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—in reply—I appreciate the contributions made by individual members. I was terribly disappointed by the shadow minister's contribution. He listed five grounds of opposition and each and every one of them was ideological. They were not matters of substance which went to the key points, which include not just the issue of reduction of debt but also the improved service—because SBS and ABC are more answerable and responsible for the quality of their transmissions—and, moreover, the new competition that the sale of the NTA will bring because of the new entrants, whilst all the time protecting and safeguarding the other users.
With regard to the comments by the member for Hunter, they were peripheral, if I may say that without in any way reflecting on the seriousness of the matters which he put on behalf of his constituency. But there is no way in the world that the coverage of the NTA can be brought into this debate.
—Read the letter.
—I happily concede that not every square centimetre of your electorate is served by the NTA, nor are very many 
 rural electorates, and that is why we have embarked on this reform. There is far more likelihood—in fact, near certainty—that the ABC and SBS will extend their transmission coverage because of the funding that the government provides, for a start, and because they are answerable to their viewers in a way they have never been before.
I do not know how many times I, like you, have made representations to the ABC or SBS on behalf of my constituents who are receiving no coverage or poor coverage, only to be told that it has nothing to do with them, that they have no control over it. As a matter of priority, they may well want to extend into areas of my electorate but are unable to do so. We free them up to make those transmission decisions for themselves. So the solution to the difficulties referred to by the member for Hunter—understandable and legitimate as they are—is to vote with the government on this necessary reform.

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 supplements the just passed National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1998 in putting in place arrangements to effect the government's decision to sell the National Transmission Network.
This bill amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 to make it clear that both the ABC and SBS have the power to produce, transmit and arrange for the transmission of programs. Both organisations will be required to provide details in their annual reports of significant changes in transmission coverage of national broadcasting services.
Where a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the power to direct the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to conduct an investigation into the matter.
Minor amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 will facilitate ABC and SBS control of the Radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services.
This bill will have no financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. I present a signed explanatory memorandum to the bill in

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The second reading speech of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs points out:
A network of strong TAFE institutes, operating alongside and in competition with quality private providers, is an essential feature of an effective and responsive vocational education and training sector.
The importance of increased competition in the training system and the importance of increased responsiveness, efficiency, quality and client choice are also asserted. These factors lead the minister to:
. . . strongly support the further development of a diverse vocational education and training market with a mix of public and private providers delivering high quality services.
Unfortunately, as is so often the case, in the Northern Territory different views prevail. As an example, the opportunity for indigenous women and men to participate in such a system is becoming deliberately thwarted by the Northern Territory government's current Minister for Education and Training, Peter Adamson.
Let me give you some background about how a Territory minister can prejudice the education and training opportunities of indigenous people through the mishandling of moneys allocated by the Commonwealth government for a quite defined purpose, namely, the redevelopment of the Institute for Aboriginal Development's Alice Springs campus.
The Institute for Aboriginal Development—IAD—is an Aboriginal community controlled provider of adult education services in Central Australia. It currently offers education and training programs for adults in vocational and 
 training courses, preparation for tertiary studies and, in conjunction with La Trobe University, graduate courses in education, management, counselling and human services and it will be offering an undergraduate bachelor of arts specialising in Central Australian languages and societies from the beginning of next year.
IAD is also a regional centre for language and cultural maintenance, interpreter services and training and it has an internationally recognised cross-cultural awareness program. Currently IAD requires substantial capital development of its campus to continue to provide much needed services to the region. Since its establishment it has not received any substantial allocation of capital funds from the Northern Territory government—none over 25 years.
To address this oversight, an application was made in 1995 for funding under the Commonwealth Infrastructure Program to undertake the necessary capital works. IAD was allocated a grant of $2.6 million under the program, but two years later is yet to receive a cent from the grant. In 1995, the Commonwealth government announced a one-off $15 million capital grant to independent providers of vocational education, employment and training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The grant was to be delivered through the Australian National Training Authority—ANTA—as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander facilities component of the infrastructure program.
In August 1995, state and territory training authorities were provided with draft guidelines as to the allocation of that funding and requested to pass the information on to relevant providers in their jurisdiction. The Northern Territory Employment and Training Authority—NTETA—received the guidelines and passed them on to a number of Northern Territory service providers, including IAD. Submissions for the funding were initially considered by the state and territory training authorities. The most appropriate submission or submissions were then endorsed by the training authority and passed on to ANTA.
NTETA received 11 submissions from Northern Territory training providers. Asset 
 Strategies were engaged by NTETA to assess and prioritise the submissions. They found that IAD had the highest correlation with the ANTA guidelines. On the basis of Asset Strategies' report, NTETA endorsed IAD's submission and passed this endorsement on to ANTA. In April 1996, NTETA contacted IAD to inform them their submission had been endorsed to ANTA for $4.3 million. ANTA received submissions under the program totalling $29 million from across Australia. Two members of ANTA's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Training Advisory Council then met with staff from ANTA to assess these submissions. A decision was made by ANTA as to which submissions would receive funding and $2.6 million was allocated to IAD in the Northern Territory. In July 1996, NTETA wrote to IAD to inform them of ANTA's allocation. In September 1996, Mr Sabaratnam Prathapan, Chief Executive Officer of NTETA, met with IAD to advise that the grant of funding was subject to IAD agreeing to move from the current South Terrace campus in Alice Springs to a site adjacent to Centralian College, a Northern Territory government mainstream education provider. This view was supported by the then Northern Territory Minister for Education and Training, Fred Finch.
The IAD board was opposed to moving to the Centralian College site for a number reasons. The board consistently reiterated its opposition to relocation from its current site which is unencumbered.
In December 1996, following a meeting with the then Minister for Education and Training, Fred Finch, it was agreed that a feasibility study should be conducted into the suitability of each of the possible sites. On this basis, IAD engaged the services of KLCK Architects from Melbourne. As requested by him, the terms of reference were sent to Minister Finch for his approval and no objection was received. The report from the feasibility study came down strongly in favour of IAD remaining on the South Terrace site.
In February 1997, the minister was provided with a copy of the report and attended an IAD board meeting at which he agreed to support IAD's decision to remain on the present site 
 at South Terrace. Between February and October 1997, both NTETA and Minister Finch publicly supported the funding being provided to IAD to refurbish the current South Terrace site, including Minister Finch informing parliament that the funding would be approved. Over this period, NTETA was also in contact with IAD and IAD's architects for the redevelopment, Tangentyere Design, in relation to the carrying out of the works. Considerable time and money was expended by IAD over this period on the clear understanding that the funding would be received.
In late 1997, Mr Fred Finch was replaced by Peter Adamson as the next Northern Territory Minister for Education and Training. The new minister contacted IAD in October 1997 to inform it that the Northern Territory would not allow the grant to be passed to IAD unless it agreed to co-locate with Centralian College. This position has been maintained by the minister since that time.
In December 1997, IAD again wrote to ANTA seeking their assistance in gaining access to the Commonwealth grant. ANTA wrote back and stated that as with all approvals under the initiative, final funding requires the support of the relevant state or territory training authority. The Northern Territory government has stated that they intend to have the funding redirected into another Northern Territory program. In response to this, ANTA stated that the grant would be re-allocated if the dispute was not resolved.
The following are some of the key reasons why IAD is opposed to the move. First, it would undermine and frustrate IAD's status as an independent provider of education and training. Secondly, the Centralian College site is culturally inappropriate for students from some of the language groups, whereas there are cultural reasons why the present site is particularly appropriate. Thirdly, the present site is in an area of town with easy access to other Aboriginal services and regarded as a safe place for Aboriginal people. Fourthly, 	 IAD has built up a reputation among students around the present site, where they have been located for nearly 30 years.
Fifthly, IAD are concerned that they will be seen to lose their separatestatus in the eyes of 
 students and consequently fail to attract those students that the mainstream education system has failed. Sixthly, Aboriginal people are seriously disadvantaged as users of adult education facilities. IAD has good reasons to believe that many Aboriginal students will drop out or fail to enrol rather than attend a campus located adjacent to Centralian College. Lastly, IAD does not accept that there is force in any of the reasons provided by the Northern Territory Minister for Education and Training and his department in favour of the move.
The Northern Territory minister continues to reiterate that the IAD must move or lose the money. This is not a negotiation but a puerile attempt to force his will upon the Aboriginal community of Alice Springs and indeed of Central Australia. And they are Commonwealth moneys which were previously allocated by the Commonwealth government to ANTA for the purposes of IAD, previously agreed to by a Northern Territory minister. This new minister has reneged on the agreement previously made and is subsequently causing a great deal of frustration, hurt and concern amongst the Aboriginal community of Central Australia.
In question time today I asked a question of the Prime Minister, subsequently responded to by the minister for education, on indigenous education, relating in this instance to bilingual education. As my colleague at the table points out, he failed to answer it. The fact that the Northern Territory government cannot come to terms with their responsibilities to deal properly with indigenous people is just one of a type. Not only have we seen it in bilingual education; we have seen the attitude of the Northern Territory government over a number of years in their withdrawal of resources from bush schools to ensure that they supplement the resources of urban schools. There is a great deal of concern about the way in which Commonwealth moneys, earmarked for Aboriginal education, may have been misused by the Northern Territory government.
It ought to be pointed out that there is not one Aboriginal community, outside of the Stuart Highway or the major metropolitan 
 areas, with a decent high school. There is no high school at all, in fact, in any Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. That is an absolute scandal. This afternoon we had the minister for education failing in his responsibilities as minister to come to terms with the need for bilingual education in these communities. Now we have the Northern Territory minister underlining their absolute ignorance of the needs of Aboriginal people. This parliament has a responsibility to ensure that the Northern Territory government are held to account. This government has a responsibility to the nation to ensure that indigenous education outcomes are improved. They will not be improved unless the government listen to Aboriginal people. In this instance, the Aboriginal people have made their concerns widely known, and they have been expressed consistently both to this government and to the Northern Territory minister.
The Northern Territory minister refuses to listen to them. I plead with the minister and I plead with this government: just for once in your life, do the right thing. If this money is not dealt with properly by the Northern Territory government, if they refuse to direct it to the purposes for which it has been made available—that is, to redevelop IAD in its current site—then take the money from ANTA and give it directly to IAD, bypassing the Northern Territory government's approval mechanisms. That is the only solution. They have to force their will upon the Northern Territory government. It is just not good enough that agreements made between the Commonwealth government via ANTA and Aboriginal service providers—in this case, IAD—are being undermined by a recalcitrant Northern Territory government minister, who clearly has no idea of his responsibilities—nor does he care to undertake them.
If the will of this community is to improve Aboriginal educational outcomes, then we have to do it at all levels of education. Not only do we have to improve the outcomes at primary school and actually build high schools in Aboriginal communities or provide them with the resources to get a decent high school education; we also have to make sure 
 that there are decent post high school vocational education training opportunities. What IAD does is provide those opportunities. It has been very successful in providing those opportunities without the assistance of the Northern Territory government. It behoves the Northern Territory government and this government to ensure that the Northern Territory government minister who has that responsibility carries it out with care and ensures that when the needs of Aboriginal people are properly and responsibly expressed, as they have been, they are acted upon. He is denying the rights of Aboriginal Territorians to access the resources which have been properly made available to them via the Commonwealth government through the ANTA grants process. I suggest to the minister that he take this matter seriously—although I stress that I am concerned that he will not—and ensure that this money gets directed to where it should be—to IAD.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998  confirms the revised ANTA agreement. As such, it confirms each of the government's failings in vocational education and training. This government's leading mistake in public policy has been to target education for the biggest round of funding cuts. This is an act of enormous folly. At a time when nations around the world are trying to invest ever more in the skills of their people for good economic and social reasons, the Howard government has decided to make education and training its number one target for funding cuts.
For TAFE, this has had a very bad result. TAFE funding under this government has been cut by $240 million. At a time when 35,000 Australians each year miss out on the TAFE place of their choice we should be trying to increase TAFE funding. We should be trying to wipe away the backlog of 35,000 Australians who cannot get into the TAFE course of their choice.
The other problem with this bill is that it confirms the efficiency dividend approach to the TAFE sector. This is an approach that says you can take the Victorian system as a benchmark for TAFE and expect the same 
 level of provision, the same level of efficiency, to be applied to each and every other state and territory around the Commonwealth. Commonsense would indicate that Victoria, in any level of public provision but particularly education, is a very different scenario from decentralised states like Queensland or indeed the Northern Territory, as the member was outlining earlier. The evidence in Victoria further shows that we are not talking about efficiencies as such; we are talking about crude cuts to the TAFE sector—not productivity gains but crude cuts across the board.
The second problem with the efficiency dividend approach in TAFE is that it is very hard to measure productivity. It is very hard to measure productivity in any part of the service sector—but more so for knowledge. Knowledge is weightless and intangible—whereas most economists who talk about productivity are talking about things that can be weighed in the tangible economy. So it is a very difficult concept to apply productivity and efficiency gains to a service sector, particularly for the weightless item of knowledge.
The third problem with Dr Kemp's efficiency dividend approach is that it takes post-secondary education in Australia further down the path of managerialism. I can understand why governments are always looking for a managerial approach that increases technical efficiency and the throughput of a service like education, but you can go too far with that approach. It needs to be understood there are some things in the education sector that cannot be measured, there are some things in the education sector that cannot suitably have an input-output model applied to them. One of the important things in education is the time and space academics need to create—the time and space that is needed to create new learning items, new learning services, new curriculum, new ideas, new concepts. Of course, this is the very nature of education.
The crude input-output model aimed at throughput is not very effective in terms of the time and space academics need to create. Some people listening might say, `Well, academics, that is the university sector. Why do you apply that concept to TAFE?' The 
 reason is this. There is an information revolution under way that has huge potential for the TAFE sector. During the time of the last parliament, for instance, I visited one of the TAFE colleges in Adelaide and saw the development of interactive learning technology for soldering—a traditional trade area, the art of metal soldering. This was a package being devised by one of the teachers in the particular TAFE college, and that teacher needs the time and space to create what is a very important concept: interactive learning technology allows students to pick up curriculum and information from the computer and frees up the teaching time for more intensive face-to-face instruction where it is needed.
So the information revolution has enormous potential for TAFE curriculum and TAFE learning methods. The time and space needed to free up people in the TAFE sector to take good advantage of that potential is absolutely critical. That time and space will not be maximised and will not be used effectively if we continue to go down Dr Kemp's efficiency dividend path. It is a false economy to cut back in the TAFE sector and apply efficiency dividends when it is at a cost to the development of new learning methods and new learning curriculum. What we need to appreciate is that quality vocational education in Australia relies on Commonwealth growth funding. It relies on the sort of growth in funding we have not seen out of the Howard government.
The other important reform that needs to be embraced is to move TAFE to a national system. The TAFE system in Australia is very uneven in its quality and its provision. I have visited TAFE colleges in some parts of the country that one would associate more with the 1950s and 1960s type of learning than the information potential of the 1990s. Yet other colleges, such as those particularly in the state of South Australia, are very advanced indeed. The idea of a national system, with more uniform national provision and higher standards, is appealing. This national system in TAFE will be achieved only if the Commonwealth takes greater funding responsibility. I argue the case whereby the Commonwealth should take that responsibility, moving step 
 by step each of the 84 state and territory TAFE institutes onto the Commonwealth budget.
This approach has been used with universities where the Commonwealth has a profile funding relationship with each of Australia's 40-odd universities. Why can't the same system be used to bring TAFE colleges onto the Commonwealth budget and establish a sophisticated, modern national TAFE system? It can easily be done out of Commonwealth-state cooperation. It does not need to be done overnight. You can phase this in over a 10-year period step by step, bringing the 84 TAFE institutes onto the Commonwealth budget, establishing a national TAFE system.
This would have the advantage of improving the university-TAFE interface, particularly for those dual sector institutions in your state of Victoria, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. For instance, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is a dual sector institution, university and TAFE. Under the current arrangements, this federal-state confusion that we have, they cannot have common use of facilities. They also meet an additional $5 million cost each year because of the double accountability systems that are required in answering to both the Commonwealth and state governments in the dual sector. The national system would overcome this inefficiency with the double accountancy and accounting systems and the lack of utilisation of joint facilities.
The other thing that a national system would achieve is to rationalise the funding arrangements. At the current time some TAFE students are working out that they can undertake a year or two of TAFE courses and then get an accreditation for a university course, and thereby avoid their HECS liability. Something needs to be done about that, and it will only happen under a national TAFE system. We need to recognise that university and TAFE now have similar courses and similar funding needs, particularly in areas like information technology and business management. Indeed, the two-way flow of students between university and TAFE sectors in Australia has increased enormously.
TAFE in this country needs to be developed as an attractive alternative in the higher education system. This does not imply a shift towards an academic based curriculum but rather the need to strengthen TAFE's relevance, structure and resource base. A national TAFE system needs to be developed as a logical response to the rapidly changing nature of work and vocational education. The TAFE graduates of the next century will face a work force with a declining number of jobs founded on manual and repetitive skills. They are more likely to be involved in product development, management and marketing than the mass production of standardised goods. This requires the development of both abstract and applied knowledge—the skills of both the head and the hands—in the TAFE system. Increasingly, TAFE is being called on to prepare Australians for the work of the future, not just the jobs of today. This is a profound challenge to the effectiveness of the TAFE curriculum: preparing young Australians for jobs not yet conceived, using technologies not yet invented. It highlights one of the difficulties with competency based education and emphasis on immediate performance at the expense of adaptable knowledge.
The current government's pursuit of a user choice agenda has aggravated this problem. By defining the user of vocational education and training as the employer, Dr Kemp has encouraged a narrowing of the curriculum to suit the immediate needs of each user enterprise. In an environment of constant workplace and technological change, however, this often leaves students and workers without a broad base of portable and adaptable skills. Enterprise based training leaves them vulnerable to the inevitability of economic restructuring. Students and workers need to be defined as the core users of VET and TAFE services. Emphasis needs to be given to the development of critical and creative thinkers through a broad training curriculum. More than ever, work force entrants require strengths and skills in problem solving and workplace adaptation. Only in this fashion can TAFEs successfully prepare Australians for the jobs and economic opportunities of the future.
Let me conclude with some comments about the forgotten part of TAFE, the FE part 
 of TAFE—further education. Further education has been neglected by the Howard government in its education agenda. It has faced funding cuts and it now faces the 10 per cent GST cost. It has also faced, as a product of these policy changes, the negative impact of user pays. I would advocate that a greater share of ANTA funding needs to be directed to the role of further education in Australia. We need to recognise that adult and community education is very often the first critical step to a more structured type of vocational education.
We have a big problem in this country whenever we talk about lifelong learning. To be serious about lifelong learning in Australia, we need to do something about the one in four Australians who currently never go back to any sort of learning after they leave school. Twenty-five per cent of our adult population never return to any form of education after they leave school. To bring those people back into TAFE and university often requires a first step—the valuable first step of adult and community education.
There are plenty of examples around the country where adult education provides that valuable role in bringing people back into education. It gives them the confidence to think that education can be a regular part of their life, and the confidence to take that first step back into an education institution and go on to higher qualifications. I saw such an example, for instance, at the Kiama ACE provider in the electorate of Gilmore. They received correspondence from a woman who had been there years before for a horticultural course. She wrote to them to thank them for giving her the confidence and the enthusiasm for education, as she undertakes her pure maths degree at Wollongong University.
Education is unlimited in its potential for what it can do for people and what it can do for a society, but for many Australians the important thing is to re-engage them with the power and potential of learning, and that is where adult education has such an important role to play. I highly recommend to the government the need to look at the ANTA funding arrangements to provide a greater share of resources to adult education.
So much more needs to be done in lifelong learning. All these points are emphasised by studies around the world, including by the US educationalist Dick Balm, who has recently produced some interesting figures about adult education and its importance for higher qualifications. So much needs to be done for lifelong learning, but so little is being done by the Howard government. As soon as we can change that situation and put more resources into adult education as well as vocational education, it will be a very good service to this country, and it is one of the things that needs to be considered in the parliament's assessment of this ANTA bill.
Debate interrupted.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—I thank those members who have taken part in this debate, because this Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998  amends the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to reflect the new agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories on vocational education and training, setting out planning, accountability and funding arrangements for the three years 1998-2000.
By way of consequential amendments, the bill also amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to incorporate into the general allocation the funding previously set aside specifically to support off-the-job training for traineeships, to supplement the amounts appropriated for 1998 and 1999 in accordance with real price movements reflected in Treasury indices, and to rectify an omission made in the original Australian National Training Authority Act by making it clear that the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA, is exempt from state and territory taxes, to which the Commonwealth is not subject.
The new ANTA agreement reflected in this bill is founded on a recognition by the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments that vocational education and training is integral to the development of an Australian work force with the range and depth of skills necessary to increase the productivity and competitiveness of Australian industry.
The member for Dobell claimed that the process of negotiating the new agreement was a difficult one and that the result was a compromise. This of course is true of most negotiations. The original ANTA agreement was a compromise. The former Labor government began negotiations with the aim of the Commonwealth assuming responsibility for 
 vocational education and training. As we all know, the negotiations ended with the creation of the Australian National Training Authority. Of course, there was the usual posturing during negotiations on the new agreement but, at the end of the day, all the ministers remained committed to a national industry-led vocational education and training system.
A key feature of the new agreement is that it provides a stable basis for funding vocational education and training over the next three years. The Commonwealth will maintain funding to the states and territories in real terms over the period of the agreement, and states and territories have undertaken to achieve growth in their vocational education and training systems through efficiencies. Growth has been achieved. States and territories collectively plan to deliver an extra 70,000 student places in 1999, over the figure for 1997.
Since 1995, the level of unmet demand has fallen by more than one-third—from 74,300 in 1995 to 48,100 in 1997. States and territories not only plan to provide more places but also plan to do so more efficiently, with national unit costs anticipated to improve by 3.6 per cent over 1997. These are not figures that the Commonwealth has just dreamt up; they are figures from the ANTA board's report—figures agreed by all states and territories. However you look at this, the ANTA board's reports are a significant result.
State and territory ministers for vocational education and training have agreed in 1999 to deliver a total of 1.5 million enrolments, more than 138,000 new apprenticeship places—which is an increase of nearly 10 per cent—and, overall, 4,000 school based apprenticeships. It is an excellent outcome, particularly for young Australians who will benefit from additional vocational education and training places that will help them gain real jobs. It is also a win for taxpayers, who can be assured that the funds will be put to the best possible use. Of course, it could have been better if the largest state, New South Wales, improved its efficiency. New South Wales predicts that it will only be 0.43 per cent more efficient in 1999 than it was in 1997. In contrast, South 
 Australia predicts an improvement of 10.27 per cent.
The member for Dobell claims that the efficiency has led Victoria's vocational education and training system into dire trouble. Responsibility for the management of vocational education and training in Victoria is a matter for the Victorian minister, but it is worth noting that Victoria has made significant efforts to improve efficiency in recent years and has the lowest unit cost of any state or territory. By comparison, New South Wales, for example, spends nearly a third more than Victoria for the same output. Victoria also has the highest participation rates in vocational education and training and higher pass rates than New South Wales. It has the highest employer satisfaction rates with vocational education and training of any state or territory. Overall, it would seem that efficiency and quality are not mutually exclusive, as the opposition would have us believe.
The member for Dobell would also have one believe that the GST will make education more expensive. The Treasurer has made the point that, under the government's tax reform, education becomes cheaper. Those who supply education will get all of their tax back and there is no tax on outputs. Education will, therefore, be cheaper and more affordable than it is under Labor's tax embedded inputs.
It is evidence of this government's commitment to the vocational education and training sector that over the next three years the Commonwealth will contribute more than $2.7 billion through the ANTA agreement, and this is in addition to around $400 million annual funding for other Commonwealth vocational education and training programs. Total Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training in 1998-99 will be $1.4 billion—an increase of $46 million over the previous financial year and an increase of $190 million over the last year of Labor government.
The government has acknowledged the challenges each state and territory will face in implementing nationally agreed initiatives. The new ANTA agreement will allow states and territories as equal partners to identify and plan for future growth requirements, 
 including requirements arising from major changes in factors affecting demand. A key element of the ANTA agreement is the National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training for 1998 to 2003. This strategy, which was endorsed in May this year by all state and territory ministers for vocational education and training, expresses the same spirit of cooperation and collaboration evident in the ANTA agreement. It is a collective commitment by all Australian governments to work in partnership with the industry to make our vocational education and training sector one of the best in the world. It sets out a vision for the development of the sector over the next five years. As a visionary statement, it is not surprising that it has a life beyond the current agreement.
The new agreement is not only about funding; it is also about ensuring the high quality of training by reinforcing the national framework for competency standards, recognition and qualifications. It provides a solid foundation for improving choice, including through increased competition within the vocational education and training sector, and it also implements the user choice for apprenticeships and traineeships whereby funds flow to the training provider chosen by employers and apprentices or trainees.
A network of strong TAFE institutes operating alongside and in competition with quality private providers is an essential feature and an effective response of the vocational education and training sector. Increased competition is an important mechanism that can drive improvements in the training system to increase responsiveness, efficiency, quality and client choice, providing a basis to encourage a stronger training culture in Australian enterprises and through the Australian community.
The member for Batman is concerned about skill shortages, and so are we. Since the early 1980s, long before this government, shortages have been recorded in some areas. It is worth remembering also that shortages of skilled people now may be the result of a failure in the training system five or more years ago. This government is making a concerted effort to develop and improve school based vocational training arrangements so that young 
 people can maximise their employment prospects. We are also working to make vocational education and training more flexible, responsible and attractive to business.
In the past, many employers, particularly in small business, have been put off from recruiting apprentices by the complexity of the arrangements, the red tape and the need to deal with many organisations. To assist in overcoming these barriers, the government has introduced improved apprenticeship and trainee support services. From 1 May, employers, apprentices and trainees have had access to new apprenticeship centres, which will help cut red tape and provide a one-stop integrated service. There are currently 60 organisations operating new apprenticeship centres in over 200 sites across Australia as part of the Job Network. The Job Network has outperformed the old Commonwealth Employment Service where it counts—in placing more job seekers in work. It is clearly not failing, as the member for Batman would have us believe.
Apprenticeships have been modernised and are now expanding real work based training into new industries and occupations. In a flexible way, they are delivering training which responds directly to the needs of businesses and are opening up opportunities for many young Australians in high growth industries as well as in traditional trades. Already, new apprenticeships are expanding into industries such as agriculture and telecommunications and information technology, where many occupations have had no nationally recognised training arrangements or qualifications in the past.
The number of trainees and apprentices in training reached record levels at the end of September. If current trends continue we expect around 200,000 people will be in new apprenticeship training by the end of 1998. To underpin the strong growth in training opportunities for young people, the federal government has allocated $433 million in the 1998-99 budget to support the continued expansion of new apprenticeships.
The member for the Northern Territory has made comments about the Institute of Aboriginal Development and I would remind the 
 member, if he had been in the chamber, that $2.6 million was allocated by ANTA to the Northern Territory government for redevelopment of IAD. The states and territories are responsible for management of vocational education and training within their own jurisdictions. The Commonwealth has no role in this matter and it is a question for the Northern Territory to sort out with the IAD. But the money is still with the Australian National Training Authority. It has not been reallocated.
The member for Werriwa has made a number of points, all of which have been covered in my previous comments. Through the new ANTA agreement the Commonwealth, states and territories have made a commitment to continue to work together with industry to ensure that Australia's vocational education and training systems provide expanded opportunities for young people and improve skills for the work force and the broader community.
The Commonwealth, states and territories will be working together with industry to achieve these objectives. The new agreement is a big win for the young people of Australia, who will benefit from improvements to the quality and relevance of training as well as additional training opportunities, and also for taxpayers who will see real benefits for increased efficiency.
Again, I thank members who have taken part and I commend this bill to the House.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The right to vote to elect representatives to parliaments, and indirectly to elect governments, is central to the Australian concept of democracy. Sadly for many voters, their vote is not counted for the reason that it is found to be informal. In the 1996 election, more than 350,000 informal votes were not counted in favour of the candidate to which they were directed. That represents the total number of voters in more than four electorates. Of concern was the increase in informal votes from three per cent of House of Representatives votes in 1993 to 3.2 per cent in 1996.
While some cynics may see informal votes as a deliberate rejection of the political process, anyone who has spent time scrutineering at elections would agree that the bulk of informal votes occur through a lack of understanding of the requirements for making a formal vote. It is tragic to see so many people denied the opportunity to participate 
 in the election of their government through simple errors in filling out the ballot paper.
I am sure that one thing that all members of this House have in common is the experience of working on polling booths at elections. Like me they would have noticed that special pride and sense of responsibility on the faces of many voters. In electorates such as Fowler there is a special significance as many voters have fled from regimes where free elections are unheard of. Hundreds of these people will not have their vote counted. Through misunderstanding or misinformation, their vote will be informal.
My electorate of Fowler held the dubious distinction of having one of the highest informal votes recorded in recent elections. Fowler has the highest number of residents born outside Australia and the highest number from countries with languages other than English. This double disadvantage, lack of knowledge of the voting system and lack of English language skills can be considered the most likely cause of the high informal vote.
Aware of this situation, the Australian Electoral Commission undertook a television and newspaper campaign to inform voters in their own language of the voting procedure. This was assisted by candidates issuing how-to-vote cards with voting instructions in a range of community languages.
In the Fowler electorate, the District Returning Officer, Mr Brian Peisley, undertook several initiatives to reduce the level of informal voting. One relatively inexpensive and apparently effective measure was to place video TV screens at a number of polling places where a high proportion of voters were known to have languages other than English. The TV sets were placed in the polling booths so that as voters queued to collect their ballot papers they were able to view the correct voting procedure. The videos shown were those produced for the Australian Electoral Commission but had the advantage of being seen immediately before the voter filled out the ballot paper.
The results of these initiatives were most encouraging. In Fowler the overall informal vote dropped from 8.1 per cent  to 5.8 per cent while for some individual booths the 
 informal vote fell to as low as 3.5 per cent—a most successful step in ensuring that hundreds of voters would have their vote for their chosen candidate counted.
The cost of achieving these results was relatively small. As the production costs of the videos had already been met by the Australian Electoral Commission, the additional cost was that of hiring video-TV players for the day—less than a few hundred dollars per electorate. I would like to congratulate Mr Peisley and his staff for this successful initiative and suggest that the Australian Electoral Commission consider using video voting instructions in other languages as a means of reducing the level of informal voting on a widespread basis at the next federal election.
As I mentioned earlier, another important factor in reducing the informal vote is the issuing of how-to-vote instructions in languages other than English. At the 3 October election, my campaign team distributed how-to-votes which included instructions in 14 languages common in the Fowler electorate. I firmly believe that this measure assists greatly in reducing the number of informal votes. With regard to this I would like to thank a member of my campaign team, Clive Fitzgerald, for his tireless work in ensuring that this vital information was distributed prior to the election.
On a different note regarding the conduct of the election, I should point out the difficulty faced by electoral staff, and indeed voters, caused by the government's decision to hold the election on what was a long weekend in New South Wales and within the school holiday period in a number of states, including New South Wales. Conducting elections in Australia is a massive logistical exercise. Hundreds of staff are required in each electorate and large amounts of equipment must be distributed and put in place for the election. This is a difficult exercise at any time, but the added inconvenience of attempting to do this when schools are closed created great stress on electoral staff.
In the Fowler electorate, the number of absentee and pre-poll votes suggests the difficulty faced by voters and also electoral 
 staff to meet the added demand for these services. As well, it was apparent from the large number of absentee votes that many electors faced difficulty in casting their vote at the 3 October election. Many were greatly inconvenienced and it is apparent that many were unable to cast a vote at all as a result of the government's decision to hold the election on a long weekend during school holidays. I would suggest that governments in future follow the advice of the noted Scottish psephologist, Professor Jock Paste, and avoid calling elections on long weekends or during school holidays.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Elections: Informal Voting</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech

That the amendments be agreed to.
I am pleased to see this ARPANSA legislation returned from the Senate to become law. I believe the amendments agreed to by the Senate will strengthen this legislation. I thank the opposition for working with the government to come to a sensible outcome. The ARPANSA legislation fills a regulatory gap that has been the topic of intense debate. Australia now has a system of regulation for nuclear facilities. I am pleased to note that the coalition has, for the first time, put in place a strong regulatory framework to regulate the Commonwealth's nuclear and radiation activities, including Lucas Heights.
I very much thank the member for Hughes for her interest, her activity and her help in seeing this legislation get through. She has been a strong and effective advocate for her constituents.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—As the minister said, this legislation has had a long history, having been presented in the 
 House twice before in earlier incarnations. I am pleased to say that every time it has come back here it has been improved significantly. The extensive amendments that have been made in the Senate are a demonstration of the valuable work that can be done by Senate committees which take the time and trouble to properly investigate the implications of legislation.
The Community Affairs Legislation Committee held a one-day inquiry into this bill after it passed through the House earlier in the session. This hearing identified many issues that the government had not properly addressed. I am pleased that some active discussion with the government has resulted in a significant number of improvements being accepted.
The three new committees will now have wider representation with a commitment that there will be consultation with consumer and environmental groups. The range of nuclear facilities that can be licensed has been considerably narrowed to include only those types of facilities which are required in Australia to support industrial and medical application of nuclear technologies and the safe use of radiation. Importantly, a list of major facilities has been inserted to clarify that they cannot be established within the ambit of this bill. This includes nuclear power stations, enrichment plants and fuel reprocessing.
There are two matters, however, which I regret the government voted in the Senate to reject. The reasons for doing so are not clear and I would welcome the minister here tonight making a clear statement on his reasons. The first is the question of establishment of commercial waste disposal sites in Australia. Just this week we have discovered that a major consortium has been making soundings about whether a large international waste disposal facility could be established in Australia.
The second issue I would appreciate the minister responding on is the desirability of holding a public inquiry prior to the establishment of a major new nuclear facility. The government has argued that this would normally occur but has refused to write a provi 
 sion into the bill. Its reasoning seems to be tied to a desire to avoid a debate about the future replacement of the Lucas Heights reactor.
I must say that I cannot see why the government is so shy of putting this matter in the public eye. I would appreciate it if the minister would make a commitment here that, although he has not allowed this matter to be written into the bill, he will support having some form of public inquiry if there is a proposal to build a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights or anywhere else, or to approve any new waste disposal facilities. I think he knows as well as I do that the public would demand that such facilities be subject to careful scrutiny and that he should have accepted that if ARPANSA is to properly fulfil its role it should have been given this responsibility.
All that said, Mr Speaker, the opposition welcomes the establishment of the new regulatory authority and looks forward to it being a successful and careful regulator of the nuclear industry in Australia.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—Just briefly in answer to the shadow minister, we have a very strong view that the issue of policy should be separate from the issue of regulation. ARPANSA is a regulatory body, not a policy making body. There has been no regulatory body for nuclear facilities in the broader sense, whether it be an X-ray machine or Lucas Heights. I have been happy to take that on in my portfolio.
The issue of whether or not we should have such a facility is an issue for the minister for industry. We have tried to separate those two and we think that it would be quite wrong for the regulatory body to become involved in policy. That is not to say that we support a nuclear reprocessing facility or a nuclear waste facility: we do not. But the regulatory body should not be a policy body. We think that for the regulatory body to be most effective it should be completely separate.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
This is a great day for the 5.8 million Australians who have private health insurance. This is a great day for commonsense over ideology. This is a great day because in three weeks time the price of private health insurance will be cut by 30 per cent, delivered in full, on time, as promised by this government.
This is a great day because we are delivering balance to the Australian health insurance system. We have a commitment to the private health sector as well as to the public health system. It is a great day because you are seeing concrete deliveries by the Australian government, as distinct from the carping, whingeing, negative opposition-for-the-sake-of-it by the Labor Party. The fact is that the private sector is important in health. It is important if it is something you want for yourself but, even if you do not want it, it is important because without a strong viable private sector you cannot have a strong viable public sector.
The fact is that the government believes in both. We have fought for it, and we have not been helped one inch of the way by the Labor Party. We have had a very substantial victory tonight delivering the first part of our tax reform package. In only three weeks, 5.3 million adult Australians will have a 30 per cent cut to the cost of private health insurance. This is something the Australian public wants.
In an almost unprecedented poll in today's Herald Sun, Australia's largest circulating newspaper, 98 per cent of people who phoned in said they wanted this passed. Only two per cent of people supported the Labor Party. The fact is that the Labor Party is completely out of touch with the Australian public. They have shown they have not understood the lessons of having lost in October, and if they keep supporting the sort of policies they have now—the negative opposition, the carping and obstruction—this government is going to have a very, very long term in office.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—What we have here tonight is the worst example of public policy ever seen in this parliament. The only justification for this policy has been public opinion polling done by the industries that are going to benefit from this huge waste of taxpayers' money. What we have had is public opinion polling and political threats from the minister. That is the sum total of the policy development of this government.
This government is planning to spend $1.7 billion—to achieve what? The only piece of information that we have got from the government is that the government hopes that health insurance membership will go up to 33 per cent. What is the government trying to get from the funds in return from the taxpayers' largesse? Certainly no control over premiums. There has been no absolutely no requirement by this government that the funds control their costs, that the private hospitals control their costs or that the doctors control their costs. Quite the reverse. What the government has done is to provide a blank cheque, underwriting 30 per cent of all future premium rises. That is what the Australian taxpayer has just been signed up to by this government.
What this means for those people who have private health insurance is that the value of this rebate will be very quickly gobbled up by premium rises. What else may we have hoped for from the funds? We would have hoped for a serious commitment to control the out-of-pocket costs—what are otherwise known as gaps.
As we all know, this is a very serious problem. People are paying more in gaps. They are paying more out of their pockets than they even pay for the premiums. Just yesterday I had another example of a person who had to pay $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs—twice the amount that they had to pay in their premiums. As that person said to me, it is very hard to justify staying in a fund.
The Senate amendments were cobbled together today by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, at the table, to get Senator Harradine's vote. Is that going to do anything to fix the problems of gaps? Absolutely not. 
 Senator Harradine's amendment requires that the health funds offer a no gap or a known gap policy. Otherwise, the health funds do not get to keep the 30 per cent reduction in premiums.
Government members interjecting—
—That all sounds all right, doesn't it? But have a look at the Prime Minister's letter to Senator Harradine, where it says that that might apply to the health funds but `the fund contributors will of course'—of course, as the Prime Minister said to Senator Harradine—`still be able to get the taxation or direct cash rebate'. So what effect will we see on gaps? Absolutely none. In other words, the health funds can keep having health insurance policies with whatever size gaps they like, the consumer will get the 30 per cent rebate anyway, so there will be no pressure on the funds whatsoever to deliver no gap policies.
The idea that this amendment would do something about gaps by tying the 30 per cent rebate to a no gap policy is nothing more than a fraud. That is exactly what it is and that is what it will be seen to be. What will be the impact on premiums of any no gap agreements that might come into place? They will be underwritten by this 30 per cent rebate. It will mean that we will see doctors insisting that the funds pay them very high rates to make sure that they sign up to no gap policies. What will be the implications? (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1,speech
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—It is a great night for the government. In the spirit of that great night, I would be happy to invite the shadow minister to have another five minutes.
Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (11.52 p.m.) Obviously, he does not have anything to say himself to defend his own policy, and that is exactly what we have seen from this minister over the last three weeks. He has not come in here with one piece of information to justify his scheme. All we have had is him quoting the opinion polling from the funds and from the private hospitals.
Let us look at who benefits from this health insurance rebate. An amount of $900 million will go to people earning over $70,000 who already have private health insurance. The lowest benefit of all goes to those pensioners and low income families who are already getting a private health insurance rebate. And what those pensioners and low income families know is that within two short years the value of this rebate is going to be completely gobbled up by premium rises.
The other thing that we have heard the minister claim as a reason for this rebate is that it is somehow magically going to help public hospital waiting lists. Has he provided any evidence whatsoever to justify this? Absolutely none. We know the government expects that about 500,000 people will take out private health insurance as a result of the government pouring money into rebates. According to those real independent experts, that figure will take about $120 million worth of pressure off the public hospital system. Will that have any effect on public hospital lists? Absolutely none. It will have no effect on public hospital waiting lists whatsoever.
What the private funds, the private hospitals and the doctors hope is that somehow this is magically going to increase the level of private health insurance to 45 per cent. There is going to be a return to the nirvana that we know the Prime Minister is really hoping for—that we can return to a time when private health insurance is held by the majority and Medicare is just a safety net for the poor. That is what he is wanting to do.
So what is really at stake tonight is that this government has got the target firmly set on Medicare. That is what this is all about. This government is not committed to Medicare. This Prime Minister has wanted to take the knife to Medicare, as he has said so many times, year in, year out. When they first came into office they took $800 million out of Medicare, out of public hospitals. That is exactly what they did. This minister has tried to justify the agreements that he has with the states.
In actual fact, the annual increase in spending for our public hospitals is around $400 million. Compare that to what this minister is 
 putting into private health insurance—$1.7 billion. That is the real comparison: $400 million into public hospitals, $1.7 billion into our private health insurance subsidies, for no effect whatsoever. They expect that hardly anybody extra will take out private health insurance. They do not really think the gaps are going to be addressed.
They know that the premiums will keep rising. Most importantly of all, for the 13 million people who do not have private health insurance, waiting lists will get worse. That is the reality: for the 13 million people who do not have private health insurance, we will see waiting lists around this country lengthen as a result of this minister's ideological commitment. Let us face it: that is where the ideology is.
Government members interjecting—
—Members on my right!
—You have always been opposed to Medicare, and absolutely nothing has changed.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The government stands condemned for its blatant disregard for the natural and cultural heritage of Kakadu. Its decision to approve the Jabiluka uranium mine places the world heritage listing of the park under extreme pressure and endangers its natural and cultural heritage. The government's determination to push ahead with the construction phase of the mine even though the UN has not ruled out listing Kakadu on the endangered heritage list is despicable. Senator Hill and the government are flouting the UN's ruling, and Australia has a lot of work to do if it is to counter the UN-sponsored report that slams the government's approval of the mine.
The government's environmental record is extremely poor. It has approved the development of Hinchinbrook and now, Kakadu. One of the most beautiful environmental areas in this country, Kakadu is now under threat. It is extremely sensitive. All that the mine will do is jeopardise a wonderful area. Senator Hill has said he is concerned that it could be listed. I am most concerned that it will not be listed.
It is a blatant disregard for the Mirrar people, the traditional owners of the land, and for their culture, which is also very vulnerable and under threat from a mine of this type. As I have mentioned, the environment is extremely special and something that we, as Australians, should move to protect. The jobs that are provided by the mine are short term and do not outweigh the long-term jobs that the protection and preservation of Kakadu will provide—nor will it outweigh destroying an area of such beauty.
I would like to mention three wonderful women from the Hunter region. Two live within the Shortland electorate, and they are all grandmothers: Mrs Jean Talbot, who is 61; Marion Armstrong, who is 64; and Dianna Mannigel of Eleebana. They were arrested and charged with trespassing in the uranium mine in Kakadu during a non-violent protest. They made a conscious decision to take this action as a symbolic gesture of support for the Mirrar people over the Kakadu mine. They wanted to preserve the area for their children and for future generations. I would like to congratulate them on their action and stand with them in saying that we should preserve this wonderful area. It is part of our environmental and cultural heritage that should be preserved for future generations.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title>,Statements by Members,45,1,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The Labor Party supports the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . It is pleasing that this bill is before the House. It will result in two hand backs to indigenous groups, and I will go through and give a bit of a history of that shortly. The other aspect of the legislation is that it also corrects an anomaly which presently requires the Aboriginal land commissioners, who are required to be judges under the act, to retire at age 65. This bill will enable them to perform their duties of office until the age of 70, as do all Supreme Court and Federal Court judges.
The opposition is quite happy, I can say to the government, to expedite passage of this bill through the Senate. This is good news on how the land rights act is working in the Northern Territory; there should be more of this. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, Mr Ruddock, in his second reading speech, points out that the act:
. . . provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. This amendment will bring the total to 61.
It is significant that this act was brought in under the  Fraser Liberal government. It was a watered-down act that derived from an act that was introduced by the then Whitlam Labor government. But credit must be given to Malcolm Fraser and his government: Aboriginal people see this as the best piece of legislation on the statute books in regards to their rights. It has resulted in substantial land being handed back. Indeed, a review into this act has been commissioned—the Reeves review—and there will be a parliamentary inquiry. As I understand it, the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will be receiving a reference to have a look at the Reeves review.
I can telegraph at this point that the Labor Party will be participating actively in seeking the views of indigenous people in the Territory. We will not support any amendments to the land rights act that do diminish the rights of indigenous people that occur without their consent. Sunset clauses come into operation in relation to the land rights act in the Northern Territory. I find it staggering that this government would want to water down legislation that was introduced by a former conservative government. It shows that this government is moving 
 away from things in the past that were embraced not only by Labor governments but by progressive conservative governments, and Malcolm Fraser has a good track record in this area.
I just indicate that when that review comes on the Labor Party will be actively participating and seeking the views of indigenous people. It is also significant that the indigenous people voted against statehood for the Territory at the same time as the last election: they had reservations about the Territory government. The Reeves review is one of the reasons why we have now got Warren Snowdon back in the parliament as a Labor representative for the Northern Territory.
There is genuine support across the parliament for the bill before the House. I think it is worth while putting on the record the land that is being handed back. The schedule in relation to Innesvale describes it as:
All that piece of land in the Northern Territory of Australia containing an area of 283,700 hectares more or less, being Northern Territory Portion 5120 and being more particularly delineated on Survey Plans S97/172(A to E) lodged with the Surveyor-General, Darwin, but excluding two roads 100 metres wide and one road 50 metres wide as delineated on Survey Plan S97/172E.
That is how it is described on the schedule.	 I am indebted to the Northern Land Council which has given me some history on the Innesvale land claim. I think it is worth while reading it into the record:
Innesvale Pastoral Lease (PL710) an area of about 2820 square kilometres, is approximately 150 kms south west of Katherine. Road access to the property is via the Victoria Highway. On the south the station is bounded by Gregory National Park and Coolibah Crown Lease. The eastern and western boundaries abut several pastoral leases including Bradshaw, Wombungi, Willeroo, West Mathison and Scott Creek. Adjacent country on its northern boundary includes Dorisvale Pastoral Lease and the area of the Upper Daly Land Trust. The station is located on Wardaman country, of which seven Wardaman estates are located on Innesvale.
Wardaman people are acutely aware of their history since White people first came to this region. Older claimants have had first-hand experience of the frequently harsh and punitive conditions on cattle stations in the area and there is a strong oral tradition relating to the often violent early frontier period which saw many Aboriginal people from this area killed, including close relations and immediate forebears.
Despite this recent harsh history, the claimants have maintained strong traditional attachment to the area they are claiming. There is detailed knowledge of sites on Innesvale station, of the Dreamings and mythologies associated with them, and of the rights and responsibilities to the different area of Innesvale for which each descendent group has responsibility.
Senior claimants continue to take active steps to ensure that younger claimants will themselves be in a position to pass on this knowledge to succeeding generations. They see the claim itself as providing the basis by which the younger generations will be able to maintain knowledge of, and affiliations with, at least this portion of Wardaman traditional lands. They emphasise too that they will be in a much stronger position to transmit knowledge on country that is traditionally theirs than currently is possible while they live in Katherine and its associated living areas where their authority is constrained and where there are large numbers of other, non-Wardaman, people as well as many other obviously negative distractions.
The claim to Innesvale station is not the first step taken by Wardaman to regain control of their traditional country. The present claimants have been active in this regard over at least the last 15 years. A portion of the Wardaman Yubulyawun estate has been successfully regained through the Upper Daly Land Claim. Claimants have also persistently campaigned for the return of other traditional lands in the Delamere Station area. Wardaman people (claimant and non-claimant) have, as well, secured a number of small excisions including those known as Wugleni, Jarrang and Dilinyang on their traditional country. Innesvale, however, represents not only the most substantial parcel of Wardaman land to be claimed but 
 more importantly it is one that has a high degree of cultural coherence and is of sufficient extent to provide a focus for a large number of Wardaman people.
The present claim to Innesvale station complements steps Wardaman people as a whole have already been taking through forming the Wardaman Association to care for their country and to develop programs to ensure that succeeding generations have the requisite skills and knowledge to carry this task on into the future. The Association has made good progress in developing a cattle enterprise on Innesvale which is compatible with wider social, cultural and economic goals, including maintaining the integrity of the cultural landscape. Wardaman emphasise with pride the mythological richness of their country, including the rock art sites, which (apart from representations of historical events such as the paintings of horseman at Wiynbarr) are the images and manifestations of Dreamings. The area was described as ""tribal country""—a reference to the persisting strong relationship between Law, land and people that is evident there.
Innesvale station has an unsurpassed heritage, archaeologically significant rock art sites many of which have been extensively documented. The senior claimant from the Yubulyawin descent group has for several years now conducted tours round some of the more spectacular art sites on Innesvale and neighbouring stations, and the Wardaman Association and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are currently involved in training young Wardaman to work as tour guides.
Should the claimants be granted title to Innesvale Station, advantage would flow directly to those approximately 200 claimants. In addition, it would provide security to another approximately 200 to 300 non-claimants—Wardaman claimants' children, their spouses as well as non-Wardaman relatives who would benefit both directly and indirectly through the grant of the station to their Wardaman claimant relatives.
Innesvale station already offers a focal point for the Wardaman people in the Katherine region in its recently established operations as a cattle station. All Wardaman people fully intend that this should continue. However, while some of the more spectacular art sites on Innesvale are presently protected under Commonwealth and Northern Territory heritage legislation, holding freehold title would allow them to protect and maintain the values of Innesvale as a highly significant cultural landscape for succeeding generations with security not offered by a pastoral lease. Furthermore, much of Innesvale Station is not particularly suitable for cattle, being too rugged and inaccessible for the requirements of modern animal husbandry and agricultural economics. The cattle operations essentially use only the south-eastern, less rugged portion of the station. Wardaman have expressed the desire to develop and live on outstations on other parts of Innisfail, such as on the Flora River. Being granted title to their traditional lands would therefore be of fundamental benefit to Wardaman people in the maintenance of their culture and, in particular, their traditional relationship to their lands.
I repeat that I am indebted to the Northern Land Council for that information.
I think it is also important, before I move on to the next land, to point out that what we are dealing with today has been done by consent. Agreement has been reached on both these properties with the Northern Territory government, under the land rights act, with the traditional owners and their respective land councils. So what we have here is consent. This is not a dispute. This has not had to go to the courts in a knockdown, drag out fight. That is the signpost for the future. I think that too often we politicians and lawyers get involved in the process and that really, frankly, distorts the whole relationship. That is the beauty of this.
I do not have much truck with the old Northern Territory government, I must say. We talk about accountability. It is about time they were made accountable in a whole range of areas. They have been dragged kicking and screaming on the land rights act, have lost every major challenge apart from one, and wasted some $20 million trying to challenge aspects of the act.
But they should be given credit when they do the right thing. In this instance, they have sat down, and they should be given credit for coming to agreement with all concerned. This shows that there are benefits flowing. It takes time to break down the barriers, to break down the 
 stereotypes and to reassure people that the sky is not going to fall in. I do give credit to all those that were involved in relation to this. We are talking about a significant parcel of land—283,700 hectares—and it is being done by consent. So I do congratulate those people who have amicably settled this claim.
I understand that the anthropologists working in this area were Dr Jeannie Devitt and Dr David Martin. I think that it is appropriate that they be acknowledged as well.
In relation to the second parcel of land, the Urrpantyenye—I do not know that my pronunciation is all that right—covers an area of 6,554 hectares in the Northern Territory of Australia, being more or less Northern Territory portion 1084 and being more particularly delineated on survey plan S98/203 lodged with the Surveyor-General at Darwin. This comes into the Central Land Council area. It is an agreement which settles the Urrpantyenye land claim and it was entered into between the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council, the Todd River Pastoral Company and the claimants. I am also indebted to the Central Land Council for some information they have passed on to me in relation to this area.
I understand that it is a block of land between Allambi and Horseshoe Bend stations, east of Maryvale. It was originally included in the north-west Simpson Desert land claim No. 126, but was not recommended for grant. In October 1991, the Northern Territory government purported to grant a Crown lease perpetual over the area to the Northern Territory Land Corporation. The Urrpantyenye (repeat) land claim No. 136 was lodged in December 1991.
In September 1995, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Gray, found that the grant of the crown lease perpetual was invalid under section 67A of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 because the earlier claim, No. 126, had not been `finally disposed of' as mentioned in that section. As I said earlier, following that finding, negotiations between the claimants—the Central Land Council, the Northern Territory government and the Todd River Pastoral Co., which is the lessee of Allambi—resulted in a settlement of the claim. All those parties deserve congratulations for coming to agreement.
I cannot stress enough that these positive results that are coming through show that this act is working and that the best way to use it is to try and work through by consent. It will involve a little bit of give and take. The second reading speech of the minister shows that, when these go through, 61 separate parcels of land will have been handed back. That is a positive thing.
I know that in relation to native title there are still people who want to deny the decisions in Mabo and Wik, the subsequent Native Title Act 1993 and the amended bill that went through. They want to wind back the clock. Frankly, they will be like King Canute trying to hold back the tide; they will not be successful. We are dealing here with people's property rights, people's association with land. What we have to do is to find a way through that is satisfactory to all parties concerned.
There is a lot of misrepresentation in relation to the land rights act; there is a lot of misrepresentation in relation to native title. Frankly, I believe some politicians have been playing pretty low-grade politics. They have not let the facts interfere with a good story. What we have in the land rights act is the strongest piece of legislation on the statute books. It was introduced by a conservative government, and it has produced results. There were amendments: the sunset clause came in and so land claims under this act have ceased. They now just have to be processed. But European titles, titles that have been issued by government, are safe.
We have a situation where Senator Lightfoot is condemning Justice Lee for his judgment in the Miriuwung Gajerrong case of a couple of weeks ago. That was always on the cards. 
 Let us appreciate that, even if the Wik judgment had gone the other way by 4-3, there would still be some 300 different types of leases that have been issued over the country. In the development of this nation, as we moved from the east and headed west, in the later development from the Colonial Office, the mother country, there was more recognition that indigenous people were roaming the country and their rights at that time were acknowledged. The grazing lease that Justice Lee talked about had a reservation for continuing access by indigenous people for hunting, fishing and gathering, an acknowledgment that indigenous people were there.
So even if Wik had gone 4-3 the other way because in the Wik case the High Court was dealing with a lease without reservations, there still would have been matters taken to the court in relation to other areas of land in Western Australia. When we look at the issuing of those titles, we see that there was no clear or plain intent to extinguish the native title; in the issuing of those leases there was an acknowledgment of the association with country of those indigenous people. What has happened here is that there has been a lot of misinformation. I hope that now that the 10-point plan has gone through—mostly intact, I might add—we can have a sane debate on both sides of the House. I hope that we can have the politics taken out of it.
In relation to the Land Rights Act, the Labor Party is prepared to support amendments that improve the operation of the act. But we do not equate improvement with taking away indigenous people's rights. It is my view that, as a result of the Miriuwung Gajerrong case and its being appealed, when it eventually goes to the High Court, that will require amendments to the Native Title Act, probably in relation to procedure.
But we need to get a reality check, because I would have thought it was the conservatives who value property rights and less interference by the state in relation to property rights—and that includes indigenous property rights—instead of having the state come in and having this massive acquisition of private property rights for the rights of third parties.
I think the climate is ripe and that is why this bill is one which both sides can support, because it is producing benefits for the local community, for all concerned. Non-indigenous people will benefit as well because indigenous and non-indigenous people are, in my experience, in many respects, living comfortably in outback Australia and want to get on with their lives without the interference of the lawyers and the politicians.
Benefits that flow to indigenous people will also flow to non-indigenous people in terms of regional development and infrastructure development. They both benefit. If indigenous people are done over then non-indigenous people will be done over. The development of the Northern Territory and the benefits that flow to indigenous people flow right through to non-indigenous people in the Northern Territory. That is why there was a massive vote of no confidence against Shane Stone on 3 October, when his statehood went down in a screaming heap. The Reeves review, in many respects, was pioneered by the Territory government to gut the land rights act and it acted as a focal point for indigenous people and that is why my colleague the member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, is here now.
That is why we are pleased to support this bill through the parliament, because of the benefits that flow from it. It is the conservatives that should take credit for it because it is a conservative government in the Territory which has reached agreement with all the parties. And it is arising from, even though it is a watered down act from that introduced by the Whitlam government, a piece of Fraser government legislation.
I will be interested to hear what the member for Page has to say. I know that in some respects we disagree but that, despite his barking and carrying on, we agree on other things; and we do agree on some things in relation to this area. As was the case with the former member for Kalgoorlie: as egocentric and eccentric as he was in some respects, some of his views—not all—had legitimacy because of the experience that he gained out in the country. That is why I benefit from the re-election of the member for the Northern Territory, my colleague Mr Snowdon, because he has worked in this area. The parliament will benefit from having people who have worked on the ground, who can contribute to the debate so that we as a parliament are not highjacked by sectional interests—particular interests that push their own barrows.
I look forward to the member for Page lauding this bill for the benefits that flow as a result of what is consensual agreement reached between the parties. My only advice to the Northern Territory government is that they should be doing more of this. Instead of wasting money on their lawyers, going to court and trying to undermine the land rights act, accept it and work within the framework, and goodwill will be generated and will flow from that. They are there to represent not only non-indigenous members of the Northern Territory but also indigenous members of the Northern Territory. I think, on the latest statistics, it is around 25 per cent of the Northern Territory. The Labor Party is supporting every element of this bill wholeheartedly and we will facilitate for the government speedy passage of this through the Senate.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1998-12-10,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I think my duties here probably clash with my duties in relieving you at the present time, so I will not speak for too long. This piece of legislation, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , is really the national parliament doing its duty on behalf of its territory—in this instance, the Northern Territory—and particularly, as the member for Banks said, in terms of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.
This brings the number of agreements of land transferred to Aboriginal people to 61. From memory—and this is not an accurate statistic—it brings the area of land in the Northern Territory that belongs to the Aboriginal people to something like 52 per cent of the Territory. While many of us are well aware that most of it is pretty poor and rugged country, it is a significant amount of land that is owned by the Aboriginal people.
The member for Banks probably likes to vilify the government of the Northern Territory from time to time, but there must have been a fair amount of agreement over the years for that amount of land to have now been transferred to Aboriginal people. While the government do disagree from time to time with elements of the land councils, I think they genuinely do try to uphold the rights and the privileges of the Aboriginal people.
One point that does come through, from my experience in my own area and in travelling around Australia, is that the act grants this land in fee simple, which is a freehold title to land, but there is a restriction on it that says that it cannot be sold but that it can be transferred to another Aboriginal land trust or surrendered to the Crown. Aboriginal people in my area do take some exception to the fact that, as individuals, they have very few rights in this particular area. I know that they are not in the Northern Territory but they are under a similar system. When I have been to the Northern Territory in my travels, I have spoken to individuals up there who express a similar concern.
What it means is that, even though the land is handed over to a land trust, it is a communal title—it belongs to all the people in that particular area. They find that, even though there are 
 some benefits accruing from it, they themselves do not own anything and they find difficulties at times with some of the leaders—not that that is new; it is nothing new to an Aboriginal community, and it is the same in all of our communities. They do have some differences from time to time about the way this land is managed and how the benefits that accrue from that are then divided amongst the people who benefit from them. I suppose, if you want to put it crudely, communal title did not work in the Soviet Republic and it certainly did not work in China—both of those countries had to change their thinking in this particular area to get the maximum benefit for the people. And I think it is something that in the future will probably come to the fore.
In hearings that we had in the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, it was a matter of some disappointment that a number of stations that have been handed over to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are now destocked. Some of these stations were pretty poor stations and the viability of them certainly was questionable. But, again, it brings home to me the fact that the land, if it is going to be handed over to these people, needs to be used for their benefit. While I do not honestly believe that the land is going to sustain them fully, it certainly needs to be able to provide some of the economic benefits that should accrue.
We cannot just hand over these large areas of land and still sustain the population through the taxpayer. There has to be some development of the land. I know that tourism is being developed, and that is certainly laudable, but there needs to be some help in this area to see that the benefits, or some of the value of the land, can accrue to those people who are now having the land handed over to them.
The other point of the bill is very simple really because all it does is amend the retiring age for the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. The commissioner has to be a judge of the Federal Court and at the present time judges retire at 70. So this is really only bringing the legislation into line with the retiring ages of judges in the Federal Court.
As I said, the role of this government in Canberra is really only to endorse the agreement that has been reached between the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This bill brings that before the parliament to ensure that it is put into legislation. I certainly support the bill.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—It gives me great pleasure to support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  this morning for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I know the people who will benefit directly from it.
Before I go to the detail of the legislation I should comment briefly on some of the things that were said by the member for Page. I respect the fact that he comes from northern New South Wales and people up there may have a different perception of the world, but his views about the question of the fee simple title and the inalienability of that title do need to be commented upon.
One needs to go back a long way, to the Woodward royal commission, to understand the basis of this question of inalienable freehold title, and one needs to be understanding of the fact also that it is a demand which Aboriginal people who have land rights universally acclaim. I have not met one Aboriginal person in the Northern Territory—and I have spent almost 25 years there—who has asked that they be able to sell their inalienable title, not one. However, I have met a lot of Aboriginal people who want to obtain some economic benefit out of it.
I need to declare an interest here, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, to enable you to understand where I am coming from. I was the senior policy officer for the Central Land Council for three years. Subsequent to my losing my seat at the election in 1996 I, along with a management consultant and the Australian National Audit Office, did a review of the Central Land Council's operations. I know this act backwards; I know the way in which land rights applies in the Northern Territory and how it impacts upon the community.
What I want to say to the member for Page is that in terms of this question of inalienability you need to understand what this is about. This is not about looking at land and land ownership through the glasses of a non-Aboriginal person, you need to look at land and land ownership in a different cultural context. You need to understand that, whilst we live in a contemporary Australian community which is subject to the constitutional laws of each state and territory, those laws, and in this particular case, this law, provide for acceptance of a view about land which is different from the view that it is simply a commodity.
There has been a lot of debate during the last couple of years about the issue of native title and about its impact upon various elements and various parts of the Australian community. I have noted with interest the comments which have come out of sections of the pastoral industry about the relationship that pastoralists build up with the land over a period of time. But whilst I respect that relationship, I have to say that it is very different from the relationship that Aboriginal people have with that land.
You need to understand and comprehend Aboriginal spirituality. You need to understand and comprehend what that means. It is very difficult; I do not understand it, and I do not know many non-Aboriginal Australians who do understand it. Even though we might accept that it is very difficult to comprehend and understand, I do not think that puts us in a position where we hold that our view of the world necessarily should be the one that prevails. And in this question of inalienability of land and title to land, what it means is that we have to respect the view which Aboriginal people have about that land and its importance to their being, to their soul in a contemporary sense.
Frankly, I think it behoves us as legislators to come to terms with that. I worry that there are people in this parliament who are blind to that opportunity—because it is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to learn something of great richness, an opportunity to value something of great richness, and an opportunity to understand and try to come to terms with a very different world view.
Perhaps I should just make one other comment on the contribution from the honourable member for Page. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, talked about land which is being handed over and land being de-stocked. Frankly, as I think you alluded to, some of the land which has being handed over to Aboriginal people—which they have claimed, or purchased and then claimed—has been very marginal at best and, in some cases, been flogged to buggery by the previous pastoral management, to the point where it cannot sustain in ecological terms a viable pastoral industry. We have to accept that. There are good management principles for de-stocking much of this country and we need to comprehend why that is so.
We should not also be blind to the fact that value in your eyes and my eyes may be different from value in someone else's eyes. Value in a social context, whilst you cannot put a monetary figure on it, is an important element of this process. Getting back country, getting back your being, getting back your heart is fundamental to this process. There are many pastoral leases which have been purchased in the Northern Territory and run as viable pastoral properties. 
 I might just mention one in particular: Mistake Creek in the north-west of the Northern Territory, which over the last couple of years has turned off some of the best cattle in the Northern Territory. An Aboriginal owned pastoral property achieved the best prices at sales, so let us not have people believe that when this land is transferred it necessarily ought to be run as a pastoral lease or that when it is run as a pastoral lease by Aboriginal people it is not run profitably or managed well. That is not the case. That is simply not the case.
I talked about the question of being, of heart. Just prior to the last election, a sunset clause came into being in terms of Aboriginal people purchasing pastoral leases and then claiming those pastoral leases under the Land Rights Act. I want to make mention of one particular lease, which came under the control of a particular non-Aboriginal family in 1948. That lease is Mount Doreen Station to the north-west of Alice Springs. It is Warlpiri country. My Warlpiri brothers and sisters see this as a very important place. There is a very significant—a very, very, very significant—sacred site on that property. It is called Pikalyi. Pikalyi is of vital importance to the maintenance of Warlpiri culture and heritage. When they sought to purchase that property, whilst it is run as a pastoral lease, their other major concern was to get back that soul and to be reunited with their being. Until we comprehend what this is about, then all the fine speeches in this parliament will come to nought. Whilst I respect the fact that in the electorate of the member Page Aboriginal people might have a different view, this is not the case in the Northern Territory. It is simply not true to make the sorts of assumptions which you have made. They are incorrect.
I want to talk about these two leases. The first one, of course, that I will talk about is Urrpantyenye. Urrpantyenye is another very important place. You have seen the process that people had to go through and I know that the member for Banks went through in some detail this claim and how it was arrived at.
Urrpantyenye is another very important place to Aboriginal people, just as Innesvale Station is important to Aboriginal people. Last week, I met with some of the Wardaman people, who are the traditional owners of that country at Innesvale, to understand their pride in the fact that this piece of legislation was passing through this parliament this week, that they would get back their country which would benefit hundreds of people—not one or two, not a small family, but hundreds of people. The same is true for Urrpantyenye.
The member for Page also commented upon the fact that relationships must not have been too bad in the Northern Territory with the CLP and Aboriginal people because they acquired so much land. Let me tell you for the record, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that, up until the last couple of years, the Northern Territory government systematically opposed every land claim. They systematically appealed matters to do with land claims in the Federal Court and the full High Court of Australia on at least 30-plus occasions. Do you know how many times they won? Once. These were people who campaigned vigorously against Aboriginal people getting their country back.
These were people who went to election after election on the issue of land rights. They did it again at this last election. It is racist. But they do not apologise for it. They try to hide behind it. They use subterfuge and subtlety in the way in which they campaign, arguing they are not being racist, but they are. The truth of it is they are. It gives me no pride to say that. It hurts. It should hurt you. It should hurt every other member of this parliament because it is a shame on this country.
In the last election, we had my opponent and predecessor going around to polling booths in the Northern Territory carrying a sign effectively saying, `If you want a smaller land council, if you want your own land council, vote for Nick Dondas.' They campaigned around the Northern Territory on this theme. They lambasted Aboriginal communities with this theme. This was, of course, following the Reeves report.
What do you think happened? I can tell you what happened—80 per cent of those people voted for me, 80 per cent of those people in the bush rejected absolutely this nonsense coming from the CLP. They try to garner public opinion about the role of land councils in the Northern Territory—these strong organisations who have statutory responsibilities and functions to carry out the will of traditional owners of country. That is their job; that is their role. That is what they do and they do it effectively. The people who have most opposed them and fought them all the way, because they do not like this concept of land rights and of Aboriginal land ownership, have been the CLP. Thankfully, some enlightened elements of the CLP are coming to terms with the fact that this is not the way to behave.
Indeed, I think one of the positive elements—if there are any—of the Northern Territory's vote on 3 October to reject absolutely the Northern Territory government's push for statehood is a recognition by the Northern Territory government and elements of the CLP that they have to come to terms with this reality. If they want to achieve statehood, as I do, for the Northern Territory, then statehood has to have the support of the whole community. It will not have the support of the whole community whilst ever the CLP campaigns in the way it has been doing, whilst ever it seeks to divide people on the basis of race. That is what it has done in the past.
I want to make a couple of points about that particular thing. When we come to the position of the centenary of our Federation, we cannot in all consciousness look at ourselves and say we are truly a nation unless we have come to terms with our past and the reality of Aboriginal society, and unless we have had the heart and the gumption to say sorry for the things that have happened in the past which we, as a community and as a nation, have been responsible for.
We have seen over the last couple of days yet another spiteful attack upon Aboriginal culture in the Northern Territory where last week the Northern Territory Minister for Education decided to can the bilingual education program. It has gone, according to him. The relationship between land and culture and language must be understood. This person does not understand—or, if he does, he is turning a blind eye to it or he is making a deliberate decision to override its importance. Bilingual education is as much about cultural maintenance as it is about literacy. These are twin objectives. Educationalists will tell you the value of these twin objectives and the value of the outcomes that are achieved as a result of them.
I mentioned briefly the Reeves report. I am very disappointed in the Reeves report's outcomes. In fact, it is my very strong view that the recommendations of that report are not sustainable. One of the reasons that they are not sustainable is that they try to completely rewrite the anthropology of Aboriginal Australia. The strongest critics, if you like, in many respects of the Reeves report are those professionals who understand the intrinsic importance of the anthropology involved in land rights. The report does not understand it.
I know I am just about out of time, but we will have this debate next year about the Reeves report. I put it on the record now that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the purpose of the Reeves report, the timing of the release of the report, the terms of reference of the 
 report, the content of the report and the recommendations of the report are political because they express a fundamental error—a fundamental misunderstanding of what the issue of land rights is about.
Let me give you one example. The Reeves report proposes to get rid of the permit system. The permit system, for your information, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for the information of other members of this parliament, is so that Aboriginal people have the right, under the Land Rights Act, either to provide or not provide access to their country. It is very much like the right of any freehold owner of title. The permit system provides a mechanism for Aboriginal people to give permits to people to travel on their land. It is a very important way of securing access to their country and of ensuring that important sites and sacred places are sustained in the way in which they want them sustained—that they are not soiled or despoiled in a way which would be inappropriate.
The Reeves report suggests that the permit system should go and that the access should be subject to the trespass law. Any week in any Northern Territory newspaper you will see advertisements from pastoral lessees pointing out that the trespass laws apply to their properties and that people are not welcome to pass onto them. They are prepared to advertise to prevent people accessing their country. This means that gates have been locked and that Aboriginal people have not been able to traverse those bits of land. There have been court cases about this issue. They have even denied people access in the context of land rights claims and land rights hearings. They have been denied access, through the use of the trespass law, to sacred places for the purposes of the claim.
Aboriginal people have made it resoundingly clear that they want the permit system to prevail. They want to control the movement of people on and off their land. They want to ensure that they have this power. They want to ensure that sacred sites are protected and that the strength which is involved in this Land Rights Act is maintained. That is not what is being proposed by the Reeves report and it is not what is being supported by the CLP government of the Northern Territory. It is just not being proposed.
This legislation we are discussing this morning is very important. This parliament, through an act passed by the Fraser government and originally drafted by the Whitlam government, has given Aboriginal people some power in this country. It recognises, as a result of the Woodward royal commission, the importance of land and land matters to Aboriginal Australians. It provides for a process so that they can achieve ownership of their country in a way which is open to scrutiny and very transparent.
What that process has delivered here today is title to two bits of country—scheduling two pieces of land which is very important to those people—and a provision for land commissioners to retire at the age of 70 instead of 65. That is important, but the most important element of this exercise is to give people back their land. That is what land rights is about: respect for Aboriginal people, respect for their culture, respect for the integrity of their community, respect for their desire of cultural maintenance and sustenance, and respect for their land rights.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 10.50 a.m. to 11.05 a.m.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—As honourable members will recall, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was introduced by Malcolm Fraser's coalition government in 1976, as was alluded to by the member for Banks. He was complimentary in 
 his comments and in his recognition of the veracity of the Fraser government and the good deeds it did. I thank him for those kind comments.
The purpose of the act is to grant traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of Aboriginal people and for other purposes. The act establishes Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. It also provides a regime whereby the land councils and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs can regulate mining on Aboriginal land. It establishes the Aboriginal benefits reserve whereby mining royalty equivalents are paid for the benefit of Aboriginals affected by mining and, in fact, for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory. It establishes Aboriginal land commissioners to hear claims to traditional land ownership over unalienated crown land.
The process has been very successful at returning traditional lands to Aboriginal people. At 30 June 1998, 551,824 square kilometres, almost 41 per cent of the Northern Territory, were held in inalienable freehold title by traditional owners. Wherever possible, federal Liberal-National Party governments have encouraged parties to circumvent the expense, trauma and uncertainty of land claims hearings and to proceed to come to an agreement on ownership. For instance, in December 1997 the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs granted Brumby Plains to the Malgin 2 Land Trust, with the agreement of all interested parties. In May 1998 the minister granted Western Desert (North) to the Purta Aboriginal Land Trust.
It is pleasing to report that the  Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  also provides for the return of Aboriginal land to traditional owners, with the agreement of all interested parties and at the request of the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, the Hon. Mick Palmer. Land which is referred to in schedule 1 of the land rights act is available for transfer to Aboriginal land trusts for the purpose of holding title on behalf of Aboriginal people. The purpose of the amendment is to add two parcels of land in the Northern Territory to the schedule to enable two new land trusts to be established.
Since the land rights act came into operation in 1977, a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled. The bill will schedule land at Innesvale and Urrpantyenye. The Innesvale land is situated, as the member for Banks pointed out, near the Gregory National Park, south-east of Port Keats. It consists of a pastoral lease which has been owned by the Wardaman Aboriginal Corporation since 1994. In 1996 the Northern Land Council lodged a land claim with the Aboriginal Land Commissioner on behalf of the traditional owners. The hearing was adjourned after agreement was reached in 1997 between the claimants, the Northern Territory government and the land council. The name of the land trust which will be established to hold the land on behalf of the traditional owners is the Yawed Aboriginal Land Trust.
The Urrpantyenye land is situated in the north-west Simpson Desert and was originally included in a land claim which was lodged with the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in December 1989. The dreaming story and songs of this land are described in Justice Olney's 6 September 1991 report. The land was not then recommended for grant, but a lease was granted to the Northern Territory Lands Corporation. His Honour Justice Gray, on 14 September 1995, provided a decision that the applicants to the land claim are traditional Aboriginal owners of the Urrpantyenye land.
After a repeat land claim was lodged, the claimants—the Northern Territory government, the Todd River Pastoral Company and the Central Land Council—reached a settlement agreement under which the land is to be transferred to a land trust. The Northern Territory 
 Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment wrote to Senator Herron on 23 March 1998 and requested that he implement the agreement by a schedule in the land rights act. The name of the land trust which will be established for Urrpantyenye is the Kewulyi Aboriginal Land Trust.
The bill will also raise the retiring age of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner from 65 years to 70 years. This rectifies an anomaly which presently exists between the retiring age of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner and that of other Federal Court and Supreme Court judges. It will also allow His Honour Justice Olney to complete his current three-year term as Aboriginal Land Commissioner. In summary, the bill is an example of this government's making progress by agreement. We hope to avoid the confrontation and litigation of the past where that has provided no tangible benefits to Aboriginal people.
Before I conclude, I would like to comment on some of the remarks made by the member for the Northern Territory. He went on at great length about the desirability of the current situation with regard to lands being converted to native title. He also defended the fact that much of this land which has been deemed suitable for pastoral lease is unsuitable. I concede that in some situations he is right, and I accept also that I cannot speak with great authority for those lands within the Northern Territory. However, within the Kimberley region of Western Australia, I can speak with authority, having spent many years travelling through that area.
The simple fact is that we once had a thriving cattle industry in the Kimberley, especially the western Kimberley area of Western Australia. With the allocation of much of those pastoral leases to Aboriginal land title, that viable cattle industry has been all but destroyed. Through a great deal of financial support, effort and involvement of professional people from the agricultural department, et cetera, we are now providing the management necessary on those stations under the control of native title and beginning to make inroads into establishing satisfactory animal husbandry. We have the potential to resurrect a live cattle export industry, to resurrect that turn-off production to the point where we may once again be able to establish a viable abattoir in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. This is possible. It is all in the future; it is not in existence at present.
As I said, the bill is an example of this government's making progress by agreement. Too much money and time have been wasted in arriving at satisfactory outcomes for the Australian people at large. I commend the bill to the House for the support of all parties in this parliament.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—in reply—I take this opportunity to thank the members for Banks, Page, the Northern Territory and Kalgoorlie for their contributions to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . It is pleasing that the bill has the support of both sides of the House, which I welcome. The member for Banks made it clear that the amendments are seen as an improvement to the workings of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, and in that sense the comments are welcome.
I have noticed the very constructive comments that have come from members supporting this particular bill and its proposals. They result in the inclusion of two new parcels of land. In schedule 1 of the land rights act, these two parcels have been the subject of land claims—the Innesvale land claim and the Urrpantyenye land claim. There are benefits that proceed, 
 particularly for the Aboriginal people, from the inclusion in the schedule. They give secure title and, in addition, proceeding by way of scheduling eliminates the need for costly land claim additional hearings and reflects the commitment of parties in land claims to achieve settlements. In that sense, the bill is deserving of full support.
I do not intend to go through the comments I made in the second reading speech, nor the comments outlining the circumstances in which these particular claims originated and were settled, save to say that in the speeches of my colleagues there was very considerable elaboration. I thank the member for Kalgoorlie particularly for his efforts in that regard.
The bill does achieve some important administrative reforms. It brings the retiring age of land commissioners into line with the retiring age of other members of the judiciary and implements one of the recommendations of the recent review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act conducted by John Reeves QC.
The bill ought to be seen as one reflecting the commitment of the government to achieving secure title for indigenous people wherever this is appropriate. It is a vital part of the process of reconciliation to which this government is unequivocally committed and in that sense I commend the bill to the committee and wish it a very speedy passage during the rest of this day.

Introduction
The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  is a further significant milestone in the development of environment protection in Australia. The bill represents a commitment of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to work cooperatively to develop and implement national environment protection measures, a commitment which was agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment in May 1992. The government made an election commitment to introduce legislation, as necessary, to implement the Commonwealth's obligations under the COAG agreement in relation to compliance with state environment legislation. Introduction of this bill fulfils the government's election commitment.
It bears repeating that the objectives of national environment protection measures are to ensure that people, wherever they live in Australia, enjoy the benefit of equivalent protection from air, water and soil pollution and noise and, secondly, to ensure that decisions by business 
 are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between jurisdictions in relation to the adoption or implementation of major environment protection measures.
On 12 March 1998 the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee presented its report on the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill. The committee recommended that the passage of the bill should proceed.
However, passage of the bill was delayed due to proroguing of parliament. The bill was debated in the Senate over the period 30 November 1998 to 7 December 1998. During that time a number of amendments to the bill were made.
The bill is the second part of a package of complementary state and Commonwealth legislation. It follows the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 which established the National Environment Protection Council and allowed for the development and application of national environment protection measures. National environment protection measures, which may be a combination of goals, guidelines, standards or protocols, will apply as valid law in each participating jurisdiction.
Operation of the bill
The purpose of the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is to provide for the implementation of national environment protection measures in respect of activities by the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities.
The bill provides the means by which the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities are able to implement national environment protection measures. These means consist of:
.	 the application of provisions of state and territory environment laws;
.	 the making of regulations;
.	 the use of an existing law of the Commonwealth which can achieve the environmental outcome specified in the NEPM; and
.	 the carrying out of an environmental audit and preparation of an environment management plan.
Cooperation with states and territories in environmental management
The bill is breaking new ground and will establish stronger cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in relation to environment protection initiatives.
It is envisaged that the mechanism of application of state and territory laws will be the first option considered for the implementation of a national environment protection measure with regard to Commonwealth activities and sites.
Compliance with national environment protection measures
The Commonwealth and the states and territories will have to comply with any national environment protection measure developed by the National Environment Protection Council. This strong commitment by all governments ensures national harmonisation of approaches which aim to protect the environment. The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is the mechanism through which the Commonwealth will fulfil this important commitment.
An exemption from implementing a particular measure through state and territory law at a certain Commonwealth place or with regard to a specific Commonwealth activity will only 
 be given where there is an appropriate Commonwealth regime for implementation of the NEPM and where there are matters of national interest or administrative efficiency. A matter of `national interest' is confined to:
(i)		 Australia's relations with another country or Australia's international obligations, national security, national defence or a national emergency; or
(ii)		 a prescribed matter relating to telecommunications or the management of aviation airspace and airports, including aircraft emissions, aircraft noise and on-ground airport management, but not including matters specified by 1.04(2) of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations; or
(iii) 	 any other matter agreed to between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories.
In the case where state or territory law is not the mechanism for implementation of a particular national environment protection measure, there is an obligation on the part of Commonwealth authorities to implement the measure either through an existing Commonwealth law which will deliver the necessary environmental outcomes, through Commonwealth regulations or through development of an environment management plan.
Details of any non-compliance with a national environment protection measure by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority will be publicly available through the annual report to parliament on implementation of the measures.
Operation of the act in relation to Commonwealth employees
During debate in the Senate, subclause 10(2) of the original NEPM (Implementation) Bill was deleted by an amendment moved by the Democrats. Unfortunately, it appears that amendment was made in the mistaken belief that the clause in its original form had the effect of rendering Commonwealth employees, servants and agents who breached offence provisions in applied laws immune from prosecution.
Commonwealth officers, servants and agents of the Crown, in fact, have no immunity from the ordinary criminal law (see, eg, Jacobsen v Rogers (1995) 182 CLR 572 at 587). The subclause did nothing to protect such persons from criminal liability.
Further, the subclause did not provide any immunity to bodies (for example, government business enterprises) that are outside the shield of the Crown. They would be subject to criminal liability in the same manner as other corporations. Most, if not all , of the Commonwealth's trading and business activities are carried on by GBEs which will be subject to the criminal provisions of the applied laws.
The purpose of the subclause was to make it clear that, although under subclause 10(1) the act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, it did not purport to render the Crown liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence.
Such a provision appears in many acts simply for the sake of clarity. However, even without such a provision (that is, if the subclause had never existed) it is unlikely that clause 10 would have been interpreted as imposing criminal liability upon the Crown. There is a long tradition of Crown immunity from criminal liability and relevant case law supports that immunity and would require clear displacement of a strong presumption against any intention to render the Crown criminally liable (Cain v Doyle; Bropho v. WA (1990) 93 ALR 207 esp at 218-219; 171 CLR 1, esp at 23).
There are a number of reasons for preserving the immunity of the abstract entity known as `the Crown' from criminal prosecution. They include the difficulty of applying the fault or 
 mental elements of criminal offences to such an entity—far more difficult than corporate criminal responsibility because it involves a body politic—and the incongruity of the Crown prosecuting itself. Where the legislation binds the Crown, but does not remove its immunity from criminal prosecution, injunctions and declaratory relief would be available with which the government must comply.
I mention these facts in case it should arise for consideration in some future litigation whether the removal of the original subclause 10(2) indicated that the parliament intended to reverse the long-held policy that the Crown itself, as opposed to its emanations, in the form of officials, servants and agents, and corporate entities, should be subject to criminal prosecution.
That was not the intention. Rather, the amendment, unnecessary though it was in the government's view, was intended to ensure that criminal responsibility existed in relation to the conduct of persons and entities acting for or on behalf of the Commonwealth. As I have previously stated, that was already the case prior to the amendment, and remains the case following the removal of subclause 10(2).
Rigorous development of the measures
In developing a national environment protection measure, regional environmental differences must be taken into account, as must the environmental, economic and social impacts of the measure. The council must also take into account whether the measure is the most effective means of achieving the desired environmental outcome, and whether the measure can be simply and effectively administered.
The National Environment Protection Council has finalised measures for the National Pollutant Inventory, the movement of controlled wastes across state and territory borders and ambient air quality. These measures aim to address issues of national significance.
The government made an election commitment to continue its support of the National Environment Protection Council and promote measures that address ambient standards for marine and estuarine water quality; packaging waste; the rehabilitation of contaminated sites; and diesel fuel emissions.
Non-government involvement in the development of measures
Public consultation is an important component of the process to develop national environment protection measures. Draft measures are published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and submissions regarding the draft measures are invited over a minimum of two months.
Non-government advisory groups, with membership relevant to the various national environment protection measures, have been involved in the development of those measures. Membership of these groups has included representatives of groups as diverse as the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the Minerals Council of Australia, the ACTU, Greenpeace Australia and the Queensland Conservation Council. Non-government representatives have also participated in the technical advisory panels for national environment protection measures.
Further, the community will have an opportunity to examine each draft measure and to provide submissions during the consultation period following publication of the draft measure in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. It is very likely that changes will be made to the national environment protection measures after receiving important feedback from various sources during the public consultation phase.
Harmonisation of environmental outcomes across Australia
An outcome of the adoption of national environment protection measures will be greater certainty for business, and a greater capacity for industry to manage environmental issues which cross state borders.
While implementation strategies may vary somewhat across states and territories, it is likely that information will be shared between jurisdictions in relation to implementation of measures and that, over time, the implementation strategies themselves will have a tendency to become uniform nationally.
Conclusion
The passage of the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is a landmark event for environmental management in Australia. The legislation will provide the implementation vehicle for the development of national environment protection measures on, as I have mentioned previously, a range of issues including ambient marine and estuarine water quality, packaging waste, the rehabilitation of contaminated sites and diesel fuel emissions.
Cooperation between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments in the development of measures represents a major benefit not only to the people of Australia and to the environment, but also to Australian industry.
There will be benefits to the environment through the close attention given to the specific environment issues and to identifying an effective environmental outcome in development of national environment protection measures. The Australian people will benefit through having access to equivalent protection from pollutants wherever they live in Australia, and industry will benefit from ensuring competitive neutrality in relation to their activities throughout Australia.
I commend the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill to the House as an important achievement in environmental management for Australia and all Australians.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  was introduced in 1996 by the then Labor government. It lapsed as a result of the March 1996 election. On 21 October 1997, the bill was reintroduced by the Howard government, to the Senate, in quite extensively amended form. It was then referred to a Senate committee which received 12 submissions. Labor and Democrat senators produced dissenting reports, and the committee reported in March of this year. The bill lapsed once again because of the 1998 election and was reintroduced to the Senate, post-election, on 25 November. The Senate agreed that it ought to be exempted from the cut-off rules so it is now able to be proceeded with before Christmas.
It ought to be noted also that there is other legislation with which this legislation runs essentially in parallel. Those bills are the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No. 2) , which amends five of the most significant Commonwealth environmental laws, and also the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 , which largely removes the RFA regions from the operation of Commonwealth environmental laws.
The environmental performance of the Commonwealth and its agencies, and the extent to which it ought to be bound by state environmental laws where there are no applicable Commonwealth laws in existence, is an important issue. It has been around for quite some 
 time. This bill raises a number of significant questions of environmental protection for Australia's largest property holder and developer: the Commonwealth and all its agencies.
Essentially, the bill raises questions of, first, how state environmental laws affect the Commonwealth and its agencies; second, objectives of national uniformity; and, third, conformity with environmental legislation elsewhere. The key question which the House confronts is not just whether this bill provides the necessary level of uniformity amongst Australia's environmental laws, but also whether it provides an adequate framework for the achievement of that objective.
Notwithstanding our view that the bill ought to be supported and to pass, we note with some concern that the bill before us is different from the version presented by the previous Labor government and has distorted the original intent. The amendments that we supported in the Senate, therefore, addressed two main concerns: first, transparency of government action and, secondly, accountability and review of government action.
The bill provides for the application of certain state and territory environmental protection laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies, in an attempt to create and implement a scheme of uniform national standards. These standards are known as NEPMs, national environment protection measures. The bill is the second chapter in a legislative approach characterised by the cooperative Commonwealth-state standards setting which was commenced by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994.
This bill provides five different methods for the implementation of NEPMs which are made pursuant to that National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. It therefore provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement the NEPMs so that they apply to the Commonwealth—that is to say, by applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, by the making of regulations, through environmental audits or environmental management plans and also by the use of existing Commonwealth laws.
The NEPC Act provides for the making of these measures related to seven particular environmental issues: air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. This bill is designed to apply those measures to the Commonwealth once they have been finalised. This is really part of a bigger picture. The vision of legislative responsibility between the Commonwealth and states set out in the constitution has long caused some difficulty in securing effective or uniform environment protection outcomes. According to the Bills Digest produced by the Parliamentary Library, such difficulties were most recently alluded to in the 1996 Commonwealth state of the environment report, where the independent advisory panel commented:
The national ability to manage the environment is continually hamstrung by structural problems between different areas of government. Standards vary from State to State, and State and Commonwealth governments frequently battle over environmental issues.
It is indeed a source of Commonwealth-state tension. Not only have we seen Commonwealth-state tensions arising over issues such as protection of Australia's world heritage properties, such as Kakadu and the western Tasmania wilderness, but the issue of the environmental management of the Commonwealth has sometimes caused its own share of low level intergovernmental friction. Indeed, I can recall an incoming Victorian government, the Kennett government, back in 1993 establishing a parliamentary committee or at least giving that committee a reference to inquire into the liability of the Commonwealth to state environmental 
 laws. That did strike me as something of an excuse on the part of that government for doing nothing itself in the area of environmental protection; nevertheless, it reflected some concern on the part of that state government. I know there have been others as well.
The adoption of a policy of national uniformity in environmental protection standards in the 1990s appears to have been motivated by factors, including a realisation by Australian governments that environmental problems cross state borders and need to be addressed on a nation wide basis. It is not just a matter of taking national responsibility. There is also a need to recognise the fact that, in 1998, it is highly desirable that players in a national marketplace face only one set of rules rather than many.
This bill presents itself as a decision to bind the Commonwealth to NEPMs found in state laws. We need to examine whether the bill in its present form meets that objective. The idea of the Commonwealth meeting environmental standards found in state laws through the NEPM scheme makes sense for two main reasons. The first is the need for consistency among national pollution control and environment protection laws. This scheme of national uniformity would hardly be a truly national scheme unless the Commonwealth itself were bound.
The second reason, speaking candidly, is that the Commonwealth must act to address concerns about the environmental impact of Commonwealth activities. It is a fact that the activities of the Commonwealth and its authorities can have significant environmental impact. The Commonwealth is a major landowner. It also operates a wide range of facilities which involve a number of land uses with the potential to contaminate land with toxic and hazardous waste. For example, according to the Bills Digest, the National Transmission Authority in 1996 was storing over 33 tonnes of highly toxic, polychlorinated biphenyl or PCB material at its 500 sites throughout Australia posing significant health and environment risks.
This example of problems with toxic waste storage was reported by the Australian National Audit Office in its 1996 report entitled, The environmental management of Commonwealth land, site contamination and pollution prevention—that is, report No. 31 of 1996. We have also had other reports pointing to problems involving land contamination as well as air, noise and water pollution arising from Commonwealth activities and places.
In my own electorate, the Commonwealth-owned facility of Essendon airport from time to time generates environmental issues, which are a matter of concern to local people and local government. The issue of the capacity of the local planning laws, the local environmental laws, to apply to the Commonwealth comes up. There have been environmental concerns about aviation issues and about the airport providing a lease for waste recycling facilities.
Where we have the issue of legal uncertainty over the application of state laws to the Commonwealth, the question before us here is: does this bill adequately resolve the existing legal uncertainties surrounding the question of Commonwealth environmental responsibilities under state laws? This issue was the subject of a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 June 1997 entitled, `State pushes to end exemptions on prosecutions for polluting'. The report stated that New South Wales was seeking a test case to break the long held perception of a standing exemption of Commonwealth agencies from state pollution control laws. It said:
All Commonwealth agencies in New South Wales are believed to be the subject of examination by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority. These include military bases, including the Australian Defence Industries at Garden Island, the Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor, Sydney Airport and telecommunications facilities. If successful the EPA action would open a new chapter in the legal relations between the Commonwealth and the states particularly where federal government activities do not enjoy immunity specified in legislation. 

The report continued:
Commonwealth agencies suspected of breaching environmental protection standards set by States have often played both gamekeeper and poacher.
The EPA may still be looking for such a test case. But, in 1997, the High Court, in the Henderson case, revisited the difficult question of the application of state laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies. The Henderson case, according to the Bills Digest , stated—
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.40 a.m. to 12.01 p.m.
According to the Bills Digest:
The High Court's decision of August 1997 in Henderson has considerably reduced the extent to which the Commonwealth and its agents can claim a broad Constitutional immunity from State laws. The Court found that New South Wales residential tenancy laws applied to the activities of the Defence Housing Authority. A 6:1 majority rejected the broad proposition that the Commonwealth cannot be bound by State legislation.
I think two points are applicable here. Firstly, it always remains open to the Commonwealth to legislate to waive any relevant immunity that they have from state law. Secondly, it is open to the Commonwealth to exclude the application of state law by means of the section 109 inconsistency provisions of the Commonwealth constitution.
The bill before us does seek in some limited circumstances to apply state environmental laws to the Commonwealth but only in nominated and declared circumstances. This approach has the potential to generate confusion. As was stated by Senator Schacht in Labor's submission to the Senate ERCA committee, the bill:
. . . rather than clarifying State/Commonwealth responsibilities, by its unnecessary complexity, further blurs and confuses these responsibilities.
The New South Wales government submission argued:
The Bill appears to reflect a Commonwealth decision not to allow state laws to apply of their own force, in accordance with Henderson's case, but rather to set up an inconsistency between those laws and Commonwealth law that will ensure, subject to Commonwealth law, that Commonwealth law prevails.
Clause 9 is an example. According to the Victorian government's EPA, in its submission to the ERCA committee inquiry on the bill:
Clause 9 expressly excludes the application of State laws to Commonwealth places or activities, unless they are applied by the Environment Minister under the Bill. This is a significant step backwards . . . Passage of the Bill in its current form would leave States in the clearly unacceptable position where none of their environment laws apply to the Commonwealth, with no guarantee, or even presumption that those laws will be applied.
The New South Wales government also stated:
The Bill's various exclusions of and qualifications on the application of State laws to Commonwealth activities give the Commonwealth great scope to `pick and choose' which, if any, State laws it will apply to Commonwealth activities. There is a risk that this will result in a piecemeal Commonwealth approach to implementation of NEPMs.
The government's response to these criticisms has been adequate, as it appears determined to evade and avoid the principal objectives of the legislation—that is, the objective of nationally uniform environmental standards.
The response of Environment Australia to the committee was as follows:
The inclusion of the present clause 9 does not purport to suspend all State environmental provisions, only those implementing a NEPM. Clause 9, for example, would not suspend a whole piece of legislation, only the provisions of it that implemented the NEPM in question.
However, this response in our view fails to resolve the uncertainties. It is a recipe for ad hoc decision making. It is not immediately clear which parts of state legislation are implementing NEPMs. Victorian EPA representatives have stated that it would not be necessary to enact additional legislation in Victoria in order to implement NEPMs, as reliance upon existing legislation would suffice. Similar comments were made by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, which stated that New South Wales has significant concerns about the bill.
It is a bill where we see some significant defects. We think it focuses more on exemption of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance. We think it provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what might be described or perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds. We think it contains inadequate accountability measures. An elaborate and overly bureaucratic and convoluted reporting mechanism takes the place of any strong and publicly accessible reporting and enforcement mechanisms. We think the bill fails the accountability and transparency tests. It expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for an offence, and indeed the heaviest penalties of the bill fall upon whistleblowers rather than polluters.
As a result of this and noting that this bill has been through the Senate before it came here, there have been a number of amendments made in the Senate, either sponsored or supported by Labor. The impact of those has been to insert improved public notification measures and to limit the ambit of ministerial discretions to exempt Commonwealth agencies and activities from the provisions of the proposed legislation.
It might save the time of the House if I were to just make some observations about the amendments that were made in the Senate and that might help in terms of getting through the legislative process more quickly. Let me say a few words about the amendments that have come via the Senate. In clause 3 we see an expanded objects clause where amendments have expanded the range of objects of the legislation. Subclause (b) provides for decision making in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development and it also provides for greater public access to information.
In clause 5, in the definitions clause, in the range of matters of national interest, a Labor Party amendment, the insertion of the word `prescribed' into the range of matters of national interest required that only telecommunications and aviation matters prescribed by regulation would gain the national interest exemption from the provisions of the proposed law.
With subclause 10(2) of the bill this subclause was deleted in accordance with a Democrat amendment. The minister in his second reading speech made some reference to the significance of deletion of that subclause. I want to make a few observations about that. As contained in the bill originally presented by the government, it read:
Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth liable to be prosecuted for an offence.
We supported an amendment to delete the clause from that bill, and in the Senate, Senator Bolkus, Labor's environment spokesman, said:
We believe an integral part of this legislation should be to allow the operation to its full effect of state law that is deemed to apply in the circumstances . . . . we do say very strongly that [this amendment] needs to be supported because all it really does is allow the continued application of state criminal law.
The bill seeks to apply selected state environmental laws to the Commonwealth. This could involve the application of the criminal offence provisions. I wish to reiterate the comments made by Senator Bolkus and hope that this amendment will go some way towards improving the environmental performance of the Commonwealth.
The bill contains a definition of a Commonwealth authority that includes government business enterprises and statutory authorities. It is clear from the explanatory memorandum that the government intended that the GBEs be bound and that the so-called shield of the crown not be available to them. In recent years we have seen a winding back of the concept of the shield of the crown, starting with the Bropho case in 1990, where the High Court considered the question of whether the Aboriginal Heritage Act of Western Australia bound the Crown in Western Australia. The High Court held that it did, deciding that a statute will be held to apply to and bind the Crown if its purpose, policy and subject matter disclose an intention that the Crown be bound.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 12.11 p.m. to 12.26 p.m.
—I might be third time lucky, or I might try to get the rest of my speech incorporated in Hansard . There is a rebuttable presumption that the Crown is not liable for criminal offences. Removal of the clause explicitly stating that the Crown is not liable does not significantly alter the position, as it merely serves to weaken the presumption of Crown immunity. We also note that the Crown is already subject to civil law, so you can seek an injunction against the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; therefore it seems to us to be inconsistent not to have both apply. Why shouldn't it be subject to the criminal laws?
The existing position runs counter to broader principles articulated in the High Court in Sankey v. Whitlam and the Hayden case in which the court held that membership of the government was no excuse in relation to the commission of criminal offences, that is, that ministers of the Crown were subject to criminal law. The old arguments put forward in the High Court's 1946 decision of Cain v. Doyle were that the Crown cannot be gaoled and the Crown cannot prosecute itself. However, similar arguments could be put forward theoretically in relation to corporations, but no-one takes such arguments seriously. If the directors and managers of corporations are subject to penalties, why not directors and managers of Commonwealth departments? So, if the private sector is subject to penalties, why not the Crown? If Commonwealth servants, agents and GBEs are subject to criminal liability, then why not also Commonwealth departments and agencies?
I turn briefly to clause 11, the issue of restriction on range of national interest exemption. This clause was amended in the Senate in several respects to fetter ministerial discretion. The first amendment restricted subclause (a) to ensure that environmental outcomes contained in the relevant NEPM were addressed, rather than a more general phrase of `appropriate environmental outcomes'. The second amendment reduced the scope of the administrative efficiency exemption contained in subclause (b) so that in this context the objects of the acts and the principles of ESD must also be considered.
There were amendments in relation to the tabling of ministerial declarations which made provision to require the tabling of ministerial declarations. There were also amendments to 
 clause 25, concerning environmental auditors, which made provision for the appointment of environmental auditors by the relevant minister. Clause 27, concerning environmental auditors, ensures that only fit and proper persons are appointed as environmental auditors. Finally, clause 43, on provision for review of the operation of the act, provides that a review of the operation of the act must be undertaken within five years of the commencement of the act.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-12-10,"—Congratulations to the member for Lyne and the member for Wills for their contributions. What we are talking about today is a proposal that extends some good work that I believe was commenced under the Labor government, and I congratulate them for it. It is an example of how successive governments of different brands can continue to work constructively on things that are clearly in the best interests of the nation. Some of the member for Wills's comments also point to things that we can look at over time. But today it is a matter of moving on with a framework that recognises that environmental problems and management strategies do not stop at borders; they do not stop at jurisdictional boundaries.
With the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 there was a recognition that things could and needed to be done across jurisdictions to address some of the environmental concerns facing our nation. That National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 had a number of focuses in its initial phase protecting Australians from air, water and soil pollution.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—The national environment protection framework, whether it be the measure or the council, both of which are instruments that implement this framework, is an example of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the states in the interests of better environmental outcomes for all Australians. That is to be commended and supported, which it is. I also make the point that the Labor Party is supporting this measure today.
The passage of the  National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  fulfils another coalition government election promise to the Australian people. It signals a continued commitment to the protection of the environment through a cooperative and inclusive national process. The member for Wills outlined that process so I will not go over that again.
The bill required by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 is essential to enable the Commonwealth to implement the national environment protection measures in relation to its own places and activities. More specifically, the bill is required for the Commonwealth to implement three national environment protection measures which have already been made by the National Environment Protection Council. These are the national pollutant inventory, the national environment protection measure, the ambient air quality, NEPM, and the movement of controlled waste between states and territories. Given the situation we are faced with here today I will not talk further about those NEPMs unless there is a requirement to continue while we wait for the minister to arrive.
This bill is evidence of good environmental practice and evidence of what can be done when jurisdictions get together and address mutual concerns about our environment. The process through which national environment protection measures are developed is comprehensive and gives all stakeholders an opportunity for input.
The process is a new opportunity for industry, government and non-government organisations to contribute to the development of NEPMs. That is important, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you would agree. Just look at the national pollutant inventory measure where there was 
 some transportation of chemicals from one jurisdiction to another, or the way in which they are omitted in coastal areas where perhaps state borders and the like were concerned. You would hate to have different standards.
This is also a micro-economic reform measure because it is saying to industry, `Come and work with governments. Come and work with non-government organisations.' We will come up with regulatory frameworks that achieve better environmental outcomes but we will take into account the sorts of constraints that those working with these measures have to deal with.
Here is an example that avoids having different controls, different standards between different states which all aim to achieve much the same thing but go about them in different ways. You would see industry adapting to one jurisdiction's standards and then going to another jurisdiction to do something different. You can see quite clearly how that would be a disincentive for industry to work with those standards and to ensure that they are fully complied with. This framework acknowledges that a close working relationship between industry, the Commonwealth, the states and non-government organisations is the way to get better outcomes for our environment.
There were some issues raised by the member for Wills about compliance and I just remind the Committee that the exemptions available to the Commonwealth are quite narrow and only available under limited circumstances. An exemption for implementing a particular measure at a certain Commonwealth place, or in regard to a certain Commonwealth activity, will only be given on the ground of a matter of national interest. That definition of a matter of national interest is quite limited and has been outlined earlier by the member for Lyne's contribution. It is quite constrained in terms of where the Commonwealth has a mechanism not to fully participate with these NEPMs.
The good thing is that I think the Commonwealth has shown its bona fides, with the support of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, by saying that the Commonwealth is a land manager, that it does carry out activities that impact on others and that it should, wherever possible, uphold the standards and the environmental protection requirements that everybody else has to deal with.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1998-12-10,"—As we all prepare for Christmas we should spare a thought for the isolated mining community of Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast. Over 200 miners and their families are facing uncertain futures after the announcement this week that an administrator will take control of the Mount Lyell copper mine.
Plummeting commodity prices have reached historic lows and brought one of Australia's oldest copper mines to its knees. Indeed, today the commodity trade weighted index is the lowest in 20 years. It will be an anxious wait to see whether it is decided to continue. There is a mood of uncertainty among the people of the west coast of Tasmania. Many, even the most optimistic, fear it could be the end.
If the mine does close down shock waves will be felt not only in my electorate of Braddon and Dick Adams's electorate of Lyons but around Tasmania. At a time when the state desperately needs jobs and investment, it can ill afford a decision that puts the future of a major employer, let alone an icon of the mining industry, in doubt. It would be another very bitter pill to swallow for the north-west and west coasts, which have seen a gradual decline of the region's industrial base and a loss of hundreds of jobs. It is now an all too familiar scenario for many regional centres around Australia, but to see the flagship of Tasmania's proud mining industry in such trouble does little for the confidence of the community, the region and the state.
Once regarded as the world's richest copper mine, Mount Lyell has had a chequered history, but the resilient mining community has always managed to triumph over adversity and I for one am not writing it off just yet. But one thing the miners and the community have no control over is world commodity prices.
I might add that Mount Lyell is not the only mine at the crossroads. Prices for zinc, copper, tin and iron ore are so depressed that all the mines of the west coast are under pressure. It is a terribly unfair return for those who, over the past decade, have poured tens of millions of dollars into trying to access deeper ore bodies—and for the workers who have played a major role in keeping things going. They have done their part. They have had to adjust to change. It has not been easy for them but they accepted the challenges and made things work. Yet the Renison mine, one of the world's largest—
