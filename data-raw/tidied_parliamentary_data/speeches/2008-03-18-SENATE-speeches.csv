"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-03-18,"—My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator the Hon. Penny Wong. Will the minister guarantee that petrol prices will not rise as a result of the government’s emissions-trading policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-03-18,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer, but it appears that once more she has failed to rule out that petrol prices will rise. That being the case, can the minister indicate how much extra consumers should expect to pay at the bowser? How can the government claim to be working to drive the price of petrol down when they do not even know what effect their own emissions-trading policy will have?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I thank Senator Joyce for the question. I can guarantee that this government will do what we said we would do before the election, which is to take decisive action to tackle climate change. I also remind Senator Joyce that the former government in fact committed to an ETS. The former Prime Minister, John Howard, did commit to an emissions-trading scheme. But the thing that I want to emphasise to the chamber is that we know absolutely from the Stern report and from a range of other advisers, including Professor Garnaut, that the cost to the Australian economy and to households of neglecting to act will be significantly greater than the cost of responsible action now. We absolutely know that the cost of inaction and of neglecting to act will be significantly greater than the cost of responsible action now. Australians recognise that tackling climate change will not be painless, but I think the Australian people have a very clear understanding that, as I said, the cost of inaction would be greater than the cost of responsible action now.
Senator Joyce would be aware, as I have said, that the previous government did commit to an emissions-trading scheme. As I recall, we have also heard some comments by the member for Flinders—and I know that Senator Joyce disagrees with him on a range of issues—on the importance of tackling climate change. I want to emphasise, and we emphasised this yesterday, that the government is absolutely aware that the introduction of an emissions-trading scheme is a significant economic policy. It is a significant reform. We will be methodical and careful in our approach to emissions trading. We will undertake modelling, as I have said, within Treasury to assess the best design approach that should be undertaken. I have said very clearly that measures will be developed to assist households, particularly low-income households, to adjust to the impact of carbon prices.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—The government has laid out a very clear timetable which involves a significant amount of consultation and careful consideration of the economic impact. As Senator Joyce will probably know, there are a range of design decisions which the government needs to make, which include trajectory and a range of other assistance measures. It is not possible ahead of that consultation and consideration for this detail to be gone into. This is a significant reform, which is why the government is taking a careful and measured approach. We have announced a period of consultation with stakeholders such as industry to be followed by a green paper and then further consultation on the green paper before draft legislation is instituted. We know that the cost of inaction and of neglecting to act will be far greater than the cost of responsible action now. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-03-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ronaldson today relating to the Transport Workers Union.
We saw again today the refusal of Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister, to acknowledge that the wrongdoings of the TWU and the ALP in New South Wales are worthy of comment by him. This goes to the heart of the now tarnished claims of openness and transparency by the Rudd Labor government.
We have a failed amended return by the TWU late on Friday afternoon and then, on Sunday night, Mr Tony Sheldon, the man responsible for this, still had his name in a cabinet submission to go onto the National Transport Commission. The Australian Labor Party and the Rudd government must have known full well on Friday night of this amended form. This was the same set of circumstances that was denied by Mr Sheldon last year and denied again by him on the Sunday program. Why wasn’t he prepared to tell the Sunday program that this amended return had been filed?
Tony Sheldon, the man who on Sunday night was going to be the representative on the National Transport Commission, was the same man who authorised one of his lackeys on Friday to file this amended return. This amended return took the number of ALP state members who had been supported by the TWU from seven to 15. And Senator Evans tells us today that this is not a matter of concern at all to the Rudd Labor government—so much for openness and transparency.
Why would the Rudd Labor government, which is still going through ‘Wollongong-gate’, as it has been called, not acknowledge that it has problems with its union donations? Why do you continue to oppose the motion supported by the coalition, the Greens, Family First and the Democrats in relation to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which would put all these issues on the table—not just union donations but donations from the corporate sector? What are you afraid of? Why are you not prepared to accept this full inquiry? Why do you continue to deny the illegal activities of the TWU, which is supporting your very own? Is that why you will not do it? Or is it the $30 million that the unions gave to you before the last election? Thirty million favours in return for the shackles. That is why on Sunday night Tony Sheldon was still in that cabinet submission. That is why the bottle of white-out came out only on Monday morning to take his name off. Yet you knew on Friday night of this amended return, which had taken it from seven ALP members to 15. That is a disgrace. It is almost as disgraceful as the amount of money that has been given to them.
Why would you not support an independent judicial inquiry into this matter? We know why not. Because you are not going to do anything to the TWU, the ACTU or any of the other union affiliates which have funded your election campaign. They are owed by you and that is why the likes of Tony Sheldon can get away with what he did.
There was an article by Mark Aarons, a former senior adviser to NSW Premier, Morris Iemma, in the Australian this morning. I know that one of my colleagues will refer to the article and I will do so briefly too. He talks about the influence that ordinary union members have and what they cannot do. He said:
Such matters are simply the playthings of union secretaries. This system is wrong in principle, giving immense power to a small group of unrepresentative ALP members. This can prevent even the best governments from taking the wisest decisions for the widest good.
Absolutely! By refusing to acknowledge these TWU illegal donations, what you have done— (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2008-03-18,"—Another fine performance by Senator Ronaldson. He gets on his feet, yells and screams for five minutes and does not make one point of relevance in the debate. He asked the question of Senator Evans and he got a reasoned, considered response.
—He did not.
—He did not get an answer that you wanted, but he got a reasoned, considered response, Senator Parry. The answer was that the matter is currently before the Australian Electoral Commission. The very fact that the TWU has put in an amended return means that the matter is currently before the commission. Senator Ronaldson is screaming for a judicial inquiry into a matter in which there has been no finding of anything illegal. No-one has yet found that the TWU has done anything that contravenes the Electoral Act. There is an allegation, but there is certainly no finding.
But did we hear Senator Ronaldson get on his feet, screaming for a judicial inquiry when Greenfields was operating in the Liberal Party—when the Liberal Party got $4.6 million out of Greenfields, which was contrary to the spirit of the Electoral Act? Of course not; nor did anybody else on the other side get up and scream about a judicial inquiry into Greenfields. That was a rort set up specifically to disguise where electoral funding to the Liberal Party was coming from. Of course they would not get on their feet and scream for a judicial inquiry into those circumstances.
As I understand it, some advice we have is that in fact the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced that the former government would refer these so-called allegations about the TWU to a range of specialist bodies for investigation. As I understand it, the matters were referred to the Australian Electoral Commission, the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the New South Wales government. I also understand that the Workplace Authority, an Australian industrial registry, also undertook inquiries into these matters. Referring matters to specialised areas of government at both a state and federal level ensures the body with the appropriate legislative responsibilities and investigative powers can undertake a thorough examination of the issues. Obviously what Senator Evans was saying is that the appropriate course to follow here is to allow those investigations, if they are on foot, or any further investigations that come out of the amended return that has been put in, to take place and to proceed with those appropriate bodies.
But that is not what those on the other side want. They do not want a proper investigation of these matters. They do not want to establish whether or not there has been a breach of the Electoral Act. They want a political point that they can get up and pointscore off. They think they have something that will generate some sympathy out there in the community. That is why we have seen again today the spectacle of Senator Ronaldson on his feet, screaming and yelling for another five minutes and making no relevant point of substance in the debate—that is because he does not have one. He has what he thinks is a political hot potato and, as my colleague Senator Hutchins said, he got all hot and bothered. Maybe the potato was burning his fingers; I do not know.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—But certainly it is no substitute getting up here and screaming for five minutes, Senator Abetz—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Donations to Political Parties</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-18,"—The simple fact is that these latest allegations highlight a very deep culture of corruption within the broad Labor movement. Mr Sheldon, the architect of this dishonest scam that Senator Ronaldson so eloquently highlighted and brought to the attention of this chamber, is the one and the same Mr Sheldon who I understand was caught and convicted of ballot rigging in the Liquor Trade Union in Queensland about a decade earlier. What does the Labor movement do with these people who get caught ballot rigging? They warehouse them for a while, slip them across a border somewhere and then put them back in a place somewhere. Having done their apprenticeship in ballot rigging, they then get promoted where they can scam literally millions of dollars from employers and channel it into the Labor Party coffers.
This seems to be a rite of passage within the Australian Labor movement. Indeed, Mr Sheldon’s case shows how all this is done. But do you remember what Mr Rudd, a Queenslander who undoubtedly would have known Mr Sheldon’s background in the Queensland Liquor Trade Union, said before the election? He said, in relation to the trade union rorts, that they would take ‘an absolutely hard line on this stuff’. Yes, that was before the election. Straight after the election it was, ‘Oh, I know nothing about this; we as a Labor Party don’t need to know about this; sure, my party has benefited to the tune of a couple of million dollars or more and over 15 candidates have benefited,’ and, ‘Yes, it wasn’t a proper scheme,’ and, ‘Yes, he was convicted of ballot rigging a decade earlier, but so what?’
Does all this sound familiar, especially to you, Mr Deputy President, as a Queenslander? Remember Mr Mike Kaiser MP who was caught electoral roll rigging. The then Premier Peter Beattie said, ‘We will drum this man out of the state and out of the party.’ Yes, they drummed him straight out of Queensland and into the position of chief of staff to the Labor Premier of New South Wales. This is the way the Labor Party rewards these people. They do an apprenticeship, be it on ballot rigging in Mr Sheldon’s case, be it in electoral roll rigging in Mr Kaiser’s case, and then they get the big promotion for the Labor cause. There is this culture within the Australian Labor Party and, what is more, it exists within the Prime Minister’s office itself. I recall when we were in opposition and Labor were in government pursuing somebody who rejoiced in the name of Mr David Epstein, a person who was brought before the Senate estimates committee deliberately because of misleading information that he provided in relation to the National Media Liaison Service—so-called aNiMaLS, for short. The media knew what sort of a dirt unit it was. It was written up accordingly and Mr Epstein left this place with his tail between his legs. But of course now he is rewarded as chief of staff to Mr Rudd. What we have here are three classic examples of how the Australian Labor Party rewards those people who misbehave. That is unfortunately part of the culture. I have no doubt that one of the former Transport Workers Union officials will get up and try to defend the indefensible in relation to Mr Sheldon.
Senator Hutchins shakes his head and says he will not. Every now and then I think there is a glimmer of hope for Senator Hutchins. Every now and then decency does cut through with him. On this occasion it has cut through again, and I welcome that. But the simple fact is this. The Australian Labor Party has embedded within it this culture: you do a bit of ballot rigging in Queensland and then you get promoted to a much bigger, more powerful union in New South Wales. In Mike Kaiser’s case, you do a bit of electoral roll rigging in Queensland and you then get promoted to be chief of staff to the Labor Premier of New South Wales. In Mr Epstein’s case, you undertake activities with a dirt unit known as aNiMaLs, and then, sure you get sprung, but you just have to leave for a little while and then you will be reincarnated as the chief of staff to the Labor Prime Minister.
What this shows all Australians is: do not listen to what Labor says; look at what it actually does. The fact is that they are willing to have these powerbrokers, like Mr Sheldon, not content with ballot rigging, then rigging millions of dollars, being a powerbroker within the Australian Labor Party and determining who comes into this place representing the Labor Party. He is still in place there, he is still pulling the strings, and Mr Rudd sees no problem with him there; it is not a problem for him. It is a problem for him—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Donations to Political Parties</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I rise to speak to the motion to take note of answers moved by Senator Ronaldson in response to answers given today in the Senate by Senator Evans. This is a matter that was raised yesterday, and here we have it again, raised by Senator Ronaldson. His concern seems to be that there ought to be some form of judicial inquiry set up in order to investigate certain allegations that the TWU bullied transport companies into paying money into a union training fund and donated funds going this way to the members of the ALP in New South Wales. This is the allegation that has been raised. In fact, these allegations go back some time. This is not a new issue. However, we still see Senator Ronaldson going on and on about it.
As I mentioned, this matter was actually raised in September of last year, when the Howard government was still in office. At the time, the former minister for employment and workplace relations, Mr Hockey, announced that the government would refer the allegations that had been made to a range of specialist bodies for them to investigate. In fact, at the time, there were some eight inquiries established into these allegations. Inquiries were set up by the Taxation Office, through the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and through the New South Wales Police. All of these were established in order to see whether or not there had been any breaches of Australian law. A whole gamut of authorities were established to have a look at this matter. The Workplace Authority and the Australian Industrial Registry also undertook inquiries. Today, of course, we hear concerns raised by Senator Ronaldson in relation to additional information that has been provided now by the TWU to the Australian Electoral Commission.
As I said, there have been numerous inquiries that have been established to look at these allegations and so far, to date, there have not been any conclusions drawn by these authorities. None of these inquiries to date have found anything at all that would warrant prosecution. There have been no findings whatsoever of illegal conduct. Most importantly, these inquiries are ongoing; they are not yet exhausted. Surely it is the case that, when you refer a matter such as this to specialised areas of government, both at a state and a federal level, the body with the appropriate legislative responsibility and the investigative powers, ought to be able to conduct a thorough examination of the issues, and they should be able to complete their inquiries—take them right through to the end—before any other sort of judicial inquiry, such as Senator Ronaldson has suggested, is established. The appropriate course of action, clearly, in this instance, is to allow these investigations, which are on foot, particularly that of the Australian Electoral Commission, to proceed.
As Senator Evans said in response to the questions asked by Senator Ronaldson, if Senator Ronaldson or any other senator—or any other person, for that matter—has any information on these matters that they think is relevant then they ought to provide it to these authorities. If they have any information that they believe relates to criminal activity on the part of any person then they ought to refer that information to either the state police, if necessary, or to the Australian Federal Police, whichever body happens to have the jurisdiction over the matter.
So, really, this is a pretty clear-cut case. The AEC has an ongoing investigation, as do a number of other bodies, and we should allow these processes to be completed. They should be able to go right through to the very end and draw the kinds of conclusions that they find, on the basis of evidence. Why would we spend taxpayers money establishing a judicial inquiry at this point in time? Why would we not wait until the authorities who do have the jurisdiction to look at these matters have completed their inquiries? Here we have Senator Ronaldson making allegations, suggesting that people are guilty and finding people guilty when there has not been a proper process in place. There has been no procedural fairness or natural justice provided to these people. As I said, if there are allegations that Senator Ronaldson has to make or if there is any information that he or any other person has then he ought to refer this information to the relevant authorities, whether it be the AEC, the state police or the Australian Federal Police. That is the proper process to follow, and I encourage Senator Ronaldson to be patient and wait for the outcome. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-03-18,"—This is the second day of questioning of the new government on this particular issue and it really is starting to stink. It is a scandal that is engulfing the new government and the Transport Workers Union in allegations of extortion, of misappropriation, of avoidance to declare, and secret commissions and secret donations to ALP members’ campaign funds. That is the extent of the allegations, and the other side just bat it off—for good reasons, as previous speakers have said—because they owe so much to the union.
This gets more suspicious as each day goes on and demands an inquiry, particularly with the revelations in today’s paper that there are in fact more Labor members of parliament who were beneficiaries of the TWU’s secret donations than first suspected. It raises a whole lot of questions. If that is the case, if there are in fact more members that have received these secret, undeclared donations than first suspected by the Sunday show, by the media, it raises a whole lot of questions. First of all, how long has this been going on for? For how many elections can this be backdated? How many declarations have they missed? How many more have not been declared? How can we trust them that 15 is indeed the definitive number? It raises a whole lot of questions that ought to be looked at by a proper judicial inquiry.
We cannot trust Mr Sheldon; he has form, as my colleague Senator Abetz said. He has form from Queensland, brought down to practise his art in New South Wales. His glib remark was that the Sunday show was simply carrying old electoral news. The fact is he rushed the declarations on the Friday to meet the accusations of the Sunday show. That is not old electoral news; that it is a desperate rush for damage control before it all became public. There is no doubt that the new government received phone calls yesterday. They have got their riding instructions today. We have seen the new set of speakers stand up and repeat exactly what was said yesterday, to defend the union and the union officials at any cost at all. As Senator Conroy succinctly put it yesterday, ‘We won’t rat on our mates.’ That basically sums it up.
There is no doubt an inquiry is required. This is a very serious matter. Last month the auditing firm Deloitte’s found serious irregularities in the union’s training funds—misappropriation is basically the bottom line allegation—and claims of extortion against their business associates; that is, extorting money, which, of course, all went to ALP campaign funds. I think some of the union members would be happy for a proper audit of this union. Of course there is the cover-up in relation to declarations. As I said before, Mr Sheldon rushed the declarations in on the Friday before they were all revealed on the Sunday program. We cannot even trust the declarations that have been put in.
And what of the New South Wales ALP officers? You cannot tell me—and I will not accept—that they did not know that at least 15 of their members of parliament were receiving donations for campaign funds. You cannot tell me that a head office is unaware of that. Of course it is not! It does not work that way. They were fully aware of it. And what of their declarations and their obligations? That ought to be looked at too. There is a link between the TWU and the New South Wales head office in relation to these secret campaign funds. Fifteen members have received them and they have only just been declared. What is the responsibility of the ALP officers who were once down there in Macquarie Street? I do not know if they still reside in Macquarie Street, but you cannot tell me that they are not a part of this cover-up. Of course they are. As Senator Ronaldson said, this goes to the heart of the integrity of the new government, which trumpeted their accountability and transparency. Of course it goes to the heart of the integrity of their relationship and the debt they owe the unions. It seems to me they are going to pay that debt back to the tune of $50 million. They are intertwined with the union. We have TWU union members across there, we have TWU members on the administrative committee—(Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008
Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008
Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Repeal Bill 2008
Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Communications Fund) Bill 2008
Tradex Scheme Amendment Bill 2008.
I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONSOLIDATION) BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bill

The bill makes necessary amendments to consolidate the special measures to benefit Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory, including:
prohibit R 18+ television programs in prescribed areas
permit certain prohibited material (that is, pornographic material such as videos and DVDs) to be transported through a prescribed area
provide for certain roadhouses in remote areas to meet the licensing standards for community stores
revoke changes to the permit system which will commence on 17 February 2008.

Reasons for Urgency

The amendments are required urgently so that comprehensive implementation of the special measures in the Northern Territory may continue.  Notably, the amendments relating to the permit system are required as soon as possible after 17 February 2008, when the framework for major changes to the permit system, as introduced by the previous government, commences.
While part of the previous government’s changes providing public access to communities can be limited by not making a Ministerial determination required to make most roads to communities permit free, the public will be able to access communities by air or sea from 17 February 2008.  Passage of the permit measures in this bill is required as soon as possible after 17 February 2008 to repeal the previous government’s changes, thereby removing the ability of the public to access communities by air or sea without a permit.
There has been little communication of the detail and nature of the previous government’s changes to Aboriginal people and the general community in the Northern Territory and there are reports of considerable confusion in this regard.  Any delay in implementing the repeal of the previous government’s changes will increase this confusion, especially as communities will be accessible without a permit by air or sea but not by road.
INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2008
ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) REPEAL BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bills

The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill amends the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 to apply the 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination to vehicles and trailers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS), from 1 July 2008.
In conjunction with the implementation of the charges the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 (RTC Act) will need to be repealed by 1 July 2008.  Implementation of the new 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination for a number of jurisdictions is dependent on the RTC Act being repealed.  In relation to the Australian Capital Territory, this is because it is the host jurisdiction for the template legislation.  Several jurisdictions reference the Act for the purposes of national heavy vehicle registration charges or automatic annual adjustments to charges.

Reasons for Urgency

The new draft 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination is a high priority COAG road transport reform and is scheduled for implementation by all States and Territories and the Australian Government from 1 July 2008. 
It is essential that the Australian Government has the legislative authority to apply this determination to vehicles and trailers registered under the FIRS at the same time as all other jurisdictions.  This will achieve nationally consistent heavy vehicle registration charges.
While most States and Territories currently provide for heavy vehicle registration charges in their own legislation, others are linked to Australian Government legislation.  To enable jurisdictions such as the Australian Capital Territory to implement the new determination, the RTC Act must be repealed to enable their State legislation to prevail.  The new national heavy vehicle (registration) charges model legislation will effectively replace the repealed RTC Act. If approved, the model legislation will be scheduled in regulations, under the National Transport Commission Act 2003.  Under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Inter-modal Transport the Commonwealth has agreed to “repeal any road transport legislation that has been enacted by the Commonwealth for the ACT as soon as practicable”.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMMUNICATIONS FUND) BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bill

The bill amends the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to provide access to money in the Communications Fund to fund the deployment of broadband telecommunications networks.

Reasons for Urgency

A key Government election commitment was to invest up to $4.7 billion (including $2 billion from the Communications Fund) to establish a fibre to the node National Broadband Network, in partnership with the private sector, rolled out over a five‑year period.  The Government envisaged an expedited development and assessment process.
The Government has decided to amend the provisions of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 which establish the Communications Fund to enable money in the Communications Fund to be used to fund the National Broadband Network.  It is important that these funds are made accessible early in the competitive assessment process to facilitate the rollout of the National Broadband Network in 2008.
TRADEX SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bill

The bill:
clarifies the eligibility requirements for Tradex by de-linking it from the Drawback Regulations;
reaffirms the policy intent of the scheme;  and
codifies some administrative details not provided for in the initial legislation.

Reasons for Urgency

Plans to streamline the Tradex Scheme, including through the de-linking of the scheme from duty Drawback regulations, have been in place since January 2006.  Those plans became more urgent on 19 October 2006, when amendments were made to the Customs Regulations to modify administrative aspects of duty Drawback.  Those modifications included changes to the eligibility criteria for duty drawback that raised doubts about the eligibility of many importers for the Tradex Scheme.  Since that time, the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and many of its clients, have had to follow additional procedures required only because of the current legislative framework.
The introduction and passage of the bill in the 2008 Autumn sittings would ensure that unnecessary regulatory burden and uncertainty for industry would be removed without further delay.

That the Senate—
notes with deep regret the passing of Professor Peter Cullen on 13 March 2008;
acknowledges the significant contribution Professor Cullen made:
to the environment, natural resource policy, freshwater ecology, and the management of Australia’s water resources, particularly within the Murray Darling Basin, and
to the knowledge and understanding of these complex and vital issues, including his significant role in the development of sustainable water policy in Australia, and that his insightful analysis will be sorely missed;
acknowledges that Professor Cullen was particularly skilled at bridging the gap between science and the policy and practice of water management, and had a flair for using language that made complex issues accessible and got the point across; for example, some ‘Cullen-isms’ include:
on the importance of water accounting, ‘Flying blind hasn’t worked and we must know how much water we have, where it is and how it is being used. We need to know the health of our waterways’,
on managing water scarcity, ‘Believing we could meet the water needs of these communities by fixing a few leaking taps and having shorter showers was always a fantasy’,
on the Murray Darling, ‘We don’t have all the answers—nobody does—but before we start laying bricks and mortar, we have got to get the foundations right, otherwise the cathedral will tumble with the smallest of tremors’, and
on climate change, ‘We’re doing a wonderful experiment in global warming at the moment but by the time it gets through peer review there might not be many humans left on the planet’; and
offers its condolences to his family and friends.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-03-18,"—On behalf of the Treasurer, Mr Swan, I table a statement on global market turbulence and the Australian economy. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The world has witnessed substantial financial market turbulence since it began in August last year, making its presence felt across markets, across nations, and across continents.
It is of course most evident in the United States, but it affects all of us to a greater or lesser degree, including the hard working families of Australia.
As global financial market turbulence has become more prolonged, Australians have become more concerned about the dimensions and possible consequences of this uncertainty.
Later this week the House will rise, and when we next meet it will be to consider the first Budget of the Rudd Government.
Accordingly I seek the indulgence of this House at this time to review the character, magnitude and status of recent global financial turbulence.
I will inform the House how the Commonwealth Government and the relevant regulatory authorities and agencies within my portfolio are assessing the risks and monitoring these developments.
And I will offer this assessment, Mr Speaker, in the wider context of where the Australian economy has come from, where it is now, and where we hope to go.
When these developments began to unfold eight months ago the central concern was around the size of the write-downs that major global banks would have to accept from the rapidly rising default rates in US sub prime mortgages.
Within a very short time, however, it became an issue of uncertainty about the credit risks embedded in packages of mortgages bundled together by financial institutions and sold into global financial markets.
Sources of funding dried up and the market in sub prime mortgages virtually closed. 
Shortly thereafter the entire residential mortgage backed securities market ceased to function with the depth and liquidity that had made these securities among the most widely held financial assets over the last decade.
With financial institutions here and elsewhere unable to raise as much funds through securitisation, and uncertainty as to the extent of exposures to losses on these assets, they began to hold on to the cash they had. 
Banks here and elsewhere became more reluctant to lend to each other, except in the very short term.
Central banks in all major advanced economies, including our own, responded by offering to lend cash to banks on a much larger scale than usual, accepting as security a wider range of financial assets.
Toward the end of last year it appeared the crisis was beginning to ease as the US Federal Reserve responded by cutting the cash rate and supporting the liquidity of financial institutions.
However, as financial institutions sought to finalise positions prior to Christmas, spreads began to widen once more. 
As we entered the new year, renewed concerns in financial markets were coupled with increasingly convincing signs that economic activity in the US was sharply slowing.
Equity prices across the world declined, as did the US dollar, and banks once again became reluctant to part with cash.
The US Federal Reserve responded with a large cut in the cash rate in January, and more recently has taken action to provide further liquidity to the market.
The prolonged uncertainty took its toll as exposed financial institutions, those with illiquid assets and short term liabilities, came under increasing pressure.
In Australia we experienced a fresh episode of funding dislocation this year, which we’ve seen in a wider premium of wholesale market rates over the cash rate.
In the US market, concern moved on from household mortgages, to the risks of dealing with investment banks which might have difficulty accessing liquidity.
Just this week the US’s fifth largest investment bank was absorbed into a larger competitor after it encountered mounting liquidity problems.
I do not want to downplay the severity of the global financial developments.
Nor do I wish to say that they have no impact on us.
On the contrary there is no doubt Australia’s financial system has been affected by the global financial circumstances.
The residential mortgage backed securities market is no longer functioning in an effective way.
This is true more generally for most asset-backed paper markets, here and elsewhere.
Where Australian financial institutions had been very successful in bundling streams of mortgage income to sell as securities offshore, they now have been obliged to seek other sources of funding.
In recent weeks there has been renewed stress in global short-term bank funding markets.
This is in addition to the continued difficulties in term and securitisation markets, which have functioned under considerable strains for some months.
Funding costs have continued to increase.
Though markedly narrower than it was a week ago, the spread between the Australian 90-day bank bill rate and the cash rate is still around 60 basis points – somewhat wider than the usual spread.
Australian banks have continued to issue in offshore markets, though at higher spreads than were previously the case.
This has led to higher costs of borrowing for businesses and higher mortgage rates for households.
The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is closely monitoring the impact of developments in our banking sector.
Its focus is on ensuring that all institutions have adequate plans in place if the market turbulence continues.
Despite increased issuance in domestic and international bond markets in the early months of this year by major Australian banks, further instances of market turbulence cannot be ruled out.
Problem loans are still very low by historical and international standards, however, and Australia’s corporate debt to equity ratio remains at historically low levels. 
The turmoil in global financial markets has not unduly restricted the total supply of finance to our economy, with strong growth in bank lending more than offsetting the reductions in corporate bond issuance, and in lending to households by mortgage originators.
As the House will be well aware the Commonwealth Government and its regulatory agencies are charged by this Parliament with the responsibility to protect the stability of the financial system on which this economy depends.
My department, the agencies within my portfolio and the Government have been following the global market developments with an eagle eye.
We are in close and continuous contact with financial markets here and offshore.
I have been in almost-daily discussion on this topic: with our central bank, with the regulatory authorities and the leadership of the financial community.
I have consulted with my counterparts in Europe and North America.
Only last Thursday the Secretary of my Department met with his colleagues in the Australian Council of Financial Regulators to discuss developments.
While we are alert to the impacts on our economy, I would point out to the House that the circumstances of our financial institutions are different from those in the US.
While the twelve consecutive rate rises since 2002 have undoubtedly taken a toll on household budgets, we are not experiencing the same levels of mortgage defaults that are now occurring in the US.
While it is important that we recognise the severity, duration and possible consequences of the global financial turbulence, we should also recognise that Australia’s circumstances are more favourable than those elsewhere.
We are not in the least complacent about the circumstances of the Australian economy, but we do recognise that we have strengths on which we need to build.
The very clear differences between Australia’s circumstances and those of some other economies brings me to my second theme.
This is the issue of what economic policy strategy is appropriate in Australia’s current circumstances.
One of those circumstances is the financial turbulence which I have already described.
But that is by no means the only circumstance which I am taking into account in shaping policy in the run up to the Budget over the next two months.
I want now to offer the House my assessment of some other important aspects of our economy.
Our economy’s strength in recent times has been supported by large rises in the prices of our commodity exports.
Australian output growth through last year was just under 4 per cent.
But while we have high prices for our commodities, over the last few years our export performance has been weak.
It is a surprising but undeniable fact that Australian exports have been growing only slowly over most of this decade, at least in terms of volumes.
Our export volumes have grown at an average annual rate of just 1.9 per cent in the seven years since 2000, compared to an average annual rate of 6.9 per cent over the preceding seven years.
This slowdown in export volumes growth has occurred despite strong world growth over this period and against a backdrop of a once in a generation terms of trade boom.
It is clear this performance is more a reflection of supply side constraints rather than a lack of demand for our exports.
The slow down in export growth also goes hand in hand with the slow down in productivity growth.
Driven by strong global demand for our metals, minerals and energy exports our terms of trade have risen to 50 year highs.
While the resource-rich states of Western Australia and Queensland have experienced the largest direct benefits from the terms of trade, the impact has been felt across the whole of our economy.
The rising terms of trade have provided a significant external stimulus to the economy —adding around 1½ percentage points each year to the growth of Australia’s gross domestic income over the last four years.
Demand created by this strong growth in income has outpaced increases in our economy’s supply capacity.  This has contributed to inflationary pressures.
While there is considerable uncertainty around the medium-term outlook for non-rural commodity prices, recently settled contracts and market expectations for iron ore and coal prices suggest further support for the terms of trade in the period ahead.
While further gains in our terms of trade could be expected to continue to support domestic activity, it also presents further challenges for an economy already pushing up against its capacity. 
It is sometimes said, including in this place, that an upswing in mining output from Western Australian and Queensland must be at the expense of Victoria and NSW.
It was quite evident in conversation with my state colleagues last week, however, that this will not necessarily be so.
While Queensland and Western Australia are expecting remarkable increases in the production and transport of iron ore and coal in particular, NSW and Victoria aren’t despondent about the outlook.
Some talk loosely about a two track economy, but NSW final demand increased by over 4.5 per cent last year, and overseas exports from NSW increased over 4 per cent.
Exports increased more in NSW over that same period than in Victoria, or Queensland or Western Australia and of course well above the national average.
Over the same period Victorian final demand increased over 5 per cent.
Unemployment in NSW is 4.2 per cent and Victoria 4.1 per cent, in both cases the lowest outcomes in 30 years of data.
These are not numbers which suggest considerable gloom in either state.
Mr Speaker, with the right policies, growth in the resource rich states of WA and Queensland does not have to be incompatible with growth in NSW and Victoria.
A good deal of the increased income from mining will be distributed locally, as higher employment and consequently higher local spending.
But some of it will be distributed through the rest of the country as higher government revenue or as returns to shareholders.
It is our task to think through these challenges, as we are doing in the run up to the Budget, and get the balance of policy right.   
Given the challenges we confront, Mr Speaker, the Rudd Government has twin objectives in economic policy, which it is pursuing with equal vigour.
One is primarily about the next year or two, and the other is primarily about the next decade.
It would be quite wrong to suggest to the House that our first May Budget will accomplish both objectives immediately.
On the contrary, we are now planning architecture of at least three budgets, each closely related to its predecessor, and each taking us a bit further down the road towards our twin objectives. 
The first objective is of course the gradual moderation of inflation from the rate of 4 per cent or so which the Reserve Bank expects to see in the year to March, to within the target band.
And we will be doing what we can through Budget policy and through other measures to make the Reserve Bank’s job less difficult.
That’s why we have a Five Point Plan to fight inflation, which includes a surplus target of at least 1.5 percent of GDP in 2008-09.
The second objective is to modernise our economy.
This includes the removal of constraints in our physical infrastructure of roads, bridges, ports, water and energy.
It includes a big improvement in Australian education, from pre‑school to our centres of higher education, to compete with the best in the world.
It includes more and better training in skills to improve the quality and size of our workforce.
And it includes taxation and child care reforms to lift labour force participation to reward hard working families for their efforts.
These are big jobs Mr Speaker but we are clear about what we want to do and we will deliver on all our election commitments to Australians.
We have already laid foundations with the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, the provision of an additional 450,000 high quality training places, the decision to better resource technical training in schools, and the plans we have in hand with our counterparts in COAG, of which I will have more to say on a later occasion.
The Government seeks an effective balance between our two objectives.
We can’t rebuild the nation’s economic infrastructure in one Budget. Building world class education systems, modernising our infrastructure and tackling skills shortages will take time.
And our new policies will need to be carefully implemented, so that we do not further complicate demand pressures in the economy.
But we also recognise that tackling inflation in the longer run is largely an issue of the capacity and flexibility of the Australian economy.
The underlying trend increase in inflation has been apparent now for some time and it represents a failure of past government to foresee and prepare for the inevitable consequences of the long expansion we have enjoyed.
To control inflation we need a more responsive and flexible economy, and we won’t get it without addressing our infrastructure constraints now and into the future, without world class education at every level, without upgrading the skills and quality of our workforce.
So in that sense Mr Speaker our two objectives are mutually reinforcing.
Once a lower rate of inflation is achieved we will have more room to remedy the structural shortcomings which have contributed to its acceleration over recent years.
The deteriorating global outlook does present a significant risk to the Australian economy. 
Businesses and households are already feeling the effects of higher interest rates which, in part, reflect global financial turmoil.
The outlook for the global economy and uncertainty in global financial markets is beyond our control, but we are vigilant.
And we remain confident that Australia’s financial institutions and our regulatory agencies are coping reasonably well with a global challenge of considerable severity. 
Developments in global financial markets, combined with significant inflationary pressures in the domestic economy, reinforce our determination to build long-term productivity and growth in our economy.
We are putting all our efforts into modernising our economy, so it’s strong enough and flexible enough to meet future challenges —to create the right environment for business to flourish and to deliver for the working families of our nation.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Global Market Turbulence and the Australian Economy</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move:

That the Senate take note of the document.

My colleague the shadow Treasurer, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, has replied in some detail in the House of Representatives and I will draw briefly on his speech for my remarks. Firstly, I should say that the opposition welcomes the statement by the Treasurer on the crisis in international credit markets. There has, of course, been some considerable concern and we do welcome the statement.
However, we do wish to take this opportunity, because the Treasurer has recapitulated his economic policy, to say where the opposition differ in important respects. Firstly, we recognise, as indeed we all do in this chamber and elsewhere, the importance of ensuring that inflation remains within moderate levels, by which we mean between two and three per cent on average over the cycle. The fact is that, despite the very considerable positive shock to our economy from the improvement in our terms of trade, we have over recent years—and you can take that as being either the entire 47 quarters of the Howard government or the last two years—been able to contain inflation within the target band, and that is so whether you are measuring inflation as the headline CPI or as the RBA’s preferred measure of underlying inflation.
The RBA governor, Glenn Stevens, last week compared the nature of inflationary pressures in today’s economy with those of the early 1950s or mid-1970s. He said:
The reason we are doing better this time around is not hard to fathom ... As work in the Treasury has argued persuasively, a flexible exchange rate, a reformed and flexible industrial environment, better private-sector management and much stronger fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have made a lot of difference. The fruits of those decades of effort of reform are an economy that, for all its strains, is doing well under the circumstances. The officers of the Treasury, past and present, have played a key role in achieving that. That legacy has been handed to you, and to all of us. Our challenge is to keep those improved structures in place and to develop them further, in the period in which we have the privilege of having some influence.
In economics, as the shadow Treasurer and others have pointed out, confidence and expectations are crucial to the performance of the economy. As Alan Greenspan said on 12 February 1998 in testimony to the US congress:
The state of confidence so necessary to the functioning of any economy has been torn asunder. Vicious cycles of ever rising and reinforcing fears have become contagious. Some exchange rates have fallen to levels that are understandable only in the context of a veritable collapse of confidence in the functioning of an economy.
…            …            …
Once the web of confidence, which supports the financial system, is breached, it is difficult to restore quickly.
That is why prime ministers and treasurers successively have consistently used moderate language when speaking about the economy, for confidence can turn very quickly, as I think we have seen and as recent consumer and business confidence surveys show. We have now seen three surveys of confidence, with business confidence falling dramatically in the National Australia Bank business survey for January 2008 and record falls in consumer sentiment in the Westpac Melbourne Institute survey, showing confidence at its lowest level since 1993, and a record fall in the Sensis survey.
In the space of 106 days of the Rudd government, business and consumer confidence have tumbled. Yet, for 11½ years under the coalition government, these indicators held fast despite many ructions and shocks on the international political and economic stage.
This economy is enjoying its 17th year of continuous economic expansion, the longest since Federation. It has been described by the Economist as ‘the wonder down under’. It has unemployment at 35-year lows—that is, now four per cent—while the participation rate is at record highs. This economy has enjoyed average growth over those 11½ years of 3.6 per cent a year, higher than most other developed economies, including the United States and Europe. This economy was 50 per cent larger in real terms when the coalition left government compared with when it commenced government. Real wages grew 21.5 per cent over those 11½ years, when they had fallen 1.8 per cent under the Hawke and Keating governments. This is an economy that has no net debt and has run consistent strong fiscal surpluses; an economy which was strong enough to provide tax cuts each year since 2003 while providing bonuses to carers; an economy where the government was praised in September last year for its exemplary macroeconomic management; and an economy where every year Australian taxpayers are saving over $9 billion in debt interest, allowing greater investment in health, education, roads, the environment and defence.
That was the state of the economy handed to the Rudd government on 3 December 2007 and here we are now 106 days into the Rudd government’s term and business and consumer confidence has been trashed. It does not have to be this way. The economy, as evidenced by the remarkable unemployment figures and the recent national accounts, is strong. The economy is flexible and it is resilient. But the point I want to make is that it is confidence that underpins it all.
Disappointingly, the Treasurer has chosen to misrepresent the economic history of the last decade. He is a Treasurer who continues to try to trash the reputation of the previous government without consideration of the consequences to the Australian economy and the Australian people. He is a Treasurer who repeats ad nauseam gross misrepresentation of the RBA with the so-called 20 warnings; he is one who, unfortunately, talks up inflation with irresponsible comments such as ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle,’ and pushes the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates. He is a Treasurer who cannot help but talk of chronic crises whenever he opens his mouth and one who continues to exaggerate inflationary pressures, unfortunately to score political points.
It does affect the economy, because the Treasurer speaks with the authority and advice of Treasury. It is a lesson of good economic government that great leaders in history have known how to inspire and build confidence and to build credibility. Sadly, it appears the Treasurer has not yet learned his lesson. Of course, we also have a Prime Minister who claims that inflation is the No. 1 short-term problem, yet proposes to absent himself for almost three weeks overseas in the middle of the budget process.
What is disturbing about the reckless comments of the Treasurer and the PM on inflation is that the RBA have now issued warnings about inflationary expectations. The Reserve Bank today released the minutes on monetary policy, which contain two separate warnings. They said:
A concern was that higher inflationary expectations might influence future wage outcomes.
They also noted:
Members were mindful as well of the risk that further increases in inflationary expectations could influence ... wage and price outcomes, which could complicate the task of reducing inflation. Hence, the question remained whether the current stance of monetary policy was sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back towards 2–3 per cent over a reasonable period.
These minutes today highlight that the Treasurer’s immoderate language has made this task even harder and, of course, the Treasurer should be the last person fuelling inflationary expectations. The Treasurer likes to talk endlessly about Reserve Bank warnings, yet does not seem to have considered the effect of his own comments. The warnings about fuelling inflationary expectations keep mounting. Two more warnings were released just today. When will the Treasurer start heeding these warnings?

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—Senator Siewert, I do have some notes here. Perhaps I can read them and then you can indicate if this addresses sufficiently the issues you raise. I think you asked how this amendment would prevent employers from terminating an employee’s employment for the purpose of re-engaging them on an ITEA. The government has now passed an amendment that will enable eligible employees to make ITEAs with previous employees following concerns expressed to the Senate committee. ITEAs would not be available in circumstances where the employee’s employment was brought to an end for the purpose of re-engagement on an ITEA. If this occurred, a fundamental requirement for the ITEA would not have been met; and, if lodged, the document could not operate as a workplace agreement. This is a result of other changes the government is making in the bill—in particular the new section 347A—to ensure that only genuine workplace agreements operate. An employee whose employment was terminated because the employer wanted to re-engage the employee on an ITEA could have remedies under the freedom of association provisions of the act.

              (a)    the ITEA does not result, or would not result, on balance, in a reduction in the employee’s overall terms and conditions of employment under any reference instrument relating to the employee; and
              (b)    the ITEA would not result, on balance, in a reduction in the employee’s overall terms and conditions of employment under any law of a State or Territory that was in existence immediately before the reform commencement that the Workplace Authority Director considers relevant; and
              (c)    the ITEA complies with the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard.
(2)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 6 (lines 1 to 6), omit subsection 346D(2), substitute:
         (2)    A collective agreement passes the no‑disadvantage test if the Workplace Authority Director is satisfied that:
              (a)    the agreement does not result, or would not result, on balance, in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of the employees under any reference instrument relating to one or more of the employees; and
              (b)    the agreement would not result, on balance, in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of the employees under any law of a State or Territory that was in existence immediately before the reform commencement that the Workplace Authority Director considers relevant; and
              (c)    the agreement complies with the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard.
These amendments relate to compliance with standards and certain laws. Part of our concern is addressed by the government’s next amendment, which relates to long service leave. We did articulate in our additional comments to the Senate committee report that we had some concerns about long service leave which came up during the inquiry. However, the government’s amendments do not address all of our concerns—specifically around the fact that the NDT does not take into account the Australian fair pay and conditions standards. We believe it is illogical for an agreement to be passed by the Workplace Authority which breaches the act in any way. While the Workplace Ombudsman deals with compliance with the AFPCS, the Workplace Authority could easily ensure that the agreement is at least lawful. We believe that it does not make any sense for it not to be actually stated in the act that they are required to consider and comply with the standards. We believe the most appropriate thing, if they need to be in the agreement, is that they should actually be in the act. If they are not in the act, how does an employee know if they have actually been complied with? The onus is then on the employee to know that the standards have been complied with. But if it is in the act then they know that their agreement has to comply with those standards. So it would be a much simpler process for them to actually be in the act.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I am not sure if the opposition is speaking on this but I would like to indicate that the government is not supporting this amendment. I just want to be clear with Senator Siewert what the effect of the government’s bill is. An ITEA must not leave an employee worse off over all when compared with the underlying instrument in the workplace—and this may be, for example, a collective agreement or an award. I am advised that the fair pay and conditions standard applies by force of law where the standard provides a more favourable outcome than that provided in their workplace agreement. So an agreement cannot purport to exclude the standard. In our view this amendment is unnecessary. We already have a situation where the standard applies by force of law and where ITEAs must be compared against the underlying instruments for the purposes of considering whether or not an employee is worse off. For those reasons the government is not supporting this amendment.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I move government amendment (5) on sheet PA412:
(5)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 6 (after line 6), after subsection 346D(2), insert:
      (2A)    For the purposes of subsection (1) or (2):
              (a)    a law of a State or Territory that:
                    (i)    relates to long service leave; and
                   (ii)    immediately before the agreement was lodged, applied to an employee referred to in that subsection, or would have applied to such an employee if he or she had been employed by the employer at that time;
                       is taken, to the extent that it provides for long service leave, to be a reference instrument relating to the employee; and
              (b)    if, apart from this subsection, the only reference instrument relating to the employee is a designated award for the employee—the designated award is to be disregarded to the extent (if any) that it provides for long service leave.
This inserts a new subsection. The amendment would further strengthen the agreement-making safety net by making state and territory long service leave laws part of the no disadvantage test where they are not already part of a relevant collective agreement or general instrument. Such laws would not necessarily form part of the no disadvantage test for employees to whom they did not actually apply before a workplace agreement was launched. Where, for example, an applicable award or collective agreement is the basis for the no disadvantage test and excludes a state or territory long service leave law, the Workplace Authority Director would be required to have regard to the agreement or award. If an award is designated for an employee, for example because there is no actually applicable award, and it contains long service leave provisions, the Workplace Authority Director would only have regard to the state or territory law that applied in fact and not the designated award in respect of long service leave. This is consistent with the approach that designated awards are used for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no otherwise applicable instrument.
In short, the amendment ensures that state and territory long service leave laws are part of the no disadvantage test where there is no other federal award or agreement for the purposes of that test which excludes state or territory long service leave law.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

(6)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 6 (after line 27), at the end of section 346D, add:
         (8)    To avoid doubt, if there is a reference instrument in relation to one or more, but not all, of the employees whose employment is subject to a collective agreement:
              (a)    in a case where the agreement passes the no disadvantage test under subsection (2)—it passes the test in relation to all employees whose employment is subject to the agreement; or
              (b)    in a case where the agreement does not pass the no disadvantage test under subsection (2)—it does not pass the test in relation to any employees whose employment is subject to the agreement.
This amendment clarifies the operation of the no disadvantage test where there is a reference instrument in relation to some but not all employees. Currently under that test a collective agreement must be tested if there is a reference instrument in relation to one or more employees and, where there is no reference instrument in relation to any employees, a collective agreement is taken to pass the test. This amendment clarifies that, where there is a reference instrument for one or more employees but not every employee, two things apply. First, a collective agreement that passes the no disadvantage test will pass in relation to all employees, including those for whom there is no reference instrument. Second, a collective agreement that does not pass the no disadvantage test will not pass in relation to any employee, including those for whom there is no reference instrument.

      (1A)    An employer who makes an application under subsection (1) must provide a copy of the application to the relevant employee or employees, as the case may be, within seven days of making the application.
This relates to employees being informed. We believe employees should be informed of the designated award that is being applied. Under new section 346G employers can apply to the Workplace Authority for a particular award to be the designated award. The designated award becomes the award an agreement is tested against and therefore has a direct effect on whether the wages and conditions in an agreement are fair. The designated award could affect the level of take-home pay for an employee depending on what conditions have been bargained with—that is, if an award contains a particularly penalty rate or not. It seems fair that, given the importance of the designated agreement to employees, they be informed which award the employer is proposing. We believe this is a question of natural justice and that employees have a right to be actually properly informed of decisions that directly affect them. We do not actually see why this should not be in the act.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

The government’s bill does ensure that the Workplace Authority is able to consult more widely than previously when designating awards, including with employees and their representatives.

Will there be any restriction or impediment put in place whereby an employee or a union representing a set of employees would not be able to ask which award or awards has been referred to? It is one thing not to provide them automatically. That involves some bureaucratic kinds of procedures and maybe that is a little difficult. But if someone wants to know what award was being referred to, would they be able to ask for that and receive information?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—First in relation to Senator Siewert’s proposition, as I said, the government’s bill ensures that the Workplace Authority can consult more widely than previously when designating the award and we think that is the appropriate way in which to deal with this issue.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move government amendments (7), (9) and (11) on sheet PA412:
(7)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 10 (lines 6 to 25), omit subsection 346G(3).
(9)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 12 (lines 14 to 18), omit subsection 346H(2), substitute:
         (2)    The Workplace Authority Director must determine that an award is a designated award for the employee or employees referred to in subsection (1), if the Workplace Authority Director is satisfied that:
              (a)    on the date of lodgment of the agreement or variation (as the case requires), the employee or employees are or would be employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by the employee or employees:
                    (i)    are usually regulated by an award; or
                   (ii)    would, but for a workplace agreement or another industrial instrument having come into operation, usually be regulated by an award; and
              (b)    there is an award that satisfies the requirements specified in subsection (3).
(11)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 12 (after line 37), after section 346H, insert:
346HA  Effect of State awards etc.
                  For the purposes of paragraphs 346G(2)(a) and 346H(2)(a), an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by an employee are usually regulated by an award is taken to include an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work performed or to be performed by the employee:
              (a)    were, immediately before the reform commencement, usually regulated by a State award, or would, but for an industrial instrument or a State employment agreement having come into operation, usually have been so regulated immediately before the reform commencement; or
              (b)    are usually regulated by any of the following instruments:
                    (i)    a transitional Victorian reference award (within the meaning of Part 7 of Schedule 6);
                   (ii)    a common rule in operation under Schedule 6;
                  (iii)    a transitional award (within the meaning of Schedule 6) other than a Victorian reference award (within the meaning of that Schedule), to the extent that the award regulates excluded employers in respect of the employment of employees in Victoria;
                       or would, but for a workplace agreement or an industrial instrument having come into operation, usually be so regulated.
These amendments go to sections 346G(3), 346H(2) and 346HA, a new section. They are technical amendments to ensure that the ‘usually award regulated’ requirement applies to all designations before and after lodgement of a workplace agreement and to ensure that the references to relevant instruments are correct. Amendment (11) would insert a new provision, section 346HA, which would ensure that the references to each instrument listed above reflect their correct time of operation and deal with the concept of ‘usually regulated by an award both before and after lodgement’. Subsection 346G(3) of the act would no longer be required because it only applies to pre-lodgement designation and would be deleted by amendment (7).
Proposed sections 346G and 346H of the bill relate to the designation of awards for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no other reference instrument against which to test a workplace agreement. Under proposed section 346G—that is, the section dealing with award designation before a workplace agreement is lodged—an award can be designated if the employee or employees in question are employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work are or would usually be regulated by an award. Amendment (9) would amend section 346H to correct a technical oversight to ensure that this requirement—that is, the ‘usually award regulated’ requirement—also applies in relation to award designation after a workplace agreement has been lodged.
Under proposed section 346G(3) of the bill a reference to an award regulated industry or occupation includes an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of employment were usually regulated immediately before the commencement of the Work Choices act by a state award, a transitional Victorian reference award or a common-law or transitional award other than a Victorian reference award to the extent that the award regulates excluded employers in respect of employment of employees in Victoria. Of these instruments, only state awards operated before the commencement of the Work Choices act. The rest were created as federal instruments on 27 March 2006. It is a very lengthy explanation and, as I said at the outset, they are really quite technical amendments.

            ; (d)    if the agreement is a union greenfields agreement or a multiple‑business agreement that would be a union greenfields agreement but for subsection 331(1)—the organisation or organisations bound by the agreement.
These amendments relate to the issues around agreements operating from approval. Under the current arrangements in the bill, certain of the agreements operate from approval—that is, once they are approved by the Workplace Authority then the agreement passes the NDT—and other agreements come into operation on lodgement, which is quite confusing. We received a number of submissions about this during the committee inquiry.
Those agreements that come into operation on lodgement—that is, new employer ITEAs and greenfields agreements—have the potential to require the compensation provisions to be accessed if the agreement does fail the NDT. For employees on ITEAs, we believe this is a particular problem. The compensation provisions are quite complicated and they are not easy for individuals to access. We believe it is much more logical for all agreements to come into operation on approval and bypass the need for a complicated compensation process.
There is an issue around backlog and timeliness of approvals which we believe is a matter of administration and should be dealt with in that way, not through two different types of agreement regimes. As I said, we believe that makes the act much more complicated, and the present system actually replicates the process it goes through now, the fairness test, which we believe is unfair and is generally acknowledged to be unfair.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I indicate that the government is opposing amendments (4) to (8) and (11). The principal amendments moved by Senator Siewert are really amendments (4), (5) and (6), which, in effect, require that all workplace agreements operate from approval. The government’s position is that workplace agreements for new employees—that is, new employee ITEAs or greenfields agreements—should apply on lodgement to provide certainty for these parties. Other agreements, such as ITEAs for existing employees and union or employee collective agreements, will only operate from approval. These are transitional measures which reflect the move from the lodgement-only system under Work Choices to the Labor government’s new workplace relations system from 2010. As Senator Siewert is no doubt aware, under that new system all workplace agreements will be assessed and approved by Fair Work Australia. In effect, amendments (7), (8) and (11) are, in great part, dependent on the primary set of amendments being passed and therefore we would oppose those as well.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—As the minister and participants in the committee would know, this is an important issue, and has always been an important issue in workplace agreements. If an agreement only has provisions to operate from approval and there is a long time gap between lodgement and approval, workers and employees can be at legal risk. You actually need a legal instrument which applies from the moment of employment under a particular agreement. If you have a very slick approval system, of course, the problem falls away because lodgement and approval can occur within a short or almost simultaneous time span. But that is not possible or guaranteed in any administrative situation.
So, on balance, I have tended to favour those who think lodgement is the better time for provisions to come into play, although that can raise great difficulties if they are subsequently not approved. I recognise that you can end up with the worst of all worlds, whichever system you go for.
I have sympathy for the intention of the Greens, but my instinct is that the government’s choice is right given where we are at with the various regulators and authorities, and the distance, as I understand it, between when lodgement occurs and when approval is likely to occur. I cannot see that improving vastly in the near future, so I am inclined to support the government’s direction here.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—Under the process in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, it is highly likely that some employees will in fact be on unfair ITEAs and unfair individual agreements. We do not believe that that is appropriate.
The government came into office saying that it would bring in a new, fairer system and there are certainly elements of that here. The way to make this system even fairer is to accept this amendment and see that all agreements operate from approval. We do appreciate that there are some time lags and significant backlogs with the existing process. I found it ironic that the opposition questioned the government earlier about that, when it was the very system that they had set up. A number of us had said all along that the system was doomed to failure and it would end exactly the way that it has ended—although I should use the word ‘result’ because it has not ended yet. We believe that it is much fairer to employees if agreements operate from approval. We also believe that having two different systems, lodgement and approval, makes the system even more complicated.

 (10) Schedule 1, item 2, page 15 (after line 25), after section 346M, insert:

 Review of decisions of Workplace Authority Director

If the Workplace Authority Director makes a decision under section 346D in relation to an agreement, any of the parties to the agreement in paragraphs 346MA(c) to (f) may appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the decision in accordance with the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.
This again relates to the issue of natural justice and people being informed of decisions. It relates to the amendment that I moved before, which concerned employees having the right to know what designated awards are being used. This one has a similar essence in there being a requirement for workers to be able to access information and to be told about decisions that are affecting them. This came up during the inquiry and I would recommend that people look in particular at Professor Stewart’s comments and submission. We believe it is important for workers and employees to get written reasons and the right of appeal and to be able to look at the decisions on the NDT. It is not just a matter of natural justice but also a matter of basic accountability measures for the NDT. We have raised this previously. We raised it last year in respect of the fairness test and we will continue to raise it.
We believe that decisions on the no disadvantage test do materially affect people. The test goes to people’s wages and conditions and they have a right to know about those wages and conditions because these are of fundamental concern to them. Given the potential seriousness of the decisions made by the Workplace Authority and the requirement for basic accountability measures, we believe that it is a question of natural justice that people be allowed to know this information.
Also, the bill is light on details on consistency of application of the NDT, so how will we know about the basic consistency of application if written reasons are prevented from being given? When a similar no disadvantage test operated prior to Work Choices, there were real issues with consistency of decisions and also with fairness. The application of the test by the then Office of the Employment Advocate resulted in employees losing conditions and receiving inadequate compensation. I remember very vividly talking to workers who were coming to us with concerns around how the Office of the Employment Advocate was working at the time. We should be learning from the past. People should have access to written reasons for decisions. I would therefore like to ask the government why this was not taken into account when the bill was drafted in the first place.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—As senators will know, no written reasons were required under the previous government’s fairness test or under the system pre-Work Choices. The government will ensure that the authority provides information to parties to agreements about the approach they will apply to the assessment of workplace agreements. The government will also ensure that the Workplace Authority informs parties to agreements when they have determined whether an agreement passes or fails the no disadvantage test. However, the government has inherited a backlog of around about 150,000 agreements that require assessment by the Workplace Authority. We are working with the authority to clear this backlog, which arose as a result of the previous government’s decisions.
The reality is that it would take additional time to check compliance with the standard in every agreement, particularly given that the standard, which is 140 pages in length, is complex and convoluted and would require a separate assessment to the global no disadvantage test the government has put in place for agreements during the transition period. For these reasons, the government is not supporting the Greens amendment.
In relation to amendment (10), the government reiterates that we believe our no disadvantage test is a fairer test with simpler rules. The government reiterates its desire for a system which provides certainty to employees and employers, including certainty that agreements will be processed and assessed and the parties notified within a reasonable time frame. As senators will be aware, the powers and functions of Fair Work Australia, which the government promised prior to the election, will be developed as part of our substantive workplace reforms later this year.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—I can understand that the government is dealing with a big backlog of agreements through the failed processes of the past. However, I do not think past unfairnesses justify future unfairnesses. There is an absolute failure in natural justice here if people cannot find out why their agreement failed or passed, particularly what the reasons were for a decision under the NDT. Also, it is a failure of natural justice to be unable to appeal those decisions. As I said, I totally understand that the government is dealing with a large issue here. They need to find an efficient way to deal with it, but that does not mean that workers should continue to be subject to unfair procedures. This bill is about improving the system—the title of the overall package is Forward with Fairness. It is not fair if people do not have access to natural justice and to the reasons for, and the inability to appeal, decisions that directly affect their lives. We have past examples. You need only to have gone to estimates in the past to listen to issue after issue that came up with regard to the Office of Employment Advocate. Cases in relation to the work of that office were continually brought up and asked about at estimates. Therefore we very strongly believe that these two amendments afford a bit of extra fairness in this process.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—Without going to the actual wording of the Greens amendment, I want to deal with the issue of principle that is before us. I think that Senator Siewert is right about the issues of due process. As a legal practitioner herself, the minister would know that a basic in law is that a decision of any authority making a judgement on an agreement should be capable of review. The normal process would be to go to a tribunal such as the industrial relations tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I have a question of the minister. I can understand your attitude in the transitional period. I think it is difficult. There are many messy aspects and nothing is to everyone’s satisfaction, but the government is of course constructing a new regime. My question to the minister is this: is it the intention of the government to take up the principle that Senator Siewert has outlined in its new regime that industrial instruments, whether they be collective or individual agreements, be capable of review and due process if they are subject to a decision by an authority other than the parties to the agreement? Of course, in law, if no third party is involved and there is a dispute, the parties to the agreement can take it to the courts. But in these cases a third party is involved in deciding whether or not an agreement stands, and that agreement process should, under the normal principles of natural justice, be capable of review. So, Minister, are you going to deal with it in your substantive bill?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—Can I deal with this sequentially. First, Senator Siewert, you raise the issue of fairness, and I appreciate the position you are putting. The point I also make is that there are two other aspects of fairness I would ask you to consider. One is the framework—that is, the test against which an agreement is assessed. Obviously there is a no disadvantage test that is much more substantive and real here. Second, I also make the point that, potentially, delay can be an issue of fairness as well, and the government is cognisant of that. Senator Murray raises the point that I was going to respond to in relation to this. I can indicate that we will consider this issue in the context of the substantive bill. I can put it no higher than that, but certainly there are some arguments that have been raised that the government will take into account when considering our substantive bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

(12)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 15 (lines 31 to 34), omit subsection 346N(2), substitute:
         (2)    For the purposes of subsection (1), Division 8 does not apply to the variation of an agreement, except for sections 367, 368, 368A, 372, 373 and 374, paragraph 377(1)(b) and section 380A.
(13)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 20 (lines 27 to 30), omit subsection 346W(5), substitute:
         (5)    For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), Division 8 does not apply to the variation of an agreement, except for sections 367, 368, 368A, 372, 373 and 374, paragraph 377(1)(b) and section 380A.
These amendments ensure that all relevant provisions apply in relation to variations made when workplace agreements fail the no disadvantage test. Under the bill as is currently drafted, for the purpose of varying agreements that initially fail the no disadvantage test, the usual procedural requirements in division 8 of the act do not apply. The only requirements are those set out in subsection 373(1) and section 374.
Other provisions are also required, including those that the bill introduces to ensure that agreement variations are properly approved. The new provisions to be inserted in section 346N(2) and section 346W(5) would, first, apply sections 367 and 368 of the act, which set out who may make a variation and when a variation is made; second, apply proposed new section 368A of the bill to ensure that only genuinely approved variations are capable of operating; and, third, apply section 372 of the act, which requires an employer to seek approval for variation of a union collective or greenfields agreement within a reasonable time. In addition, these amendments substitute the reference to section 373(1) with a reference to section 373 of the act, so that the approval of variations of ITEAs and collective agreements apply, apply proposed new section 377(1)(b) so copies of signed variations would have to be lodged and apply proposed new section 380A to ensure that, where an unapproved variation is lodged, civil remedy provisions apply.

This is a minor technical amendment. The amendment would insert a reference to section 346Q in subsection 346ZH(1). As I said, it is a minor technical amendment and would ensure that an employer who has received a notice under 346Q is required to give a copy of the notice to its existing employees, consistent with similar provisions elsewhere in the bill. As the chamber would be aware, 346Q provides that the Workplace Authority director is required to notify an employer about the outcome of the application of the no disadvantage test in relation to variations of collective agreements that commence operational approval. Proposed section 346ZH requires an employer who has received a notification from the Workplace Authority in relation to a collective agreement to take reasonable steps to ensure that the employees are given a copy of the notice as soon as is practicable.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move amendments (13) and (14) on sheet 5449 together:
(13)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 31 (line 1), after paragraph 346ZJ(1)(b), add:
          or (c)    fail to employ an employee; or
              (d)    treat an employee any less favourably;
(14)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 31 (lines 2 and 3), omit “the sole or dominant reason for the employer dismissing, or threatening to dismiss,”, substitute “one of the reasons for the employer dismissing, threatening to dismiss, failing to employ or treating less favourably,”.
These amendments relate to dismissal and unfair treatment as it relates to whether agreements fail the NDT. Again, this issue was brought up during the hearings, particularly by Professor Stewart and in the ACTU submission. This is another issue that was raised during the last debate over the fairness test. Basically, the provisions in the bill replicate what was in the fairness test and the fairness test provisions. New section 346ZJ attempts to provide protection for employees from dismissal in circumstances where the agreement fails the NDT. There are a couple of issues with the provision. As I said, these are not new issues; they were identified last time we had this debate.
One of the issues is that limiting the protection against dismissal leaves employees open to other forms of adverse treatment, such as demotion and receiving fewer shifts, for example. So dismissal is not the only thing that an employer might do in a potentially discriminatory manner. We believe employees should be protected from this behaviour as part of this bill. The second issue is that there is only protection when the NDT is the sole or determining reason for the dismissal. We believe a stronger protection would be if failure of the NDT is one of the reasons for the adverse consequences or dismissal. So the crux of the matter here is dealing with adverse consequences beyond just dismissal. The other issue we are seeking to deal with is to ensure that failure of the test is only one of the reasons for the adverse consequences. This issue is not new; it was brought up before. I do not see why the government did not pick this up when it drafted the bill, because it seems to me it is blatantly unfair and is, in fact, inconsistent with the government’s approach to fairness to employees.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—The government’s view is that the protection in this section is focused on protection against dismissal. We note that prejudicial variation to working conditions could prima facie breach freedom of association protections and there are significant penalties for such breaches in those circumstances. We do not support this amendment. In respect of amendment (14), we believe the position the government has put in relation to the bill reflects an appropriate balance. I again indicate that these were provisions discussed with both employer and employee parties to the NWRCC—the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council—and the Committee on Industrial Legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—I appreciate that many of the answers I will be receiving today are that these issues were discussed by the reference group. Be that as it may; they were still substantive issues that were brought up during the committee inquiry. I believe that these amendments are a much simpler and easier way of dealing with these issues rather than leaving it up to the other mechanisms that the minister outlined.
As I articulated earlier, we believe this makes this bill fairer and it goes beyond just the dismissal issue. It acknowledges that there are other things that can happen to employees beyond dismissal that are adverse to not only their working conditions but also their work. For example, if they are receiving fewer shifts then it is a similar form of dismissal—if they are doing less shift work and, therefore, less work. I do not understand why the government does not seek to close these loopholes seeing as this issue has been raised a number of times in relation to either the fairness test or the no disadvantage test.

7A  At the end of section 352
Add:
AWAs and ITEAs to expire on nominal expiry date
         (3)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a pre-reform AWA, an AWA or an ITEA expires on its nominal expiry date and ceases to have effect on that date.
As we have already touched on in the chamber during an earlier debate, this bill does not end AWAs. It brings in ITEAs, but AWAs continue until their nominal expiry date and then they only terminate if one of the two parties gives the 90-day notice that they want the agreement to expire. We believe the more appropriate approach would be for the AWAs to expire on the nominal expiry date. There are two ways forward from there: either they can then go on to an ITEA or they can go on to any other subsequent collective agreement. We want to see an end to AWAs and ITEAs, and the amendment proposes that AWAs and ITEAs cease to operate on their nominal expiry dates. We believe that does genuinely get rid of AWAs and it would encourage employers and employees to reach new agreements before the end of the nominal expire dates. It is in that way that we can ensure that AWAs are finished and that gives extra encouragement to employers to reach agreements before the end of the expiry date. We believe this is very important. We believe this is a much better approach and sends a much stronger signal about the government’s intent to genuinely get rid of AWAs.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—I support this amendment for entirely different reasons to those put forward by Senator Siewert. As readers of the inquiry report would know, my recommendation 2 said:
That Labor design an individual statutory employment agreement system as an alternative to individual common-law contracts, that has the following characteristics:
the statutory provisions are fair;
fairness provisions are oversighted and enforced by an active regulator;
the individual statutory agreements are underpinned by a credible safety net of wages and conditions;
individual statutory agreements are subject to a global no-disadvantage test referenced back to the applicable award; and
fast low-cost disputation processes are available.
That being so I wanted to see a continuation of the individual statutory agreement stream, albeit much fairer than the one we have had in the past. So I was particularly pleased with government amendment (1) and I said before question time, rather selfishly, I think, from the perspective of Western Australia, that it is an excellent amendment. I know it is one much desired by employers and employees in my state. I think Senator Siewert has a point because now we have the protection of that amendment (1), which means an ITEA can be made with a previous employee provided the former employee’s employment was not brought to an end in order to re-engage the former employee on the ITEA. So if it expires at the nominal date and the employee genuinely wants to strike an agreement for an ITEA with the employer, I think that is a good thing. It reinforces the proper negotiation and agreements and allows the conditions of employment to be updated. I am sure my motivation is different from yours but I do like the symmetry of what you have done. I think it is better legally, better ethically and better from the point of view of modernising and updating employment arrangements between individuals and their employers. Of course, it would not be as attractive without government amendment (1), which again I compliment the government on for introducing. So we certainly support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—Senator Siewert, I think you are already aware—let me put my glasses on so I can see whether you are nodding—that in my answers to general questions I did indicate the government’s position on this. I appreciate your views in relation to this but we have taken the view that, in developing the policy implementation plan under Forward with Fairness, we had to provide certainty for employers and employees in their terms and conditions without preventing them from agreeing to terminate the agreements if they desired. I read out, I think, in response to earlier questions, the aspect of our policy implementation plan which dealt with this issue. Therefore it comes as no surprise, I am sure, that the government is not supporting this amendment.

This amendment deals with the operation of AWAs. The amendment removes subclause 2(2)(b) from proposed schedule 7A. This means that an AWA made prior to commencement and lodged within the 14-day time frame from commencement would be able to replace an earlier AWA consistent with the current rules. This amendment would omit subclause 2(2)(b) from proposed schedule 7A. Subclause 2(2)(b) of schedule 7A will currently have the effect that paragraph 347(4)(b) of the pre-transition act would not apply to an AWA. Under the bill an AWA made before commencement can be lodged with the Workplace Authority director up to 14 days after commencement. After commencement no new AWAs could be made and after four days no new AWAs could be lodged.

(16)  Schedule 1, item 15, page 39 (after line 28), after clause 2, insert:
2A  Application of no-disadvantage test to AWAs
         (1)    An employee employed under an AWA or the bargaining agent of an employee employed under an AWA may apply to the Workplace Authority Director for a review of the employee’s AWA to determine whether it passes the no-disadvantage test in Division 5A.
         (2)    If the Workplace Authority Director determines that the AWA fails the no-disadvantage test, the employee may terminate the AWA by lodging with the Workplace Authority Director a declaration of termination which meets the requirements set out in subsection 395(3).
         (3)    The employee must take reasonable steps to ensure that written notice of the termination is given to the employer in relation to the AWA.
         (4)    An employer must not:
              (a)    dismiss an employee; or
              (b)    threaten to dismiss an employee; or
              (c)    treat an employee any less favourably;
if one of the reasons for the employer dismissing, threatening to dismiss or treating less favourably, the employee is that the employee sought a review of his or her AWA or that the employee terminated his or her AWA.
         (5)    Subsection (4) is a civil remedy provision.
Note 1:  A contravention of subsection (4) is enforceable by a workplace inspector—see Division 11 for provisions on enforcement.
Note 2:  Division 3 of Part 14 contains other provisions relevant to civil remedies.
This amendment is about AWAs being able to be terminated prior to the expiry date of the NDT. This amendment we believe goes to the heart of fairness and what is wrong with the AWA system and Work Choices. We had very clear evidence to the Senate committee that demonstrated that employees had been forced onto unfair AWAs. In fact, that had happened since the election. The Qantas Valet Parking example was provided to the committee. There was some fairly distressing evidence. We had one of the workers who had been offered an AWA since the election of the government—a government that came into government with a clear policy on these issues. We are also deeply concerned that many people will continue to stay on AWAs until at least their nominal expiry date. We do not support in principle retrospective application of new laws, and we understand that to merely cancel all AWAs now would create many difficulties. However, we do remain convinced that the Work Choices system was unfair. We know that the government believes that the Work Choices system was unfair and we believe very strongly that there are a number of AWAs out there that are unfair.
We believe that this mechanism allows employees to choose to get off unfair AWAs where they do not meet the no disadvantage test. We believe the opportunity should be open to employees to test whether their AWAs are unfair and to get them out of what are unfair work situations. It would also deal with issues where people had been forced, within the few short months between the election and now, onto AWAs which would not meet the no disadvantage test once this bill is passed. We strongly believe that this amendment goes to the heart of the unfairness of the past system. We are trying to reduce the unfairness that workers have been suffering due to the Work Choices system and regime.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I again indicate what we said prior to the election. Obviously the government did have to consider in opposition, when putting forward our policy commitments and our implementation plan, the need to deal with transition arrangements and the need for some certainty in the workplace as we moved to a new system. The government’s policy as set out prior to the election is that AWAs made prior to the implementation date of this bill, Labor’s transition bill, will remain in force and may only be terminated in accordance with current rules. These rules allow termination by agreement between the parties during the term of the AWA or termination by one party when providing 90-days notice to the other after the nominal expiry date. Under our policy, if an AWA is terminated in such circumstances, then the employee will revert to an existing collective agreement in the workplace or, where there is no collective agreement, will revert to the award, and obviously the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard will also continue to apply.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,—What does the government intend to do? Let me be clear: this amendment gives employees the ability to test their AWA against the no disadvantage test. What does the government intend to do in circumstances where there is clear evidence of people being forced onto AWAs in that period between the election and when this bill comes into effect? I do not know how many people there are out there in this situation but I know there are some. I am sure the government has been presented with stories and other senators in this place have heard similar stories. Does the government intend to address that inherent unfairness? It is even more unfair when people have been forced onto these instruments since the election. This is not just about those employees but is a way of picking up those employees without making the act specifically retrospective.,SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-18,"—I will make a contribution because I would have thought the minister would have found it within herself to say that under the existing legislation, prior to the amendments that we are discussing today, it is illegal to force anybody onto an AWA, and the remedies that the minister is referring to are in fact remedies that already exist in the legislation, prior to this raft of amendments.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—That is correct. If I may add to the debate: the great weakness of the regime pre Work Choices was the lack of a regulator to ensure that duress was properly policed. That was the greatest problem. One of the very significant advances made by Work Choices and reinforced by Labor policy is the decision to have a much stronger regulatory regime for workplace relations nationally. If any good has come out of all those events, it is an understanding that, without strong regulations and a strong regulator who can enforce the law, you actually cannot ensure fairness, particularly when it is a question of an individual employer and an individual employee with no other witness at their negotiation. So I would confirm the law on duress was there and was improved subsequently with the provision of a decent regulator. Through the chair: Minister, I hope that, under your substantive bill and in your policy to come, your regulator will be even stronger and even more capable of ensuring as much fairness and fair play in industrial relations as possible.

This relates to no variation of AWAs. This bill provides in general for no variation of AWAs, and we support this. However, the bill does provide for AWAs to be varied if they fail the fairness test, if they contain provisions which are discriminatory or if they contain prohibited content. We believe that, for the protection of employees, AWAs that fail the fairness test should not be able to be amended to pass it. This bill introduces a new test for agreements—as we all know, that is the no disadvantage test—and we should ensure that as many agreements as possible are required to pass the new test. There is a significant difference between the fairness test and the NDT, which the minister has pointed out to the chamber, and if an AWA fails the fairness test we think it should be void and the employer required to enter into a new agreement. The bill provides for ITEAs, which are subject to the NDT.
I remind the chamber—but I think the minister pointed this out, and earlier in question time so did Senator Fisher—that there are a lot of agreements currently being processed, around 150,000. That is, there are 150,000 agreements currently being processed that could potentially be unfair. Going on the average statistics for agreements currently failing the test, I would say a good portion of those would fail the test. We believe that if an AWA fails the fairness test, which is not as effective as the NDT, it should not then be allowed to be varied and should in fact have to go through the whole new process that comes into effect with this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I suspect, Senator Siewert—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—this is another manifestation of a fundamental disagreement about how we manage the transition process and our view that some certainty needs to attach to agreements, notwithstanding that we disagreed with those laws when they were passed. The government clearly have to deal with the reality that there are people who made agreements and therefore we have to have a transition process. A lot of the disagreement between us and the crossbenches, particularly the Greens, is due to different views about how to handle that—and I respect that that is a different view. In our view, the bill enables some limited variation of AWAs to deal with specified issues. Having made the decision we have made to allow existing AWAs to continue under the provisions that I previously alluded to, we do need to continue to be able to vary AWAs for specified matters only. I do make the point that the government’s bill does not allow ongoing substantive variations to AWAs. If parties wish to do that, the government’s view is that they can bargain under the transitional legislation and/or do so later on pursuant to the new substantive legislation that the government will put before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—I take your point; I think it is a substantial, fundamental disagreement about what should and should not be included in the transitional bill. But, if previous AWAs are failing the previous government’s fairness test, I do not see why we should guarantee those employers certainty. I think they should be required to start again. I accept that we have a fundamental disagreement, but this is about fairness. We keep talking about fairness, but I do not think it is fair that an employee should have to keep going through that process if the AWA has already failed the fairness test. It should not be allowed to be varied. They should start again.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move government amendments (18) and (19) on sheet PA412 together:
(18)  Schedule 1, item 15, page 41 (line 24), omit “the 14 day period referred to in section 342”, substitute “a period of 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule”.
(19)  Schedule 1, item 15, page 41 (lines 33 and 34), omit “the 14 day period referred to in section 375”, substitute “a period of 14 days after the commencement of this Schedule”.
These amendments seek to amend subsections 7(1)(b) and 7(2)(b). These amendments would enable lodgement of an AWA or a variation of an AWA to be made before the commencement of the bill and lodged after 14 days from the day it was made—which would otherwise be in breach of section 342 or section 375—to be accepted by the Workplace Authority in accordance with current rules. These amendments would require the Workplace Authority director to notify the parties, where an AWA or variation made to an AWA has been lodged at the end of 14 days after the commencement of the schedule, rather than 14 days after the AWA or variation was made, if lodgement has not been effective and the AWA or variation is not in operation. The penalty provisions for breach of sections 342 and 375 would continue to apply. In short, the purpose of the amendments is to make clear, in accordance with current arrangements for AWAs, that agreements made before commencement and lodged after the end of the approval period can be accepted, provided they have been lodged by the end of 14 days from commencement of the bill.

That is why the Deputy Prime Minister has made clear that the government will take a consultative approach, both through the Senate process and also in relation to consultations with employers and employees, on these bills.

15A  Effect of repeal of section 399
(1)    To avoid doubt, if, immediately before the commencement of this item, an industrial instrument had no effect because of the operation of section 399 of the pre-transition Act, the repeal of that section by this Act:
              (a)    does not cause the instrument to have effect after that commencement; and
              (b)    does not cause any protected award condition to cease to have effect.
(2)    In this item:

industrial instrument means an instrument mentioned in subsection 399(3) of the pre-transition Act, and includes any of the following (except to the extent that they contain protected award conditions):
              (a)    a common rule within the meaning of clause 89 of Schedule 6;
              (b)    a transitional Victorian reference award within the meaning of Part 7 of that Schedule;
              (c)    a transitional award within the meaning of that Schedule, to the extent that subclause 102(1) of that Schedule applies to it.

pre‑transition Act means the Workplace Relations Act 1996 as in force immediately before the commencement of this item.

protected award condition has the meaning it had for the purposes of section 354 of the pre‑transition Act.
Currently, the act provides that an agreement or award ceases to operate because it is replaced by a new agreement but the award or old agreement can revive when a replacement agreement is terminated.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 5443:

I draw the attention of the participants to sheet 5443. I intend to make my remarks to all three sets of amendments that you see on that sheet in one go. I do not intend to speak at length; I think participants in the debate know what this is about so I will deal with it on that basis. When I am discussing the unfair dismissals issue with people who are not members of parliament, they are always quite astonished when I say, ‘Actually, all parties are in furious agreement on unfair dismissals.’ Every political party does actually support unfair dismissal provisions; the quarrels have been about the threshold at which they apply and the extent to which they apply. The coalition, for instance—taking them as a starting point—began their life in government in 1996 supporting unfair dismissal provisions for all employees but agreed with the Democrats, in our agreement on the 1996 bill, that there would be restrictions placed on probationary, casual and specified-term contract employees applying for unfair dismissal relief. The result of that agreement was that federal unfair dismissal applications fell by 50 per cent. Subsequently, in 1997, the coalition began to ratchet it back, and in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 the coalition proposed a permanent exclusion for new employees in businesses of 15 employees or fewer from making an unfair dismissal application. That bill eventually ended up as a double dissolution trigger. The point is that having provisions for unfair dismissals was still a policy for the coalition for businesses with above 15 employees at that time. Fifteen was chosen because it was the number used in industrial instruments. Subsequently, the policy of the coalition was to set it at what was known as the small business level, which was the Australian Bureau of Statistics level of 20 employees or more, and then they raised it even higher with Work Choices to 100 employees or more.
The Greens have always held to the view that unfair dismissal provisions should apply to all employees. Labor did hold that view but have now moved to the view of the coalition in 1997, which is that it should apply to organisations with 15 or more employees. The Democrats continue to believe that all employees should have access—provided, of course, that the surrounding environment discourages vexatious claims and that restrictions are placed on probationary, casual and specified-term contract employees.
Knowing that the coalition are still attached to the view that unfair dismissal provisions should not apply to small business, and knowing that the Labor policy is for unfair dismissal provisions to apply to organisations with 15 employees or more, I thought I would bring the issue on—just to be helpful. I have proposed what I would describe broadly as Green and Democrats policy: that unfair dismissal provisions under the Workplace Relations Act apply to all employees—items (1) and (2) on sheet 5443. Then, if that goes down—which, I must say, in my pessimistic way I have anticipated it will—I offer up Labor policy; and, if that goes down, I then offer up what was the previous coalition policy, which is for it to apply to organisations with 20 or more employees.
What I expect is that, when the substantive bill that Labor talked about is introduced later this year, they will bring forward their policy of unfair dismissal provisions applying to organisations with 15 or more employees, and they will have to get the numbers from the Greens senators and the votes of Senators Fielding and Xenophon to agree with that. I suspect they will get that approval and so it will become law. What I would like is for it to become law now. I do not raise this to be mildly provocative but because the issue of unfair dismissal provisions and it being of assistance in fairness matters was raised by a number of witnesses in the Senate inquiry, independently of my questioning or anybody else’s questioning. I do not propose to say much more unless I am obliged to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—Readers of the amendments will know that the Greens have an extraordinarily similar amendment to the universal dismissal amendment that Senator Murray has moved on behalf of the Democrats. We are also moving to get rid of the concept of operational reasons for dismissal.
We will be supporting this amendment; it is extremely similar to our amendment. The declared intent of the government is to deal with the issues of unfair dismissal; we do not agree with them taking it down to 15 employees. I think the Greens have been on the record on many occasions saying we support universal unfair dismissal rights, hence our amendment. We will be supporting the Democrats amendment to take it to 15 employees and, if that is unsuccessful, then to 20. We realise that it is better than the current situation, although our preferred position is that it applies, as the Democrats amendment says here, ‘regardless of numbers of employees in a business’.
Senator Murray is right: it came up on a number of occasions during the Senate inquiry. It is clearly the government’s policy to deal with and change unfair dismissal laws. We would urge the government to do it now, rather than leave it until the substantive bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-18,"—These are provocative amendments by Senator Murray. They are provocative to the government. It is a very simple amendment to delete one number and put in another number. If the Labor Party actually believed their vehement rhetoric on this, you would imagine that they would accept the amendments of the Democrats. If the unfair dismissal laws are such a matter of great social injustice, as we were led to believe, one would wonder why the Labor Party would not seek the first opportunity to overturn the unfair dismissal laws that we introduced and indeed were elected upon on a number of occasions with a very firm unfair dismissals policy.
It is interesting to reflect that when we introduced certain changes we were told that Labor would oppose them lock, stock and barrel and would rip them up wholesale. We now know that the lock of the constitutional lock—namely, use of the corporations power—is accepted by Labor and the stock was having a national system, now accepted by Labor. In relation to the barrel, all they are doing is making it into a sawn-off shotgun rather than getting rid of the barrel, because they now accept the principle of an unfair dismissal law. They accept that principle.
As Senator Murray quite rightly points out, at least the Greens are consistent. They oppose it all the way down the line. That is fine—fundamental disagreement there. The only thing that stands between the Australian Labor Party and the alternative government on this is that we are unashamedly pro small business, and that is why we support as high a threshold as possible. We believe 100 is the appropriate figure. If you are anti small business, you would go to the lowest possible threshold whilst paying lip-service to small business and saying, ‘Yes, we do need unfair dismissal laws.’ Therefore, Labor have agreed to set it at 15.
The interesting thing is that, when this section was introduced by the former government, I remember receiving wholesale assaults from those opposite saying that this would lead to mass sackings and it would see unemployment skyrocket. The argument that we consistently put as the government at the time was that employers are called ‘employers’ and not ‘dismissers’ for a very simple reason: they are in the game of employing people, not dismissing people. As soon as we gave employers the confidence that if things did not work out they could dismiss, guess what? The unemployment level in this country, and the social misery caused by the unemployment level, was driven down from above five per cent to below five per cent and now, with the latest figures, to below four per cent—3.97 per cent. So, rather than seeing wholesale sackings, we saw wholesale employment and the removal of the social misery of unemployment from literally thousands of our fellow Australians.
We stand by what we stood for and remain consistent with our view that the unfair dismissal laws, which were a social experiment introduced by Prime Minister Keating, were an abysmal failure. They were a great disincentive to employment. Once they were removed, as we had sought to do, we saw a whole percentage point plus fall in our unemployment rate in this country. That meant the removal of the social misery associated with unemployment for literally tens of thousands of our fellow Australians. We believe that, in relation to unfair dismissals, we did get it right. We will be opposing the amendments, but it will be interesting to see how the government twist and turn on this one. Because of all the extravagant and extreme statements they made in relation to unfair dismissals, you would have thought they would be tripping over themselves to bring in legislation to get rid of it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I thank Senator Abetz for reminding us and certainly reminding the crossbenches of what the alternative might be just as Senator Siewert was getting grouchy at me. The government made our position on unfair dismissals absolutely clear prior to the election. We do want a new fair and balanced system for the benefit of both employers and employees. We believe the previous government’s 100-employees exemption went way too far. I might be corrected, but I do not recall former Prime Minister Howard nor Senator Abetz prior to the preceding election ever running around telling people that they considered 100 employees to be the appropriate cut-off. My recollection is that that was a late conversion.
The government’s policy is that employees employed in businesses with fewer than 15 employees will have to satisfy a 12-month qualifying period so that the employer can determine whether those employees are appropriate for their business. Unlike with these amendments, such employers will have protection once they satisfy that qualifying period. We consider that to be an appropriate balance for business, particularly small business. As the chamber may be aware, it is the government’s intention to ensure that businesses be protected by a simpler and faster system. The bill before the chamber does not, as I think Senator Murray indicated, substantively deal with the unfair dismissal regime. These are issues that will be addressed in the context of the substantive bill. Senator Murray, I appreciate you moving the amendments at this time, because it may be the case that you will not be here when we debate—
—That’s unkind and unnecessary.
—I was actually about to say something nice to him. I was going to say that, whilst I personally and the Labor Party may not have always agreed with Senator Murray, his contributions to this chamber have always been measured and intelligent and it will be very strange to go through the substantive bill without him on the crossbenches.

In moving these amendments, I will briefly remark that I understand the arguments put by the coalition in support of their policy, but I will indicate my own opinion is that there is absolutely no empirical evidence to indicate that there was a one per cent drop in unemployment because the size of a business to which unfair dismissal provisions applied was raised to 100 employees from zero. In fact, I recall with pride the contribution the Democrats made to the pre-Work Choices area, where I think employment increased by 1½ million or more over the years, and I would never dream of attributing that to the efforts we put in on unfair dismissals or anything else.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-18,"—What we had in relation to the climate was a very high rate of unemployment from which Australia had suffered, with over one million of our fellow Australians on the unemployment scrap heap, courtesy of the Hawke-Keating government. We then drove down the unemployment rate to slightly above five per cent, and it hovered there for 20 months unabated. Then all of a sudden some changes were made to legislation, and since then the unemployment rate has consistently decreased. You have got to ask yourself: what was that circuit-breaker about two years ago?
—China.
—Can I say to you China existed more than two years ago and the boom and other matters were already happening prior to that time. But for 20 months during that boom the unemployment rate hovered between 5.2 per cent and five per cent and could not break that psychological barrier. Indeed, there were many commentators saying, ‘Look, the government should be satisfied with five per cent unemployment,’ and that that really represented full employment. We who saw the social misery of unemployment said: ‘No, that’s not good enough. We will do everything we possibly can within reason to drive it down further.’
Whilst I am willing to accept that possibly not every single job can be directly related to the changes, the simple fact is that the vast bulk of those jobs were a result of the change, because nobody can point to anything other than those changes that were made some two years ago as the reason for that dramatic fall to where we are now—technically below four per cent, on 3.97 per cent. I accept it is four per cent. But to have crashed through that psychological barrier of five per cent, and now even through four per cent, is something for which I think there are many tens of thousands of Australians genuinely thankful to the previous government—albeit we accept the verdict of the Australian people, of course, on 24 November. Just as 47 per cent of people wanted us to stay in office, we accept that, in round figures, 53 per cent did not, and that is why we are not standing in the way of these changes. I remind the Senate that we do not stand in the way, unlike the way the Labor Party treated us when we won government on certain policies such as GST, balancing the budgets et cetera.
I note that I did withdraw something prior to question time, at 12.30 today. It is amazing, when you are on radio and you have to withdraw something, how the information flows into your office. I have been advised that somebody in a lumberjack type shirt was in fact spotted outside the doors of Parliament House shortly before they came down. I will not take the matter any further, but it was interesting the person that was identified to me by that information.

As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman Bartlett, we have lost the amendments that would allow all employees access to unfair dismissal under the Workplace Relations Act. We then had the amendments which would allow access to unfair dismissal provisions for all employees working in organisations with 15 employees or more, which is Labor policy. Those amendments have been lost. These amendments now set the level at which employees would have access to unfair dismissal at the 20 mark, which is the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of a small business—a small business being below 20 employees and a medium business being above.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—Thank you. I do appreciate that if you have further information you will come back to us. We could stand here going backwards and forwards arguing for hours about what is appropriate to put in this bill and what is not as you start the process, but I will not indulge in that. I will go on to my first amendment which is on sheet 5451. This relates to awards coverage. These awards have fundamentally changed under Work Choices and this bill. There are no longer any opportunities for parties to create new awards. Therefore, there is no ability, except through the modernisation process, for award coverage to be extended.
Evidence before the Senate committee, as I understand it, indicated that 10 per cent of employees currently have no award coverage. Given the historical award coverage is industry and occupations based, we can assume that in the future new industries and occupations may come into existence and may not be covered by an award. We do not see why these employees should be without part of the safety net. We do not believe that it is sufficient for the award modernisation request to leave it to the discretion of the AIRC as to whether or not award coverage is extended to all employees. The changed nature of awards and their role in the safety net means that it is an imperative that award coverage is as complete as possible, and this amendment is how we seek to do that. We seek to extend award coverage to employees that may not be covered. That is what this amendment is about. I will also take this opportunity to ask—and I am anticipating that the government ain’t going to like this—whether it is something that is being considered for the substantive bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—You anticipated my response in terms of your reference to the award modernisation request. I would make the point that the extension of awards to new classes of employees has, under various iterations of federal industrial law and state industrial law, traditionally been something that the industrial tribunals have done. It is not a new concept.
We have made it clear in section 2(a) of the award modernisation request that the commission is not precluded from extending coverage to new industries or occupations where work performed by those employees is similar to that conducted by employees who are traditionally covered by awards. The government’s position sufficiently addresses the issue you have raised with your amendment.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—I doubt the minister, and maybe not even the department, would have had the opportunity to consider this. What is being raised here is an issue of very broad concern. Minister, I ask you, through the chair, to take a professional and quite deep interest in the matter as you progress towards the resolution of the substantive bill. I appreciate that it is not your portfolio, but I also appreciate that consultation is going to occur not just between the Labor government and outside parties but also internally. The issue is that apparently—and it is very difficult to get the statistics—anywhere up to 800,000 Australians may not be covered or underpinned by the safety net of an award. The issue is whether the National Employment Standards will substitute and therefore cover them or whether something needs to be done whereby a default provision exists for a common-rule award, which applies to everybody who is not otherwise covered.
I think the evidence is that this is an issue of concern. It is a material issue. I am not at all sure it can be dealt with in the shorthand version of Senator Siewert’s amendment, which is why I do not support it. I think it is a far deeper issue which needs much broader attention, although I think Senator Siewert is dead right to be raising this as an issue. At the heart of modern industrial policy—whether it is the coalition, the crossbenchers or the Labor Party—is the belief that you have got to have a comprehensive safety net, which means that every employee has to be covered by either an award, an industrial instrument or the National Employment Standards. It is a problem that has been identified in evidence. It is an uncertain problem; the statistics are rubbery. It does seem that substantial numbers of employees are not covered appropriately, and they should be.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—Beyond the issue of us saying this should apply to all employees is that we think it should be an object of this part, which is where the amendment goes to, and it should not be up to the discretion of the AIRC. As an Australian community, we should be extending awards and ensuring they cover all employees. We are saying that it is a fundamental tenet that should be included in the act and not left up to the discretion of the AIRC, which is how the government’s bill stands at the moment. The point here is that it should apply to everybody and it should not be a discretionary issue.

Schedule 2, item 9, page 91 (after line 24), after paragraph 576B(2)(h), insert:
the need for rates of pay and classifications to provide equal pay for work of equal value;
I take your point, Senator Murray. These issues relate to pay equity, which came up extensively as an issue during the inquiry. One point that became clear was that gender pay equity had significantly decreased under the AWA process. It should be noted that this occurred in Western Australia under the Court era of IR reform. Research has been presented that showed there was a clear impact on pay equity then, and it has gotten worse in Western Australia under the Work Choices regime. In fact, my home state of Western Australia has the dubious record of being one of the worst states in Australia, if not the worst state, for pay equity and the different rates of pay for men and women. We all know that the average pay rates for women in Australia are well below the average pay rates for men. Research conducted in Australia over the last 10 years points to awards playing an important role in addressing gender pay inequity. For example, most states now have pay equity principles, which allow awards to be varied to ensure equal pay for work of equal value.
I outlined in our speech in the second reading debate that we would be addressing this issue through amendments. We are concerned that the award modernisation process will merely consolidate these pay inequities as they exist in awards, without the Industrial Relations Commission being required to consider pay equity when modernising awards. At the very least, we would urge the government to include an effective pay equity mechanism in the substantive bill. I am already pre-empting that that may be an issue. One of the government’s responses is that this should be dealt with in the substantive bill. I would specifically like to ask questions around this issue and how it is envisaged that the award modernisation process will consider pay equity issues in the awards. If the government does not think this is appropriate, why not? How does it intend to deal with this issue if it is not dealt with through this process?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I can indicate that the government considers that the award modernisation request which is included in the explanatory memorandum does address this concern, and I would refer the chamber to item 3(E), which includes promotion of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value. I also point out that section 576B, which sets out the commission’s award modernisation function, contains at subparagraph (2)(e) the same iteration—the promotion of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value.
I also understand that section 104 of the principal act requires the commission to take into account the need to apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value in performing its functions, and that section will continue to apply to the commission in undertaking award modernisation. The government does share concerns about the erosion of women’s pay and conditions and an apparent increase in the gender pay gap under the previous government’s Work Choices laws. We are working to redress this in a number of ways including: the abolition of AWAs, establishing a stronger no disadvantage test, establishing a new safety net including 10 National Employment Standards and through the award modernisation process.
In addition, changes to the equal remuneration provisions in the act are currently being considered in the context of the government’s substantive workplace relations legislation to be introduced into parliament this year. The award modernisation request, as I have outlined already, ensures the commission must promote the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value, and this is a stronger requirement in the government’s view than ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—The minister touched on an important point there—that is, we do not consider the current pay equity provisions in the act efficient. The fact is that they are not dealing with this issue because the gender pay gap is actually getting worse. Does the government consider that the current provisions in the award modernisation request will satisfactorily start addressing the current inequity? It is all very well to provide a provision to ensure equal pay for equal work, but that is obviously going to require a series of steps to address the actual current inequity. Is it envisaged that that process will be able to be undertaken through the current instructions under the award minimisation request?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I think I have put on record the government’s position in relation to this issue. I have gone through the sections of both the award modernisation request and the bill that we believe deal with this issue. Of course this government want to ensure that there is a reduction in the gender pay gap. We recognise that the previous government’s laws have not been good for many working women in terms of their paid work and we believe that the provisions to which I have referred deal with that. I have also flagged to you that further consideration of this issue will occur in the context of the substantive legislation.

This is about the regular review of awards. We very strongly believe that awards must be living documents that can adapt to changes in community standards. Awards have been the main vehicle for establishing community standards in workplace conditions such as annual leave, carers leave, parental leave, restrictions on working hours et cetera. We have not reached an end point in the evolution of workplace standards. I do not believe we can imagine that we ever actually will. They will continue to be living documents. Workplaces and labour markets will continue to change and we must have a process for award safety nets to respond. This is another issue that was brought up at the committee inquiry hearings. There was a good deal of comment around this. I would like to ask: is the government considering a regular review of awards and how will the government ensure that their award system remains relevant to changing conditions?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

We have also committed that awards would then be reviewed every four years to ensure they remain relevant. We do not believe the amendment really deals with the objects of award modernisation; rather, it intends to deal with—and in fact this is what Senator Siewert’s comments were directed towards—the maintenance of the awards system. That is a matter, including in terms of the commitment I have indicated, that will be dealt with in the substantive workplace relations legislation.

This specifically relates to exceptional matters. We believe the matters that are listed to be considered in modern awards are too limiting. The ACTU gave examples in the committee inquiry of important industry-specific conditions that will be lost in the award modernisation process unless the AIRC is given discretion to include such matters where it is appropriate. We believe there should be more flexibility in the making of these modern awards and the government should trust the wisdom of the AIRC and their knowledge of awards in industries as well as input from stakeholders, ensuring there is an appropriate and relevant safety net. This is the issue around exceptional matters—whether the circumstances of an industry or sector warrant such matters being included in the award. There was a lot of debate and discussion around flexibility, and in fact I referred to it in my speech on the second reading. This is one area where we believe there needs to be a widening of the scope of the awards to allow for exceptional matters. There was a considerable body of evidence given during the inquiry around the need for exceptional matters to be included in the process of award modernisation.

              (b)    an individual who is a party to a contract for services, and who, for the purposes of the contract, performs work:

         (2)    A modern award may include either or both of the following:
              (a)    terms relating to the conditions under which an employer may employ employees who are outworkers (including terms relating to the pay or conditions of the outworkers);
              (b)    terms relating to the conditions under which an eligible entity (within the meaning of Division 4) may arrange for work to be carried out for the entity (either directly or indirectly) by outworkers (including terms relating to the pay or conditions of the outworkers).

9B  At the end of subclause 3(2) of Schedule 2
Add:
             ; (j)    subsection 576K(1), definition of outworker.
I will deal with some of the technical issues. I have been asked to indicate clearly on the Hansard the intention behind these amendments. Amendment (15) ensures the continuing operation of award terms about outworking conditions despite any less favourable terms of a workplace agreement. Given the government’s strong and longstanding support for the maintenance of outworker protections, this amendment would continue to ensure that the special terms and conditions of employment for outworkers in awards cannot be reduced in workplace agreements. The former government’s Work Choices laws provided that outworking conditions had effect despite any terms of a workplace agreement that provided a less favourable outcome. Accordingly this amendment was consequential upon the repeal of provisions about protected award conditions. Those provisions are no longer required because under the government’s proposal the full award is the safety net for agreement making.
Amendment (32) inserts a definition of ‘outworker’ to cover employee outworkers and contract outworkers in the clothing, textile and footwear industry so that the award modernisation process does not diminish existing protection for outworkers. The amendment is designed to make clear the government’s intention that modern awards can include provisions relating to both employee and contract outworkers in appropriate cases. This will enable protective clauses like those found in the clothing trades award to be included in modern awards.
Amendment (34) is a minor technical amendment consequential on amendment (32)—in other words, it changes a cross-reference. Similarly, amendment (35) is also a technical amendment consequential on amendment (32), which I have spoken to.
I want to place on the Hansard the government’s intentions in relation to these outworker amendments. The government understands that the clothing trades award contains important provisions in part 9 which are designed to provide specific protections for clothing trades outworkers, whether those outworkers are engaged as employees or contractors. In moving amendments (32) and (35), the government is ensuring that, in the modern, simple award system, these protections can be retained and remain enforceable. That is the government’s clear intention, and the government has been advised that the amendment has been drafted accordingly. The government will continue to monitor the question of protections for outworkers in the award modernisation process. Should it be necessary to further legislate to ensure the continuation in a modern, simple award system of the current part 9 protections of the clothing trades outworkers’ award, the government will do so in its substantive workplace relations bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

I have a specific question. I want to clarify something in amendment (15). In subclause (3) it is stated that an outworker means an employee. I have heard the minister say ‘employee’ and ‘contractor’, yet the word ‘contractor’ does not appear there. I want to ensure that this does pick up contractors.

We are concerned about the rigidity of the process and the lack of discretion given to the AIRC to include matters that may be relevant and important in maintaining a fair safety net. This, again, came up in the committee hearing. One of the organisations that raised this was the ACTU, but it was raised by numerous other parties who made submissions.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—The government does note the concerns raised before the Senate inquiry into the bill about the requirement for the commission to ensure that modern awards do not contain state based differences and to ensure that they are removed within five years. Our view is that the section would not prevent the commission including in awards terms and conditions that are appropriate and are based on objectively ascertainable regional circumstances, based on the evidence of the parties that such a term or condition is necessary to ensure a fair minimum safety net.
It is appropriate, however, that new modern awards operating in a national system should not replicate state based differences from old awards that exist merely as a matter of historical circumstance. I note that the government has allowed for the commission to include transitional arrangements in modern awards to deal where necessary with issues such as these.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

23  AFPC’s wage-setting parameters
         (1)    The objective of the AFPC in performing its wage-setting function is to ensure that a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment is established and maintained while promoting the economic prosperity of the people of Australia, having regard to the following:
              (a)    the need to provide fair minimum standards for employees in the context of living standards generally prevailing in the Australian community;
              (b)    the capacity of the unemployed and the low paid to obtain and remain in employment;
              (c)    economic factors, including levels of productivity and inflation, desirability of attaining a high level of employment, employment and competitiveness across the economy;
              (d)    relevant taxation and government transfer payments;
              (e)    the needs of the low paid.
         (2)    In performing its functions under this Part, the AFPC must have regard to the following:
              (a)    the need for any alterations to wage relativities between awards to be based on skill, responsibility and the conditions under which work is performed;
              (b)    the need to support training arrangements through appropriate trainee wage provisions;
              (c)    the need, using a case-by-case approach, to protect the competitive position of young people in the labour market, to promote youth employment, youth skills and community standards and to assist in reducing youth unemployment, through appropriate wage provisions, including where appropriate junior wage provisions, taking into account:
                    (i)    the extent of labour market disadvantage faced by young workers; and
                   (ii)    the work value of young workers at different ages; and
                  (iii)    the promotion of skills development and training of young workers to reduce their labour market disadvantages; and
                  (iv)    the desirability of minimising discrimination on the basis of age in wage rates only to the extent necessary to further these objectives; and
                   (v)    the structural efficiency principle; and
                  (vi)    that 18 years of age is considered an adult;

         (3)    For the purposes of paragraph (2)(f), trainee wage arrangements are not to be treated as constituting discrimination by reason of age if:
              (a)    they apply (whether directly or otherwise) the wage criteria set out in the award providing for the national training wage or wage criteria of that kind; or
              (b)    they contain different rates of pay for adult and non-adult employees participating in an apprenticeship, cadetship or other similar work-based training arrangement.

As one does in preparation for debates on substantive bills, you go back over the ground covered in previous substantive bills. I went back as far as Work Choices and, in looking at that, found it to be a bit depressing because, unlike this process where amendments are being dealt with as they should be—each on their merits—I recall that a lot of ours were rolled up under a guillotine. Some were not rolled up in the guillotine and they were very topical and covered issues of fairness. I did want to bring forward the amendments that were in many particular specific instances supported by the Labor Party in opposition, so hopefully they will now support them in government.
My amendments (1), (3) and (7) all cover issues of pay equity and inequity. Unless the chamber wishes, I do not intend to go through all of them in depth. Amendment (3) has a quite substantial change because, when we originally moved that amendment in 2005, we were very concerned that insufficient fairness imperatives were put upon the Australian Fair Pay Commission in its work, including in areas to do with young people, disadvantaged people and the promotion of skills development.
I doubt that senators’ memories would be exact enough but, having looked back at the debate, my memory is that the Labor Party supported this at the time. We can always go and look for the exact element. I am putting you on the spot deliberately—even if you do not want to deal with this right now because you are working on a transitional bill—in saying to the Labor Party in government that it is important that, as far as possible, fairness be wound into the directions and objectives of regulatory tribunal or commission bodies, such as the Australian Fair Pay Commission.
So essentially these are three fairness mechanisms. They have a history; they have been put before the chamber in past days. They are of course updated. For instance, amendment (7) refers to ITEAs, which certainly were not referred to in 2005. But, by and large, they are a regurgitation of previously held positions by the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-03-18,"—While the Greens do not object to these amendments and, obviously, issues dealing with pay—we had the earlier debate around awards and pay equity—the reason we chose to try to amend the bill in the way we did is that we thought it was an issue that should be dealt with through the awards system as a structural issue. We thought that, while looking at individual cases is extremely important, it does not actually deal with the structural undervaluing of women’s work and the work that women are more traditionally involved in, such as child care et cetera. So, while we will be supporting these amendments, that is why we preferred to use the award system. We wanted to see if the government supported the award system to be used as a mechanism in order to ensure pay equity, because it is more of a structural issue than just an issue where individuals bring complaints about pay equity and being disadvantaged.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I want to make some comments in relation to the amendments moved by the Democrats. The first is in relation to the pay equity monitoring powers. I suppose I should start with a general proposition, and Senator Murray did in fact allude to this. We do take the view that this is a transition bill. The focus for the government is on delivering the transitional bill as per our implementation policy. We are not minded to change the powers of the Australian Fair Pay Commission, because our policy, as you know, is to establish a new entity, which is Fair Work Australia. A number of the comments that have been made by senators in this place are obviously matters the government will consider. We will also engage in substantive consultation with stakeholders about the powers and the scope of Fair Work Australia prior to the introduction and passage of the substantive bill. So that really is the context in which we consider your amendments, Senator Murray.
In relation to amendment (1), we have a view of a limited role for the AFPC during the two-year transition period in relation to a minimum wage-setting function only. One of the reasons for this is that we do not want that function to overlap with the award modernisation function. As I have previously discussed, the award modernisation request includes the requirement for the commission to promote pay equity principles, and that process will be open and include consultation with stakeholders so these issues can be raised with the AIRC and can be taken into account in the modern award-making function.
In relation to amendment (3), which revises quite substantively the AFPC’s wage setting-parameters, I again reiterate the position that I put at the outset: our view is that we are moving to a different system, one which involves a different body, and we perceive a limited role for the AFPC during this two-year transition period. We have made clear in our policy that Fair Work Australia will conduct annual wage reviews which will take effect on 1 July each year and that the FWA will publish updated pay rates before this date to provide certainty for employers and employees. Minimum wage-setting criteria for Fair Work Australia would be determined as part of the government’s substantive workplace relations reforms.
Finally, amendment (7) amends the list of the Workplace Authority’s functions to include a range of matters in relation to pay equity. The government’s position is that it is protecting the safety net for both women and men through our new no disadvantage test for workplace agreements. In addition, as I discussed earlier, in setting modern awards the commission is required to have regard to promoting pay equity in modern awards. From 2010, Fair Work Australia will replace the Workplace Authority and the AIRC. The functions, powers and matters to take into account for the operation of Fair Work Australia will be determined as part of our substantive workplace relations reform package.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (2) and (4) on sheet 5457, revised, together:
(2)           Schedule 3, page 108 (after line 7), after item 1, insert:
1B  Paragraph 22(1)(a)
After “conduct”, insert “annual”.
(4)    Schedule 3, page 108 (after line 12), after item 2, insert:
2B  Paragraph 24(1)(a)
Before “the” insert, “subject to paragraph 22(1)(a),”.
Before I move to these amendments, I will make two remarks arising out of the brief, prior debate. One of the reasons we moved the fairly significant shift in amendment (3) was that the Fair Pay Commission is considering wage awards right now. Those will come into force—will be decided on—as I understand it, prior to the substantive bill, so we were trying to influence the considerations they must take into account. However, that is as it may.
The second point I want to make is with respect to the remarks of the shadow minister. I really think the issue of the future architecture, if you like, of our industrial relations system deserves far more debate and examination than it might have had to date. The Australian Democrats’ opinion is that it is very unwise to tie in a regulator and a commission as one body, which, as I understand it, is the Labor government’s policy. There are, of course, instances where that does occur. The ACCC, for instance, has a tribunal and a commission all under the same roof. But the Australian Democrats’ view is that you need something very clean and very simple to understand. We argue for a separate industrial relations commission which would absorb the functions of the state industrial relations commissions, the federal Employment Advocate and the Fair Pay Commission—either totally or you could create divisions within that.
With respect to the workplace regulator, we would see a single, national, strong, independent workplace regulator that would absorb the regulatory functions of the state departmental inspectorates and absorb the regulatory functions of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and other federal regulators. Again, we have no objection to those being in divisions. If it is decided that you have a specific division which is the Australian building and construction division, so it should be. But personally I think there are real dangers in the present path that the Labor government has set out on, with just one authority. I think you should consider splitting the tribunal, with its quasi-judicial function, from the regulator.
I raise these issues because I am not as convinced as many that the substantive bill that you are proposing to put up will have an easy passage. Although the coalition will not have a majority in the Senate, I am not so convinced that the Greens or Senator Fielding or Senator Xenophon will not have an independent view on these matters. These are matters of principle—for instance, whether you stick a regulator in with a tribunal or not. So I thank the shadow minister for his interjection, because I wanted to make what I think are important policy points.
I return, after that brief digression, to items (2) and (4) on sheet 5457 revised. Item (2) in fact confirms the policy that the minister has expressed—namely, that Labor will move to an annual wage-setting system. I think that is for the good. This simply says that is to happen now. Item (4) is a consequential amendment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-18,"—I move on to item (5) on sheet 5457 revised. That is a very simple amendment. I dislike the idea that minimum wages and those sorts of considerations should be done only with an eye towards the economy. I think when you are talking about safety nets and minimums, you have to pay attention to society and what is necessary in society. So I have simply repeated an amendment we put up in 2005, which asks that they take into account society as well as the economy. I move item (5) on sheet 5457:

7A  After Subdivision A of Division 2 of Part 7
Insert:

Subdivision AA—Indexation of minimum wage


181A
 
 Indexation of minimum wage

         (1)    This Subdivision provides for the indexation of the minimum wage, in line with the Consumer Price Index, to start on commencement of this section.
         (2)    The indexation factor is to be worked out in accordance with section 1193 of the Social Security Act 1991.
         (3)    The rounding of indexed amounts is to be worked out in accordance with section 1194 of the Social Security Act 1991.
 The chamber will note that this refers to the indexation of the minimum wage. It is the Australian Democrats’ view that an easy device for dealing with the minimum wage issue and keeping it current and up to date with the current value of money would be to index it. Like any economist, I recognise the dangers if inflation gallops away. You might get a bit concerned if you were indexing it in Zimbabwe, where right now I understand the indexation would be about 150,000 per cent, but I do not expect any such danger here. I rather like Treasurer Swan’s declaration that, in minimum wage discussions, attention needs to be paid to the tax welfare area as well and to how well people are doing with respect to government policy and cuts there.
I know that argument has previously attracted the coalition—that is, you cannot examine wage claims in isolation of tax and welfare changes which advantage lower income people. My attention was drawn to this many years ago, and I have remarked on it in this chamber before. It was first presented to me on this basis: if you give a minimum wage increase of say $17, in the hand of the recipient it might be as low as $8 and in the hand of the employer, because of on-costs, you might be talking about $23 or $24. That is not productive or efficient for either party—either the employee, who gets $8 out of $17, or the employer, who ends up with a cost of $23. It is important to pay attention to what is being offered in the tax and welfare area with respect to wage claims. Nevertheless, having said that, you do need to keep your minimum wage standard up to date and indexation would achieve that. I am well aware that the minister is going to knock this off. I certainly will not push it with a division or anything, but I really want to take the opportunity of this bill to put before you policy ideas which I would like you to consider when you come to the substantive bill. That is the purpose behind this.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FORWARD WITH FAIRNESS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I want to respond to Senator Murray. There is a substantive policy issue which is behind this amendment in relation to how you go about dealing with changes to the minimum wage. It is the government’s position that it is better for the minimum wage to be set in an open and transparent process. That is what is envisaged in the Forward with Fairness policy. Under that policy the AFPC will be replaced by Fair Work Australia, and Fair Work Australia will conduct any wage reviews which will take effect on 1 July each year. Fair Work Australia will also publish updated pay rates before this date to provide certainty for employers and employees. As I have previously indicated, the issue of minimum wage setting criteria will be determined as part of the government’s substantive workplace relations reform.

This relates to the issue of prohibited content. As I understand it, it is the government’s policy to remove restrictions on the content of agreements. Employers and employees should be free to negotiate the content of their agreements. Furthermore, the prohibited content rules are complicated and carry over into restrictions on industrial actions. Employees and employers also run the risk of breaching civil penalty provisions. We believe this is a straightforward amendment to delete prohibited content rules and, as it is government policy, we do not see why it does not do it now rather than wait until the substantive bill, because I can hear that coming down the track. We believe this would help protect workers from this point forward, rather than waiting another two years. This issue was specifically raised during the committee hearings.
We believe that it is more appropriate, as we move forward into the new industrial relations system—particularly with regard to those areas of the bill that remain that can impinge on the setting of the new system and the process of putting in place the ITEA system for the next two years—that we deal with that now rather than in the future when, I understand, it is government policy that this will be removed. I would be interested to know why the government are not moving this particular element of the Work Choices regime now rather than in the future.

We have had a discussion about unfair dismissal—quite a substantive discussion—so I will not go back over old ground. I would like to point out, as I briefly indicated in the previous discussion, that these amendments also relate to operational reasons. We have seen a number of high-profile cases since Work Choices came in where operational reasons have been given broad meaning, which essentially through that process gave employers wide discretion to dismiss employees, even where there were, in fact, over 100 employees. Redundancy has always been an exemption under unfair dismissal legislation, but operational reasons, as we have seen, go much further than that. We also believe it is appropriate to get rid of the provisions that deal with operational reasons. We differ slightly on that issue. This amendment, we believe, goes beyond the previous amendments that we considered in the chamber not long ago.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-03-18,"—I rise to speak to the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. Infrastructure Australia is the creation by the Rudd Labor government of a statutory authority within the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government portfolio, with members drawn from industry and all levels of government. It will have functions that include auditing Australia’s national infrastructure and considering current and future infrastructure requirements. Allegedly, this new bureaucratic body is necessary to improve national infrastructure planning processes and to advise government and private stakeholders on infrastructure issues.
This body is created in the context of much noise and carry-on by Labor about inflationary pressures that have apparently been caused by demands on infrastructure as a consequence of the growing and healthy economy. Labor is complaining about the policy challenge of handling success—an economy that is booming and providing historically high levels of opportunity for young Australians to participate in the workforce. This economy is the result of competent economic management that occurred under the previous coalition government.
So be wary of Labor’s attempts to beat up their false claim that there was no national planning framework for infrastructure under the previous government. That is simply a falsehood. I need not remind the Labor Party that there is a thing called AusLink—that is right. AusLink was established by the former coalition government in 2004 and represents the most significant change since Federation in the way the Commonwealth tackles the national transport task. It is a comprehensive planning arrangement that covers road and rail and involves both the Commonwealth and the states. Under AusLink, both jurisdictions are now able to develop long-term strategies for major transport corridors, rating some of the projects according to merit and giving ample lead time to the private sector. There is also the Council of Australian Governments. In June 2005 COAG agreed that each state and territory should prepare an infrastructure report every five years. The first group of those reports, I understand, is in fact complete and on the minister’s desk. So there is a federal-state infrastructure planning arrangement called AusLink, and a federal-state overview mechanism of Australia’s infrastructure requirements has been completed under COAG. The planning process exists, and Infrastructure Australia runs the risk of being just another bureaucratic creation completing a task already being done.
The situation has again been misconstrued by Labor—I am very careful with my choice of words there. In relation to the assertion that the previous government did not take infrastructure seriously, we know that is not correct. Under the first AusLink program—that is, between 2004-05 and 2008-09—the coalition government provided $15.8 billion in funding for land transport infrastructure. Under AusLink 2 the Australian government will invest $22.3 billion in Australia’s land transport system—the largest investment in land transport infrastructure in the history of the Commonwealth. So I think we should dismiss the misleading assertions of Labor. The first of these assertions is that under the previous government no national infrastructure planning framework existed; of course, that is wrong. The second is that the former coalition government did not take infrastructure challenges seriously; that is obviously false. The record funds provided by the former coalition government under AusLink demonstrate this to be the case.
I do note the irony when Labor makes such claims. For example, Labor decided to scrap the F3 to Braxton link road. I can recall comments made in parliament by the federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government that the critically important road to remove bottlenecks around Newcastle and the Hunter Valley simply did not add up. Look at the hypocrisy of the federal transport minister standing up in parliament and actually saying that an absolutely critically important bottleneck simply does not add up. Of course, we all find the statement somewhat astonishing given that the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon—now the Minister for Defence—had in fact promised before the election that a Rudd Labor government would absolutely match the coalition’s commitment of $780 million to complete the road. So we do have a bit of a mishmash of assertions, and I am quite sure the Australian people have the same challenges I do in actually working out where Labor stands on this. This broken promise is a devastating blow to the people of Hunter and, as I say, makes a mockery of Labor’s claims that it is determined to fix infrastructure bottlenecks as part of its anti-inflationary strategy.
The Rudd Labor government has also delayed funding of $65 million needed for critical rail maintenance in regional Australia. Recall the misleading statement made by the federal transport minister that pushing the funding back to 2009-10 related only to the inland rail proposal. Of course, that is, again, misleading. Treasury papers reveal that the $65 million was to be used by the Australian Rail Track Corporation for maintenance and upgrading of a number of existing rail lines which could contribute to a future inland rail corridor. So it is hardly accurate to say, ‘We’re just putting that off because it was to do with the inland corridor,’ when it was actually involved with the fundamentals of essential maintenance for our infrastructure. Rudd Labor has slashed funding for the rail lines, which were already operating and allowing farm and mine products to move up and down the eastern states.
Also there has been a failure by federal Labor to prod their Queensland counterparts to complete the flood related improvements on the Bruce Highway in Far North Queensland. This is in spite of the fact that the Queensland government have had $368 million of Australian taxpayers’ money sitting in their bank account since 2005-06 for upgrades and flood immunity work on stretches of the highway between Cairns and Townsville. These works are not complete. I note that as you drive down there they say, ‘There’s a planning process in place and we’ve got to make sure that we don’t rush this.’ The money has been in the bank for the floods but we have had another set of floods since then. So I suppose there has been a bit of an efficiency dividend, but try telling that to the people of Queensland who put their lives on the line on those roads every day. If Labor is truly determined to remove infrastructure bottlenecks as part of their strategy of fighting inflation then I do not think they should be making these types of decisions—and the decision to not fix that infrastructure was a clear decision. I think it is always important to look at Labor’s deeds and not their words.
In terms of Infrastructure Australia, I have a number of questions. Labor is on the record as saying—and I refer to the member for Batman’s comments on 18 July last year at the Australian Rail Summit in Sydney—that federal Labor is absolutely committed to the retention of all AusLink programs. So Labor is committed to supporting the $15.8 billion in land transport infrastructure over the five years to 2008-09 under AusLink 1! I assume that means that they are also absolutely committed to the $22.3 billion worth of investment in Australia’s land transport system from 2009 to 2013-14 under AusLink 2. That is a fair sort of a commitment, and we will have to watch that space.
Given that so many funds are already committed to a broad range of infrastructure projects, what decisions of substance will Infrastructure Australia actually make? Will Labor provide more funds—in addition to the considerable funds that have already been committed to AusLink—for Infrastructure Australia to consider?
Also, the Council of Australian Governments agreed on 3 June 2005, as I have mentioned earlier, that each state and territory should prepare an infrastructure report every five years. The first reports were to be submitted to COAG on 31 January 2007. We know that these reports exist. Presumably they are on the member for Grayndler’s desk. These reports provide a broad outlook for each state and territory across a range of infrastructure sectors—from rail, roads, airports and seaports to energy and water. So the long-term cross-jurisdictional planning framework does exist. It was introduced by the last government and is a fundamental aspect of infrastructure planning in this country. Perhaps the reports from the Labor states were inadequate. We certainly had experience, when we were in government, of that circumstance.
Given the long-term planning that has already occurred under the COAG framework, the first task of Infrastructure Australia, announced with much fanfare by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, was that there would be a national infrastructure audit. That is apparently a little less attractive than it seems. Let us just hope that this 12-month review is not an excuse by federal Labor and their state Labor counterparts to duck the hard decisions—a convenient excuse to delay the hard infrastructure decisions. These are tough decisions and those on this side of the chamber have a fine record of making grand infrastructure decisions—the largest infrastructure decisions made in history—on the back of a finely planned and finely tuned infrastructure framework.
I think it is important, when we are considering the function of Infrastructure Australia, to evaluate proposals for investment in a nationally significant infrastructure. We need to make sure this does not become another bureaucratic hurdle for the private sector to overcome when they are dealing with an already complex infrastructure approval process.
I also note that Infrastructure Australia is to develop infrastructure priority lists. Presumably, Infrastructure Australia will develop the criteria with which to rank projects. That is a fairly laudable process but it raises the question of what criteria Infrastructure Australia will employ. Will a cost-benefit analysis be used? Will Infrastructure Australia consider rates of returns? Are not these functions best provided for in the private sector, which is responsible for proposing these sorts of projects in the first place? That is where those of us on this side of the chamber believe that those responsibilities should naturally lie—in the private sector.
The relationship between Infrastructure Australia, regulatory bodies—such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission—and state bodies is still unclear. Nor in fact is there a clear relationship between Infrastructure Australia and other Commonwealth agencies such as Treasury, which play a role in developing policy that affects infrastructure. It seems that there is a large potential for duplication and overlap.
I note that the bill, as it is currently drafted, stipulates that Infrastructure Australia may only evaluate infrastructure proposals on the advice of the minister. It is unable to independently consider, for example, ALP infrastructure election promises. Well, there is a set of blinkers for you! I think that it is a fairly restrictive component of this draft legislation that it significantly constrains the capacity of Infrastructure Australia to engage in infrastructure reviews of its own volition. I think it is a pretty serious lamming of any particular organisation if it does not have a free capacity to examine infrastructure and report to the Australian people in the Australian parliament about matters and priorities associated with infrastructure.
I note that the bill, as it is currently drafted, leaves aside a number of those technical issues. I will come to some amendments on that when we deal with the bill in committee. Whilst welcoming independent analysis of the rigour and appropriateness of Labor’s election promises, we are very disappointed that Infrastructure Australia will not be able to do this. I have to say that this really begs the question of how fair dinkum Labor is about this. They say: ‘Let’s have a body that looks at all the infrastructure needs across Australia and does all those things including setting priorities and ranking priorities. But, sorry, the fine print says that you are not allowed to look at anything on your own volition, particularly the infrastructure promises made by Labor before the election!’ I am not sure why that would be the case but those more cynical than I am would perhaps have suspicions that Labor is actually trying to avoid scrutiny.
I also understand—and I touched on it earlier—that the minister can also give direction to Infrastructure Australia without any reference to parliament and appoint an infrastructure coordinator without taking advice from Infrastructure Australia. In the interests of transparency—and how often we use that word—directions by the minister to Infrastructure Australia should be tabled in each house rather than just being buried, as currently proposed, in the annual report of Infrastructure Australia that we can check out at the end of the year.
I also think that the minister, when making such a significant appointment as the infrastructure coordinator, just on the basis of manners should at least be compelled, at the very least, to consult with the chair and members of Infrastructure Australia. This spares Labor the temptation of using Infrastructure Australia as a vehicle for handing out jobs to its mates. I am not a cynical individual, but we have seen this recently occur with the appointment of Steve Bracks to head a review of the Australian car industry. Accordingly, the coalition will be moving a couple of technical amendments that will rectify these clear weaknesses about temptation in the bill. I would hate to see Labor tempted to provide jobs for the boys.
In conclusion, while the opposition will not be opposing the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, we do wish however to place on the record a firm rebuttal of the rewriting of history currently engaged in by Labor regarding the former government’s commitment to meeting Australia’s infrastructure needs. I would have to point out that robust long-term planning frameworks are in place and we question, therefore, whether Infrastructure Australia may become just another bureaucratic creation that makes the rollout of national infrastructure harder, not easier.
We question whether it will really have much to do, given that funds and projects are already committed under AusLink—record infrastructure, record planning and record funding in the history of the Commonwealth. We would have reservations about its limited capacity to undertake infrastructure reviews of its own volition given the fact that you cannot have a unique thought; you have to wait until the minister provides some direction in these matters. We would also say that the ministerial directions to Infrastructure Australia should be subject to the scrutiny of both sides of parliament instead of waiting for the annual report to come out.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-03-18,"—I am very pleased to rise today as a member of the great nation-building Labor government to speak in support of the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. The bill will establish Infrastructure Australia as the key advisory body for investment and planning in infrastructure. The bill will establish the body that will revolutionise the way infrastructure is addressed in this country. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with the development of a strategic blueprint for our nation’s infrastructure needs. It will establish a mechanism for ongoing and cooperative infrastructure dialogue between the Commonwealth, states and industry. Infrastructure Australia will identify and coordinate key infrastructure projects which are of high national importance.
The Rudd Labor government has recognised that a national strategic plan for infrastructure is well and truly needed in this country. Notably, for the first time since Federation, Australia now has an infrastructure minister. There will be a coordinated approach to infrastructure investment, and there will be cooperation between every Australian government as well as the private sector. For the first time in over a decade, the Australian people can expect a national plan for tackling infrastructure bottlenecks. Infrastructure Australia will create the networks to enhance future economic performance and raise national productivity.
The establishment of Infrastructure Australia is more evidence of the Rudd Labor government fulfilling its election commitments. At last there is a Prime Minister and a political party in Canberra that cares about the nation’s essential infrastructure and is committed to a constructive relationship between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. Industry groups have been forced to accept the excuses of the former government in its negligence in addressing Australia’s infrastructure needs. Failure to address the infrastructure challenges facing our nation will threaten our economic strength and prosperity. It will endanger our industries and affect our quality of life.
Infrastructure Australia is about putting the prosperity of the whole nation on the agenda and not just sectional interests. In this regard it is relevant that my home state of Western Australia accounts for 36 per cent of Australia’s export earnings, which in large part are generated by the state’s mining and agricultural sectors. The Western Australian Premier, Mr Alan Carpenter, has noted that the last federal budget only allocated $317 per person nationally for infrastructure spending. In comparison, the WA state government allocated $2,154 per person for infrastructure spending in their last budget.
Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, you can see the problem. The Howard government set the scene for a massive crunch in WA’s capacity to continue to be the engine room of Australia’s economic growth. Without the funds to provide essential public infrastructure and services to underpin private investment, growth of the production capacity of the state’s mining sector, and therefore of economic development, will inevitably be slower. Furthermore, we have the ludicrous situation where WA is projected to receive only 10.3 per cent of AusLink National Network funding despite its 22 per cent share of roads in the network.
Let me move on to raise the issue of WA’s Kimberley region as further illustration of essential need for a body such as Infrastructure Australia. This sparsely populated and underdeveloped region of WA is poised on the brink of massive economic development in respect of energy, minerals and agricultural production. The region has an export earnings potential that could rival the Pilbara. However, to make things happen it will require large private and public investment in necessary infrastructure on a scale that will only be achieved by the Commonwealth and state governments working together alongside the private sector.
We are already experiencing difficulties in keeping up with the need to expand and improve port, road, education, hospital and housing infrastructure in the region. As I mentioned earlier, for the last decade, the federal government has made a very marginal contribution to infrastructure in Western Australia, despite receiving record revenue from the resources boom in WA. Even Mr Barry Haase, the member for Kalgoorlie, admitted there was nothing for Kalgoorlie in the final federal Howard budget.
I would also like to make comment at this time on some of the disappointing and ill-informed remarks by the member for Kalgoorlie when he spoke on this bill. In his speech in the other place on 12 March 2008, he said:
I put to you that they—
being Labor—
are simply going to re-badge AusLink 1 and 2 ...
He then went on to say that Labor ‘has been left a very solid heritage’ and that we should give credit where ‘credit is due’. I do not believe the government or the people of Australia will have any problems in giving credit where credit is due for the current state of infrastructure in Australia. The member for Kalgoorlie should also be aware that Infrastructure Australia is not a re-badging of AusLink. Infrastructure Australia is in fact part of a comprehensive strategy by this government to move on from the disastrous Howard years in infrastructure.
Considering that a majority of Western Australia’s mining boom occurs within his own electorate, Mr Haase may want to consider that, whilst he was in government, unfortunately he wasted time and opportunity by not obtaining infrastructure projects for his electorate. The member for Kalgoorlie also stated:
Is this new government seriously condemning the state Labor government transport ministers?
Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: no, Mr Haase, we are clearly condemning the former federal government, who did not show leadership and did not plan for the future. Perhaps if the member for Kalgoorlie had been a National instead of a Liberal, he could have at least gotten infrastructure funding for the odd cheese factory in his electorate as part of the ‘regional rorts’ program. Mr Haase concludes with an interesting statement:
I wonder how the facade has been maintained for even this long.
The Howard facade on infrastructure investment and planning in this country did not last. With little or no infrastructure funding in WA to maintain the mining boom, Mr Howard was killing the nation’s golden goose and hurting those communities. The Rudd Labor government will address the void left by the Howard government in national infrastructure. By coordinating our approach to infrastructure investment, we will make sure that funding flows to the right projects and towards the right outcomes for this nation.
—A dead tree!
—I am sure you are awake over there, but it did take you about five minutes to wake up, Senator Nash. Welcome back! I say that through you, Madam Acting Deputy President. As a former truck driver, let me tell you something about what happens when infrastructure bottlenecks prevent investment—
—With the TWU.
—Yes, proudly—especially in road networks and transport, Senator Ronaldson. It is an area of which I have had intimate knowledge over the past decade, unlike other senators in this chamber. I know what happens when there are not adequate road networks to carry freight. Without quality road infrastructure and road transport networks, trucks cannot deliver the nation’s essential goods. Without roads, how are you going to transport across state lines to mine sites and across the nation?

Senator Scullion interjecting—

—Maybe, Senator Scullion, by osmosis! Maybe we can ‘will’ the freight across the Nullarbor—maybe that might work! How did the Howard government think goods would be transported? How will we service the towns and mining sites that need these resources to harvest other precious resources? It must be by trucks and it must be by road. You will not see an ocean liner sailing up the Great Northern Highway, I am sure of that. Senator Nash, for your benefit: I certainly cannot see carrier pigeons carting the freight across New South Wales. The transport must be done on bitumen.
At last we have a federal government that is able to conduct meaningful dialogue with all levels of government and has the support and involvement of all sectors of the economy, public and private. Let us seize this opportunity and rectify the problems of the past 10 years. This bill will establish Infrastructure Australia as the body that will revolutionise the way infrastructure is addressed in this country. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-03-18,"—I rise tonight to comment on the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. I think it is a good idea that a nation should begin to predict and anticipate its infrastructure needs and demands and set out a strategic blueprint. Why I am disappointed, though, is that this whole bill is couched as if climate change and oil depletion are not real. I do acknowledge that in the second reading speech on the bill there is one mention of climate change and that in the legislation itself as proposed there is reference to climate change, but it is not one of the primary functions of Infrastructure Australia. What concerns me is that we have legislation here which is effectively a megaphone for the roads lobby. That is really the only way that you can look at what we are talking about this evening.
What we already know is that our cities are choked and that urban congestion is a huge problem. However, the solution is proposed in terms of more freeways, more flyovers, more city tunnels and so on. Where is the recognition that oil is already above $100 a barrel? Where is the recognition that, in fact, it has been $110 a barrel and it has come back marginally? The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics foolishly cling to the notion that oil is going to come back to $45 a barrel; I do not know of anybody else around the world who is of that view but they clearly are, and they are clearly advising government that it will not be a problem into the future. There is recognition in the government that it is an issue of the current account that Australia is increasingly lacking self-sufficiency in oil, yet there is no recognition in this legislation that, in planning the future, we should take it into account. In the strategic planning exercise, which is meant to look at the anticipation of infrastructure needs and demands, there is no anticipation that Australia will lose its self-sufficiency in oil.
There is a lot of talk about housing affordability; there is a lot of talk about equity; there is a lot of talk about energy poverty. But the reality is that the poorest people live the furthest out from the centre of the city, and they are most dependent on inefficient vehicles and have the least access to public transport. When fuel prices rise, those people do not have the discretionary income to be able to meet the fuel price rises, so they seek reductions in price. Whilst you might be able to do that with all manner of subsidies in the short term, the reality is that in the long term it is not effective.
What we have to be doing is looking at urban planning in the future which sees itself as central to a low-carbon economy—and that means a major investment in public transport and a major investment in mass transit not a major investment in more infrastructure in terms of freeways and more and more highways. It is very clear that we need to be upgrading the nation’s rail system—that we do need to get greater efficiency in those nodal points where rail meets road. Everybody understands that, and that is why I welcome the notion that we are moving to a strategic planning exercise. But I am concerned about the way this is being developed and the way this is being advocated for public consumption—it is those major private sector infrastructure organisations which are actually driving this; and the way it is going to be set up is to facilitate those people.
Already we have heard talk about the war on inflation, the need to invest in infrastructure and the infrastructure gap. But, if you have a look at who is out there telling us that there is this infrastructure gap, you see that it is Infrastructure Partnerships Australia. This is a consortium of major construction firms and banks led by former Kennett government minister Mark Birrell and endorsed by state premiers John Brumby and Morris Iemma. It has claimed that there is a $90 billion infrastructure gap and has published a state-by-state list of projects that it considers should be constructed. If they were to be constructed, the people who would construct them would be the very people putting forward the notion. What a surprise!
My concern here is that we have a recycling exercise going on where former state government ministers and premiers leave office, find their way to Macquarie Bank and other major infrastructure providers—particularly those keen on public-private partnerships—reintroduce the wish list they had as state transport ministers and state premiers through this mechanism and then get it recycled through AusLink. You only have to look at what happened at the last federal election: both the coalition and the Labor Party went around state by state promising road projects, overwhelmingly road projects, which were cherry-picked from the lists brought forward by state governments through the AusLink program. Nobody went back and actually had a look at those projects and said: ‘Was there a socioeconomic analysis of the need for the project? Was there a look at an alternative? Did anybody say there was an alternative to the latest flyway bypass? Was it possible that we could have a mass transit lane instead of yet another road project?’ The alternatives were not considered. The way that these projects were selected and prioritised was not considered. Even the economic viability of the projects was not looked at. Essentially both the coalition and the Labor Party got the AusLink priority lists for each state, cherry-picked what they thought they wanted to promise from those lists and then promised that in the federal election context.
My concern with this body is that what we are seeing now is a formalisation of that process without the required level of public scrutiny and without the context of climate change and oil depletion. I make the point on climate change because when you look at the list of functions you see that the primary functions are listed and then the additional functions are listed—and listed in the additional functions is taking account of climate change. That should be the absolute primary function if you are serious about a whole-of-government approach to reducing emissions; if you are serious about moving on from oil dependency and looking at the ways of moving people around that provide for a healthy environment and that actually provide for human health in terms of addressing the obesity crisis that we have. You need to actually encourage people to walk, encourage people to cycle and encourage people to take public transport. That gives you a healthier population and better air quality, and you get people moving around cities faster. It is much more cost efficient than putting more and more people in cars on more and more freeways. You build a new bridge or freeway and then there is a bottleneck, so you build a tunnel—then you build another interconnecting tunnel and on and on it goes.
Let us look at some examples from around the world. Mayor Ken Livingstone in London recognised that congestion was a major issue, so he introduced the congestion tax. He hypothecated the money to the provision of public transport. Now London is exemplary. You can stand in Piccadilly Circus in the centre of the city and you have hardly any private vehicles—you have the London taxis, the red buses and the occasional luxury vehicle. The improvement in air quality is terrific. The actual amenity in moving around London is better than it has ever been. Now he has introduced a further levy in terms of the congestion tax in order to discourage large vehicles that are fuel inefficient. That is the kind of move that you are seeing overseas when they look at strategic planning for the future. It is the same in the European Union. They now have very strict directives on vehicle fuel efficiency and on public transport. You are now seeing companies setting standards for their workforce to reduce dependence on the private vehicle. Yet here we still have no movement to get rid of the fringe tax benefit for private motor vehicle use. There is no indication from the government that they are about to move on that—which of itself would be an excellent reform because it would actually stop encouraging people to engage in greater car use and encourage them to look at something different.
In the past you had public scrutiny of large infrastructure projects. You had the development of policy proposals and alternatives. You had the cost-benefit analysis. You had planning acts to assess the net community benefit of any infrastructure project. You had the assessment of environmental effects. You had parliamentary committee scrutiny, you had a public consultation process, you had a Treasury assessment and then you went through the cabinet approval process. Now what we have is project lists generated by private firms and consortia. It is a closed government-consortium collaboration, and we have seen what has happened with that in New South Wales in particular and also in Victoria. The traditional merit assessment is nearly invisible, if it occurs at all. Most public environmental assessment is in retreat.
This climate of dwindling public scrutiny has allowed state road construction agencies to produce extensive lists of urban and rural freeway proposals which are given standing, as I said, in their inclusion in the AusLink funding programs, and we are now into the next projected period. The construction of urban freeways has been recognised as one of the major factors behind the rapid growth of car use in Australian cities since the 1970s, and yet we are set to do it all over again. We know that emissions from transport are the second-largest source of greenhouse pollution after energy generation. The Australian Greenhouse Office predicts that transport emissions will grow by 60 per cent on 1990 levels by 2020.
As the imperatives for action on climate change intensify, it is vital that there be stringent and transparent processes for the evaluation and public scrutiny of infrastructure projects that may be given Commonwealth support. It is essential that the membership of the Infrastructure Australia Advisory Council include expertise in assessing the impacts of major transport infrastructure projects in relation to the likely impact, positive or negative, on greenhouse gas emissions, on maintaining economic and social resilience in the face of rapidly increasing oil prices and peak oil, and containment of the physical footprint of transport infrastructure in the urban environment. There is nothing in setting up this particular body, Infrastructure Australia, that suggests to me that any of that public scrutiny, public interest alternatives and proper scrutiny of the economics is actually going to happen. There is a huge potential for conflict of interest, as is recognised in the bill. There are provisions that require disclosure. But once we have these public-private consortia getting together where they have a clear interest in building more infrastructure regardless of whether it is the best infrastructure opportunity in a carbon constrained world then we have got problems.
I will be moving a series of amendments when we move into the committee stage and I foreshadow those now. One will be to make consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption implications of any development a primary function—not just an additional function but a primary function. There should be ministerial direction for this to be by legislative instrument and also there should be reference of the advice of Infrastructure Australia to the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, so we actually get back to parliamentary scrutiny of what is being proposed in the public interest using public funds. Surely the people need the opportunity to actually test this, to make sure that the vested interests have not become so close to government that the best interests of the community are not taken into account. That is something that I think is absolutely critical to how we move forward on that. I will certainly be moving that amendment in the committee stage.
When I talk about parliamentary scrutiny and independent environmental and social impact assessment of the projects, we have to have an opportunity for alternative approaches, different groups and different financial or ownership structures than those that might be proposed by Infrastructure Australia. The community have to be given the chance to have their say and have the integrity of the appraisal process open for consideration. We have to have more than a rubber stamp, and what is being proposed is a rubber stamp. What we are going to see is no capacity for the parliament to actually refuse any of these projects. So you are going to have this nice little set-up between those with a vested interest in promoting and building new roads around Australia predominantly working with a few people in government and the minister rubber-stamping it without parliamentary scrutiny. I think that an effective parliamentary committee review of each major infrastructure project valued above $50 million should be mandatory. That is what I will be moving as an amendment. I think there should be reciprocal arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states so that if a project undergoes parliamentary scrutiny at one level of government there can be a joint assessment process so that it does not have to go through a double assessment. Nevertheless, where we are using public funds for major projects there needs to be parliamentary scrutiny.
The same goes for environmental and social impacts. I have said already that we have got the government talking about freeing up land around Melbourne to build cheap housing, without a commitment to make sure that that housing is energy efficient and without a commitment that that housing will be serviced by public transport. So all you are doing when you promote that kind of infrastructure development is condemning people who live in those properties to energy poverty into the future, because they are the people who will be least able to afford the increased energy bills that will come from the carbon price and they are the people who are least able to keep running their inefficient vehicles and will have no choices in terms of public transport. So I see a major flaw in this legislation. Yes, it is a good idea to have a strategic plan for Australia’s infrastructure; but it is not a good idea that the need for infrastructure or the infrastructure gap is allowed to be identified by the very people who have a vested interest in filling that gap and then that those people are actually on the board here with a view to promoting road projects. That is essentially what will occur.
There is talk in the second reading speech about water infrastructure and talk about energy infrastructure. For that you can read improvements to the shipping capacity and the port capacity to move more coal out of the Hunter Valley. Where does that take us in terms of strategic planning for Australia’s future? I would argue that if you see this country as an information and knowledge based economy, you would be using your Infrastructure Australia to start building and investing in the infrastructure that would deliver a knowledge based economy. I see the current proposal as saying we need more infrastructure to maintain our position as a resource based economy, to see if we can dig things up faster, cut things down faster and move them faster by road to the ports and get them on the ships to China to generate more emissions as quickly as possible whilst saying we are taking climate change into account.
I cannot see how Infrastructure Australia is taking climate change into account when there is no requirement to look at the greenhouse gas emissions of every infrastructure project that is being recommended, no requirement to look at alternatives and no requirement to look at oil usage and long-term capacity for Australia to meet its transport needs. What we are clearly lining up for here is more road infrastructure to be supported by coal to liquids.
We have had the minister, Martin Ferguson, saying recently that we need a major investment in coal to liquids. South Africa ran its transport fleet on liquefied coal. The Nazis did it in Germany during the war. The technology is well and truly known. But the greenhouse gas ramifications are also known, and the low emissions centre has said very clearly that the emissions from the tailpipe from coal to liquids are the same as conventional oil even if you succeed with 100 per cent carbon capture and storage.
My view is that it is a good idea to have strategic planning on infrastructure, but I am concerned that this does not go to the heart of it, which is a real strategic plan in the public interest. This looks like a strategic plan for those with vested interests who want to build more road infrastructure across Australia to the detriment of the national interest in the context of the transition to a low carbon economy. That is the context in which I will be moving amendments in the committee stages.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-18,"—The introduction by the government of the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 marked a significant shift in the role of the Commonwealth government in the planning and coordination of infrastructure investment and planning in Australia. I have listened carefully to the various contributions made during the debate on the second reading, and I want to thank all those who have contributed, though I am sure Senator Ronaldson was not one of them.
I understand that the opposition will not be opposing the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. The coalition’s lack of understanding of the infrastructure challenges faced by Australia today is clear. Most of this debate has been spent blaming the states for the nation’s infrastructure problems or trying to mount an argument that says infrastructure is limited to AusLink alone. We know that for 11½ years priority was never given to infrastructure by the Howard-Costello government. There was no federal infrastructure minister and no leadership. It was easier to blame the states than to get on with the job. Only during the election campaign did those opposite discover infrastructure.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—To be fair, I know that you, Senator Nash, did discover infrastructure. That now famous Page report recommended fibre to the home, in some cases, and fibre to the node. I know that you understood how important infrastructure was, but your colleagues, as you know—because they spurned you; they turned their backs on you—did not get it. You did, but they did not. I have always given you credit for that, Senator Nash.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Conroy, your remarks can be put through the chair.
—I accept your admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President. In May 2007 the former government established AusLink II, with a budget of $17 billion. Yet, in the election campaign, they promised projects worth at least $20 billion. That is right: they set up a program for $17 billion and then they spent $20 billion. It does not add up to me either, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know you are looking puzzled because that maths just does not add up. Maybe there was an extra contribution for Tasmania tossed in there for good measure that you know about but we do not.
It is easy to spend when you are using someone else’s money, and even easier when you have nothing to lose. The real question is: why, in 11½ years, had these projects not already been built? And why did the previous government categorically exclude water, energy and communication infrastructure from the national agenda? How can one claim to be a good economic manager and then ignore nationally significant infrastructure that pays back in spades when strategic investments are made?
Infrastructure is a significant component of the Australian economy. In 2006-07, the ABS engineering construction survey indicated the value of engineering construction work performed in the major infrastructure sectors was approximately $33.6 billion, or 3.5 per cent of GDP. This is not an area that governments can ignore. We know that under the coalition the definition of infrastructure simply did not stretch as far as water, energy and—Senator Nash—communications. AusLink II excluded communications. How could you let that happen?
If a project did not fit within an electoral boundary, it had no place at the coalition policy table. If there was no immediate gain within a three-year electoral cycle, it had no place on the coalition policy table. If a project was planned in an urban area, it had no place on the coalition policy table. If it was an idea of the member for Higgins, it definitely had no place on the coalition policy table. And—to defend Senator Nash for that famous Page report—if it was from the National Party, from Senator Nash, on communications, it had no place on the coalition policy table.
The infrastructure debate has evolved over the last 15 years, and experts from both the private and public sectors have demanded the kinds of institutional arrangements that Infrastructure Australia will provide. So many people were singing the same tune, but the coalition had stopped listening. After 11½ years—11½ years—the coalition did not know the state of the nation’s economic infrastructure assets. If a government does not know what assets exist and where the priorities lie, how can it plan future investments or establish sound policy framework?
On 24 November 2007, the Australian people ceased giving the coalition permission to do nothing. They said no to the blame game, no to the rorting, no to a disjointed approach to infrastructure and no to a future that seemed to include only their Liberal and National Party mates. The message was loud and clear, so I am dismayed when I continue to hear resistance to important, fair and future-looking government reforms such as the creation of Infrastructure Australia and Skills Australia—immediate reforms to combat climate change and urgent action to restore fairness in the workplace.
The Rudd Labor government is firmly focused on the future. We have heard the 20 warnings from the RBA about unsustainable inflationary pressure being placed on the economy and we have felt the back-to-back interest rate rises. We know that infrastructure shortfalls are costing us 0.8 per cent of GDP and that our infrastructure backlog is conservatively estimated to be worth $25 billion. We know that working families are experiencing long-term water restrictions, slow internet speeds and are spending too much time stuck in traffic rather than being at home with their children. The opposition is correct—it is pertinent—infrastructure investment today will take more than three years to result in new transport, water and energy solutions. But that is no reason never to commence. In fact, the government thinks Australians have waited far too long.
We have already commenced implementation of our nation-building election commitments. Just last week I announced a panel of experts to assess proposals to build a new national, high-speed fibre broadband network. We have known these projects to be priorities for years, but the nation simply lacked the political leadership needed to action them. They have become too urgent, so we are getting on with the job. But there is much more to do. Infrastructure Australia will prioritise infrastructure according to need and future forecasts and match those priorities to available investment dollars. Infrastructure Australia will look at the nation’s infrastructure networks in a coordinated way so that we can face future challenges with confidence. It will also look at how we can use our existing infrastructure more efficiently.
Boosting the productive capacity of the nation does not always require big spending and decades to get results. It requires leadership and a government prepared to search for solutions, not search for the next person to blame. To ignore infrastructure, as the coalition did for over 11½ years, is to ignore one of the best ways to boost the productive capacity of the nation. To underinvest in infrastructure is to give up the fight against inflation and say to the Australian people, ‘It is just too hard; fend for yourselves.’ The Labor government is focused on the future and on supporting working Australians. On infrastructure, skills and climate change, the Rudd Labor government is pursuing an agenda that will last well beyond the three-year cycle. Infrastructure Australia will drive investment where it is needed most.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-03-18,"—I rise to seek an apology from the Labor Party tonight, and I am sure it will be forthcoming, especially with Senator Conroy in the chamber! The Labor Party attacked our party over section 457 visas for many, many months indicating that we were bringing skilled labour into this country as cheap labour. ‘Cheap labour’ was the catchcry of the Labor Party. Today it has been reported in the media and in the media release of the shadow minister for immigration, Senator Chris Ellison, exactly what the situation has been. He said that the union bosses scare campaign has been exposed as a total fraud.
—Why didn’t you ask the man a question about it today?
—We did not ask any questions about this today because we knew that this would be a good matter to raise this evening in the adjournment debate. We have left the quality until the end of the day. That is why we are raising this now.
The facts have now come home to roost. The Labor Party now has to retract its comments—its attack on us—over that long period of time over section 457 visas. We brought people into this country for what purpose? To assist with the skills shortage in Australia. And what was the allegation? It was that they were being paid less than the average worker. And what has happened now? The 2006-07 figures now prove that the skilled immigrants who came to this country were being paid more. They were not removing jobs from Australians. They were filling jobs that Australia could not fill and we have paid them more money. We have said that for a long period of time.
That is why we are seeking an apology from the Labor Party. They need to say ‘sorry’ to us for their having misrepresented the truth. We sat through this day in and day out. The Labor Party even raised a matter of public importance on this in 2006.
—2006?
—Absolutely! I participated in that debate. You raised it in 2006; that is how far back the fraudulent misrepresentation of what we were doing goes.
Now, 18 months later, we can stand up and say that the average 457 visa holder was paid not $50,000, not $60,000, but $71,600. That was the average wage. And the Labor Party then alleged that this was only in select vocations. But let me quote some of the figures. In the mining sector, the average income was $95,200. We agree that it is a unique industry, but let me put that to one side and go through the average earnings of visa holders employed in some other industries. In the accommodation, cafes and restaurants sector—we were told it was a terrible area because we were bringing in cheap labour—the average 457 visa holder earned $45,000, which was $3,000 above the average wage for the sector. So that is another myth that we have exposed today that the Labor Party should apologise for.
Then, in the construction sector, and what a union stronghold is the construction sector, the average visa holders earned—have a guess how much, Senator Conroy—$19,551 more than the average in 2006-07. That is 37 per cent higher, and the cry from the Labor Party was, ‘We are bringing in cheap labour.’ What a load of rubbish by the Labor Party. We sat through that. We put up with it for 18 months and finally we have been vindicated in our position.
Then we go on to the finance and insurance sector, where section 457 visa holders earned $20,000 more than the average, with salaries of up to $90,400 compared with an industry average of $70,000. This goes on and on and on. In the health and community services skilled area, overseas workers are commanding almost $12,000 more. This is very embarrassing for the Labor Party, because this was their strong point on which they attacked us, and this has all come home to prove that they were wrong, they were fraudulent and they have misrepresented us for a long period of time. It is great for us to come back at you today and be able to correct the record with facts and figures which we always promoted throughout our time in government.
In the administration and defence area, wages were an average of $22,000 per annum higher—and you can just imagine that, in some of the areas, we were accused of being exploitative; most of them are traditional union areas. I think that this has proven that the policies of the Howard government during that time worked, despite criticism and strong opposition from the Labor Party. We helped alleviate the skills crisis in this country, and we got no thanks. There was not one single word of thanks from the Labor Party.
The Labor Party have consistently knocked, knocked and knocked us. What else are they going to misrepresent to the public? That is what I am really concerned about. In the areas of factual basis, they could have used the same facts and figures as us but, no, they chose to be selective and fraudulent with their representation to the Australian public. What else are they doing that does not reflect the truth in basic statistics, issues and areas which we promoted strongly as a coalition government and where we fixed problems in Australia? I just hope the Rudd Labor government does not go down that path again and mislead the public and put in jeopardy the livelihoods of families in this country and also the expanding of infrastructure, the industry that we need. I say to the Labor Party: look at the facts; look at what we did and never, ever misrepresent those facts again to the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Skilled Migration</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-18," asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, upon notice, on 12 February 2008:
Is the Minister aware that the Melbourne Anglican Synod recently moved the following ‘without dissent’ motion: ‘That this Synod regrets the Government’s adoption of procedures for certain people seeking political asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal Government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’.
Is the Minister aware that, as at 23 September 2007, material aid valued at $1 608 925 has been distributed to the benefit of: (a) asylum seekers on bridging visas ($840 456); (b) refugees from Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan ($743 100); and (c) tsunami victims in Sri Lanka ($25 369).
When will the Government change the refugee laws so that asylum seekers do not continue to be ‘beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life’; and (b) if there is no intention to change the laws, how does the Government consider the needs of such people will be met in the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,22,1,question
