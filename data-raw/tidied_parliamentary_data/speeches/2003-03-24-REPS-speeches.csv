"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2003-03-24,"—I have great pleasure in presenting the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Canada and China, 17 to 30 November 2002. This was a whirlwind delegation from one side of the world to the other. I was very proud to be a member of this delegation, along with the members for Melbourne, Cowan and Eden-Monaro. The delegation was ably led by Senator Alan Ferguson, with the accompaniment of Senator Lees. We are very grateful for the support we received from Michael McLean, the delegation secretary. We visited two countries of important interest to Australia but completely different in their cultural make-up and interests.
Firstly, in Canada the delegation were pleased to attend various committees at the seat of the federal government, the House of Commons in Ottawa. Discussions proceeded around important issues at that time. Some of them are still the same. There was a lot of discussion about the situation with Iraq, and there were interesting comments and discussion about the position of orderly marketing agencies here in Australia and also in Canada, genetically modified organisms, Indigenous issues and stem cell research. The delegation was visiting not long after the discussions and debate in this chamber and our parliament.
One of the things that I was left with an incredible impression of—and I am grateful for the opportunity to have visited it—was the seat of the national assembly, the seat of provincial government in Quebec City. Over the years I have read a lot about the strong French cultural distinction that the eastern side of Canada has. But I think you have to visit and talk with the people there to understand just how strong those sentiments are that lead to discussions about secession. That is an ongoing debate, although we did notice that it is on the backburner in Canada as they watch what is happening in Europe and other places that are trying to find political ways to strengthen and enlarge their economic base rather than create small divisions of it.
The conclusions in the report refer to the great parallels between Canadian and Australian history. It is not surprising that we found that members of parliament in Canada are grappling with identical issues that we face here in Australia, particularly with regard to the welfare of their very large indigenous populations. A lot of discussion was conducted on that, and the similarities and parallels are quite obvious. They are different types of people but have the same health and social issues.
China was a completely different story. There is no doubt that now I understand so much more the great motivation that exists in my own constituency to build cultural, social and economic ties with this huge population not far from us. There is no doubt that there are immense opportunities in Australia continuing to engage socially, culturally and economically with this huge market in China. A huge amount of reform is being undertaken in China, particularly in the last decade, in opening up their economies and in their accession to the World Trade Organisation. They too see enormous opportunities for them in mutual economic trade between our two countries.
We also had an opportunity to see Australian aid operations in China. We were grateful for the facilitation of a visit to a large provincial centre in inland China at Chongqing. The Prime Minister had to cut short his visit to China and missed out on an opportunity to see what is happening in Chongqing. We met Australian AusAID agents in Chongqing providing vocational education and training support, which is something that we do very well here in Australia, particularly in those rural, isolated locations. It was very good to see a positive Australian aid project being well received.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I want to join with the member for Forrest in having a few words to say about this report, both on my own behalf and on behalf of Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, who is currently unavoidably tied up with some parliamentary business. First of all, I want to say that I too was very proud to be part of this delegation. There were senators and members from right across the political spectrum, but I was very proud of the way that we came together and, in a very strong bipartisan way, represented a number of views relating to issues that are of common interest to Canada and Australia, and Canada and China. I felt that the way we addressed this trip did us a world of good. I must say that I was very impressed with the leadership of Senator Alan Ferguson. He did an excellent job, and he served the delegation very well—as did Lindsay Tanner, the deputy leader of this delegation. I know that the member for Mallee and the member for Eden-Monaro share these views, as does Senator Lees. I should also note my appreciation of the very fine job done by Mr Michael McLean, the secretary of the delegation. He did an excellent job, and I do not think we had one problem in terms of the organisation at all.
It was very interesting to go to Canada and their various parliaments, to have the opportunity to sit down and talk with their foreign affairs committee and their Canada-Australia friendship group and to know that many of the issues that they are grappling with are issues that we too are dealing with. Of course, the then pending war in Iraq took up a lot of discussion. I think that Canada and the people of Canada had similar views to people in Australia about that conflict and it was interesting to have the opportunity to speak with them about that. Other issues raised related to stem cell research. Finally, they wanted to know the attitude of Australia to the Kyoto protocol. It is interesting that the Canadian Prime Minister signed Canada's ratification of that protocol back in December 2002.
We had a long trip from Canada to Chongqing in China. I was very pleased that we got off the Beijing and Shanghai route and went to Chongqing. They were very pleased to see us there, and I felt that, once again, we flew the Australian flag very well. We had the opportunity to talk about a number of things in China, including the Olympics, which the Chinese are very excited about hosting. We took the opportunity to discuss both the Olympics and the Paralympics, because these are parallel issues. We were informed by Mr Zeng, the chairman of the NPC's foreign affairs committee, that China intends to host the best Olympic and Paralympic competition ever. They were very excited about the Olympics. They were also very keen on hosting the 2008 World Expo, which has now been awarded to Shanghai. I think that we should take credit for that, because they did approach us to lobby on their behalf.
On my way to Canada and China, I went—at my own expense, I might add—via Menin Gate, where I was invited to speak at the 11 November ceremony. I want to thank very much Joanna Hewitt, the Australian ambassador, for her very great support in that. I also want to thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Danna Vale, and her staff officer, Peter Hulsing, for the arrangements which they helped me put in place to enable me to go there.
—I have to interrupt the member for Cowan, because his time has expired. I would have thought it might suit the convenience of the House, given that I understand that he is the only opposition speaker, if he were allowed to continue. Could I have an indication from the member for Mallee?
—I give leave for the member for Cowan to continue for another five minutes.
—If there is no objection, the member for Cowan may continue.
—I thank the House very much for that indulgence. I was just thanking Danna Vale, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and Peter Hulsing, her officer, for the help that they provided to enable me to get to Ypres for the Menin Gate ceremony on 11 November and to be able to speak on behalf of the Commonwealth countries at the end of the service. It was a very moving service, and I was very moved to have that opportunity.
This is the first delegation that I have been on. It was a delegation where we worked hard. We put in long hours, we had very fruitful discussions and we also had the opportunity to get together in a social sense with some of our counterparts from both Canada and China and to talk directly, in that social way, about a whole range of issues. I know that, from time to time, trips like this raise the ire of some of our constituents and some of our taxpayers, but I want to say to them, in all sincerity—and to other members of this House who perhaps have not had the opportunity to go on such delegations—that they are absolutely worthwhile. I think the dollar cost is returned to the nation manyfold.
I want to say in conclusion that if we could promote ourselves more in the bipartisan and cross-political way in which we did on this delegation, not just overseas but in Australia, I think that members of parliament would be much more highly respected in the community than, unfortunately, we currently are. This was a very well-led trip, as I have said. I want to again extend my congratulations to Senator Alan Ferguson and all of the other members of the delegation. It was very well done.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Canada and China, 17 to 30 November 2002</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I would like to support the remarks of both the member for Cowan and the member for Mallee, particularly the last comments of the member for Cowan. In my seven years in parliament this is only the second delegation that I have been on. Once the delegation left Australia, the political allegiances of each of the individual members were left behind, to some extent, and we were all there on behalf of Australia and on behalf of the parliament. That was a really great way to start off on the right foot overseas and I think we all started very much with that attitude.
The Canadian week was certainly a very busy and interesting week. The member for Mallee mentioned going to the parliament in Ottawa, which I also found fascinating. Question time in the Canadian parliament was interesting, and fairly robust actually, but probably the most interesting aspect was the use of dual languages. There was the situation where some questions were asked in English and actually answered in French or vice versa. There were also many members who answered questions partly in English and partly in French—they would swap from one paragraph to the next, so that was an interesting experience. Some of the similarities to Australia in Canada were incredible, particularly in the health area. The week that we were in Canada there was substantial discussion, in the public, generally, about health matters. In fact, there was a major report about to be released—I think it was released more or less at the end of the week that we were in Canada. In the lead-up to that, there were major articles in the local newspaper each day on some aspect of health. I found the similarities with Australia and the problems that they are having in Canada, with respect to their health system, quite stark.
I was pleased also to go to Quebec. I found that interesting, as did the member for Mallee. There were very individualist aspects of Quebec compared to other parts of Canada. I was fortunate to visit a private mapping spatial information company, which I wanted to see while I was there, and look at some of the work they were doing and the technology that they used. The National Research Council Canada, which we visited, was a highlight, particularly from my point of view as chair of the parliament's Standing Committee on Science and Innovation. Some of the aspects that they are working with and working towards, particularly with improving the research and development commitment in Canada, were things that I was interested in, given the inquiry that my committee here in Australia is currently undertaking. In the information that the National Research Council gave to us, in the Speech from the Throne—which is an interesting turn of phrase in itself in Canada—I noticed Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said:
An innovative economy is driven by research and development. It requires a highly skilled work force and investments in new technology.
	...	...	...
To secure our continued success in the 21st century, Canadians must be among the first to generate new knowledge and put it to use.
In a speech in September 2002, he reinforced that that they were certainly heading in that direction. So we have some competitors in Canada in respect of what we are also trying to do here in Australia. I congratulate the Australian High Commission in Canada for the assistance that they gave us. They were absolutely superb. The staff were tremendous in everything that they did while we were there.
Then we went on to China and, as others said, there was a drastic difference. We went to Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai and saw the development of China in three different aspects, from probably the least developed through to the most developed. Shanghai was like walking into the future, and what they have done there in the Pudong District over the last 10 years is absolutely staggering. It was great to speak about so many different areas between China and Australia and understand the huge market that is there as we develop our trade through the WTO. I was pleased to be able to buy Bega cheese in Beijing, which demonstrated the extent of trade that is possible for the future, and all those aspects that we discussed. Well done to all the committee. It was well led by Alan Ferguson, and Mick McLean, the secretary, did an excellent job as well. (Time expired)

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the widespread use of mobile phones in Australia, with subscriptions now at approximately 12 million;
(2)	commends the Commonwealth Government and Australia's telecommunications carriers for their cooperative action in developing measures to address the problem of loss and theft of mobile phones, including:
(a)	carriers implementing IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identification) number blocking technology, which can render a lost or stolen mobile phone inoperable;
(b)	examination of regulatory reform to support IMEI blocking; and
(c)	encouraging greater public awareness of this problem and recommending action consumers can take to protect themselves in the event of the loss or theft of their mobile phone; and
(3)	notes the success of these measures to date and the recently reported falls in the level of mobile phone theft in Australia.
The Britney Spears song Hit Me One More Time does not necessarily refer to a physical altercation, nor to a robust love life, which I understand she claims she does not have. It means `send me another text message on your mobile phone'. That indicates to me that the whole question of the security of mobile phones today is vital, as the technology has become an integral part of people's lives—particularly young people's. There are now, as the motion indicates, some 12 million mobile telephone subscribers. Mobile phones in Australia are no longer the toys of the rich; they are in everyday use right across the community. Indeed, parents provide their children with mobile phones so that a constant line of communication is available to them. As a parent with two teenage sons, I am well aware of that phenomenon. Teenagers are even SMS messaging each other during school. They have embraced the technology of SMS messaging with so much gusto that a whole youth culture and nomenclature have developed around the technology.
With the spread of mobile phone use, a number of issues of general interest have been raised. The first relates to the question of responsible use. We need to develop a sensible and broadly accepted courtesy code for the use of mobile phones. The second relates to health and includes the possible radiological damage intensive long-term use of mobile phones may bring; in addition, according to physiotherapists there is even the possibility of SOS from constant SMS usage.
But today I am most concerned with the question of the loss of mobile phones through theft or otherwise. There are some 120,000 mobile phones lost annually, according to police and security sources. The consequences of the loss of a phone can be devastating. Kerryn Sloan, a councillor on Waverley council in my electorate, wrote to me recently and described the situation after her phone was lost:
It is like being in exile. All your communication lines are severed and the thought of what someone can do with your numbers and contacts is really worrying.
It is not just the loss of information and stored numbers on SIM cards; victims of mobile phone theft also incur the costs associated with paying out any fixed-term contracts, plus the expense of purchasing replacement phones. Dramatically, in Oxford Street, Bondi Junction—in my electorate—the theft of some $50,000 worth of mobile phones from the Optus World shop occurred at 3.30 a.m. last Monday.
The theft of mobile phones is a major issue and one which touches the lives of many ordinary Australians. I am pleased, therefore, to acknowledge in the terms of this motion that some progress has been made by the government and the three main carriers in relation to GMS phones. Last year, as a result of a special conference between the carriers and the Commonwealth government, a program of cooperative action in developing measures to address the problem of theft and loss of phones was put in place. That included implementing an international mobile equipment identification, or IMEI, number blocking system. That technology renders a lost or stolen mobile phone inoperable for further use. It is important to note that Telstra put in place its part of that blocking program on 15 August 2002 and that Vodafone put in place its part on 31 December 2002. On 31 March 2003—that is, very shortly—Optus will commence its blocking program. I am also pleased to say that AMTA, the carrier representative body, is putting in place a telecommunication cross-network program that will ensure that mobiles will be blocked across all networks. It is important that we publicise this to the broader community. That is one of the purposes of this motion. As a result of the initiatives taken by the government and the carriers—for which I commend them—I hope those initiatives will bear fruit and people's phones will be more secure. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Theft</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in this House on the subject of mobile phone use, and I thank and commend the member for Wentworth for raising the issue in this way. We do not always agree on the subjects that the member for Wentworth and I enjoy talking about, but on this occasion we do.
For me, perhaps the most telling reference in the motion is that which highlights the fact that there are now approximately 12 million mobile phone subscriptions in this country. The population of Australia is currently around 19.7 million people. Whilst acknowledging that some Australians will have more than one subscription, that figure basically indicates that nearly two out of every three Australians have access to a mobile phone. We are not talking only about adult Australians with the means to maintain mobile phone habits; it is probably fair to assume that the popularity of mobiles is very low amongst the oldest Australians. Thus these statistics become somewhat daunting, bringing home to us the number of these subscriptions which must relate to persons under the age of 18 years. Whilst many of these telephones will be parent controlled and provided for the purposes of safety for and contact with their children, many will not be. Even if the telephones are parent provided, their usage may not always be controlled. Approximately 24.4 per cent of our population is aged under 18 years. A bit of basic mathematics leads us to a pretty rapid conclusion that a fair proportion of those under 18-year-olds must have access to mobile phone subscriptions.
The reality is that mobile phones have become status symbols, particularly amongst teenage Australians. The risks of mobile phone possession and usage—whether that includes long personal conversations, accessing expensive phone services or uncontrolled texting interchanges—can be substantial. Before long either the child or the parents can be faced with horrendous bills. In my electorate office, I have certainly seen the disastrous effects this can have; many parents have come into my office with these concerns. In these circumstances, the risk of theft is also greater. Mobile phones have been popular targets for theft virtually since their arrival on the market. The black market in mobile telephones thrived in circumstances where it was almost impossible to trace ownership. In reality, mobile phones are also very easy things to lose. I do not think we would be all that amazed by the number of phones which slip out of pockets or are left on the seats of taxis, trains and buses or in someone else's office. They also look so much alike; it is easy to mistake someone else's for your own.
Although action in developing measures to address the problem of the loss and theft of mobile phones has been longer in coming than really needed to have been the case, it is to be commended. I commend in particular the encouragement of greater public awareness, not only in relation to the specific matters which the member for Wentworth has brought before the House but generally in relation to the usage of mobile phones. There is no question that mobile phones in the wrong hands are potentially time bombs waiting to go off. The consequences, whether they be the result of a loss or a theft or quite simply the provision of a mobile phone legally to a person who is either not fully cognisant of the implications of its use or is reckless about it, can be significant. Greater public awareness about mobile phones and their use is absolutely essential.
I would prefer to see even more cooperative action than that described by the member for Wentworth and, if that is not forthcoming voluntarily, then perhaps some legislative action to ensure that consumers are fully aware of the implications of their possession and use of mobile phones. The risk, as mobile phones become more and more a part of our daily lives, is that consumers will become complacent about the costs and complacent about protective measures. The fact that there are 12 million subscriptions for just 19.7 million Australians is evidence enough that mobile phones are becoming a necessary part of our lives. You only have to look at the job ads, particularly those targeted at young people looking for casual work, to see that possession of a mobile phone is often a necessary prerequisite for participation in society. I see by the way in which many people organise their daily lives and their family schedules that they have become dependent on most family members having a mobile phone. This trend will, I am sure, develop even further. I think soon it will become a given.
In these circumstances, a broad range of measures to protect the consumer is absolutely essential, and there are several ways in which these can be achieved. Industry self-regulation and cooperative action in addressing a broad range of issues is one. In addition to the protective measures which the member for Wentworth has referred to, I would like to see real action which will ensure that excessively mounting call charges are referred to the bill payer for action when they begin to arise, rather than at the end of the billing period. This would particularly apply to situations where the phone is provided to a dependent child or to a person without the capacity to understand the implications of excessive phone use. I also believe that we should have more stringent assessment of subscriptions and that this is something that we should be considering in this process.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Theft</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I rise today to support the motion of the member for Wentworth and to commend the federal government, law enforcement agencies and the telecommunication industry for their combined commitment to developing measures to deal with mobile phone theft. The federal government and industry acknowledge that a consistent, national and multifaceted approach is the only effective way to combat mobile phone theft. Technical solutions need to be supported by education strategies and regulatory reform to outlaw IMEI tampering or handset rebirthing and, in effect, to reduce the number of stolen mobile phones each year from over 100,000.
In the first three months after Telstra introduced the antitheft IMEI blocking technology, more than 10,000 handsets have been blocked from its network: 69 per cent of these were stolen and 31 per cent were lost. The UK also noted that falls in mobile phone theft were reported after the implementation of its mobile safety campaign. While prevention strategies involve costs for mobile phone carriers, which may be passed on to consumers, the fact is that consumers are already paying for the problem of mobile phone theft, not only through having to purchase new phones to replace those that are stolen but also via the public investment in law enforcement to deal with mobile phone theft.
The severity of the problem of mobile phone usage emerges when we examine the nature of the offences involving theft of mobile phones. The largest growth in crime associated with stolen mobile phones has been in offences that are violent in nature, such as street robberies and stabbings. Ironically, parents providing their children with mobile phones for their safety may in fact be endangering them. The number of young victims of mobile phone theft has surged 600 per cent in recent years. Last month in New South Wales a 19-year-old boy was killed when a gang of teenagers robbed him of his mobile phone before ramming him into a power pole.
In the absence of IMEI blocking technology, after a mobile phone has been reported stolen and the network has cancelled the account, the thief can simply replace the cancelled SIM card with another purchased legitimately. Unauthorised users who continue to use a phone in this way have little or no prospect of apprehension by the police. Stolen mobile phones, particularly those with newer features and higher retail prices, have thus become a readily saleable commodity on the black market. The theft problem generated by the low risk of apprehension has been exacerbated by certain marketing practices adopted by telecommunication service providers in response to competitive marketing pressures. Many service providers now encourage customers to enter into contracts for set periods of time—usually 24 to 36 months—in return for which each customer receives a handset free or at reduced cost. When a customer loses their mobile phone or has it stolen, they are usually required to continue the contract and buy another handset at their own expense. Given the high cost differential between mobile phones purchased legitimately and those available on the black market, victims of mobile phone theft may in many instances be tempted to cut their losses by purchasing another phone illegally.
IMEI number-blocking technology is currently employed by Telstra and Vodafone and will be implemented by Optus by 31 March this year. This will make it possible for police to obtain the identity of the phone's current user from the mobile phone carrier. At present, most mobile phone customers do not know their IMEI number. Most do not appreciate its importance in police investigations. However, it is very easy to obtain: you simply press *#06# and the IMEI number for a particular handset will be revealed. Therefore the government's education strategy is of vital importance in reducing the theft of mobile phones.
In the UK the launch of a mobile phone database that will prevent stolen phones from being used on any UK mobile network has been successful. When a stolen phone is reported to a network operator they are able to cancel it just like they would a credit card. Technical solutions and the aggressive education campaign in the UK are complemented by the Mobile Telephones (Re-Programming) Act 2002, which introduces sentences of up to five years for those caught reprogramming IMEI numbers on mobile phones. I commend the government for its commitment to developing measures to prevent mobile phone theft.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Theft</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I rise to give bipartisan support to the motion introduced by the member for Wentworth. I think it is important to draw attention to the fact that, while mobile phone technology has been successful and has reached the level of use to which the honourable member has, in moving this motion, drawn attention, the reality is that it has been so successful because it is so simple in the hands of the consumer. This technology has worked and has been marketed so well and has reached these levels of use because the consumer simply has a phone in their hands which works. The technology is transparent to them but behind that technology lies an incredible array of very complex technology in the hands of the network providers. That technology is much more computer technology these days than it is telephone technology because almost all the technology which is employed, apart from the radio technology used to disseminate the telephone signal, is basically and fundamentally composed of computer software. In the hands of the telephone companies it is basically a large computer system.
Of course, they can now use that in very flexible ways and they could have come to a solution much earlier in the existence of mobile telephone technology. Unfortunately, there are very strong, perverse incentives in the system for them not to come to a solution for the benefit of consumers because in reality the new user of the stolen mobile phone is still making telephone calls. Telephone calls are still being paid for; someone is still responsible for the payment of those telephone calls being made through the stolen handset. As far as the telephone companies are concerned, there are quite perverse incentives in the system. They really have never had an incentive to provide effective solutions to the theft of mobile phones—even though those solutions have been staring them in the face ever since the system was invented. The reality is that mobile telephone technology, because it is so software oriented, has always provided ready solutions to problems like this. It has simply been that the perverse incentives built into the system—not deliberately by the telephone companies, of course, but simply by the very nature of the business—are such that they have never had the necessary incentives to deal with these kinds of problems. Now they are dealing with them—ultimately and belatedly—and I am very pleased to see that that is the case.
The honourable member for Wentworth has quite correctly pointed out—indeed, as all honourable members in this debate have—the magnitude of these problems. It is occurring at all ends of the market now, with not only our young people but also our older citizens making very good use of this vital technology. It will extend beyond mobile phones because now PDA devices—portable computers—which are reduced to the size of mobile phones and which will be even more valuable also incorporate telephone technology. So $1,000-plus computer devices will also incorporate telephone technology. Laptop computers incorporate telephone technology to dial out as broadband devices. The 3G telephone technology will allow even more expensive devices to also incorporate telephone technology, which will also need this kind of protective software. It is quite possible for the telephone companies to incorporate much more consumer empowerment into these devices.
As the honourable member for Bass has pointed out, consumers need even greater empowerment. So why not allow consumers to manage their mobile telephone accounts for themselves, for their children and, if necessary, for their older parents through the Internet? You can set daily limits through your own web account for your mobile telephones—if that is what is necessary. At a particular time in your child's life, you may want to set a $5 or a $2 a day limit through an Internet web page which Telstra can provide for your particular mobile phone account. For another child you might set a $3 a day limit or you might set a limit of five, or 10 or zero SMS messages a day and tomorrow or next month you might change that. If Telstra or the other account providers allowed that kind of empowerment by consumers through the Internet, for example, that kind of management on a micro basis would be very cost effective for the consumer and for the telephone companies. Of course, they are not providing that level of control because that would reduce the profitability of some of the services which are very highly profitable because of the out-of-control management by individuals in the system. That is the problem we face. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Theft</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2003-03-24,"—I would also like to commend the member for Wentworth for bringing this issue to the attention of the House. When you consider that there are something like 100,000 mobile phone pieces being stolen annually, it is very easy for members to equate that to something that has happened to a constituent much closer to home. I think it is important that we have this debate, too, just to reinforce a few simple things that the community can do for itself. There are adequate in-built security measures that are already in the handpiece. I know a lot of people say that is too technical or too complicated, so to that extent the member for Bonython is right, but there are very simple measures where you can code in your own PIN—a four-digit number—and you can impose your own local security.
It is very easy to have your mobile phone stolen. Of all mobile phones stolen, 28 per cent are stolen from motor vehicles and 20 per cent are stolen from social venues such as restaurants, pubs and clubs. That can happen easily: you make a call, you then become engaged in another conversation, you leave your phone on the table next to you and it is very easy for someone to walk past and collect it. Eight per cent of mobile phones are stolen from the workplace, which is very disconcerting.
To expand on what the member for Bonython has said, there are some measures in place. I have children too, and we have provided them with mobile phones for security purposes. There are only certain numbers that they can ring and it is not an unlimited account. We provide a limited amount of dollars per month so that if a phone is stolen and they have not utilised the in-built security measures, which I have already mentioned, the liability is somewhat limited. 
In addition to what the carriers can do—and members have mentioned the IMEI process—there are a large number of smaller initiatives which consumers themselves can utilise, but most people are unaware of them. I think it is important that we have a motion like this to give some publicity to those measures. One of the things that I am amazed about is the incredible take-up of mobile telephony in Australia in the short space of around 12 years—since the late 1980s. I can remember that my first mobile phone was an old analog box that weighed 3½ kilograms. Do you remember those, Mr Deputy Speaker? It was a very effective piece of equipment, but it was analog technology. To give some testimony to the difficulty in providing a regulatory framework with technology changing, soon after that we had the introduction of the GSM network, the global system for mobiles, using digital technology. Since then here in Australia there have been a huge push and massive expenditure by the carriers, particularly Telstra, for the provision of CDMA, code division multiple access, which is an Australian adaptation, if you like, to make the technology go even further and to cram more and more users into a limited technology. With all those changes, there is no doubt that consumers become readily confused, but it is not so difficult to impose your own security arrangements and just be a bit careful where you leave your mobile phone.
I am very grateful that the government has taken a very proactive role in the rollout of mobile telephony. It is an incredible facility to provide to rural Australia, in particular, and the kind of constituency that I represent. In fact, this Friday I will be launching another CDMA tower at a place called Gulaquil in my electorate, which is a strategic location on the Henty Highway. It is the third such tower I have taken part in launching just this year. It is very pleasing to my constituents because the demand to have this technology at their disposal for commercial and safety reasons is becoming even greater. In Australia there are 12 million handpieces in a population of slightly less than 20 million. This gives us the highest per capita possession of mobile phones of any country in the world. This motion is all about ensuring security and safety for consumers so they can avoid having their possessions stolen. I commend the motion and thank the member for Wentworth for bringing it to the parliament's attention.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—Australia's stunning victory in the Cricket World Cup is a cause for great national pride and a recognition of the success of initiatives such as the Australian Cricket Academy and the professionalism of sporting bodies such as the Australian Cricket Board. But it has special significance for me and for the people of my electorate of Bass, because the Australian team was steered onto its unwavering course to its ultimate goal by one of our own. Ricky Ponting's elevation to the Australian one-day captaincy may have caused eyebrows to be raised in some quarters, but to all of us it was a cause for much local pride—a pride which has no doubt swollen beyond all belief in the last 12 or so hours.
He is very much the product of Tasmania—a young boy from Mowbray, in the working-class suburbs of Launceston, who has combined the wonderful natural ability with which he is endowed with the opportunities which were presented to him to rise to the very top of his sport. Not only was he able to lead his talented and determined team on an unbeaten path through to the final but last night he led by example. Despite what commentators described as a shaky start, he dominated the Indian bowling with 140 off just 121 balls. It was fantastic to see the 234-run, unbeaten partnership between two highly professional cricketers hailing from opposite ends of our vast continent; the Darwin lad combined magnificently with the Tassie boy in a superb display of sporting prowess. This aptly demonstrates what young Australians can achieve, wherever they might come from, if they are given just one thing: opportunity. That is something all of us who have the privilege to be members of this House should ensure we provide to all of our fellow Australians whenever possible.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Sport: Cricket World Cup</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—My question is to the Prime Minister, and I ask: given that coalition forces have been involved in military action for several days and have encountered resistance, can the Prime Minister inform the House of the number of coalition casualties, including the current wellbeing of Australian troops? Does the Prime Minister have any information on the current number of Iraqi civilian and military casualties?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question that he has asked me. It is not possible for me to give a precise number of coalition casualties. The information that I have is not substantially different from what has been reported in the media. Sadly, an Australian cameraman was killed, in circumstances that have been detailed in the media. I understand the foreign minister may have something further to say about that later on today. I am able to report to the House that thus far there have been no casualties sustained by the Australian forces. There do appear to have been a number of battle casualties sustained by the United States forces. Regrettably, some 14 to 16 British military personnel have died in a series of accidents.
So far as civilian casualties are concerned, it is not possible to give a precise figure. However, on the basis of both the bombing assessment reports and the targeting assessment reports by both the United States and the British military, and our own, it is possible to say that the aim of the coalition forces in keeping to an absolute minimum the number of civilian casualties as a result of the military raids has so far, it appears, been achieved. That is not, of course, to suggest that loss of even one life is anything other than very regrettable. It is very important in circumstances such as this that we take care not to trivialise any aspect of the casualties that are sustained. But it is a firm goal of the coalition forces, and it is very much a goal of the Australian forces, that targets be selected on the basis that injury and death to civilians is avoided to the maximum extent possible.
It would appear from some of the on the ground press reports, including in particular those of the Australian journalist Paul McGeough of the Sydney Morning Herald, who is still in Baghdad, that the aim of the so described `precision attacks' of the coalition forces has been successful to date and that the buildings that have been attacked and the assets that have been attacked are those that are part of the infrastructure and support system of Saddam Hussein's regime. I am very conscious, and I am sure that both President Bush and the British Prime Minister are very conscious, of the responsibility carried, which is fully consistent with giving their own forces a proper opportunity of protection and success. The obligation they carry is to minimise the civilian casualties. That is a very firm aim. It is one of the things that perhaps has distinguished this operation from operations that have been conducted in the past.
I take this opportunity to say—I am sure on behalf of everybody in this parliament—how much the Australian community respects the skill, the professionalism, the bravery and the commitment to duty displayed by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force now in the gulf. I believe that they have behaved in accordance with the best traditions of Australia's military forces. They are a group of people of whom all of us can be immensely proud. They are a group of people who carry into the campaign in which they are now involved, and any campaign in which they will be involved in future, the profound good wishes of every man and woman in this country. I believe they should. They carry the profound hopes and prayers of all Australians that they will return safely to their homes. If there are any further pieces of information on the general subject matter of the Leader of the Opposition's question that I can provide to the parliament over coming days, I will be only too happy to do so.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—In a sense, I think I have already answered that question. My point is that I did not say last Thursday—and I do not say it now—that we never issue general travel advisories; I say that we do have general travel advisories. I would have to check this, but I think some were probably issued in the time of the previous government as well. Obviously, we continue to monitor the situation very closely. The particular pieces of new information I can think of at the moment relate to two factors that have come from Indonesia, as well as very general but very serious information that comes from the Middle East. In relation to Indonesia, there was at one stage some information which we publicised and which we talked about—even in question time, if my memory serves me well—in relation to the possibility of sweeping operations by an Islamic extremist group in Indonesia which has made those sorts of statements from time to time. More generally, as the House knows, there has been the information in relation to a possible terrorist attack in Surabaya. In that particular case, we issued a very specific press release last Saturday.
In addition to that, it is very important to follow the evolution of the individual country travel advisories in relation to the Middle East. They have been reissued many times—over 20 times in the last few weeks, from memory. Naturally enough, we are very concerned about possible terrorist threats in the Middle East region, and it has been important to highlight that. So the general travel advisory, as I explained, does exist, and I did not say that it did not exist. It does exist, and we just endeavour to get the balance right there. It obviously does take into account specific warnings we have in particular parts of the world, but we do try to get the balance precisely right.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Travel Advice</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. Before I ask this question, in terms of its context, I should acknowledge that it is entirely necessary and appropriate that a nonviolent removal of those who seek to disrupt the proceedings of this House occur. But I want to raise a matter which occurred on Sunday in the precincts of this parliament which raises issues of civil liberties and the dangers to those civil liberties through the conduct of parliamentary staff. 
On Sunday a woman who had attended a rally outside this parliament walked to the top of the grassy precincts of the parliament to overlook the War Memorial. She was accompanied by two of her children. Before proceeding, she had been asked by parliamentary attendants to leave behind a placard which she had carried, and she did so. But she was wearing a T-shirt which had on it a slogan saying `World War III, starring Bush, Hussein, Blair and Howard' and the slogan `No war'.
When she got to the top of the building and was overlooking the War Memorial, she was approached by a parliamentary officer, I believe a member of the APS, who told her she was obliged to remove the T-shirt because it was a political statement. She kept telling the APS officer that she was not in the demonstration, she was on the hill with her kids to show them the War Memorial. She said she had come from Dubbo because she felt strongly about the war being wrong but now she was just an ordinary person exercising her rights as an Australian. I am advised that she was quite shaken but she held her ground.
—The member for Denison has a question to me?
—Yes, it is to you. She was supported by a number of other people, who asked for the basis upon which she was being required to remove her T-shirt, and she was told by the parliamentary officer that the Parliamentary Precincts Act obliged him to take the action to prevent people making political statements and so on. When someone asked if he would have taken the same action if she had been wearing a pro Howard T-shirt—
—If the member for Denison will come to his question, I will address his question.
—He said he could not comment and walked off.
—A question to me is not an opportunity to advance a particular argument. I ask him to come to his question.
—Mr Speaker, I did alert you to these circumstances—
—The member for Denison could have written me an entire epistle; the standing orders would still stand. He is obliged to come to his question.
—The question I ask you is whether it is under your instructions or the instructions of any other officers of this parliament to require people to remove T-shirts or other items of clothing which express particular views, not within this chamber but on the external parts of this building or indeed in the internal parts of this building, which offer no disruption. I ask you whether this is in accordance with any instruction that you have provided.

"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-03-24,"—I can very quickly respond to the member for Denison by indicating to him that no, I have not issued any specific instruction that changes the arrangements that currently exist under which there is in fact a demonstration area. Obviously, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between what is an appropriate or inappropriate political statement. It would seem, from what the member for Denison has said, that one of the APS officers may have been a little more diligent than was appropriate in discharging his duty. I will raise the matter with the APS. Before I do so, I must publicly indicate the support that I have, and that I believe everyone in the House has, for the security staff and the APS in this building.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	reaffirms its support for the 30% private health insurance rebate which helps give Australians choice and is financially assisting almost 9 million Australians and their families, including one million Australians who earn less than $20,000 a year;
(2)	notes the Labor Party opposed the introduction of the private health insurance rebate and voted against the legislation when its was debated in the House of Representatives and the Senate;
(3)	notes that numerous Labor Party members have called for major changes to the rebate; and
(4)	calls on the Labor Party to express its support for the 30% private health insurance rebate or urgently release its private health insurance policy.
The private health insurance rebate is a tax cut worth about $700 to $800 a year for Australian families with private health insurance. It is a 30 per cent tax cut on private health insurance premiums. Removing the rebate would amount to a tax increase for nearly nine million Australians. The coalition government support the rebate. It gives Australian health consumers quality, choice, better access and affordability. Our policy has also received a tick from Access Economics in their recent report, Striking a balance: choice, access and affordability in Australian health care.
Labor's position is also crystal clear. Labor have always hated the private health system. They see it through the prism of the class struggle—an idea as outdated as the spinning jenny and the stump-jump plough. Labor's opposition to the private health system is a metaphor for the modern ALP: short-sighted, limited, ridden with contradictions and unable to rise above their class-conscious, determinist history. Labor bitterly opposed the private health insurance rebate in both the House and the Senate. Since the legislation was passed with the support of Independents, Labor's campaign against the rebate has continued. On 6 November 2000, the then Leader of the Opposition said:
My Shadow Health Minister, Jenny Macklin, and I have made clear that Labor will retain the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, with no means test or cap.
But, just as we knew Labor did not support the government's border protection policy, we knew they did not support the rebate. Soon after the election the member for Jagajaga made clear what Labor really thought. The Australian of Monday, 19 February 2001 reported that the member for Jagajaga said:
We've been saying for ages that the private health rebate doesn't take pressure off public hospitals ...
In an article by Maxine McKew in the Bulletin of 12 June 2001, the member for Jagajaga is reported as speculating on how the Labor Party might fund a doctors' $100,000 a year pay claim. McKew writes:
There is an obvious option for the Labor Party. They can get their hands on close to $2 billion by killing off the 30% rebate to those who take out private insurance.
The article continues:
It's no secret Macklin hates the rebate ... After a year or so into office, a defensible backflip could see the rebate scrapped with the revenues redirected to both public hospitals and GPs.
In the Canberra Times of 2 December 2002, the member for Jagajaga, in reference to the debate, is reported as saying:
It's a huge area of expenditure and a lot of people are figuring out that it isn't worth having ...
Indeed, the member for Jagajaga's position on the private health insurance rebate seems to be more aligned with that of the member for Denison, Duncan Kerr, who has called for the `substantial dismemberment' of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The member for Jagajaga and her Labor lieutenants seem to be softening up the electorate for a policy backflip.
We know that, in addition to scrapping the rebate, other alternatives Labor are considering include means testing the 30 per cent rebate and capping the Commonwealth's expenditure on the rebate. Maybe the member for Canberra will be able to inform us whether or not that is the situation. A capping of the program would be akin to the slow suffocation of the rebate for, although the subsidy would stay, its value and effect would be diminished over time. Also, the compliance costs of such a scheme would surely erode the funds available to Australian private health consumers. We also know that Labor are considering placing a ceiling on individual expenditure on the rebate, which would not need a means test but which would have the effect of costing Australian families as much as $500 a year. Maybe the shadow minister has been told about that suggestion circulating in the ALP right now or maybe she is being left in the dark. Labor's position has nothing to do with what is best for Australians and everything to do with ideology. Labor oppose consumer choice because they do not trust Australians to manage their own affairs.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I rise to speak during this private members' business debate today on the private health insurance rebate. The Howard government's management—or should I say mismanagement—of private health insurance has been appalling. In the run-up to the 2001 election, Prime Minister Howard said that his government's policies would lead to reduced premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. We now know with absolute clarity that the government's policies in this area have led to the exact opposite: families and taxpayers are now paying a very high price. Since the election in 2001, the government has approved increases in premiums of more than 14 per cent. This year's increase of 7.4 per cent comes on top of last year's average increase of 6.9 per cent. As a result, many families with private health insurance will pay an extra $150 to $250 this year. Together with last year's increases and the decision by some funds to abandon discounts for regular and up-front payments, many Australian families will now be paying $300 to $500 more for their premiums than they did before the election in 2001. 
The cost to taxpayers generally is also horrendous. The average increase in private health insurance premiums of 7.4 per cent will cost taxpayers more than $170 million each year, or $680 million over four years. That is on top of the $2.3 billion that the Commonwealth is already spending on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate this year. For every dollar that premiums rise, taxpayers will contribute 30c. The Minister for Health and Ageing recently demonstrated the way in which the Howard government has developed inadequate policy. Last month Senator Patterson announced an agreement with the Private Health Insurance Association to phase out gym shoes, tents and golf clubs from the ancillary benefits which many health funds offer. This is an admission that the taxpayers' funds are being wasted on top-rate ancillary items. For example, in Senate estimates we discovered a case in which a woman claimed $400 from her health fund on the basis that her family's lifestyle was to relax listening to classical music and that this would result in them not having to go to the psychologist. After a complaint to the Ombudsman, the fund subsequently agreed to pay. It is difficult to see how a $120 federal government subsidy for the purchase of $400 worth of classical CDs can possibly be justified as a legitimate Commonwealth expenditure.
The Howard government also claimed that the private health insurance rebate would relieve pressure on the public health system. It is difficult to find anyone who agrees with this view. State premiers, state health ministers and health policy experts such as Professor Deeble, one of the architects of Medicare, argue that the introduction of the rebate has not solved the problem at all. On the contrary, when you look at the official statistics, it is clear that there has been a negligible fall of 0.1 per cent in public hospital separations since the introduction of the rebate. At the same time, we have seen the catastrophic collapse of bulk-billing and very many more presentations to emergency departments because of the collapse of bulk-billing—in respect of which, the federal government will not lift a finger. Professor Deeble has also argued that 60 per cent of the rebate goes to ancillaries or to people simply upgrading their private health insurance cover. 
I would now like to turn to an issue which is very important to me in my role as shadow minister for ageing—that is, dental services. The statistics are frightening. People over 45 have an average of 20 missing, filled or damaged teeth. Disadvantaged Australians are twice as likely as the general population to have lost teeth and are less likely to visit a dentist. Half of all adults aged 65 and over who live in rural areas have no natural teeth. Fewer than 50 per cent of uninsured people visited a dental professional in the previous 12 months, and 14 per cent had not visited for five or more years. In 1996 the Howard government axed the Commonwealth dental program set up under Labor. Waiting lists increased 55 per cent in the years 1996 to 2000, and waiting times for non-emergency treatment are projected to reach 29 months in 2002-03. As copayments and waiting times increase, more teeth are extracted instead of filled. With fees for private dentistry as high as $200 an hour, many people rely on publicly funded dental clinics. These are now so pressed that they can only see people who are in severe pain. About 500,000 people are on waiting lists to receive public dental treatment. Only 11 per cent of those eligible for treatment receive it each year, yet the Howard government now spends over $350 million annually on subsidising private dental insurance.

"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—The private health insurance rebate is of critical benefit to Australians and to the entire health system. Our system relies on a dual system of public and private health. Without a strong private system, without a critical mass of Australians in private health insurance, the whole system suffers—and that is the thing that those opposite seem to miss. As the member for Sturt said when he spoke to his motion, nearly nine million Australians are covered by private health insurance. That 30 per cent rebate which he spoke of and which this motion is about means that private health insurance is 30 per cent cheaper than it otherwise would be; it means it is 30 per cent more affordable than it otherwise would be. As the member for Sturt said, that represents to the average family with an average policy a saving of around $700 or $800 every year. 
If the Labor Party had had their way, they would have prevented this ever coming into being. They have spoken against it. They voted against it in both houses of this parliament. They did everything they could to stop it coming into being. If they have their way in the future, they will do exactly the same thing. The millions of Australian families with private health insurance deserve to know what the Labor Party plan for them—that is, a $700 or $800 tax hike on their private health insurance. As I said, the Labor Party opposed and spoke against this measure when it came in. At the last election, as the member for Sturt said, they pretended that, whilst they opposed it, they would keep it, but nobody believed them. Everyone was right not to believe them, because every utterance, every word, every statement by the Labor Party since the election has been about how the rebate should be changed, how it should be altered and how, as the member for Sturt said, they can dismember it, as has been stated by Duncan Kerr, the member for Denison.
Labor oppose private health insurance because of their well-known ideological obsession. You do not need to take our word for this; you need only go to Graham Richardson, the former minister for health, who said after he left parliament, `The Labor Party have always been a bit biased against private health insurance.' You can see why when you look at their record over their 13 years in government. They never once had a single incentive for private health insurance, and they did everything within their power in a policy sense to make life difficult for those with private health insurance. In this aim, it has to be said, they were spectacularly successful. During their 13 years in government, the number of Australians with private health insurance fell from 65 per cent to around 34 per cent in 1996, which took it down to very low levels indeed. This bias and this blind opposition not only threaten the premiums of the millions of Australians who have private health insurance but also threaten, as I said at the outset, the entire health system. 
When people abandon private health insurance, it has second round effects on both the private system and the public system. For the private system, massive drop-outs reduce the pool of funds available and cause catastrophic premium increases. We saw that between 1986 and 1988. For the member who spoke just before me about private health insurance premium increases, it would do her well to go back to that time. In that period of two years, premiums went up 40 per cent. In 1991 and 1992, when there were further drop-outs, they went up a further 17 per cent. This also hurt the public health system. When you have those sorts of drop-outs, as we did in the late eighties and the early nineties, that burden is immediately transferred on to the public system.
Graham Richardson acknowledged this when he was health minister. In 1993 in the Senate he said:
I accept that one of the ways we will have to explore in making sure that some of the pressure is taken off waiting lists is at least to put a floor under private health insurance ... to get the numbers back up. 
Unfortunately, he never got the chance. As he said after he left parliament:
I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance.
It took the election of this government to provide the important incentives in relation to private health insurance which have increased numbers, benefited millions of Australian families and helped strengthen the entire health system. This motion says that we will keep that rebate because it is working. We call on the Labor Party to do the same thing. But up until now the only thing we hear is that they will scrap it and hit every Australian family with a private health insurance bill of between $700 and $800.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Private Health Insurance: Rebate</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—It really surprises me to hear the previous speaker talking about ideological obsession. What I see is an ideological obsession on the other side of the House to totally destroy Medicare, undermine our current system and force people to pay more for basic health care. It is really absolutely disgraceful what this government have done, and they have shown just how little understanding they really have of health and health issues. The other thing that really surprises me is that the member for Sturt would have had the courage—or should I say the stupidity—to move this motion given the massive increase in private health insurance premiums with which Australians have recently been hit. This year alone there has been a 7.4 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. I can see the member for Sturt looking particularly bored and complacent about this increase. Last year we had a 6.9 per cent increase. That is an increase of over 14 per cent since 2001.
This government promised the Australian people more affordable private health insurance. We know that we should never believe what this government promise. We know that they have quite a reputation of going back on the promises that they make to the Australian people. It was no surprise whatsoever when, on the anniversary of September 11 last year, this government announced their agreement to an automatic CPI increase in private health insurance. This is not a government that is committed to openness. This is not a government that is about providing good quality health care to all Australians. The money that is being spent on health should be about improving health outcomes. Is improving health outcomes about putting money into insurance or is improving health outcomes about putting money into hospitals, encouraging a system which makes it possible for doctors to bulk-bill and making sure that people actually get the health services that they need? Health care is about care; it is not about insurance. This is bad policy by the government.
Last weekend I was working on a polling booth in the New South Wales election. Two people came up to me and spoke to me about issues relating to private health insurance. One person was a pensioner who had been paying into private health insurance, and it was causing them a great degree of financial hardship.
—Imagine what it would be like without the tax cut.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member for Sturt has had his say. Do not be provoked.
—This person needed to have a hip replacement. When he went along to his doctor, he was advised, `Yes, we'll book you into the local private hospital. But on top of what your health insurance company will pay, you will have to pay $4,000.' That pensioner had his hip replacement in the local public hospital. So tell me what that delivered to him. Another person came up to me and expressed their concerns about private health insurance. It is no wonder the Carr government did so well in New South Wales.
The recent increases are going to lead to another $170 million a year being paid into private health insurance—and that goes with the $2.3 billion that is already going into the government's health insurance rebate. It is because of all these inequities that exist that the Labor Party are undertaking a careful review. We are reviewing the 30 per cent rebate to determine whether it is delivering the best possible health outcomes. In other words, we are seeing whether health dollars are best spent on insurance or whether they would be much more effectively spent on achieving good health outcomes, through the money going to hospitals and to actions to increase bulk-billing. Bulk-billing has been a casualty under this government, and it is because of that casualty that I am having a `save Medicare' meeting in my electorate on Saturday this week.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—We have just heard the Labor Party's position regarding the 30 per cent private medical insurance rebate. They say it is bad policy. What could that possibly be code for? It is code for the fact that, if the Labor Party have their way and get into government, they would abolish the 30 per cent rebate and they would slug ordinary Australians—those nine million of them that have private medical insurance—an extra 43 per cent premium increase for their private medical insurance. Those one million Australians—as outlined in the motion moved by the member for Sturt—who struggle on less than $20,000 per year to maintain their private medical insurance do so because they believe that they have the right to good quality medical coverage and they want to exercise that right through the private system.
How interesting that the Labor Party live in this ideologically sealed world where they believe that the best way to generate an outcome is to tax and spend, tax and spend. The more money they can raise, the more money they can throw at that great thing called the health system. Apparently, the more money there is to throw at the health system, the sooner the Australian Labor Party will solve the nation's ills. How interesting that the member for Shortland should say, `What we're concerned with is good quality health care for all Australians.' How interesting, though, that the opposition are unable to make the connection between recognising that the more people there are in the public system, the harder it will be to provide that so-called good quality health care for all Australians.
Let's get a couple of statistics and closely examine where exactly we stand with respect to medical procedures. We heard the member for Shortland talk about someone who she claimed was shocked to learn that they had to make a gap payment. We heard the shadow minister claim on 18 November 2002 that private patients face out-of-pocket gap payments for one in five privately insured medical services provided in a hospital. On the face of it, that might be concerning—but what is comforting is that, when the Labor Party were in power, it was four in five people who had to make gap payments. Now, under the 30 per cent rebate, it is only one in five. The difference is really quite stark. This feigned concern that opposition members have about the gap payment suddenly evaporates when you consider that, under their policy, four in five people had to make the gap payment.
What about the claim that this person had to have a hip replacement? When you examine it, the fact is that now, in private hospitals—hospitals that increasingly are taking the bulk of medical procedures because of the fact that we have the affordable 30 per cent rebate—six out of 10 major joint replacements, about half of chemotherapy procedures, over half of major procedures for malignant breast conditions, six out of 10 cardiac valve procedures and seven out of 10 major eye lens procedures occur. Why is that? It is because we have made private medical insurance affordable and the people of Australia like the fact that they can now afford to get private medical insurance. It is vastly different to the situation that existed under the Labor Party. The fact is that the nine million Australians that take advantage of our 30 per cent rebate enjoy the fact that they have access to good health outcomes through both the public and the private system if they choose.
Another claim we have heard from the Labor Party is that there have been increases in the premium that is put forward by private medical insurers. Let's compare those increases. There, again, the Labor Party is on very shaky ground because, under the Labor government, private health insurance premiums grew by an average of 11.3 per cent. That was the average increase in private medical insurance premiums. Under this government, premiums have increased by an average of 4.98 per cent. That is 4.98 per cent compared to 11.3 per cent under the Labor Party. It is a vast difference.
The other concerning thing—and this goes to the heart of what the member for Sturt and my good friend the member for Casey put forward in this motion—is the fact that the Labor Party still refuses to publicly state its position with regard to the 30 per cent rebate. What we heard from the member for Canberra were words to the effect of `Don't mention our policy on the rebate. We won't talk about that; we'll talk about everything except the 30 per cent rebate on health care.' But the most telling quote of all is a comment that Graham Richardson made on 2GB. This is the quote:

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—Currently there are two wars raging: one in Iraq; the other on the domestic front regarding health care and bulk-billing services in Australia. The great similarity is that the man who has endorsed both wars so enthusiastically is the Prime Minister of this country. This is a PM that is not averse to casualties and not averse to making those least able to defend themselves suffer. This is a PM and a government that have no hesitation in making life less secure for the sick, the frail, the aged and the forgotten so-called Howard battlers.
Where are the Howard battlers of today, those the government so eagerly courted in past elections? They are now the families suffering under John Howard's harsh and unfair health care policies. They are the families queueing and waiting to see a GP—if they can get onto the list. They are the families paying the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy and the private health insurance with the several increases. For all that extra cost, they get very little additional service. The government has tried for some time to argue that people are better off with the 30 per cent rebate. But let us get one thing straight: the moment the 30 per cent rebate was introduced, every single fund raised its premiums by exactly the same amount; so the only people who were better off were the insurance companies. This is more evidence of John Howard helping big business and forgetting average families. Yes, the 30 per cent rebate is helping many families; yes, it is important—but it is only important because, under this government, the cost of health insurance has risen by considerably more than just 30 per cent.
My constituents in the electorate of Oxley are experiencing great difficulties in locating medical practitioners who continue to bulk-bill. Yet the government maintains the charade through motions like that from the member for Sturt, insisting that the private health insurance rebate has fixed the health care system and that no more problems exist. Try and tell that to the low-income families who are trying to survive day to day; try to explain the need to commit additional money, which they have not got, to afford private health insurance. If they have private health insurance, they subscribe to the lowest and cheapest possible level, which provides very little in real effect—all this to get a service they have already paid for through the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy!
The rate of bulk-billing has fallen by almost 10 per cent since the Howard government came into office. The average cost of seeing a doctor has gone up by about 50 per cent, to $12.57. But, if you think this is not much, think again. Those that it hits directly are those least able to afford it and the families that do not have any private health insurance at all. They are the families now being forced to pick up the government's bill by paying upfront for GP visits. In the run-up to the last election, the government told Australians that their private health insurance would be more affordable and that premiums would go down. But since the election all we have seen are premiums go up.
The government said that the 30 per cent rebate was the be-all, end-all solution to health care. John Howard said he would fix waiting lists and provide better health care services by giving people more choice. But now that we have seen premiums rise by 7.4 per cent this year—and on top of an average increase of 6.9 per cent last year—we know that families are much worse off. For many people, the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is not a health issue; it is a family budget issue, and it is important to them in the family budget context. Labor is undertaking a very careful review of the 30 per cent rebate to see if it is delivering the best possible outcomes for families. It is obvious the 30 per cent rebate is no longer working, with tens of thousands of people pulling out. They are pulling out because they cannot afford the high cost and they now realise they were conned by this government's scare campaign of lifetime cover. This is a government that operates through fear, intimidation, misinformation and making ordinary Australians feel less secure, not more secure.
I am calling for the Prime Minister and his battle hardened backbenchers to stop the unfair assault on families and let commonsense prevail—commonsense in maintaining a fair and accessible Medicare system and commonsense in putting a lid on the unfair increases in private health insurance premiums.

"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—Over the past two years the government's family tax benefits system has driven families in my electorate of Hasluck into a cycle of debt which many are still struggling to come to terms with. After the first year of its operation, 5,052 families in Hasluck received notification of a family tax benefit debt and 971 families received notification of a child-care benefit debt. After the second year of operation, another 2,550 families received notification of an FTB debt and 559 families received notification of a child-care benefit debt. Based on the national average of these debts provided by the minister, the government is taking—conservatively—$6,743,869 out of the pockets of Hasluck families. I have surveyed approximately eight per cent of the families within Hasluck who have received notices of debts through the family tax benefits system. I believe that their feedback is indicative of the difficulties many families receiving this benefit are now facing. Results from the survey of 200 local families clearly demonstrate the fact that a system that is supposed to assist families with the costs of raising their children has actually resulted in blowing apart their family budgets. I have spoken to many families who have received a debt notice and they have repeatedly told me about the obvious flaws in the system, but I was deeply shocked to realise the longer term impact these debts were having on those families.
By far the most disturbing figure that emerged from my survey was the fact that 70 per cent of families who received a debt notice for the 2000-01 financial year also received one for the 2001-02 financial year. Worse still, as the government well knows, the issuing of debt notices for the 2000-01 financial year was cynically delayed until early 2002, a few short months after the November 2001 election. One may well question the government's handling and motivation for that decision, as it resulted in 70 per cent of Hasluck families surveyed being hit with two large debts within months of each other. I know that a combined debt of $1,627 may not mean much to members of parliament who are on salaries in excess of $100,000, but for families in some areas of Hasluck this figure could well be close to 10 per cent of their annual income. As one single mother put to me:
Why didn't they just tell me about the first debt at the end of the 2000/01 financial year ... By the time l knew there was a problem, Centrelink told me that I had already been accruing a second debt for the past 6 months ... I'm still paying off the debts and hardly receiving any family assistance.
This government should be ashamed of its decision to delay notifying families of the first round of debts. It has put an additional financial burden on many low-income families, and for many families a debt trap has already closed.
The results of my survey indicate that families receiving the family tax benefit have been offered different pieces of advice from Centrelink officers on how to avoid further debts. One piece of advice that was regularly offered was the need to advise Centrelink immediately of any changes in income. We even had an electronic media advertising campaign to that effect. The Prime Minister himself stated on 18 September 2002, in response to a question without notice:
Families who tell us that their income has risen during the year will be able to be paid at a subsequent rate that reduces or wipes out a potential overpayment. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you might wonder what the result was following this advice from Centrelink and repeated by the Prime Minister. It was that 54.4 per cent of families who received a debt during 2000-01 and/or the following year notified Centrelink of changes to their income within one week; and 33.3 per cent of those surveyed notified Centrelink of changes to their income within one month. One constituent who received a debt for the first financial year stated:
It doesn't matter when you ring as I was told, you incur a debt as your income estimated is incorrect.
Another constituent who received a debt in excess of $1,200 told me that Centrelink had said to her, `Let us know if your circumstances change,' which, she said:
... I had already done as my husband lost his job.. and I returned to work full time for 4 months ... they adjusted my payments but I still ended up with a debt. It caused great financial stress paying back the debt.
Yet another constituent who followed this advice said that Centrelink was slow to make changes to her payments. She said:
I still can't see how I was overpaid ... but had no choice but to accept their calculations and pay the debt.
Clearly, advising Centrelink immediately of any changes to income did not work. Though families received reduced payments at some point after notification, Centrelink did not take into account the so-called overpayment component which would have accumulated prior to the notification of change. I note that the government publication from the Family Assistance Office entitled `More Choices for Families' now gives more detailed information. The fact sheet includes the following:
To reduce the chance of overpayment you can ask the Family Assistance Office to adjust your fortnightly payment of the Family Tax Benefit over the remainder of the income (financial) year to recover or reduce any amounts you may already have been overpaid.
This statement is included in a densely-written four-page fact sheet which I understand was distributed to families who receive the family tax benefit. I must say that I am not confident that this fact sheet will be of much use to the many families who are already deeply confused by this complex system. From this statement, it is still not clear whether or not families who ring Centrelink to advise of changes to their income will have their payments adjusted to reflect the overpayment, which would have occurred prior to notification. According to the statement, individuals would have to not only ring Centrelink to advise of changes in their income but also specifically request Centrelink to further reduce their payments to take into account debts already accumulated.
The second piece of advice to avoid a debt, given to 43 per cent of survey respondents, was for families to overestimate their income for the family tax benefit. Of those constituents who did overestimate their income, 68 per cent said the advice did not work. In addition, 42 per cent said that they lost benefits, such as their health care card or their child-care benefit, which they would otherwise have been entitled to. One of my constituents who followed this advice had her FTB payments halved while she was still struggling to pay off her FTB debt from the year before. Another constituent who overestimated her income lost $150 per fortnight. She conveyed to me that she was unable to continue overestimating her income because, she said, `We rely on the extra payment to survive!' Yet another constituent echoed this sentiment, stating, `We need the money on a weekly basis to feed the family.' Other constituents provided feedback on the impact of overestimating their income on additional benefits. One constituent stated that overestimating her income resulted in `lowering the child-care percentage rate, meaning I pay more for child care'. Another stated, `We couldn't afford to lose so much benefit and child care.'
For families in my electorate of Hasluck, the government is clearly out of touch with reality. It believes that most families are in a position to either overestimate their income and receive reduced benefits or opt to receive their benefits in a lump sum at the end of the year. Families who have been advised by Centrelink to do this have said, for example, `I cannot afford the cut in payments' or `I was told to claim no benefit in the year and I would be paid a lump sum at the end of the year. Obviously we should starve until that time.'
The government still does not seem able to comprehend the basic principle of a family assistance payment; that is, it is meant to assist families. The government's deliberate decision to hold off notifying families that they had incurred a debt at the end of the 2000-01 financial year ensured that the majority of families were doomed to receive an FTB debt two years in a row. This ensured that families who were supposed to be receiving family assistance were instead plunged into a cycle of debt from which many have still to recover. Whilst families were still paying off the debts that they had no idea they were accumulating, the government advised them to further reduce their income by receiving reduced benefits or no benefits throughout the year.
As the survey respondents have clearly said, this is just not possible for many families. What are they expected to live on during the year, when they need that additional assistance through the family tax benefit system? The Howard government's family tax benefit system is an unmitigated disaster. For many families, it has not assisted but rather plunged them into debt at a time when Australian households are confronting the highest debt levels in history. It has forced those in Centrelink to divert scarce resources in order to administer this overly complex system and to deal with debt collection instead of doing their job. Families in Hasluck are struggling. I call on the Howard government to waive the debts owed by Hasluck families and to fix the system now.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Centrelink: Debt Recovery</title>,Grievance Debate,9,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—The purpose of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 is to ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover that is provided by insurers prudentially regulated by APRA—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—and to specify minimum standards for medical indemnity cover. The proposals contained in these bills represent part of a package of measures in response to the collapse of UMP in April 2002. This House and this parliament have already passed the Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistance—Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Bill 2002. The purpose of that bill was to appropriate funds for payment in accordance with an indemnity agreement between the Commonwealth and United Medical Protection, UMP, and its wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, AMIL, and to confirm the government's commitments relating to UMP-AMIL.
On 23 October last year, the Prime Minister announced a range of measures, which were said to address rising medical indemnity insurance premiums and which would ensure a viable and ongoing medical indemnity insurance market. In December the parliament considered and passed a package of four bills, including the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002, to which I have earlier referred, which implemented most of these initiatives. These measures included the establishment of an incurred but not reported—IBNR—scheme to assist medical defence organisations, MDOs, with unfunded IBNRs and a High Cost Claims Scheme, under which the Commonwealth will meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims payments greater than $2 million up to the insured amount made by MDOs or insurers.
The bills now before the House deal with the one outstanding element of the package announced by the government on 23 October; namely, that MDOs be brought into a new regulatory framework administered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and be subject to a range of prudential safeguards to mitigate insolvency risks. I state at the outset that these bills are in principle supported by me and by the opposition.
The proposed framework also contains product safeguards to ensure that health practitioners receive continuity of cover. Currently, medical indemnity is largely provided by medical defence organisations, MDOs, to which I have referred. MDOs are not-for-profit mutual organisations that provide discretionary cover to their members in exchange for a subscription payment for membership of the organisation. As MDOs are not contractually obliged to meet the claims of their members, their activities fall outside the definition of `insurance business' in the Insurance Act 1973 and the prudential supervision of APRA. MDOs rely heavily on reinsurance to protect their financial position. Most MDOs have wholly or partially owned insurance company subsidiaries which they use to access the reinsurance market. APRA does have regulatory power over these captive insurers. 
MDOs can raise additional capital under their current structural arrangements by charging increased subscriptions or by making a call to members for an additional amount of money. The tradition in the industry is to make the call on members effective from 1 July of a particular year. Since 1999, four of the main MDOs have been required to make a call on their members for additional funds. There are seven major MDOs in Australia: United Medical Protection, UMP, in provisional liquidation; the Medical Defence Association of Australia; the Medical Indemnity Protection Society; the Medical Defence Association of South Australia; the Medical Defence Association of Western Australia; the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania; and Queensland Doctors Mutual Ltd. While all MDOs write business to some degree across Australia, the home state of the MDO generally provides most members.
I now turn to some of the key measures contained in the bill. From 1 July 2003 only general insurers under a contract of insurance will be able to provide medical indemnity cover for a health care professional. Breach of this requirement carries a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment. Health care professionals are broadly defined to include `any person who provides care, treatment, service, advice or goods in respect of the physical and mental health of a person whether or not for reward'. The definition specifically includes medical practitioners and registered health professionals.
Prudential standards under the Insurance Act 1973 provide that insurers must have capital of at least $5 million. The bill provides for transitional arrangements so that MDOs may apply to APRA for an exemption from the minimum capital requirements until 30 June 2008. In order to obtain an exemption, MDOs must submit a funding plan to APRA. The intent of the funding plan is to ensure that MDOs will be able to meet APRA capital requirements at the expiry of the transitional period. The bill also sets out product standards for medical indemnity insurance contracts. The minimum cover amount is $5 million and/or another amount prescribed by the regulations. Failure to provide such cover constitutes an offence.
The bill draws a distinction between claims-made base cover, where claims are made within the contract period, and incident-occurring base cover, where a claim can be made after the contract has expired provided that the incident occurred during the contract period. If a contract to provide claims-made cover is entered into, comes into effect or is renewed on or after 1 July 2003, the bill provides that an insurer must also offer to provide cover for all past health care incidents for which the health care professional does not have cover or retroactive cover, as it is described.
Insurers are also required to offer extended reporting benefits, ERB, cover, also known as run-off cover, within 28 days of a triggering event. These events include where a health care professional dies, becomes permanently disabled, retires or terminates a contract. ERB cover protects health care professionals from claims in relation to events that occurred before ERB cover commenced for which the person was otherwise uninsured. The bill specifies requirements that must be met in order for offers of retroactive cover and ERB cover to be regarded as complying with the purposes of the act. Significant requirements include that offers must be in writing, must be open for 28 days, must give clear, concise and effective explanation of the feature of the cover and must charge premiums that are reasonable. APRA may issue guidelines for the purpose of assessing whether a premium is reasonable. These guidelines are disallowable instruments. The bill vests responsibility for enforcing product standards for medical indemnity contracts in ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002, which is being considered cognate with the main bill, will require MDOs to provide data to APRA to prevent MDOs with discretionary liabilities from becoming authorised insurers. In order to be an authorised insurer, MDOs will be required to transfer their discretionary liabilities to a separate entity.
Since these bills were tabled in the parliament, they have been the subject of interest so far as the medical defence organisations are concerned and so far as the medical profession is concerned, both for individual practitioners, whether they be general practitioners, procedural practitioners or procedural specialists, and for their respective organisations, whether they be the AMA, the Australian Medical Association, or the Divisions of General Practice. I think it is true and fair to say that the three areas of the bill which drew most attention and consternation from the profession and its various constituent parts and representatives were insurance based contracts—and some of the MDOs had views on the adverse impacts on them of moving to insurance based contracts—the so-called blue sky claims and the so-called run-off cover for death, disability or retirement. For some period of time, the representative organisations have been making submissions to the government to see whether the government would countenance changes to the bill so far as these matters are concerned.
I have had these representations made to me on behalf of the opposition, and my attitude has been to wait and see what response the government makes to the various representations. That is largely because, whilst these are of particular interest to the profession—whether that is a medical defence organisation, an individual practitioner or their respective representative groups—they are not necessarily of great interest to the ordinary consumer. The adverse consequences of getting it wrong, however, do have, and have the potential to have, a great adverse impact on the ordinary consumer either by way of additional cost for a medical service that a consumer has come to depend upon or through the withdrawal of a service because a medical practitioner believes the problems of medical indemnity insurance have become so compelling that the game is no longer worth the candle.
On Wednesday, 19 March—last Wednesday—the government announced a number of minor amendments to the bills as a result of discussions with the medical defence organisations and the doctors concerned about the impact of the bills. The Prime Minister indicated that the amendments the government was proposing to make to its own legislation included the following: to ensure that the five-year transitional relief from the full application of APRA's capital adequacy requirements is extended to the existing cap to the insurers of the medical defence organisations; to make a minor change to the definition of `health care providers' to ensure that it covers former health care providers; to ensure that the compulsory offer requirements for medical indemnity providers for run-off cover do not extend to medical indemnity providers that have stopped writing new policies and are running off their existing liabilities; to enable medical indemnity providers to exclude known incidence from cover in the same way that an insurer would exclude known incidence; and to provide that APRA must make a determination within 30 days of receiving an application for transitional relief from the capital adequacy requirements.
The government also announced that it would commission a study of options to examine the retirement cover issue and increase the level of its financial support for the medical indemnity insurance of obstetricians in rural and regional Australia. The government's amendments announced by the Prime Minister are technical, and the opposition have no objection to them. I have not actually sighted them but I assume the government will progress those in the Senate and, provided they are technically correct, we will support them in that place. The announcement by the Prime Minister of these technical amendments was met with some concern from various medical defence organisations, particularly the smaller medical defence organisations—for example, the medical defence organisation in Tasmania, which had been running strong arguments in respect of the change to insurance contracts—and by what is best described as a muted response from the AMA, which is particularly keen to pursue the blue sky matter.
I will now go to the detail of those three remaining contentious areas. The first is the adverse impact which some of the smaller MDOs see of moving to insurance contracts. While the larger MDOs, representing about 80 per cent of doctors, have broadly accepted the move from discretionary cover to offering insurance contracts, a number of smaller MDOs have strongly argued that the model of discretionary cover better serves their members and that there would be adverse consequences associated with moving to the insurance model proposed by the government. It is true to say that those adverse consequences relate to the perception the smaller medical defence organisations have that they will see work force reductions so far as general practitioners or medical specialists are concerned. It is also true to say that the government has a strong view that there is a need for all in the industry to move to insurance based contracts rather than a model of discretionary cover. The government argues that it was discretionary cover which got UMP into difficulty and we have now got the chance for fundamental and structural reform, so why would we leave that gate open? As I said, the opposition in principle supports the framework, and that is a compelling and strong argument. The worry I have stems from the continual representations I get, particularly from the Tasmanian defence organisation, about their perception of adverse consequences and their perception of the adverse work force implications that it would bring to Tasmania.
The second issue relates to the blue sky claims. There are significant concerns that under the proposal doctors will be personally liable for claims that are settled in excess of the maximum cover provided by their insurance. Under the present discretionary arrangements, cover is uncapped. This means that, if a doctor holds an insurance policy which offers $15 million in cover but a catastrophic injury occurs which exposes the doctor to a payout of more than $15 million, the doctor will be held personally liable for the extra amount. The government's current scheme offers no protection for doctors against this eventuality and may force some doctors to asset strip in order to protect themselves against the consequences of such adverse claims. Other doctors may choose to retire early rather than face the possibility of personal liability for high-cost claims. This is an issue of particular concern, and representations have been made by the Australian Medical Association. When the Prime Minister announced these minor and technical changes last week, which I referred to, this issue was at the peak, so to speak, of the AMA's ongoing representations.
The final issue is the death, disability or retirement cover—or run-off cover, as it is referred to in the trade. Under the bill, after 1 July 2003, death, disability or retirement cover that has not commenced will be deemed to be subject to the new regime. It has been argued—again, by the AMA—that this means that doctors will continue to pay large premiums after retirement. The AMA and the medical defence organisations have given in principle support for a statutory DDR fund—death, disability or retirement cover fund—proposal developed by the Institute of Actuaries. Under this proposal, MDOs would contribute to a fund that would be drawn up to meet DDR claims. While the government has announced that it is prepared to inquire further into this issue, it is as yet unresolved. 
So they are the three contentious issues which remain. It is appropriate for me to indicate to the House the general approach which the opposition proposes to take on these matters within the next few days. Without breaching any confidence, I will also indicate to the House a preliminary conversation I had with Senator Coonan, the minister with responsibility for this bill in the other place. When the government's announcement was made last week, many of the smaller medical defence organisations who object to the road that the government is going down urged upon the opposition and, I assume, the government and other members of the Senate that the bill be referred to a Senate committee to enable those three issues—that is, moving to the insurance contracts scheme, the blue sky claims and the run-off cover—to be considered. There are some attractions in that, because that would enable those three contentious issues to be the subject of a public conversation or a public debate. The difficulty the government has with that approach is that any referral to a committee in the last week of March means that the legislation will not be passed now but will come back to the parliament in the middle of May during budget week, and it is unlikely that the parliament would get to the bill during budget week. That provides a difficulty for the medical defence organisations, because at the moment they are in the process of negotiating with their reinsurers for the purpose of making a call upon their members effective from 1 July this year. So, if the reinsurers are uncertain about the state of the legislative framework, that obviously has a potential material impact on the level of the reinsurance and the level of the premiums.
So my conversation with Senator Coonan earlier today proceeded on this basis. The government, as I understand it, is prepared to consider some form of inquiry—a Senate inquiry or some other appropriate inquiry—into the blue sky issue and the death, disability or retirement cover issue. I think it is also fair to say—and this is not an attempt to verbal Senator Coonan; as I said to her when we last spoke, we will no doubt have more conversations this week to try to resolve this matter—that the government is happy to contemplate removing the death, disability or retirement cover aspects from the legislation to provide a potential vehicle for a Senate inquiry into that matter. 
Clearly, the suggestion to refer the bill to a Senate committee—and the prospect that the bill might not be passed this week—has caused the government to respond positively on the issue of an inquiry into the death, disability or retirement cover and the blue sky claims, and I regard that as a helpful contribution. My impression is that the government is very adverse to moving in any way on the insurance contracts based system and regards it very much as a fundamental part of the structural framework, and there is a strength to that argument—if this contributed to UMP's difficulty, why would you leave that opportunity open? The worry I have is that I am not sure the government is responding positively enough or with enough alacrity to the representations made, particularly from Tasmania, which go to the adverse work force implications that will be caused as a consequence of going down this road.
Whilst I have said that we support the framework in principle—and I am pleased that it is pretty clear that, with a bit more conversation between the government and the opposition in the course of the next couple of days, we will see some agreed formal vehicle for looking in greater detail at the blue sky claims and the death, disability or retirement cover—I would like to see the government respond more positively to the representations that have been made, particularly from Tasmania, so far as those adverse work force implications are concerned. Whilst I have said that we support these measures in principle and support the flagged government amendments, I think there is a bit of water to go under the bridge in the course of the next couple of days before we see whether the parliament or the Senate can agree to the passage of these bills in the course of this week.
I should also say that I have had very strong representations from the major medical defence organisations—no doubt as the government has—who cover, as I said earlier, about 80 per cent of the trade. They strongly make the point that if the reinsurers do not by the end of this week see legislative certainty then that will cause very grave difficulty. That is a very powerful point which the parliament will need to consider very carefully. That is a summary of the framework of the legislation and a summary of what I regard as the three remaining contentious areas. The government has, to its credit, given ground by way of flagging a further look at those two areas of difficulty, and that will please the MDOs generally and please the AMA. It also pleases me, but I think we need to do a bit more work on what adverse implications may arise from moving to insurance contracts before we can bring this matter to complete finality in the course of this week.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—Obviously I am not privy to the discussions that the shadow minister had with Minister Coonan earlier this day, but I will agree with him that this has been one of the most contentious issues with the medical profession, at the electoral level, that any of us have had to deal with for quite some time. I doubt that the local AMA in any electorate has not had several meetings with members of parliament to talk about this issue. Therefore, I propose to speak about the purpose of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002, as I really cannot comment on those issues raised by the member for Perth—but I hope to be able to do so by the end of the week.
—It was late in the day.
—Thank you. The purpose of this bill, as set out in section 2.3, is (a) to ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover provided by properly regulated, and therefore viable, insurers and (b) to specify minimum standards for that cover. This bill is important to health care professionals for the security of viable medical indemnity, to patients for when things do go wrong and to the community so that we can be confident in the continuation of our health care services. As everybody in this House knows, there have been ongoing problems with the provision of medical indemnity, including the financial position of the major Australian provider, UMP, and its wholly owned subsidiary, AMIL. Those problems and uncertainties are still endangering the very provision of our health care services, particularly in high-risk fields such as obstetrics.
The legislation is one part of the Howard government's strategy to tackle these problems and uncertainties by ensuring that medical indemnity insurance is made a viable commercial product with safeguards to mitigate insolvency risks. But, before we can discuss this legislation further, we need to look at how medical indemnity is currently provided, how it is different from other forms of insurance and why this legislation is needed. Health professionals, like other businesses, need general insurance cover. But as well as that they need insurance to protect them in case of litigation for claimed error, negligence or misconduct arising from actions that could be recent or which could have occurred many years earlier. One problem is that there is a longer than usual time frame for litigation in such matters, which makes it difficult to calculate future risk and costs. Medical indemnity therefore differs from other types of insurance. In fact, as it is currently structured, it is not actually insurance and it is not provided by insurance companies.
In Australia, medical indemnity cover is provided primarily by medical defence organisations, or MDOs, which are not-for-profit mutual organisations which offer discretionary indemnity cover to members, who pay an annual subscription. Note the word `discretionary'. In all other forms of insurance, there is a contract which obligates the insurance company to honour the policy when an insured event takes place. There is no such contract with MDOs. The discretionary indemnity provided by the MDOs gives the MDOs absolute discretion to deny cover in any circumstances at all and bestows on the member no legal right to be indemnified. Even though MDOs very rarely deny claims, the existence of discretionary cover has two important legal implications for doctors, and therefore the community. The first legal implication is lack of prudential regulation and the second is certainty of indemnification. This bill addresses both those problems.
Let us look at the first of the problems: the lack of prudential regulation. While MDOs provide what appears to be an insurance product, they are not themselves authorised insurance companies. Instead, they all have subsidiary, or captive, insurance companies which have been established primarily to provide reinsurance cover to the parent MDO. This means that, unlike other insurers, the MDO customers are not currently protected by the body of consumer protection law which relates specifically to insurance, such as the Insurance Contracts Act and the Financial Sector Reform Act. The discretionary cover provided by the MDOs is not regulated by APRA and is not subject to the prudential standards applicable to general insurers. While a captive reinsurer may be covered by APRA and prudential regulation and standards, the MDOs avoid prudential regulations because they are not insurance companies in the technical sense of the word. With this bill, we are closing that loophole.
The key elements of prudential regulation are minimum benchmarks in three areas: (1) capital, (2) corporate governance and (3) risk management. A financial institution must maintain minimum standards in these three areas in order, firstly, to obtain and, secondly, to continue to hold a licence to operate as such. You might ask why such regulation is necessary for MDOs. It is not for reasons of bureaucracy; it is for reasons of certainty and viability. It is so our health care professionals can be certain of continuing indemnity cover and, therefore, we, the community, can be certain that those professional services will continue to be available to us. It has been recognised internationally that prudential regulation provides a high level of certainty that any financial commitments made by those regulated institutions can and will be met.
Despite legislation passed last year regarding IBNRs, there still remains doubt as to the consistency of liability recognition practices across the industry. This affects risk management and the amount of capital reserves required. IBNRs are `incurred but not reported' incidents—that is, the error or incident has occurred but has not been reported yet to the MDO. In fact, the patient concerned might not take action for some years, or he or she might take no action at all. But MDOs, like insurance companies, should be required by accounting standards to recognise their liability so that appropriate provisioning can be made for the inherent risk. Currently, the lack of prudential regulation and reliable reporting of IBNR liabilities leaves medical practitioners underinformed and vulnerable regarding the financial viability of their cover provider. 
The second legal implication I mentioned for the current discretionary cover is certainty of indemnification. Unlike insurance contracts, discretionary products are not subject to consumer protection and there is no legal obligation on the MDO to indemnify the member. This bill is aimed at overcoming these problems. Under clause 10, medical indemnity cover can only be provided by general insurers and only under contracts of insurance, thereby ensuring prudential regulation, proper accounting and certainty of indemnity.
MDOs who wish to continue as providers of medical indemnity will need to become authorised insurers and operate in compliance with prudential standards developed by APRA, who, under clause 28, is responsible for enforcing compliance. For instance, one of the requirements to be met will be prudential standard GPS 110, which requires that insurers hold a minimum of $5 million capital. Because the government recognises that some MDOs may not be in a position to comply immediately with the prudential standards, part 2, division 2 of the bill provides transitional arrangements during the period from commencement of the act on 1 July 2003 until 30 June 2008. That is a transition period of almost five years. During that time, for example, an MDO can apply to APRA for an exemption from the $5 million capital requirement.
For a number of years, there have been concerns about the viability of medical indemnity providers in Australia and particularly about the adequacy of their reserves to meet future claims. In October last year, the Prime Minister announced a package of measures to address those problems, and this bill is part of that package. Medical indemnity is not just a problem for doctors; it is a major public issue because it affects not just the cost but also the very availability of essential health services. We need this bill to ensure that our health care professionals have access to reliable cover that meets minimum standards and is provided by properly regulated insurers, so those professionals can get on with the job of keeping us healthy. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I rise today to speak on the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. These bills constitute a portion of the government's response to the crisis in medical indemnity insurance caused by the collapse of United Medical Protection. United Medical Protection was the largest medical defence organisation in Australia and provided a form of protection to medical practitioners. Issues of medical indemnity may appear to be of little interest to the broader community. If viewed in a very narrow case, that may be true. But the importance of issues surrounding the provision of medical indemnity to practitioners have had huge flow-on effects, causing great concern and even fear that critical medical services, such as obstetric services, will no longer be available. Since the collapse of United Medical Protection in April 2002, issues of medical indemnity and the impact that they have upon the availability of medical services have been of central importance to many communities, individuals and the medical profession, most particularly in rural communities.
The collapse of UMP has caused the government to act by constructing a system of regulated and commercially viable medical indemnity insurers from the existing system of medical defence organisations. These medical defence organisations or MDOs operated as not-for-profit mutual organisations that provided discretionary cover to medical professionals via conscription; that is, as the MDOs were not bound to meet the claims of their members but could discern which claims they did or did not meet, they fell outside the normal definition of insurance and, therefore, were outside the prorogues of most regulations.
MDOs relied heavily on reinsurance to protect their financial positions. Most MDOs have wholly or partially owned insurance company subsidiaries which they use to access reinsurance markets. What that means in layman's terms is that, to reinsure, you have to lay off your bet. You have to actually understand what you are covering and what you are risking. For many years, MDOs have undervalued and underassessed their actual exposure to risk. Suddenly we have had a call upon their reserves, and things have fallen over. I think there was a belief in the medical profession that doctors were above reproof in some ways, would never be found out and would never have a claim against them. Sadly, that is not the case. These schemes have been underfunded, and now we have come to the situation we are in.
Already there has been legislation to provide for an incurred but not reported scheme to assist MDOs with incurred but not reported costs. What does that mean? It means that you could have a claim that somebody has not made for 25 years and so you have not thought about insuring for that risk. Suddenly you have someone come to court and say, `This doctor performed this terrible atrocity 25 years ago; now cough up,' and we have literally had that happen in the courts in recent history. So there has been this unrealised liability sitting out there in the ether waiting to happen, and in some respects one of the downfalls of this scheme is that we still do not recognise that risk. In addition to this, there is a scheme to assist medical defence organisations with high-cost claims through Commonwealth provision of 50 per cent of the cost of claims over $2 million and up to the insured amount. That might be all right but we are not sure how this will all play out. So currently there are many issues still not adequately covered by this bill.
The bills currently before us seek to put in place a new regulatory framework, overseen by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, that includes a number of prudential requirements and safeguards. These should be welcomed. I have had a longstanding interest in the work undertaken by APRA in prudential requirements that apply more broadly to the insurance industry—and, again, more broadly, to deposit takers, APRA has coverage of the whole financial sector. These are issues that if not handled properly could have a massive and indeed devastating impact upon people's lives.
I have raised a number of times the terrible circumstances of Nick and Millie, two people who live in my electorate, and the failure of prudential regulations and the subsequent collapse of HIH that has harmed them greatly. Essentially, the builder they had, Avonwood, went under. They were given an assurance that that was okay because they had building guarantee insurance that would cover the loss or the collapse of the builder. Lo and behold, the insurance company of course was HIH. So, despite them being covered, they were simply told, `Well, we're terribly sorry; now your builder has collapsed and so has your insurance company, you have no cover.' This is the kind of impact that poor insurance has on people. It is not just something in the ether that others do not need to talk about. What we now have is Nick and Millie paying off a house that they will never own, because they will never actually be able to build it because there is no insurance cover for it. But they have taken out a housing loan, so they have to pay the bank back, but they will never build their house. This is why we should all have interest in what goes on in regulation and insurance companies. They have saved all their lives for the dream home that they will never have.
So, far from being some technical, arcane type of regulation that is distant from the broader community, this legislation is very important. It affects the availability of medical services to thousands and even millions of Australians. The availability of medical indemnity insurance that provides an appropriate level of coverage, is appropriately priced and is prudentially run is a very important component of the health industry. Doctors need to be able to obtain coverage and patients need to feel that if there is a significant problem with the treatment they receive—if that treatment is negligent, I should add—then the organisation providing coverage has sufficient assets to cover possible payouts. There has been a lot of criticism of the scheme put forward by the government that the scheme will actually cause even more doctors to fall out because they just will not be able to meet the payments. In an article in the Age on Thursday, 20 March, Josh Gordon and David Wroe stated:
In a dire forecast that angered professionals already struggling to meet their insurance bills, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority claimed insurance companies had been massively under-charging rather than profiteering.
“For every $100 of premium received for professional indemnity insurance, the industry is paying out over $145 in claims and expenses,” APRA head of enforcement Darryl Roberts said.
No bookie on the Melbourne racetrack would let you get away with those sorts of odds. Mr Roberts continued:
“This level of underwriting loss is simply unsustainable and must be reversed if the insurance industry is to remain adequately capitalised into the future.”
So doctors are fearing that instead of costs coming down their insurance premiums will go up.
In recent times I have had the joy of giving birth to two children. I have gone through the private system; I am quite happy to state that. But on both occasions I paid over $1,000 in excess to my obstetrician to cover her insurance liability. I can afford to do that; the majority of Australians cannot. That was on top of my full private health insurance and the Medicare rebate, so it was $1,000 predominantly to pay her medical insurance. In an article in the Herald Sun on Sunday, 16 March, Dr Mukesh Haikerwal said:
“Patients are already having problems accessing GPs.
“Increased uncertainty will lead us to reconsider our careers all together.”
So, yes, we have a crisis with GPs and bulk-billing as it is. Putting up their medical insurance is just going to make it harder and harder and put a greater drain on the system, predominantly in those specialised areas where they are paying phenomenal amounts of professional indemnity already.
The long-term security of the industry requires that medical indemnity providers are financially stable enough and have sufficient reserves to cover liabilities—that they actually understand the risks that they are underwriting. To be honest, it would be an actuarial nightmare to actually calculate these risks. However, in the transition of the industry from subscription based, not-for-profit mutual organisations to providers that are commercially sound, with appropriate prudential reserves, it is also critically important that the industry is brought along with the changes. This is too important an area to neglect the significant transitory changes that are required of medical defence organisations. It is for this reason that I have significant concerns that some articles in the press over the last couple of months indicate a high level of concern amongst some medical defence organisations. Last Thursday's Age had an article on this issue. I quote again from an article by Josh Gordon and David Wroe:
AMA president Kerryn Phelps said the Government's prudential regulation plan was a step forward, but the legislation ignored key problems such as how to indemnify doctors who retired, died or were disabled.
We are not always going to agree with Dr Phelps, but in this instance I think she has it right and makes a couple of good points. There are two difficulties that are faced in providing answers to the problems she has identified. It is a very complex area of insurance, where the possible claims against the insurer can eventuate well after the event occurred and the practitioner has left the practice—or indeed, may have died. This difficulty was also highlighted, by Dr Haikerwal, in the Herald Sun on Sunday, 16 February. Dr Haikerwal said:
... major problems with the federal scheme included a cap on insurance payouts, which could leave GPs personally liable to cover outstanding costs, and the lack of “run-off' insurance coverage to protect doctors against claims that arise while they are no longer practicing.
Adults and minors have three and 25 years respectively to lodge a medical negligence claim.
“We have had situations where a doctor's estate has been sued years after they have died.”
The inability of the government to appropriately address the legitimate concerns of doctors weakens this legislation. The movement of the medical indemnity industry from a nonregulated membership system to a regulated environment which also ensures there are sufficient capital reserves is an important step. This bill requires a provider of medical indemnity to have appropriate reserves of $5 million by 2008, with the period between July 2003 and 2008 being a transition period to allow providers to accumulate those reserves. There is the need for these insurance companies to have adequate capital reserves.
The requirement to have oversight by APRA will be yet another drain on that regulator. While I welcome regulatory oversight of the industry, we must ensure that with that come sufficient resources to an already underresourced regulator in APRA. With the HIH debacle, we saw the effect of a regulator that did not so much regulate as keep an eye on the industry. The actual stated approach of APRA is `soft touch regulation'. That means that it relies heavily on the reporting of these companies. Unfortunately, HIH taught us that we cannot trust companies to report appropriately. I do not mean that that applies across the board but, if there is a rogue in there, if you are relying on their own reporting, it is very hard for them to be found out. If APRA is to take on yet another very complex area of regulation, it should be adequately resourced to do so— and that means not just taking on personnel but taking on personnel who actually understand a very complex area of the industry. So, in transferring this further mandate to APRA, it is essential that APRA be appropriately resourced. You simply cannot regulate an industry as complex as the insurance industry, particularly such a complex component of it as medical indemnity, without sufficient staff and a willingness to act when required. The great failure of APRA in relation to HIH was its unwillingness to intervene when an industry member was so obviously in trouble. That is a circumstance that we should not tolerate from a regulator, and it must not occur because of insufficient resources.
I do not oppose this legislation, but I stand in this place feeling that the government could have done significantly better. The medical profession should have been brought along in the process. We should not be facing the prospect of the failure of additional providers, as reported in the media. Country communities in particular are already underresourced in relation to medical practitioners. This bill should not put another drain on those already stretched resources. The government should have acted earlier regarding medical defence organisations and should not have waited until the collapse of the largest provider with a $400 million shortfall. We saw the government's failure in respect of the HIH collapse; again the government, as well as its regulator, did not act soon enough. Appropriate oversight of an industry as complex as the medical indemnity industry relies upon a well-resourced and active regulator and a government that backs it up with attention to the industry and its stability.
I would like to quote again, this time from an article in the Australian Financial Review of Thursday, 27 February. The article states:
Australia's peak doctors' group yesterday described the federal government's proposed medical indemnity reforms as a complete mess, saying they would only exacerbate the shortage of GPs and specialists.
Australian Medical Association President Kerryn Phelps said the changes, which come into effect on July 1, would actually increase costs for doctors and their patients.
“There may well be a reduction in services, particularly in the high-risk procedural areas, and the second thing is that [patients] will have to pay more for those services when they can find them,” she said.
“We already have towns around the country which don't have an obstetrician and women are having to travel distances, and sometimes long distances.”
Again, obviously the doctors are speaking from their own perspective, and about their own issues. But I think it highlights that, if we are going to introduce a raft of legislation that is meant to be assisting a profession to achieve coverage and be able to continue in their professional practice, we should not have the key lobby group speaking out against the proposed legislation. While I welcome the steps taken in this bill, I do not believe it has been thought through enough, and I think the government could have done significantly better.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I listened with interest to the previous speaker, the member for Chisholm, and I welcome her thoughtful contribution. This area of medical insurance and indemnity confronting doctors and specialists is something that is of concern to everybody. Our whole community was shocked to find that, despite announcements by the chairman of UMP that everything was okay—that they were handling their claims and that doctors and the community need not worry—within a few weeks the company folded and the government had to bail it out.
Part of the problem was that UMP was not a proper insurance company and some of the factors that had to be considered in looking at the changes that had occurred in medicine were not taken into account. One factor, for instance, was the long-term prospect of claims—claims that may be made 25 years after an operation or procedure has been performed on a patient. That long delay is something that most doctors did not think would apply to them. They had considered a period of five or 10 years to be reasonable for seeing whether any untoward side effects of a particular treatment or procedure might occur, and they had considered that that would be covered by insurance. To find that something could be stretched out for 25 years and a court could then find that the doctor was indeed liable or that insurance needed to be paid was a surprise to the industry.
The second factor in the whole medical area was the size of the claims that were being settled by courts. The massive amounts being paid out by way of compensation were unexpected and, in the eyes of many in the public, unwarranted. It seemed that trivial matters were receiving large payouts, and that was a cost to UMP and to medical insurers. So gradually there was an attrition in the resources such companies had. They could not cover the claims that were being made and the contributions or premiums being paid by the medical profession were not adequate for them to predict a reliable future. Medical defence organisations, of which UMP was one, came under the microscope, and on 31 May last year the Prime Minister announced the key elements of the government's strategy for ensuring that medical indemnity insurance be made a viable commercial product and that proper assessment of the risk take place, along with proper prudential management and proper assessment of what the likely payouts would be. This legislation is part of that package.
There have been complaints by some that the legislation does not go far enough—or that it goes too far. I think the government has got it about right. I think that Senator Helen Coonan, after a great deal of careful examination and a great deal of negotiation, has got it right. She has listened carefully to all sides of the argument. There may be some areas in which we will have continuing interest and in which there may be the prospect of further change, but I believe it behoves the parliament to pass this legislation. 
On 23 October, the Prime Minister announced further details of the government's strategy. In that announcement the Prime Minister said that, in respect of prudential supervision of medical defence organisations, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, would be administering the prudential arrangements. So we have a process for these organisations that I think most of the community felt were just like any other insurance companies, although in fact they were not. These organisations that doctors pay premiums to are now going to be gathered into a proper process where they are under APRA's supervision and where they will be required to meet certain prudential standards.
The changes proposed in these two pieces of legislation are interesting. The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 will require medical defence organisations to operate prudentially on a sound footing, as I have said. They will have to provide certain information about their products to their members—that is, the medical profession. They will incur some additional costs in order to operate prudentially and on a sound basis. For example, they may have to raise additional capital to meet their prudential requirements. That is a matter of contention with doctors because, as we will see shortly, the costs involved in operating a medical practice are very substantial compared to what a doctor or specialist receives in return. It has been said, therefore, that additional costs for doctors will force some out of the medical profession and will force others to restrict the types of services they give.
As I have mentioned previously in the House, my electorate is close to the great Westmead Hospital. When speaking to specialists there, particularly those involved in neurological or obstetric services, I have been told that some of those specialists are facing huge insurance bills—$100,000 to $120,000 a year before they even start up. They then have the costs of their surgeries, their rooms and their staff and all the other costs that go with practices. Insurance alone was looking to be a horrific factor which might drive many out of medicine. That would have been a tragic loss of brains and skill that might otherwise have benefited the Australian community.
These bills bring medical defence organisations under the coverage of APRA, where they will be properly supervised and where they will have to fulfil certain conditions. These conditions have been set over a period of time, with discussions between the medical profession, the insurers, the medical defence organisations and the government. There are two important points that really do apply to discretionary cover. They have important implications for members of medical defence organisations. Previously, there was a lack of prudential regulation. The key elements of prudential regulation are minimum standards for the amount of capital that an organisation must hold—the corporate governance and risk management. We heard something today about HIH, and that is exactly the thing: the process of risk management and corporate governance has been lacking, and that must be applied to medical defence organisations.
The other point is that a financial institution must maintain certain practices in order to obtain and continue to hold a licence to operate. That is a general insurance principle. Medical defence organisations rarely exercise a discretion against a claim for indemnification, and they lack prudential regulation and reliable, transparent public reporting. Those have been some of the shortcomings of the system up to this point.
Another shortcoming in the system that has existed up to this point is that discretionary cover provides uncertainty to doctors regarding the extent to which a claim is going to be covered, should it be made. The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 will address issues that relate to the outline of the medical indemnity market. The intent is to ensure that providers of medical indemnity cover are subject to appropriate prudential supervision. The bill provides for transitional arrangements. There will be a five-year period in which medical defence organisations can get their houses in order. So it is not going to happen overnight, but the process is to move towards that point. The government's intention is to give these organisations a chance to change but, at the same time, to be prepared to be flexible enough to meet some of the issues that have been raised in the House today that need to be assessed. This bill also provides for minimum product standards for medical indemnity in insurance contracts.
The main purpose of some of the consequential amendments in the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 is to require medical defence organisations to provide data to APRA; that is, APRA will have access to their books and to the processes they are using. That process applies to all general insurance, and it is going to apply here. APRA will have the power to inspect, to take extracts from and to make copies of the books, accounts and other documents—perfectly reasonable stuff.
The main bill, the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002, sets the framework for the changes that were announced in May last year by the Prime Minister, the details of which were finalised in, I believe, October last year. Some of the reasons for these changes are interesting. The report of Trowbridge Consulting of November 2001 noted:
As medical defence organisations are not insurers, they have not been subject to the same accounting and reporting requirements as insurers. MDOs need to comply with the usual company accounting standards but do not need to comply with the sections of the act that apply to general insurers. This has led to a variety of accounting practices in relation to the reporting of incurred but not reported claims and full insurance disclosure of known claims liabilities. Liabilities for known reported claims have always been reported in medical defence organisations' balance sheets. However, there has been inconsistency in reporting the incurred but not reported claims between the medical defence organisations, with some incurred but not reported claims on their balance sheets, others disclosing it in a note of the accounts and others not disclosing it at all.
There we see that there is an inconsistent approach to prudential management.
The Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council stated, that in their opinion, one of the reasons that the medical defence organisation industry had experienced financial difficulty was that it had not been subject to the same prudential scrutiny as insurers and that the difficulties faced by UMP in particular were of a kind which might well have been identified and acted upon earlier had there been a regulatory regime in place. The council also stated that some of the key problems of competitive underpricing of products and the failure to adequately reserve potential liabilities were likely to have been addressed at an earlier stage. That is absolutely right; nobody could argue with that.
Under the Insurance Act there is a requirement for a rigorous prudential regulatory regime. APRA must give authorisation for a body corporate to carry on insuring. They must approve it, ensuring that the standards of conduct are set and that the prudential supervision is of a certain standard. General insurers have for years been used to this. APRA is the approved authority, and an organisation must have an APRA approved actuary and auditing process. Certain standards of conduct, including ensuring that all those involved are `fit and proper persons', are set down. A minimum assets requirement is placed on insurers, and they must have funds of a set level in reserve. All of this has been calculated and laid down, and that is part of this legislation that the House is dealing with tonight. The clauses of the legislation spell out the need for prudential requirements one after another. The standards of minimum cover and offers for retroactive and run-off cover are there, and the legislation fits together as a package.
In conclusion, I want to refer to comments made recently by Dr Kerryn Phelps about some of the concerns that the AMA have. To my mind, they are not matters that should delay the passage of this legislation. The government needs to get it through. If there are shortcomings identified over a period of time or factors which need further amendment, the government can deal with them, but we need certainty in place. We do not need the Senate playing games and delaying things, and I do not think the intention of the opposition is to cause that to occur. We need to have the government's proposals out there, and we need certainty for the medical profession, whether we are talking about specialists or general practitioners.
Regarding the comments by Dr Phelps, I have noted that she has asked the government to extend its high-claim subsidy to 100 per cent of the so-called blue sky liability for the amount of claim above $15 million. Dr Phelps says $15 million is an extraordinary claim. Yes it is, but in this day and age I consider that we would be unwise not to consider it. Dr Phelps says that the massive and unpredictable future care costs for the severely disabled need to be assessed. I notice that she also says that the AMA recommends a community funded, nationally coordinated medical accident care and rehabilitation scheme for patients severely injured as a result of medical accident. That needs to be examined, but this bill should proceed.
Dr Phelps says that the biggest sticking point could be the proposed levy on doctors. Dr Phelps outlines some of the costs of running a practice. They are very interesting. If one looks at the value of bulk-billing and the cost of insurance, it must be a matter of concern to general practitioners. Dr Phelps has said that she does not believe that doctors can contemplate a premium or levy that will provide a scheme which can be expanded to cover 100 per cent of claims above the insurable cap, which is $15 million, or that they can cover the long-term care and rehabilitation and the tort law reform that is necessary. But, all in all, the AMA strongly agrees and encourages the government to proceed. I am pleased that that is the case. The government should proceed. I do not believe that the opposition has indicated that it will be obstructive, but it is also seeking to get a reasonable result from this process with the prospect of future changes—perhaps those outlined by Dr Phelps—as time transpires.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I rise today to speak on the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. It is a rare occasion in this chamber when one follows the member for Mitchell and is in a situation where one finds oneself in some agreement. As the shadow minister for health, the member for Perth, said earlier, Labor do support this bill, although we do think that through a limited process to be negotiated, hopefully in the other place and without holding this up, we may be able to see some changes which would be to the benefit of the system overall. I certainly take on board his comments about other things that may need to be done in the future.
The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 seeks to put in place key regulatory requirements to ensure providers of medical indemnity insurance meet the prudential regulatory requirements that are imposed upon other providers of general insurance in Australia. In addition, the bill states that medical indemnity insurance contracts must have certain key attributes so that health care professionals have access to insurance policies that provide complete coverage. In plain English, the problem is that medical defence organisations have not been subject to the same regulatory requirements as other general insurers, particularly in relation to accounting and reporting standards. It has been suggested by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council that this is, in part, at least one of the reasons for the current financial difficulties being experienced by medical indemnity insurers. Medical defence organisations are not required to comply with the Insurance Act 1973, which contains a rigorous prudential regulatory regime. 
Prompted by the appointment of a provisional liquidator to the country's largest medical defence organisation, UMP insurance, in May 2002, this bill forms part of the government's package of reforms announced in October 2002. Presently, medical defence organisations provide cover on a discretionary basis. This entitles a member to seek indemnification from an MDO; however, the member has no legal right to be indemnified under the current arrangements. This discretionary arrangement has resulted in some uncertainty for doctors on the extent to which a claim for indemnity will be met. In essence, the current situation means that unlimited cover is limited to the capital available to the medical defence organisation to which a member belongs. Clearly, the current situation leaves doctors in a vulnerable position should their medical defence organisation be forced into liquidation.
Moreover, the continuing increases to premiums could lead to on-flow costs to patients, with doctors increasing their fees to subsidise escalating insurance premiums. Insurance companies are finding it increasingly difficult to provide affordable medical indemnity cover at a cost that is financially sustainable for their companies. In the case of medical indemnity cover, a long period of time can elapse between an adverse incident taking place and the point at which a claim is made against the provider, so insurers face difficulty in deciding how much to set aside to meet claims. This poses a much higher risk to consumers than some other forms of insurance because the consumer cannot be sure what the financial position of the provider is likely to be at the time the claim is lodged. Medical practitioners and patients need to have a reasonable degree of certainty that their claims will be met.
This crisis forms part of the broader insurance crisis that Australia is currently experiencing. Unless insurance is available to doctors at affordable levels there will be further impact on the numbers of doctors prepared to offer bulk-billing facilities, resulting in even fewer patients having access to primary and preventative health care services. The bill provides for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to have general administration of the parts of the bill related to their responsibilities. The bill is expected to have only a marginal financial impact on APRA and ASIC.
In 1991 the federal Labor government established a review of the professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals. Chaired by Fiona Tito, it was responsible for examining the arrangements relating to professional indemnity and experience with compensation for medical misadventure. Completed at the end of 1995 and released publicly in January 1996, the report and its recommendations remained largely ignored by the then federal Liberal government. Leading up to the last federal election, Labor again raised the issue of medical indemnity and identified areas in need of reform. The Howard government was reluctant to address the issue until after the election. However, a medical indemnity insurance summit was announced on 19 December 2001 and was finally convened in April 2002. The government saw itself at this time as a facilitator, with the expectation that the states, territories, insurers, doctors and patient groups would formulate suggestions for significant policy changes and reform.
The problem was explicitly drawn to the attention of the government when UMP, one of the largest providers of medical indemnity cover, declared its intent to enter into provisional liquidation if there were not government intervention and assistance. This led to much uncertainty and distress to health care providers, who threatened to cease providing services until the issue was resolved and assurances were given by the government that they would be covered in the event of a claim against them. This crisis has led to the current package of reforms.
It is recognised that medical indemnity reform is critical to maintain adequate health services for the Australian community and that the medical system is being crippled currently by escalating premiums. These high premiums may deter doctors from entering high-risk specialties such as obstetrics and neurosurgery. Additionally, it could cause a further decline in doctors prepared to bulk-bill, as they will require up-front fee paying patients to maintain their practices in a financially sound manner. The bill draws providers of medical indemnity cover under the regulatory arrangements contained within the Insurance Act 1973, which contains a rigorous prudential regulatory regime. The bill further states that insurance contracts will be required to meet minimum standards to ensure full protection for medical practitioners in the event that claims are made against them.
The contribution that the government is proposing with regard to high-risk areas such as obstetrics, neurosurgery and GP proceduralists who undertake Medicare billable procedures is supported by the opposition as it appears appropriate, given that it is structured on risk rather than on the income of doctors. Additionally, we welcome the extension of the existing guarantee to United Medical Protection and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd to 31 December 2003 as we have been lobbying for this action. The bill also includes transitional provisions allowing providers of medical insurance cover time to comply with prudential standards relating to minimum capital requirements. The prudential standard GPS 110 requires that insurers hold a minimum of $5 million in capital at the point of start up. However, the transitional provisions in this bill will give MDOs until July 2008 to acquire the capital.
Generally, we welcome the government's medical indemnity reform package and recognise that these reforms are critical in the continuing battle to provide accessible and affordable health services to all Australians. However, it must be articulated that there exists a real risk that these reforms will see the cost of health care rise. The reform package addresses short-term measures that will stabilise the exponentially increasing costs of premiums but it does not provide a long-term solution to the problem. The package as it exists does not address the professional indemnity needs of other health care professionals—midwives, for example—who are facing their own indemnity crisis which could result in a further withdrawal of services. Midwifery education is at risk because universities are unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for student midwives and an ageing midwifery work force.
The package of reforms also fails to address the concerns of private hospitals. Private hospitals are facing rising premiums also and are contemplating the introduction of a gap fee, payable by patients, to cover the increased premiums. In light of the current increases in private health insurance premiums, this gap fee will be another blow to sick Australians.
We continue to support the call for the Howard government to bring down the costs of medical indemnity premiums by: assuming a leadership role in the national coordination of reforms necessary to state and territory laws with the aim of uniformity in tort law reforms; requiring mandatory reporting of negligence claims and national data collection on health care negligence cases to assess where major problems lie; considering the implementation of a national scheme to ensure that the long-term care and rehabilitation needs of catastrophically injured Australians are met; playing a much more active role in keeping reinsurance costs down by representing medical defence organisations in negotiations with reinsurers; and asking the ACCC to ensure that, whatever changes occur in medical indemnity insurance, no unfair or unreasonable costs flow on to patients for the provision of their health care.
There is much that is good in the reform package; however, there are technical issues that must still be addressed. Medical services to the Australian community will be threatened if we do not have a sustainable medical work force to provide them, and the high premiums may deter people from entering the health professions. Unless insurance is available to doctors at affordable levels, there will be a further impact on the number of doctors prepared to offer bulk-billing, resulting in less access to primary and preventive health care for Australians. Older patients require more time and doctors may find it difficult to sustain their practices with high numbers of Medicare patients and high insurance premiums. The current hospital system cannot bear any more pressure from patients choosing to attend casualty departments rather than pay up front to see their own GPs.
Labor supports the bill as a short-term solution to a serious crisis but stresses the need for further long-term solutions. The effect of expensive premiums on the patient and the neglect of other health care professionals must be addressed urgently. In light of the recent bulk-billing crisis and the increases in private health insurance premiums, it is essential that the costs of premiums not be passed on to the sickest Australian taxpayers. Labor does not oppose the idea of a levy on medical practitioners, as long as it is not exploitative, unfair or unreasonable, and believes that the Commonwealth should give the ACCC special powers to ensure that there is no on-flow of costs to patients as a result of the levy. The Howard government must assure the Australian public that they will not be adversely affected by the regulation of medical defence organisations. The issue of medical indemnity reform affects not just doctors; it affects current and future users of the health system as well. 
I wish to state clearly that Labor is committed to ensuring the accessibility and affordability of health care for all Australians. This bill will go some of the way to addressing the uncertainty that currently exists for medical practitioners, but we want to ensure that the beneficiaries of this package are not simply insurance companies, reinsurers or medical defence organisations. A strong role for the ACCC in this reform cannot be emphasised enough.
We do not wish to see unfair or unreasonable costs or price exploitation that will ultimately fall on Australia's sickest taxpayers as a result of medical indemnity insurance premiums or levies on doctors. We also hope that there are further reforms that include other health professions and private hospitals and that take into consideration the real difficulty some smaller MDOs may have in meeting the strict prudential requirements. Notwithstanding that, and following on from the earlier comments of the shadow minister, the opposition support the bill as it stands.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-03-24,"—I wholeheartedly support the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. These bills will ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover provided by properly regulated insurers. They also outline minimum standards for medical indemnity cover into the future. I welcome the proposals by the Howard-Anderson government to address the many complicated issues associated with medical indemnity and public liability across Australia. These proposals before the House will assist in reassuring doctors and specialists that they can continue to practise in the knowledge that they are adequately covered should problems arise.
After a disturbing year or more and the many challenges associated with the collapse of United Medical Protection, like the rest of the members on this side of the House, I welcome these proposals. These proposals will assist rural and regional communities in particular to access and retain adequate health care services. Many doctors and specialists have left the industry or have been forced to contemplate doing so. My hope is that this legislation will encourage them to remain in practice for many years to come and encourage others who have left the industry to return to practice.
Like many communities around Australia, my electorate of Riverina has suffered from specialist shortages and an increased demand on health care services. In April 2001 general practitioners and specialists in my electorate came to me warning me about the impending collapse of UMP, and together we brought these concerns to Canberra. Some of our points for discussion included the fact that the system was running out of money, the very real concern that obstetrics would no longer be available in Wagga Wagga and rural communities, and the realisation that there would be a similar situation for many cities and towns right across New South Wales. The concern was that action needed to be taken by state governments to legislate for tort law reform in structured settlements and to reduce the statute of limitations, particularly for obstetrics. 
I welcome and acknowledge the member for Bruce's discussion of the issue of leadership from the Commonwealth perspective to force states to implement such tort law reform. I suggest in return that the opposition could play a significant leadership role here in ensuring that the states come on board with a uniform package of tort law reform. I think this position forced a lot of doctors out of the industry, and the mere fact of not knowing what lay before them was of great concern for all of our communities. I worked to encourage members from rural electorates in this House to lend their support to solving this issue of concern for rural doctors, specialists and health care professionals because, without adequate health care, many people in rural and regional areas will simply have to leave their communities and relocate to an area which offers sufficient health services. 
Some of the issues I have raised in my many meetings include the fact that steep rises in medical indemnity rates by the monopoly provider in New South Wales, United Medical Protection, produced an acute threat to ongoing obstetrics and specialist services in rural and regional NSW—more particularly, in my area of the Riverina. In May 2001 an obstetrician in my electorate, Dr John Currie, and I continued to travel to Canberra to highlight the impending collapse of UMP and the need for states to take urgent action. I repeat that there was a definite need for state attorneys-general to take urgent action, right across the sphere, taking into consideration tort law reform structures and reducing the statute of limitations, particularly in the field of obstetrics. The states needed to take this action so that doctors and specialists could feel more comfortable about their futures.
This issue was and continues to be a source of great concern for people within my rural and regional electorate. Health care is one of the most valuable services for any Australian, especially in regional Australia. In my local communities, health care is the single most important issue. People in my area are concerned for their future and many seriously consider packing up and moving to larger centres where health care services are easy to access. There is a bidding war and a price war taking place, with councils right across my electorate determining how best to attract health professionals into their communities by offering them substantial payments and substantial medical centres and practices. It is heartening to see how well the Howard-Anderson government have got behind their rural health initiatives, ensuring that those communities that have no doctors or specialist services are able to access them, with a variety of enhanced facilities in their communities. One recent addition is the Coleambally medical centre, supported by the Howard-Anderson government, which has provided the impetus for a doctor to continue to service that area—an area that looked like it would have no further doctors.
I also want to talk about Griffith, which has a population of more than 25,000 and is the centre of Australia's food bowl. Griffith has lost numerous specialists. The Griffith City Council and, to an extent, the Greater Murray Area Health Service have worked hard to attract specialists and they are now expanding their search overseas. Many other regional towns and cities throughout the Riverina have lost specialists and access to medical services and are desperately trying to understand how they can regain these services. The impending crisis of medical indemnity did not assist them at all.
Wagga Wagga is a growing city of almost 60,000 people and has recently lost its only ear, nose and throat specialist to retirement. Patients are now relying on the services of a visiting specialist from Albury—a city in the member for Farrer's electorate, more than an hour away—whilst we are hoping we can attract a replacement specialist to service our community. When Wagga Wagga, with its large population, cannot replace an ear, nose and throat specialist, what hope does a city like Griffith or a smaller community have of attracting specialist services or of retaining their GP services, particularly when the indemnity costs for these doctors to practise are so high?
The legislation to be introduced by the government will help to prevent this nationwide shortage of specialists, and it will give many doctors and specialists the peace of mind to continue their practices with affordable premiums for medical indemnity insurance. I am very proud to say that, when the whole crisis formed, the federal government, led by the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, came forward with great dexterity and speed to ensure that our people had continuing services and that our doctors were assured of the support of this government.
Each time I rise to speak in this House I remind fellow members of how proud I am to represent a very vibrant and very strong electorate—an electorate with people who are determined to survive and succeed, despite the many obstacles that come their way. I have mentioned many times that health care is the most important issue. This community issue brought people together right across the Riverina in 2000 to raise well over $3 million in a little over a year for the establishment of a radiotherapy unit. It was indeed their proudest moment. The Riverina Cancer Care Centre was opened in March 2002 following a public meeting on 18 August 2000. The centre offers lifesaving radiotherapy treatment to people from across the Riverina, southern New South Wales and beyond. Such is the desire for our communities to ensure the continuation of healthy lifestyles for the people who make up the surrounding district communities.
The Riverina is my home and I love everything about it. I take this opportunity to encourage specialists and medical practitioners to consider the Riverina as a fantastic place to work and live. The cities of Wagga Wagga and Griffith and the towns of Narrandera, Gundagai, Leeton, Temora, Cootamundra, Hay, Coleambally, Darlington Point, Ardlethan, Coolamon and Junee would all welcome you with open arms. I hope that there are doctors who will read Hansard to understand the issues of this bill and who will take the opportunity to come and see what we have to offer in the Riverina. Not only does the Riverina offer many career challenges and opportunities to develop skills but it also boasts a great lifestyle. The reason I support the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 is so that the communities throughout my electorate can have access to specialists and the best health care, which they deserve, while specialists can have peace of mind when they offer these much needed services. I really do not want to see Riverina people forced to leave their homes and way of life because access to a doctor or specialist has become a struggle. They deserve to receive health care equal to that of anyone living in a metropolitan area.
The fear of losing obstetric services in rural and regional areas continues to grow within the medical community. A primary health care facility in my electorate was threatened late last year. Once again, people from Wagga Wagga and right across my electorate of Riverina rallied in support of their sole private hospital and maternity unit, arguing that the loss of choice for many women would have an enormous impact on the region—indeed, it would. In November last year, I witnessed a community come together to protect its health services once again. Calvary Hospital's maternity unit faced an uncertain future as obstetricians threatened to leave due to the fear of the unknown price of medical indemnity insurance.
The maternity unit at Calvary Hospital services an entire region, including towns such as Narrandera, Griffith, Gundagai and Temora. People come from places up to three hours drive away to have their babies in this private facility. More than 30 per cent of mothers-to-be in Griffith currently travel to Wagga Wagga to have their babies. Without the services of Calvary Hospital's private maternity unit, expectant mothers wanting private care would be forced to travel to Wodonga, Canberra or Sydney to have their babies. Six hundred babies were delivered at Calvary Hospital in 2001, an increase of 160 on the previous year. Without this service, the publicly funded Wagga Wagga Base Hospital simply could not cope with the increase in deliveries and there would be a significant strain on its existing services. 
A rally was organised and more than 2,000 people marched along Wagga's main street to show their support for Calvary Hospital. In addition to the support shown at the rally, more than 7,000 locals signed petitions, which I presented to this House, and the state Liberal member for Wagga Wagga, Daryl Maguire—who was recently re-elected to the New South Wales parliament—presented petitions to the New South Wales parliament.
With only three private hospitals outside metropolitan New South Wales offering obstetric services, it was crucial that we maintained this service for southern New South Wales. The threat to ongoing obstetric services was wholeheartedly taken up by the community, a testament to the huge importance that we place on such services. Not only was a vital health service under threat but the future employment of 26 full-time and casual midwives employed at the hospital was under threat at a time when the health service is working to attract midwives, nurses and other allied health professionals. These professionals were facing certain doom and gloom.
But through the positive actions of this government and as a result of many meetings that I held with the minister—and through her great concern and also the great concern demonstrated by the Prime Minister's office over this issue—the government made the announcement that they would be able to resolve this issue and ensure the ongoing services at Cavalry Hospital. I welcomed those announcements by the government, including the latest announcement by the minister on increasing assistance to obstetricians from 50 per cent to 80 per cent over and above that which is paid by non-procedural gynaecologists in medical indemnity costs. I think that is most helpful in order for us to retain our obstetric services in rural and regional areas.
After the minister, the Prime Minister and the government became positively involved in this issue, the local Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser went from stories about rallying and people's concern over the loss of their services to the headline `Maternity ward safe and sound' on 14 December. The obstetricians had received their premium notices. They were affordable, just as the minister for health had assured me that they would be. They were able to continue practising at Calvary Hospital and are still doing so. Not only were obstetricians affected by the problems associated with UMP; orthopaedic surgeons, procedural GPs and district and regional hospitals in my electorate were also affected. There is certainly a great need to also ensure the future of these services through the actions of the government.
On 31 May the Prime Minister announced key elements of the government's strategy for ensuring that medical indemnity insurance was made a viable commercial product. One critical element addressed was improved transparency in the financial reporting of medical defence organisations by bringing all the insurance business of MDOs into the prudential framework for general insurance. And so it should be, because a lot of the problems were due to a lack of transparency in the way in which companies reported and managed their risks.
On 23 October the Prime Minister also announced further details of the government's strategy. He announced that MDOs would be brought into a new regulatory framework administered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and would be subject to a range of prudential safeguards to mitigate insolvency risks. The Prime Minister also announced that minimum product standards would be applied to medical indemnity cover. I believe that this is a great step forward and I congratulate the government on their actions.
This bill requires MDOs to operate on a prudentially sound footing and to provide certain products and information to members, providing general practitioners and specialists with peace of mind—and so it should. Our specialists and doctors of the future should be able to look at how their risk is spread. New South Wales is the most litigious state for medical claims. This issue comes under the realm of the state governments, with a great need for continued action on tort law reform. By enforcing this reform, the spiralling system of medical indemnity could be relieved. How can a company manage risk and strike premiums on a yearly basis with no indication of what might happen in 25 years time? It is unreasonable. It is an unreasonable expectation with respect to the company and it is an unreasonable expectation with respect to the proceduralist obstetrician.
The structured settlements bill, introduced into the House last year, also will provide many benefits for both medical indemnity and public liability insurance. It will reduce the growing tendency for courts to award huge sums of money to parties and instead will make it more attractive for complainants to opt for structured settlements. The introduction of structured settlements will bring a great deal of benefit to those affected by medical indemnity and public liability insurance. It will also allow many organisations, including local governments, to factor in the risk of litigation costs and it will reduce the huge burden on insurers to pay lump sums following litigation.
The government has done and will continue to do an enormous amount to ensure there are medical services right across Australia—that is, in outer metropolitan areas and rural and regional areas. But, if doctors, specialists and proceduralists are continually concerned about the general public taking legal action and suing in the first degree, I think we still have a long way to go. An education process must be undertaken to ensure the public recognises that there is a certain amount of self-accountability that goes with any sickness or any provision of services to a community. I applaud the bills in front of us and urge the public to consider litigation carefully before embarking on it to ensure that it is just and proper.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I rise to support the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. Previous speakers have dealt with the detail of the amendments made by these bills. I would like to make some remarks about the amendments and about the effect that the medical indemnity issue has had and is having on my electorate of Farrer. Medical indemnity is not just a problem for medical professionals; it is very much a public interest issue. It is an issue that affects the constituents of my electorate of Farrer in one of the most fundamental ways: it affects their access to medical services and that in turn relates to health, one of the essential things for all of us. So there is an obvious public interest in ensuring that doctors have affordable protection in the event of a medical error. Likewise, patients must be confident that, if they are injured, they will be eligible for compensation.
Medical indemnity cover is the customary way that medical practitioners protect themselves from any obligation to pay compensation for injuries sustained by their patients as a result of their negligence. Such negligence is determined by a court of law. Medical indemnity providers or MDOs, medical defence organisations, were originally established by medical practitioners—it seems to me—as a form of cooperative into which those medical practitioners made payments and received protection. Now we are quite rightly moving to a more comprehensive prudential regulation of MDOs, and that gives doctors and patients a great deal more certainty. Until recently, little attention had been given to the adequacy of existing medical indemnity arrangements in Australia, but with the collapse of UMP last year all of this changed.
These bills realise one of the key measures in the government's medical indemnity package, announced by the Prime Minister on 23 October 2002 in response to the medical indemnity crisis. The package aims to ensure that access to private medical services is maintained, including and especially in rural and regional areas. It addresses rising medical indemnity insurance premiums and helps to ensure a viable and ongoing medical indemnity insurance market. There are serious inadequacies in the medical indemnity legislation with regard to retiring doctors and high-risk specialists. Based on feedback from specialists and GPs in rural and regional areas and in my electorate, these concerns became obvious. The major issue we are confronted with is security for doctors, especially for retired doctors and doctors nearing retirement. Doctors who belong to an MDO with unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities may be subject to payments over which they feel they have no knowledge or control. I believe these bills address these concerns.
We must remember that our ability to manage high-cost claims is very much dependent on tort law reform by the states, who have an important role to play in bringing this under control. I appreciate that this will not solve the immediate problems facing the medical sector, but I am pleased that our government is very much on the case.
The Prime Minister announced further adjustments to the package on 19 March, and Dr Phelps, representing the AMA, made some comments in response. She said there is more work to be done and questioned whether capping insurance policies at, say, $15 million is sufficient. She stated that, if there were an award or settlement over this amount, doctors would be personally liable—that is, if they took out insurance for a maximum of $15 million and a claim came in for greater than that amount, they would be personally liable. Dr Phelps made the point that $15 million might seem sufficient today but that it is unlikely to be adequate in 10 or 20 years time, given that state and territory governments have failed to progress tort law reform sufficiently. 
I say this to the AMA: the federal government relies on state governments—who, as we know, have primary carriage of the laws of negligence—to do their share. Dr Phelps acknowledges that state law reform is lagging, particularly on the statute of limitations, and suggests that the federal government's High Cost Claims Scheme should reflect this. It seems to me that that is a request of the federal government to make up for the shortcomings of the states. In my state of New South Wales, progress has been made, and I look forward to rapid progress continuing.
There is talk about covering doctors for this so-called blue sky amount, but we cannot really expect the Australian taxpayer to pick up a blue sky tab and to underwrite whatever claims come a doctor's way. We all know that, where industries or groups—and that includes lawyers—sense that there is a bottomless pit of funding and guarantees provided by government, they will change their behaviour accordingly. Lawyers will be the winners and Australian taxpayers the losers.
I welcome the additional premium subsidy for rural obstetricians. We have talented and dedicated obstetricians practising in Albury-Wodonga. They are among the best in the country. I say that because one of their number, Pieter Mourik, delivered my three children. None of the three deliveries was straightforward. I am proud that we have such a high standard of health care in our region, and I would hate to see any of this expertise lost. Similarly, we have some of the best and most experienced specialists from all sorts of fields of medicine: paediatrics; ear, nose and throat; psychiatry, including child psychiatry; general physicians; orthopaedics; hand surgeons; urologists; and others. Obviously, the loss of a practitioner from a rural or remote community results in the loss of significant skills, expertise, knowledge and understanding of rural and remote issues.
A group of specialists came to see me late last year expressing their very urgent anxiety, and I was very concerned about what they had to say. In particular, they drew my attention to the fact that the majority of their number is close to retiring age and they were seriously considering their future after 30 June. At that time, they felt they were faced with escalating, almost unknown, premiums after this date, which would potentially go on for years after their retirement. They were certainly weighing up whether it was worth them continuing their practice after 30 June, because one operation in the 2004 financial year could change everything for them. 
The thought of losing our specialist doctors was quite horrifying to me, and it would be disastrous for our region, particularly because of the important regional role that Albury plays for the surrounding small towns in my electorate. Without that strong medical sector in Albury, people would have to travel to Melbourne—with all the inconvenience, loss of amenity and social disruption that that would cause. I do not think we are going to face retirements of this scale. I believe that our government is recognising the problem, moving to consult—and continuing to consult, which is more important—and making the necessary changes. 
It is worth noting that, because the group of specialists in my area are at perhaps the later part of their working life—and this is common to much of regional Australia—they are possibly more likely to make the decision to bail out rather than to keep going with their medical practices. That certainly is of concern. It is worth noting that specialists and doctors at this stage of their working life have perhaps the most to offer, given all their years of experience and all their knowledge. The mentoring role that they can play for young and upcoming doctors and new recruits is absolutely invaluable. As I said, I am confident that the government has moved to address those concerns. At the time the specialists came to see me, they had no idea what sort of regime they might face. In fact, when they asked their medical defence organisations what sorts of premiums they might face and for how long, they were told, `How long is a piece of string?' So, clearly, there has been much uncertainty, and I believe these bills will deliver increased certainty for doctors and allow patients to feel confident that their claims will be met.
Medical defence organisations do need to be regulated under the same standards as general insurers. Medical indemnity can no longer be just a hazy promise; it needs to be a legal and binding contract. This is a change for the medical defence organisations, and they will have up to five years to meet these minimum prudential capital requirements. I am pleased that the government will commission a study of options to examine the retirement cover issue and will consult with the AMA and MDOs in so doing. We will undertake this as a matter of urgency, because we are determined to ensure that workable arrangements are put in place to enable medical practitioners to access affordable and adequate run-off cover. We are committed to examining all options in this area as a high priority.
I would like to quote a letter I received from a specialist in my area. I think his comments represent those of the other specialists. He said:
I know several of my colleagues who are thinking about decisions to retire. This will be driving people out of practice, and certainly the other great concern is that as one reaches the twilight of one's career there is no incentive at all to wind down. The ultimate effect of this on the community is going to be that many of the most senior and the most experienced practitioners will in fact leave the profession in the next year or so. The government needs to be aware of this potential catastrophe. 
I have written to the specialists and I have enclosed the measures we have taken. I will continue to listen and consult and I believe, as I said previously, we are well and truly on the case.
As we know, UMP collapsed last year under the weight of $1 billion worth of claims, which I suppose demonstrated a level of underinsurance in an environment of rising risk and litigation. Certainly, litigation is on the rise, as demonstrated by these figures about obstetricians: one in six obstetricians was sued in 2001, compared to only one in 18 ten years previously; more than half of our obstetricians have received a letter of inquiry from a solicitor, which is the first stage of litigation; and, in its last year, 60c in every dollar paid out by UMP went to lawyers—so we can see who the winners are in the present scenario.
Home birth advocates are rejoicing as more and more obstetricians close up shop, saying they are looking for excuses to carry out caesareans, they are overservicing and they are no doubt greedy and money-grubbing into the bargain. How ridiculous. This is symptomatic that we are getting to the stage where society, pushed by either lawyers or an entrenched expectation, is driving our specialist obstetricians out of private practice and allowing mothers to lose confidence in the person they must have utmost confidence in when giving birth. I believe the law is out of step with public opinion. Greed, individualism and contentiousness are winning out over commonsense. Our culture is changing, with this growing emphasis on individual rights and neglect of the common good. 
Think about the effect the rise in litigation is having on day-to-day medical practice, including the financial costs of overinvestigating patients to keep the lawyers in check. I have been told that doctors are carrying out unnecessary, invasive investigations to prevent them from being sued. Doctors have many times before been sued for being too cautious with their investigations; no doubt they will soon face litigation for overinvestigating. There are just too many opportunities for speculative claims and too little consequences if a claim is lost. The Doctors Reform Society actually made a good point when it said that, in the information age, there should be no barrier to a web site from which can be downloaded court approved information to be provided to patients for any surgical procedure, investigation or medical therapy in any language. Doctors can pass this on. Obviously, they do not have a crystal ball; they cannot anticipate every single question and every single problem in every single language.
I would like to conclude by reaffirming how much the government have done for rural and regional medical services. We are now showing increases in doctor numbers in rural and remote areas, which is greatly pleasing. Our $100 million initiative in rural and regional medicine is starting to have an impact. We have established rural clinical schools, and the University of New South Wales has one such school in Albury, where doctors spend up to a year of their medical training in a regional area. We hope, and certainly expect, that they will fall in love with the place and, if they do not come back to practise in Albury, they will choose to practise in a regional area.
Rural scholarships are a fantastic initiative by this government, as are rebate payments for existing rural GPs. I should also mention the allied rural health training that is being carried out by Charles Sturt University in my electorate and also in the electorate of the member for Riverina, who previously spoke so passionately about this issue. Charles Sturt University has an exceptional record in training allied health providers and actually keeping them in rural and regional areas. Pharmacy, physiotherapy and, I believe, speech pathology are several examples where a huge percentage of the students finishing these courses are in fact staying in the regions. Whatever the recipe for that success is, we need to copy it.
We are now one year into a three-year $2.1 million provision of rural specialist services in New South Wales. This includes $100,000 over three years for the far west of New South Wales for physician, dermatology and neurology services and $335,000 over three years in the greater Murray region for neurology, urology, orthopaediatric, anaesthetist, gynaecology, oncology and paediatric haematology services. I am glad that the opposition supports these bills. I look forward to New South Wales and the country as a whole coming to grips with the medical indemnity problems. We have come a long way; there is a little bit further to go. I look forward to a successful outcome.",REPS,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION AND PRODUCT STANDARDS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I would like to at the outset thank those honourable members for making their contributions to the debate on the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. The purpose of these bills is to ensure that health care professionals have access to medical indemnity cover that is provided by properly regulated insurers, and to specify minimum standards in certain circumstances for medical indemnity cover. These measures as a whole are designed to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the market for medical indemnity cover and to provide greater certainty to medical practitioners by establishing a framework for the establishment of minimum product standards to be offered to doctors purchasing indemnity insurance.
The bills give effect to the announcements by the Prime Minister on 31 May and 23 October last year to improve financial transparency in the financial reporting of medical defence organisations and to bring all of the insurance business of MDOs into the prudential framework for general insurers. In addition, it was announced that medical indemnity products would be subject to product safeguards to ensure continuity of cover. They also give effect to the Prime Minister's announcement on 19 March 2003.
There are two main components of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Bill 2002. Firstly, it provides that medical indemnity cover is only to be provided by general insurers and only under contracts of insurance. Secondly, it provides for minimum product standards for medical indemnity insurance contracts. A minimum cover amount of $5 million or such other amount as prescribed by regulation will be required. There are also minimum product standards set down in the bill to offer doctors retroactive cover in certain circumstances. The bill also establishes a framework for the prescription of the offer of run-off cover via regulations, through which compulsory offers of run-off cover can be made mandatory where doing so would be appropriate for medical indemnity providers, doctors and the community. The regulation making power will also provide for minimum run-off requirements to be specified.
To help assist the medical indemnity insurance industry adapt to the prudential reforms contained in the bill, the government has offered a generous transition period—of five years from 1 July 2003—for the minimum capital requirements, for MDOs currently providing medical indemnity cover that wish to become authorised insurers and that do not already meet the minimum capital requirements. Further, the proposed bill amendments will further assist the industry to move smoothly towards the new requirements contained in the bill, by clarifying the scope and operation of bill provisions.
The Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 is designed to support the measures contained in the primary bill. Importantly, it will ensure that data must be provided by MDOs to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and will prohibit MDOs with discretionary liabilities from becoming authorised insurers. This prohibition is included so that legacy liabilities of MDOs are quarantined from the new insurance business being issued from 1 July this year. The government sees the passage of these bills as an important element of a broad strategy to stabilise the medical indemnity insurance market in Australia. In addition to the guarantee provided to United Medical Protection and its wholly owned subsidiary, Australasian Medical Insurance Limited, to 31 December 2003, that broad strategy has seen the government already implement a premium subsidy scheme, a High Cost Claims Scheme and a scheme to fund unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities of MDOs, to be recouped by a levy on doctors of participant MDOs.
Together with the proposed amendments to the bill, this legislation will ensure that doctors and their patients can have greater certainty in their indemnity arrangements, better access to appropriate and adequate indemnity arrangements and better information about those arrangements. I call on all honourable members of the House to support the passage of these bills in a timely fashion to ensure that doctors have the certainty they need in their indemnity arrangements and in the entities providing those arrangements, thereby ensuring that adequate medical services will continue to be available to all Australians. I commend both bills to the chamber and I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to these bills.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—The Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002 amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services such as diagnostic radiology, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine imaging, and radiation oncology services. The amendments provide for:
·	mandatory registration of all sites where diagnostic imaging—for example, X-rays—and radiation oncology—for example, cancer radiation—services are provided;
·	substitution of inappropriate requested tests with clinically appropriate tests and the extension of the prohibition of inducements through place and equipment or staff, in particular practices; and
·	restoration of referral access for osteopaths to diagnostic imaging services.
Those amendments are supported by the opposition. They are straightforward and will enhance diagnostic and radiation imaging services.
I address each of the amendments in turn. Firstly, as far as the registration of practice sites is concerned, these amendments provide for the registration of practices at which diagnostic imaging procedures are undertaken, practices at which radiation oncology services are rendered, and bases for mobile diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology equipment. Registered premises and mobile bases will be allocated a unique location specific practice number. The main purpose of these amendments is to provide a mechanism to collect information about the rendering of diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services. Information obtained through this initiative will enable expenditure patterns to be monitored; better detection and addressing of overservicing, cost shifting, claiming errors and fraud; better identification of where growth is occurring—for example, in the public sector versus the private sector; identification of issues resulting from the increasing trend to corporatisation, increasing mergers and takeovers, and horizontal and vertical integration; and better planning of equipment distribution and replacement of high-cost capital within the industry.
The introduction of location specific practice numbers for radiation oncology practice sites was recommended by the Radiation Oncology Inquiry Committee in its report provided to the minister on 8 June 2002. It was introduced to bring public and private facilities under the one umbrella to help address planning, service provision, work force, age of equipment and other issues identified in the report. It is proposed that all sites which have any type of imaging equipment must register with the Health Insurance Commission, HIC, by 1 May 2003.
The second body of amendments goes to referral arrangements for diagnostic imaging services. These amendments implement certain recommendations of the Diagnostic Imaging Referral Arrangements Review for improving the referral arrangements for diagnostic imaging services. The amendments involve:
·	enabling the provider of the imaging service to substitute a more appropriate imaging service when a patient is referred for an inappropriate service;
·	requiring a further referral, where a service provider wishes to provide additional necessary services to those specified in the original request and the additional services are of the type that would have otherwise required a referral from a specialist or consultant physician; and
·	prohibiting the stationing of diagnostic imaging equipment or employees at the premise of another practitioner by all diagnostic imaging service providers.
To ensure that patients in rural and remote areas are not disadvantaged by prohibiting the stationing of equipment or employees at the premises of another practitioner, there will be a provision for exemption in remote areas.
The third group of amendments goes to referring arrangements for osteopaths. This bill will enable osteopaths to be recognised as a separate profession—as distinct from their previous status as chiropractors—for the purposes of requiring certain diagnostic imaging services. Under current legislation, practitioners registered as chiropractors under state or territory registration laws can request specified diagnostic imaging services under the Medicare arrangements. Osteopaths registered as chiropractors under those laws are also able to request diagnostic imaging services. Some states now have separate legislation governing the registration of chiropractors and osteopaths. The amendments will restore the rights of affected osteopaths to request diagnostic imaging services and allow state or territory registered osteopaths, who were not previously registered as chiropractors under relevant state or territory legislation, to request these services.
As I have indicated, in my view these measures are straightforward. The opposition supports them. They have the support of the relevant industry groups and will lead to more efficient and more effective diagnostic and other imaging services. On the basis of my strong support for this measure, I was not proposing to speak for longer than a brief period. But I suspect that, with the informal placing of people on notice provisions that we have in this chamber, something has gone awry. The parliamentary secretary is doing her best to find the next speaker so that we do not embarrass ourselves by wondering what we do before eight o'clock when we might need to find a quorum.
As I have said, the measures in this bill are straightforward. They ought to be adopted, and they will lead to more efficient and effective practices. So far as the registration of practice sites is concerned, this is a sensible measure. It is a sensible measure because it will enable a proper and complete monitoring of those practices where radiation and diagnostic measures are carried out. Information which can be obtained through this practice site registration will over time enable more effective information to be obtained and more effective analysis to be made of that. That will enable expenditure patterns to be monitored and it will enable better and earlier detection of overservicing, cost shifting, claiming areas and fraud, if that regrettably occurs. It will also enable comparisons to be made about whether growth is occurring in the public sector or in the private sector, or both, and what comparisons can sensibly be made between the two.
This legislation will also enable a more effective monitoring to take place of what adverse consequences, if any, come from horizontal or vertical integration in this area of the profession and the industry; what effects, if any, flow as a result of mergers or takeovers in the private profession; and what, if any, consequences occur as a result of the worry in some quarters about increasing corporatisation in this area. And, importantly, it will enable better planning to occur so far as equipment distribution is concerned. This is a high capital cost industry and distribution of equipment is important, particularly when we pride ourselves on endeavours to ensure that there is some equity in terms of access to these services. Any information which enables us to plan better for the distribution of equipment is a sensible thing.
The amendments so far as referring arrangements are concerned have been the subject of a review by the Diagnostic Imaging Referral Arrangements Review Committee, and the relevant industry and professional groups have been involved in this review and support the review and the outcomes. It is hoped that the results of the review and the implementation of the amendment will enable the provider of the imaging service to substitute a more appropriate imaging service when a patient is referred for an inappropriate service. Rather than having a duplication and double referral, it gives more flexibility to the provider of the imaging service to enable an appropriate service to be conducted, despite the fact that there has been an inappropriate referral. It will also enable the prohibition of the stationing of diagnostic imaging equipment or employees at the premises of another practitioner by diagnostic imaging service providers, to guard against unnecessary duplication and overservicing. But the caveat which is importantly there is to ensure that there will be necessary exemptions in rural and remote areas for that purpose. The changed arrangements in respect of osteopaths comprise the final group of amendments. These seek to overcome the different registration practices at various state and territory jurisdictions so far as chiropractors and osteopaths are concerned.
These amendments, as I have said, are supported by the opposition. They will lead, hopefully, to better and more effective services at a more cost-effective rate so far as the taxpayer is concerned, and they will lead to better outcomes so far as concerns Australians who have to avail themselves of diagnostic imaging and the other services referred to in this amendment bill. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,"<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—I am pleased to rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002. I am pleased to do so because I have contact with a range of people in my electorate of Flinders—as all in this place would have contact with people in their own electorates—who have concerns about a series of health matters. There are those with concerns about access to Medicare offices. There are those who are concerned about ensuring that we have an appropriate level of outer metropolitan doctors—and I am delighted that only yesterday the health minister, Senator Kay Patterson, announced a new range of incentives to assist doctors in moving into the outer metropolitan area. Importantly, many of my constituents have concerns about access to radiation oncology. In particular, because the Mornington Peninsula is some distance from radiation oncology units, we find there is a twofold effect. Firstly, there is a health risk to many people who feel that the process of travelling is too much for them, that it is in some way overly burdensome. Secondly, there is a financial effect: many families find that the costs of dealing with distance travel to radiation oncology facilities are too great for them or that they are burdensome or painful in some particular way.
In that context, I am delighted to speak on this bill and also—and I think this is critical—to talk about the range of activities that the government is carrying out in the radiation oncology field, in particular the notion of providing services to outer metropolitan areas in the principal outer metropolitan hospitals. That is a very important step forward. It is not glamorous and it is not high profile, but in practice it is a really beneficial change for those most in need, for those in our society who suffer from some of the most debilitating conditions, many of which are terminal.
In speaking on this bill, I want to focus, firstly, on the overview to it; secondly, on the background to it; thirdly, on its purpose; and, fourthly, on its provisions. This bill brings benefits to patients who require diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services. We know that these services represent a large proportion of Medicare payments. The Health Insurance Commission estimates that 10 per cent of all Medicare claims are in some way inappropriate, incorrect or improper. At present, there is no imperative to discourage practitioners from submitting questionable claims, and industry bodies have no capacity to pursue them. Government regulation in that context is consequently the only means by which such claims can be effectively deterred. By implementing mechanisms which have the ability to identify malpractice there is a significant likelihood that the incidence of fraud and overservicing may be reduced, resulting in savings which can be put towards those directly in need. It is about ensuring that the allocation is focused on those who have the most genuine radiation oncology needs and it is about providing additional resources and services, ensuring that we do not have overservicing in one area which deprives those most desperately in need of resources.
In that context, this bill provides for the collection and analysis of information so that legal sanctions can be imposed to prevent the inappropriate use of public funds and, importantly, to prevent the distortion and diversion of resources away from the most desperately needed areas of diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology. In that respect, it is a very important step forward. It is incremental, but it is a very important step forward.
I will now turn to the background to this bill, to put it in context. Firstly, at the last election the coalition government set forth a range of initiatives to expand access to radiation oncology for those in outer metropolitan areas and rural and regional areas. Those services will be gradually expanded over the coming years which will make a profound and significant difference to those who suffer and to those who need radiation oncology services.
This bill amends a number of provisions in the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services. This is the first time that these particular provisions have been put to the parliament. The bill establishes a scheme for registration with the Health Insurance Commission of service providers in this area. It allocates a location specific practice number, in order to monitor and thus to regulate activity, so that we can see where practitioners are helping to benefit their patients and so that we can identify those few practitioners who are acting in a way which is not beneficial to society or their patients.
The bill proposes that Medicare benefits will be available only from registered practices. That is an assurance both of propriety and of quality. It is a very important step, which fits in with the moves over the last 100 years generally which have been part of the process of providing oversight and regulation of medical practitioners whilst allowing them the freedom to carry on their work. The role of the government here is to provide a framework where we have assurance and quality control for the community whilst encouraging the direction of resources specifically to those areas which most desperately need them.
Interestingly, a similar scheme already exists under the Commonwealth Health Program Grant requirements. I also note that the issues raised by this bill are not solely the concern of the government. In response to a review of mandatory reporting of practice details, commissioned by the government in 2000, medical practitioners, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association expressed strong support. An estimate of the initial set-up costs for this process of protecting the public is around $750,000, with maintenance costs predicted to be around $270,000 per annum. In that context, the amendments in this bill are intended to minimise disruption and compliance costs for individual practitioners. In particular, it is envisaged that, after an initial application for a location specific provider number, a yearly update will be required, taking about two hours per year to complete. There will be no application fees.
The third part of my speech delves more deeply into the specific aims of the bill. The first aim of the bill is to investigate and counter the effects of growing corporatisation and, in some cases, unassociated malpractice in the medical sector, which has raised concerns of diminished care standards and overservicing in pursuit of higher profits. The second aim of the bill is to reduce unnecessary future expenditure on diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services and, importantly, to increase accountability for present expenditure. In that context, it is important to note that current expenditure on radiation oncology and diagnostic imaging amounts to about $1.3 billion annually. It is estimated that these measures and the efficiency gains which will result from them will save the Commonwealth in the order of $11 million annually. That is money which can go directly to the bottom line of the health budget for provision of basic radiation oncology services.
The third aim of the bill is to collect data to help plan and develop programs to maintain the very key objectives of Medicare—to focus on the core, the essence, of the Medicare program, in particular making health care affordable for all Australians while ensuring that that care is of a high standard and ensuring all Australians have access to health care with priority according to need. This data will help to give an understanding of the types of practices which offer imaging services. Data collection plays a very important role in ensuring that, throughout the health system and throughout Australia, we have a better understanding of needs. Importantly, we may even be able to identify significant health trends as a result.
The fourth aim of the bill is to restore the rights of osteopaths who, under state registration laws, are unable to refer patients for diagnostic imaging services. This will provide a greater range of alternative treatment options to patients. Those who require diagnostic imaging will not be forced to obtain referrals from doctors. Finally, the fifth aim of the bill is to close loopholes in the Health Insurance Act to prevent the stationing of equipment at the premises of another practitioner. Those are the purposes of the bill.
I now turn to the final area I want to cover in my speech: the key provisions of the bill. Schedule 1 focuses on diagnostic imaging. Subsection 16D precludes the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services unless procedures are undertaken on equipment or a type of equipment that is registered and ordinarily located at the premises. So it is about carrying out the job, on the spot, under registered, tested and quality controlled conditions. That is a very important step. Similarly, subsection 23DZK provides that a register of diagnostic imaging premises be kept. It establishes the register nationally, and that is an important step. The second major element within the provisions of the bill takes the radiation oncology register a step further with provisions for radiation oncology similar to those applying to diagnostic imaging schedules. Again, this is a complementary element establishing a position throughout Australia.
Looking at this bill we see that it is one of a number of steps forward by the government. It is part of a range of activities the government is undertaking that will help communities such as Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Blairgowrie and Koo Wee Rup—towns which are some distance from major health services. It is about focusing on the provision of radiation oncology services to those people who suffer from forms of cancer. We know that cancer is a problem with an extraordinary reach within our society, and this bill is aimed at addressing that problem by providing a regime of quality control and ensuring that there is no fraud or malpractice within it. Ultimately, this bill contributes to the broader radiation oncology package that the government has put forward. I am pleased to commend the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002 to the House. I think it is a great step forward, and I hope that all members are able to support it",REPS,"<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—We are here to debate the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002. The key objective of this amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 is to reduce the costs to the Commonwealth associated with the provision of diagnostic imaging services—which include diagnostic radiology, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine imaging—radiation oncology and other measures in relation to the payment of Medicare benefits. The secondary objective is to capture practice based data, in order to identify more accurately where and how the facilities and services are being utilised. Thirdly, the bill seeks to restore referral access for osteopaths to diagnostic imaging services. It is suggested that these amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will result in a reduction in overservicing, claiming errors and inappropriate practice.
The cost to Medicare for provision of these services annually is estimated to be $1.3 billion, or around 16 per cent of total Medicare outlays. This figure is an approximation, because to date there has been little substantial or accurate data collected on the utilisation of diagnostic imaging services. According to a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in August 2001, GPs order diagnostic imaging tests such as X-rays and CT scans at a rate of at least one test in every 13 general patient consultations. If this number is then extrapolated by the total number of GP patient consultations in, say, 1999-2000, it could suggest that approximately eight million tests are conducted annually. Doctors have said that advances in medical imaging technology have been so rapid that they are now an integral part of patient care. They further claim that another important factor in the increased rate of use of diagnostic imaging facilities is the fear of litigation for malpractice. Doctors refer to this practice as defensive medicine.
Evidence from international studies, supplied by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, suggests that there is a correlation between large practice sizes—say, 11 to 15 GPs—and a high rate of diagnostic imaging, particularly where there exists co-ownership of imaging facilities and general practices. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare support the overseas findings. In their report, they claim that GPs working in corporatised practices are under pressure to generate more income by seeing more patients and increasing the number of diagnostic tests performed. It is also suggested that the pathology and radiology services referred to in the report often have the same ownership as the referring general practice.
In 1996 the radiology profession called for the introduction of a provider number system. They believe that such a system would allow for the proper identification and linkage of diagnostic imaging services to practice sites. An original proposal was put forward by the then Royal Australian College of Radiologists and was an attempt to assist in the identification of cost shifting, self-referral and entrepreneurial in-house radiology. In 1998 the diagnostic imaging agreement between the government and the profession again called for the identification of physical practice sites through the introduction of location specific practice numbers. 
In 1999 the HIC undertook the pilot implementation of the radiology practice and equipment register under the auspices of the consultative committee on diagnostic imaging. They took responsibility for the diagnostic imaging agreement. The pilot program supplied valuable information and demonstrated that the system was achievable. An LSPN—that is, a location specific practice number—project team comprising representatives from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association, the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine, the Health Insurance Commission, and the Department of Health and Ageing considered the administrative requirements for practices and providers. Whilst the HIC recognise that the introduction of practice site registration would require changes to billing systems on both their part and the part of practices, they found this approach preferable to a more minimal system that would not involve location specific practice numbers. The LSPN system allows for the complexities of practice arrangements, such as equipment only sites and remote reporting.
In June 2002 the introduction of LSPNs was recommended by the Radiation Oncology Inquiry Committee in its report to the minister. Briefly, the report suggested that public and private facilities should be brought under one umbrella, which would make it easier to address issues of planning, service provision, work force movements, equipment state and other issues. Currently, private radiology sites are registered with the HIC in order to receive health program grant funding. It is proposed that the HIC will shift radiation oncology practice site details to a new register and automatically allocate the practice site a location specific practice number.
In order to understand the implications of the bill it is important to understand its machinations. A practice site is defined as a premises or mobile facility operating under a single business name where diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology equipment is stationed or transported for the purpose of undertaking diagnostic imaging procedures or radiation therapy services for which Medicare benefits are payable. In short, it is proposed that the Health Insurance Commission will contact providers of diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services to advise of the introduction of practice sites and equipment registration. The HIC will request that providers and practice managers return a pre-registration form including the name of a contact person. This information will allow the HIC to build a database of all diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology sites in Australia. Once the information is collected, the HIC will correspond with the practice sites and advise of their requirement to register and receive an LSPN. The registration form supplied by the HIC will be entered into the practice site database and will be linked to existing Medicare databases.
Once a practice site has been allocated an LSPN it will have to ensure this number is quoted on patient claims and accounts in order for the service to be eligible for a Medicare benefit. At 12-month intervals the practice site will be asked to confirm or update all information held by the HIC in order to maintain registration. It is anticipated that when the system becomes effective the HIC will check claims for the inclusion of an LSPN prior to paying a claim. When the HIC receive the claim they will be able to link where the service was undertaken by the LSPN. Furthermore, where an item stipulates that on-site supervision and reporting is required, the provider number and the LSPN will have to refer to the same practice site in order for the service to be eligible for a Medicare benefit unless a legislative exemption exists.
A second measure in this bill is the recommended implementation of findings in a review which was commissioned by the government in July 2000 in relation to the referral arrangements for diagnostic imaging services. The review committee comprised a number of practitioners and radiologists and suggested that a provider be permitted to substitute a more appropriate imaging service where they feel the patient has been referred for an inappropriate service and where they deem additional services to those required in the original referral are necessary and those services are of the type that would otherwise require a referral by a specialist. These measures would result in a small reduction in Medicare costs through reducing the number of diagnostic imaging tests that may need to be reordered.
A final measure of the bill is designed to redress an anomaly relating to the referring arrangements for osteopaths. Under the current legislation osteopaths cannot request specific diagnostic imaging services unless they are registered as chiropractors under the legislation. This bill will restore the rights of those osteopaths affected by changes in state and territory legislation and will allow osteopaths not previously registered as chiropractors to request these services.
Notwithstanding the positive results from the pilot program, the government still feels that a voluntary system would not achieve the desired objectives. The requirement for practice sites to be registered in order to be eligible under the Medicare scheme is therefore included in the legislation. The bill proposes that the Commonwealth be given the power to ensure that responsibility for applying for registration and updating practice site information is placed on the entities that control the practice site.
Sanctions will be introduced where site registration requirements are noncompliant, with the onus being placed on the proprietor of the practice to ensure practice details are correct and maintained with the Health Insurance Commission. The data collected through the location specific practice number system will be used to monitor the diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services and will include information such as practice type and location, type of ownership and practice throughput. It is imperative that a provision be included to prevent patients from being financially disadvantaged through noncompliance by a practice site and to require a review process for proprietors where registration is suspended or cancelled.
The explanatory memorandum states that the measures relating to the requirement for diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology facilities to be registered have been estimated to save the Commonwealth in the order of $11 million annually through improved compliance. The explanatory memorandum also claims that the monetary savings made in addressing these issues can be then redirected back into the Medicare program to improve access. It is proposed that the information collected under the new system will help the government to plan and develop programs to maintain the key objectives of Medicare.
To digress slightly, having a situation where government is looking to put some money back into Medicare is something that we should be very happy about; it is encouraging. If only we could see a more general approach taken by this government in that direction, as I said earlier in the House about another bill. We have seen recently with this government a situation where the overall question of where we are going with health care policy is really under question. When we see the issues that have been in the public sector with respect to bulk-billing and we see what that means in terms of the provision of a Medicare system, we really have to ask ourselves whether this government is committed in this area to ensuring an overall universal service provision for all of the Australian community. With speculation from the minister on issues like bulk-billing, we have to wonder whether this government is committed to providing services in a general sense. 
Certainly measures such as this to try and ensure we get proper information about how the system operates are a step in the right direction. They can ensure that we actually plan better the provision of services and ensure we deal with things like overservicing, which are certainly problems that need to be dealt with. But there is a lot more that could be done and should be done to try and make the system work better. Rather than try and use the blunt axe of increased copayments or other blunt instruments to really get stuck into the Australian community, the government should be trying to make the system work more efficiently.
Labor are committed to the right of patients to high-quality health care services, and we believe that these regulatory measures will lead to improved utilisation and tracking of these services. That is one of the reasons that we support it. However, it should be noted that access to these services is already limited due to shortage of qualified technicians and staff. A report in the Age on 13 September 2002 referred to a report called Vision for radiotherapy, which warned that `radiotherapy services in Australia are in serious trouble. With only four-fifths of the desirable number of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer able to receive radiotherapy, waiting times for these treatments are too long'. There is a shortage of trained people and of modern equipment. Access to these facilities for those in the rural community is limited and much inconvenience is involved to those who must have treatment. There is an urgent need to get better diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services to people in the bush. The funds saved by incorporating this amendment should be redirected to these failing areas of the health system. One believes that is what is intended, and as this comes through the system I look forward to seeing the results being fed through to ensure that that is the actual outcome. As I said earlier, the opposition are pleased to be able to support the bill.",REPS,"<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-03-24,"—It is always good to follow the member for Bruce in the debate. I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate him on in his recent elevation to the opposition frontbench. May he have a long and distinguished career on the opposition frontbench. I am pleased the member for Bruce also mentioned the impact of Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002 this bill on the bush. I have a regional seat and I know the provisions of this bill, are very good for the major centres in my electorate: Nambour, Noosa and Gympie.
As every member of this House is aware, providing quality health care for all Australians in an increasingly complex technological age is expensive. We have all come to expect a high standard of health care. No-one would want anything less—but it does come at a high cost. The Howard government are committed to continuing to improve the standards we have achieved, but we are a responsible government and, therefore, in the face of increasingly sophisticated procedures and escalating costs, we have to ensure that our health service, Medicare, is as cost effective as possible so we can continue to provide those services. That means we need good administration; we need to eliminate waste and overservicing; we need avenues of accurate, relevant data to provide a solid base for good decision making; and we need to work with the appropriate medical bodies in doing so. The better our administration of the Medicare system, the better we can continue to provide the services our people expect. That is what this bill is all about.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services. These two areas of medicine account for 16 per cent of the total annual Medicare outlay. Just think about that figure. With all the GP visits, operations, specialist and hospital services paid out under Medicare, 16 per cent, or $1.3 billion annually, is for diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology. That $1.3 billion is a lot of money, so let us make sure it is not being wasted or used in overservicing. We must make sure that we have the right information to ensure that it is directed at buying the best possible health services for the Australian community.
There are four amendments, four schedules to this bill, and not one of them changes the services for which a patient is entitled to claim or otherwise adversely affects the public—quite the opposite. The first two amendments contain the most important part of the bill. They require that diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology practice sites be registered with the Health Insurance Commission for services provided at those sites to be eligible for Medicare benefits. You might say, `The medical professionals are already registered, so why should the practice sites also have to be registered?' There are some very good reasons.
Do you know we have no idea how many diagnostic imaging practices there are in Australia today? Based on the number of registered specialists, it is assumed there are about 750—but it is only an assumption. Registration of sites and the introduction of what are called location specific practice numbers, LSPNs, mean we will know how many practice sites there are in Australia, where they are situated, who owns them and what type of equipment they have—pretty basic information for government to seek when they pay $1.3 billion in benefits to the industry. A similar registration and information collection system already exists for radiation oncology premises but it applies only to private facilities, not public ones.
The second of these amendments will include the public sites in the register so that we get the whole picture and not just part of it. The information collected under this register is quite basic and straightforward: who, where and what. However, it will allow for better planning of both services and equipment. It will also allow us to safeguard the system from problems that are being exacerbated by changing ownership structures in the industry. There is a high capital cost associated with equipment used in both diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology practices. Because of this cost factor, and because of the dynamics of the medical business sector, there is an increasing trend towards mergers and corporatisation. Corporatisation, of course, is not a bad thing in itself but there are concerns that, with the changing ownership structure, practitioners may be pressured to favour high throughput and corporate profits to the detriment of patient care and Medicare costs.
The industry itself, not just the government, is concerned about these associated problems. The problems are overservicing, cost shifting, claiming errors and even fraud. With insufficient data it is difficult to estimate the extent of these abuses, but it is believed to be a significant cost to Medicare—that is, it is wasting money that could certainly be used in other health areas. These concerns regarding misuse of the system have been heightened since the introduction of capped funding under the diagnostic imaging agreement between the Commonwealth and the profession, because abuse of the system puts pressure on the whole industry. The LSPN system will allow claiming patterns to be analysed and help prevent abuse of the Medicare system.
Speaking of costs, let us look at the financial impact of introducing this site registration. The estimated compliance cost in time and overheads for each practice to fill out an annual form and notify any subsequent changes is about $120 per annum per practice. That is not a huge impact. On the other hand, it is estimated that these amendments would save about one per cent of all Medicare benefits paid for diagnostic imaging. That means a saving of about $11 million per annum. Let me repeat that: the savings are about $11 million per year in Medicare funding, which could be used for other appropriate services. These savings will be achieved without cutting services to patients; they will be achieved simply by inserting a simple barrier, a site register, to protect the system from misuse.
The third amendment, schedule 3 of the bill, deals with referral arrangements. It comprises three elements, all of which were recommended by the Diagnostic Imaging Referral Arrangements Review Committee. It is a combination of plain commonsense and good administration—for instance, it allows diagnostic imaging professionals to substitute another test for a referred one if, with their specialist knowledge, they believe that the substituted service is more appropriate for that particular case. This prevents delays and wasted services and money as well as being much more convenient for the patient. On the other hand, to prevent overservicing the amendment also limits such a professional from ordering any additional procedure for a patient if such a procedure, for instance an MRI, would normally require a specialist only referral. The third element of schedule 3 prohibits the stationing of equipment or employees in the premises of the referring practitioner but, to protect patients, it does allow an avenue for remote area exemptions. The review recommended this amendment to overcome the inconsistency in existing legislation.
The fourth and last amendment is simply aimed at fixing an unintended anomaly created when some state law changes meant that chiropractors and osteopaths were no longer registered under the one state act—a separate register was created for osteopaths. The inadvertent result was that osteopaths were then unable to access the referring arrangements for diagnostic imaging services under Medicare. This amendment simply rectifies that unintended result of a state law change.
The Howard government are committed to protecting the health of our community but, being a responsible government, we aim to get the best value for taxpayers' dollars. That means giving government departments and bodies the tools with which to provide good administration. This legislation provides such a tool. We should not be saying, for example, `We estimate that there should be about 750 diagnostic imaging centres in Australia, but we really do not know where they are and we do not know how many are outside capital cities.' Currently, that is all we can say. The government have worked with the appropriate medical bodies to provide a mechanism to collect relevant, accurate data in the diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology fields. The data collected is simply the site, its ownership and its equipment. It has two important benefits: firstly, it will provide a basis for decision making in those fields; and, secondly, it will protect our Medicare system from waste and abuse. The recovery of $11 million per annum from waste and overservicing is a boost to Medicare. By protecting it from such abuse, we are protecting its ability to look after Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002. As previous speakers have said, this bill seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in three principal respects: firstly, to require the registration of premises that offer diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services before Medicare benefits are payable for such services; secondly, to make changes in patient referral procedures in relation to diagnostic imaging services; and, thirdly, to allow osteopaths to refer patients for diagnostic imaging services. During my contribution, I intend to speak to the question of diagnostic imaging services—most particularly, magnetic resonance imaging services—and then to deal with the question of the spread to osteopaths of the ability to refer patients for these services.
We know that diagnostic imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging, is a growing technology in health care in Australia. That seems logical, given that it is a breakthrough technology that enables the early diagnosis of a number of diseases, most particularly cancers. Diagnostic imaging accounts for approximately 15.5 per cent of Medicare benefits paid in 2001-02. The fact that this is a growth area is further verified by the statistic that the number of health professionals entering medical imaging as an occupation rose by 27.6 per cent between 1996-97 and 2000-01. We have a breakthrough technology that can make a real difference for people by the early detection of chronic illnesses, most particularly cancers. As the take-up of the technology grows, then obviously the work force involved grows exponentially.
You would think that, with the introduction of a new technology, the government would take some steps to ensure equitable provision. Australia, as we know, is a big place. Whilst people tend to live in major cities, obviously we have substantial communities in rural and regional Australia. We also have substantial growing communities on the outer suburban fringes of our major cities, including my electorate of Lalor. Therefore, you would think that the government would take some steps to ensure that the introduction of this new technology is planned, that there is an equitable spread of services and that people, insofar as possible, are able to access services locally. You would not then get a situation where some of the more affluent suburbs end up disproportionately serviced by this new technology, whilst lower income suburbs, growth communities on the fringes of our cities and rural and regional Australia end up with not enough access to this technology.
Of course, we know from this bill that the provision of the new services has been largely unplanned. Indeed, it has been so unplanned that we need this bill to go through the parliament—and Labor do support this bill—so that we know where these services are being provided. Despite the growth in this technology, despite the fact that it is putting an increasing amount of bite on the medical budget in Australia, we do not know what is going on out there. We need something as basic as a registration system to ensure that we do know. Currently, without that data, there is no ability to examine and ensure that services are being provided equitably in a geographic distribution. There is no ability to target education and information campaigns. Obviously, the capacity to track the provision of services to deal with issues like overservicing and fraud is not sufficiently honed. This bill will create a registration system which will enable us to have that kind of basic information.
It seems odd that we should find ourselves in this position where we have new technology and its use is growing but we do not have even a registration system to tell us what is going on. If we cast our minds back, I think we can recall how we got here. We got here by a series of steps starting with the former minister for health's noted scan scam, as members of this parliament who served in the last term would remember and as many members of the Australian public would remember also. What was the scan scam? It was a system engaged in by the former minister for health, on the eve of a budget arrangement that was going to create a cut-off date for the purchase of Medicare rebateable machines capable of doing this magnetic resonance imaging work. If you purchased your machine before the cut-off date then you were right—when you put that machine into service, you would get a Medicare rebate. If you purchased the machine after the date then you were not going to necessarily qualify for a rebate. Of course, as history records, there was an enormous number of purchases in the few days before that cut-off, leading to many questions in this place, an Auditor-General's report and then a report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit further inquiring into the Auditor-General's report. It seems to me that, had the former minister for health not retired at the last election, we still would be hearing the words `scan scam' routinely uttered in this place. 
In serving as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in the last parliament, when we inquired into the Auditor-General's report on the scan scam, I know that one of the principal ongoing problems the scan scam left in Australian politics—apart from the fundamental probity questions going to the nature of arrangements in Australian politics, particularly the nature of trust that people can place in ministers of the Crown—was that we had who knows what kind of geographic or equitable spread of MRI technology. There was this unseemly rush to purchase machines for which practitioners were eligible for a Medicare rebate. You could pop them wherever you chose to pop them, where you could make the most money out of them; yet there was no system of planning, no system for the equitable distribution of these machines. It seems to me that the government is still playing catch-up with this bill to try and get back to where it should have been had the scan scam not happened and had it taken the necessary steps to introduce this technology in a way which would have included equitable provision across communities.
You might wonder, apart from my former service on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, why I am particularly interested in this matter. I am particularly interested in this matter as a local member of parliament serving in the western suburbs of Melbourne. As of tonight, it still continues to be true that the western suburbs of Melbourne do not have access to this MRI technology. It is very important breakthrough technology for dealing with the detection of cancers and other severe illnesses and we do not have that technology available locally. This is a matter that the local members in Melbourne's west have been complaining about in this place for a number of years now. We were routinely raising it in 2000, and I continue to press it now.
What does this mean? It means that people who live in my community, people who live in the middle to outer suburbs of Melbourne, cannot access one of these scans locally. It means they need to travel to town to access one of these scans. Obviously, that has an inconvenience factor about it, particularly if you do not drive. It means that there is an additional burden on the machines in town and it means long waiting lists. People can wait several weeks to get an appointment to have one of these scans done. The introduction of this technology was unplanned and the provision was unplanned. There was no equity in how this technology was originally rolled out in the Australian community and there were probity issues relating to the scan scam. Here we are, all these years later, and there is still an issue about the equitable distribution of these machines. Most particularly, there is an issue of access for the people in my community, the electorate of Lalor.
I note that the government did respond to the fact that there was no equitable provision of MRI technology across Australia, particularly as it left rural and regional areas with a problem. The government sought to rectify that in the 2002-03 budget by allocating $72.7 million to the development of new facilities—that is, new radiation oncology facilities in rural and regional areas. I think the extra provision to ensure access to new technologies in rural and regional Australia is a good thing, but as a representative of an electorate in the outer suburban areas of a major capital city—in this case Melbourne—I am concerned to see health measures targeted at rural and regional Australia when, if you actually diagnose need for access, if you do not just say, `Let's define need as rural and regional and look at that,' but look across the Australian map at areas of need, outer suburban areas frequently come up as areas of need but often do not qualify for assistance under the various programs that are targeted at rural and regional areas.
Government initiatives to deal with doctor shortages were originally targeted at rural and regional areas, notwithstanding the fact that communities like my own had doctor-patient ratios far worse than those of some rural and regional areas. The government in the last budget said they would look at areas of need and allocated $80 million to do that. That $80 million has produced, at last count, two or three doctors across Australia. It has been a failure. As recently as this weekend, we have seen a new government program with an additional $20,000 or $30,000 to help doctors to go to areas of need. I note that my community has been targeted as an area of need. Given that the grand announcement in the last budget of $80 million to get doctors to outer urban communities largely came to naught, I approach the most recently announced measure with some scepticism. I trust I will be proved wrong.
The need for doctors in my community is critical. Doctors have their patient lists closed. If you move into the community, you cannot get onto a doctor's list. Obviously, if you cannot get to the doctor, there is an access problem and, if you cannot get access to the diagnostic technologies we are talking about, that problem is compounded. We need to look at the health needs of outer urban communities like my own. One of those health needs is access to an MRI scanner in the local area. That still has not been resolved. I have no doubt that, when this registration system is in place, when the government can finally forensically tell us all where these machines are and what they are doing and when they can examine what is happening with the provision of this technology for equity, they will find that outer urban communities like my own are still doing it tough and need some additional assistance.
I move to the section of the bill that deals with osteopaths being able to refer patients for diagnostic imaging services. As I have indicated, Labor is broadly in support of this bill. This section has direct support from me. In a former life, I served as the Chairperson of the Chiropractors and Osteopaths Registration Board of Victoria. It was the professional board that registered and dealt with discipline matters for chiropractors and osteopaths. It was my obligation as the legal member of the board to chair its meetings and, most particularly, to convene its disciplinary hearings, which were obviously matters where people had complained about treatment they had received from chiropractors or osteopaths.
Within the community covered by that registration board—that is, chiropractors and osteopaths—the number of chiropractors was obviously far bigger, and there was an ongoing debate within the registration board and the various professional associations about whether or not osteopaths ought to be separately registered. I think those tensions between the professions have been replicated across Australia as that debate was pursued not just in Victoria but across Australia. The debate has been resolved in a number of states by separate registration, and the consequence of separate registration can be a need for the sort of legislative amendment we see here—to make clear that osteopaths, as opposed to chiropractors, also have the ability to refer for services. I think it is important that osteopaths, like chiropractors, have that ability and I wholeheartedly support that section of the bill, having had a great familiarity with these debates when I was serving as Chairperson of the Chiropractors and Osteopaths Registration Board. In summary, Labor do support this bill but, on behalf of my community, I take this opportunity to say that we would support it a lot more wholeheartedly if we were accessing locally some of the technology with which the bill deals.",REPS,"<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING, RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—I would like to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Bill 2002. This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services by amending the Health Insurance Act to, firstly, require registration of premises that offer diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services before Medicare benefits are payable for such services; secondly, make changes in patient referral procedures in relation to diagnostic imaging services; and, thirdly, allow all osteopaths to refer patients for diagnostic imaging services.
I believe that the reason for the registration of premises is that, despite the high costs associated with the provision of diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services, little is known about the nature of the practices that provide these services. I understand that some information about service delivery is currently collected through Medicare provider numbers and patient identifiers. This provides insight into the size of the work force and the number of patient services. However, information about the practices and equipment used to deliver diagnostic imaging services is not collected. This lack of data about premises and mobile facilities that provide diagnostic imaging services has in the past compromised the capacity of the Commonwealth, the medical profession and health researchers to examine and ensure equity of access to such services—for example, by examining the geographic distribution of these services—target education and information campaigns, assess compliance with legislation and regulation and ensure that equipment meets the eligibility requirements for Medicare benefits. More information is collected about radiation oncology services; however, radiation oncology has registration arrangements in order to standardise the information collected across public and private practices and consolidated registration processes.
The corporatisation of general practice medicine, particularly the trend towards vertical integration, has provided added impetus to the need for more information about the premises and facilities that provide diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology services. Vertical integration is a form of corporatisation that refers to the co-location of different practitioners and services, such as GPs, specialists, pathology and diagnostic imaging services. Often a third party not directly involved with the provision of health care owns and receives the profit generated by such services. Diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology are two services where there have been significant movement in ownership from individual practitioners to corporate facilities. 
The impact of corporatisation has become a significant issue within the health care sector. In particular, professional associations and governments have been concerned with the potential for professional and clinically rigorous practice to be compromised in favour of corporate profits. There is Australian and overseas evidence to suggest that the co-ownership and co-location of GP and diagnostic imaging services results in higher rates of ordering of diagnostic tests. It is widely believed that there are a number of corporate practices that have encouraged practitioners to increase their requests for diagnostic imaging services. This is not to suggest that all increases in the rates of ordering of diagnostic tests in these circumstances are clinically unsound; however, such evidence does encourage caution about the level of servicing within practices where there is co-ownership or co-location of GPs with diagnostic imaging services. Diagnostic imaging accounted for approximately 15.5 per cent of Medicare benefits paid in 2001-02. The growth in radiation oncology is partly attributed to the increase in the incidence and detection of cancer in Australia. 
I would particularly like to speak in relation to Western Australia. Sadly, there are significant waiting lists for radiotherapy at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, which is WA's principal cancer treatment centre. This situation has worsened over the past 12 months, despite all efforts by Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital to expand its treatment capacity by significantly increasing the operating hours of its linear accelerators. However, because of the lack of overall linac capacity and increased demand, waiting lists and times continue to grow. Notwithstanding the problems, all clinically urgent cases are accommodated as quickly as possible. Even so, many patients do have to wait. 
I know of a person who has been told she needs treatment. However, the earliest appointment she has been offered is two months away. I have reports that some people are having to wait even longer. In the meantime, I have spoken to other people I know and they advise me that, if someone requires a short treatment of radiotherapy—that is, one short, sharp dose or one week's dose—then the hospitals can usually fit them in. It is the daily, six-week treatment that gets held up. With one person I know, although she has had to wait for several months for the six-week treatment, they are going to give her one special dose—which they call a booster dose—so at least she can have some treatment in the meantime. In this person's case, she will be having chemotherapy as well, but not everyone requires chemotherapy along with radiotherapy. It seems like an effort is being made to give people a booster while they wait in line for their six-week treatment. People do not have chemotherapy or radiotherapy at the same time. If someone requires very urgent treatment, they seem to find them a place. 
This problem is not restricted to this particular hospital; it is an international problem which was recognised and responded to by the Baume review into these matters in 2001. The Commonwealth-initiated national inquiry into radiation oncology chaired by Professor Peter Baume reported to government in June 2002. I am aware of the Commonwealth's 2002-03 budget commitment to improve access to radiation therapy for people living in rural areas. Dr Mark Platell, Executive Director of Medical Services, North Metropolitan Health Service, is WA's representative on the Commonwealth-state regional areas of need for radiotherapy reference group which is advising on the allocation of linacs. The Baume inquiry report showed that WA has a low provision of linacs on a population basis compared to other states and territories. The figures in the report showed that, for WA to come in line with the national average, another two machines would be required. Doctor Platell has told the reference group WA's particular circumstances with regard to the expansion of radiotherapy services. It is the assessment of the WA health department that the most effective and practical way of improving access to radiotherapy services for people living in rural and remote Western Australia would be to increase the number of linacs at the radiation oncology centre at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.
Western Australia has a well-funded patient assistant travel scheme, PATS—a scheme that has been improved dramatically by the Gallop government—which offsets the costs incurred by people living in rural and remote areas of Western Australia who need to go to Perth and major regional centres for medical treatment. The Western Australian government also plans to increase the provision of patient hostel accommodation in Perth, particularly to assist country people who need to stay in Perth for a course of radiotherapy treatment. It is expected that this initiative will complement increased radiotherapy capacity at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. There are three linear accelerators at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. One of these machines needs upgrading, and at least one additional machine is needed immediately. There has been $73 million made available for the commissioning of the new linear accelerators across Australia which are to be placed mostly in regional centres.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-03-24,"—Tonight I want to raise some issues regarding Australia's treatment of refugees. It is timely I do so because tonight I attended the Alan Missen memorial lecture. Mr Speaker, you will recall that Alan Missen was a distinguished parliamentarian, a member of your own party, at a perhaps more gentle time in Australia's affairs, when there were large numbers of members of this parliament who stood very firmly for human rights and operated in a framework with less regard for the rigidities of party discipline that appear to now constrain some on the other side.
The speaker tonight was Mr Colin McPhedran, the child of a British father and a Burmese mother. He suffered terribly when the Japanese invaded Burma. At the age of 12 he was separated from his mother and made his way, ultimately, to Australia, where he found refuge and protection. He tells a story that would bring tears to your eyes, about the last words that his mother said to him. When he asked, `How will I find you again? What can I do if I don't?' he was told, `You will find good people to look after you.' Sadly for him, he never found his mother again, but he did find good people who looked after him. Those good people he found in Australia, where he has made his home. But, more recently, what of the people who have fled places like Iraq and Iran from tyrannical regimes, who have suffered seeing their parents wrenched from them? Some children have reached these shores alone and some have reached these shores with their parents. Did they find good people waiting for them? No; they found Minister Ruddock, John Howard's Pacific solution and the kind of bitterness of spirit represented by Marian Wilkinson's and David Marr's classic book Dark Victory.
The other night I attended a speech given by Julian Burnside QC. It was, again, a heart-wrenching experience. There were some instances of simple bloody-mindedness. For example, in one instance a refugee had claimed that he had been informed on by a member of the detention centre who had accepted voluntary repatriation but who had been essentially a spy for the regime in Iraq. His story was not accepted, and the tribunal found that such a person did not exist. But no inquiry was made of departmental files. When the matter got to court for review, the department resisted producing those files. On three different occasions, using three different devices, it sought and successfully refused to produce those materials. Ultimately, they were produced, and they showed that the person he said had informed on him had in fact departed voluntarily, was back in Iraq and was cooperating with the authorities.
Why would a department with any humanity take such a course? We have a system now where the RRT can make decisions that no reasonable person could make, and yet that is not a ground for review. There are still 113 Iraqi nationals trapped like animals in a contrived hell in Nauru, for an expenditure of $226,000 each week, as a result of these practices. We are now sending soldiers into Iraq to destroy the regime that those same people fled from. We still have children locked up. We still have higher than normal rates of mental illness not only amongst the detainees—and suicides of children and adults—but also amongst the ACM guards who are placed in that intolerable position that we have created in those hells. I cannot do more than simply draw attention to the need for us to get back to the spirit that Alan Missen represented.

The capability of the system to produce high calibre greenhouse emissions estimates for other types of vegetation systems (for example non-forest remnant native vegetation) is under development.
